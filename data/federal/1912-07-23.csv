PERSONAL EXPLANATION.",14
1,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I have received the following letter from the Auditor-General, dated 19th inst.:I have the honour to point out that my figures with respect to the Gold Reserve on 14th November last have again been incorrectly printed. Tn my letter to yourself of the 13th inst., it was clearly shown that the surplus over statutory requirement was ^43<o64. In - Hansard, page 791, this appears as ^49,064. This error may again submit me to a charge of wrongly presenting the position of the account, and making an erroneous calculation. I have been informed that the correction has been made in the second edition of Hansard; but I think that, in fairness to the Auditor-Qeneral, this explanation should be given. DEFENCE. COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN MILLS CADETS' FINES.",14

3,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"I cannot say when the report was received, but I am' willing to lay it on the table for the perusal of the' honourable member.",14
4,Mr FULLER,Unknown,Has the Government decided to erect woollen mills at Geelong?,14
5,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,That has been decided on.,14
6,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"Will the Minister cause to be laid on the table Mr Smail's report, and any correspondence that may PAPERS. have passed between the Defence Department and local governing bodies?",14
7,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"Mr Smail's report will be laid on the table, and I have no doubt that the Minister of Defence will be prepared tp submit for the perusal of any honourable member any correspondence that may have passed between the Department and local councils in regard to this matter.",14
8,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Minister representing the Minister of Defence Assess- whether it is not a fact that the declared policy of the Government as directed by the Caucus is to establish as many industries as possible within Federal territory, and why the Commonwealth Woollen Mills are to be established in opposition to that policy outside the Federal territory?",14
9,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"If the honourable member will submit his question in proper form, omitting from it the intended insolence sought to be conveyed by the use of the words ""as directed by the Caucus,"" I may reply to it.",14
10,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I wish to ask the Minister representing the Minister of Defence whether, in view of the fact that the Government have decided to establish the Commonwealth Woollen Mills at Geelong, he still proposes to make the inquiries he promised to make, last week, as to the suitability of other sites for this factory.",14
11,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"The honourable member is in error in asserting that I promised last week that further inquiries would be made. The only statement. I made was tttat the manager, Mr Smail, had completed his inquiries, and was then preparing his report.",14
12,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I wish to ask the Prime Minister whether he will inform the House whether he regards it as a matter of insolence to suggest that his party does, in its broad outlines, determine the policy of his Government.",15
13,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"So far as questions of manners and good taste are concerned, I cannot suggest to the honourable member anything of which he is not himself aware.",15
14,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"Is the Minister representing the Minister of Defence aware that on Friday last a letter was written to me stating, in connection with an application made by local authorities for the inspection of a certain site by Mr Smail, that further consideration would be given by the Government to the claims of that site.",15

16,Mr RILEY,Unknown,I wish to know from the Minister representing the Minister of Defence whether the latter will recommend to the Attorney-General the advisability of remitting the fines imposed on boys recently in Sydney for not putting in the full number of hours of drill ?,15
17,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,Why only in Sydney?,15
18,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"We l l , everywhere.",15
19,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"I understand that the Minister of Defence has already made certain recommendations respecting the reduction of the fines. There is before the Senate a Bill for the amendment of the Act in relation to this matter. POSTMASTER-GENERAL'S DEPARTMENT. ALLOWANCE OFFICES-OVERTIME , SYDNEY.",15
20,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,Has the Postmaster-General yet come to an opinion regarding the need for increasing the remuneration paid to officers in allowance offices ? a,15
21,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"A committee of the inspectors of the States met in Melbourne some few weeks ago, and the decision has heen arrived at to increase the remuneration paid to postmasters and postmistresses in allowance offices. The Treasurer, when delivering his Budget, will make known the details of what is proposed. . Mr. JOSEPH COOK - Is the Postmaster-General aware that in the Accounts Branch of the Sydney General Post Office men have been working back for some weeks past until 10 o'clock each night, and have been informed that these inordinately long hours must continue for another fortnight ?",15
22,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I am not aware that the facts are as stated, although I know that the work of that branch was in a very bad condition, and it has been found that, in the interests of the Department, extra hours must be worked to bring the accounts up to date. Every consideration will be given to those asked to work overtime by giving either time off or compensation. ELECTOR AL DISTRIBUTIONS : MAPS.",15
23,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,When does the Minister of Home Affairs think that he will receive the report of the Commissioners appointed to redistribute the electoral divisions of New South Wales? Mr KING O'MALLEY - Almos t any day now.,15
24,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Minister of Home Affairs whether, in placing before the House the reports of the Commissioners in regard to the redistribution of Federal electorates in Victoria and other States, he did or"" did not lay on the table any maps relating to them. If he did, will he say where they are?",15
25,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,I ask my honourable friend to give notice of his question.,15
26,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"As the consideration of the redistribution schemes is set down for today, it is impossible for me to give notice of my question for tomorrow.",15
27,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,"I can only, say that the maps were all sent from the Department to the House to be laid on the table on the very day on which notice of motion was given. I think that they were placed on the table, but, for the moment, I cannot say positively whether they were or were not. COMMONWEALTH SAVINGS BANK . Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Is this one of the regulations for the Commonwealth Savings Bank as approved by the Governor General in Council?The officers of the Savings Bank shall diligently endeavour to prevent fraud, and to identify every depositor transacting business with the Savings Bank; but in case any person presenting a depositor's pass-book, and producing a withdrawal form purporting to bear the signature of the depositor, or st..ting himself to be the depositor named therein, shall unlawfully obtain any deposit or sum of money from the Savings Bank during the hours of business, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia shall not.be responsible for the loss so sustained by such depositor, nor be liable to make good the same. Is not that regulation in defiance of the will of Parliament, as expressed in the refusal of both Houses to agree to a provision in the Banking Bill which would have had the same effect""?",15
28,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"My answer to the first question is ""Yes,"" and to the second "" No."" Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Was not the following clause in the original Bill:Where a person fraudulently represents",16
29,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable member knows very well that the clause was in the Bill. He is reading it from the Bill. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Then I shall frame my question in this way : Is the Prime Minister aware that there was in the Bill a clause providing that the Commonwealth should not be responsible for the fraudulent withdrawal of depositors' money, and, if so, how does he reconcile the answer just given with the fact that when he invited this House to reject the Senate's amendment omitting that clause we refused to do so, the clause being consequently omitted ?",16
30,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I think that the honourable member is not quite correct .in his statement of what occurred. The question was never tested. For the sake of convenience, I asked the House, as the provision was not material, to agree to the Senate's amendment omitting the clause.",16
31,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"Is the Prime Minister aware that the Commissioners of the Savings Bank of New South Wales have intimated that they will raise the rate of deposits to 3^ per cent., and is it the intention of the Commonwealth Savings Bank to enter into competition by raising its rate from 3 to 3^ per cent.?",16
32,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I have seen the statement in the press that the Commissioners of the Savings Bank of New South Wales propose to make their rate of interest 3J per cent, for amounts not exceeding £300, and, I think, 3 per cent, for any excess. I rely on the ability of the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank to hold his own in competition at his ordinary rates.",16
33,Mr GORDON,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Postmaster-General whether it is the intention of his Department to debit the Commonwealth Bank for the use of postal buildings in connection with that institution, and, if so, at what rate?",16
34,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"The matter is now engaging the attention of the Government. As soon as a decision has been arrived at it will be made known to the House. - Mr Bruce SMITH - I desire to ask the Treasurer a question in regard to a statement appearing in today's newspapers to the effect that nearly 300 branches of the Commonwealth Savings Bank have been established. I wish to know whether he would object to a request for a statement showing the cost of the staffs of these 300 offices, so that the public may know what it is costing the people of Australia to thus duplicate the Savings Banks of the States.",16
35,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I shall communicate with the Governor of the Bank-wh o is perfectly independent with regard to the work to be done and as to how it shall be carried out-and endeavour to obtain information which will show, I think, that the expendi-' ture is not excessive, and that we are not responsible for any duplication whatever.",16
36,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"Would the Postmaster General be good enough to state what allowance, if any, is being made to postmasters for their additional work in connection with the Commonwealth Savings Bank.",16
37,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"As I have already stated to another honourable member, the relation of the Postal Department to the Commonwealdi Savings Bank is engaging the attention of the Government, and as soon as a decision has been arrived at, the information will be given to the House. PUBLIC SERVICE EXAMINATIONS.",16
38,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Prime Minister a question relating to the examination of telephone attendants which is to take place next Saturday in the Wilson Hall. The building is so large that the 0 examiners have to use a megaphone in order to make themselves heard, and I desire to ask that care shall be taken to give candidates an opportunity to hear the examiners, so that the pronunciation of the words used can be properly heard and the necessary punctuation determined by them.",16
39,Mr FISHER,Unknown,I shall certainly take care to bring the matter under the attention of the responsible officers. It is most essential that the examining officers should be heard distinctly by those submitting themselves for examination.,16
40,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,On the last occasion the examiners could not be heard. LIGHTHOUSES: SOUTH AUSTRALIAN COAST.,16
41,Mr ARCHIBALD,Unknown,"Has the Minister of Trade and Customs yet received from Commander Brewis, the lighthouse expert, a report in regard to the lighting of the South Australian coast?",17
42,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The report is not yet to hand. ADJOURNMENT. PORT AUGUSTA TO KALGOORLIE RAILWAY : APPOINTMENT OF MR. CHINN. - Mr FOWLER (Perth) [3.19] - Mr . Speaker, in accordance with the notice I have given you, I desire to move That the House do now adjourn.",17
43,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I have received from the honourable member for Perth the following letterDEAR MK . SPEAKER, I desire to intimate that tomorrow I propose move the adjournment of the House to call atrailway, tention to a definite matter of urgent public importance, namely, "" The appointment of Mr. H . Chinn in connection with the construction of the trans-Australian railway."" Is the motion seconded? Five Aonorable members having risen their places, Question proposed.",17
44,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"Perth) [3.20] - I make no apology for the form in which introduced this matter to the House. The importance of the undertaking of constructing the trans-Australian railway is patent to every honourable member, as is also the importance of securing for that work ability of the very highest character. I am bringing forward this question at the earliest moment, because it was not until a previous debate had come to an. end that it was possible to refer to the papers. I think I shall be able to show from those papers the existence of a most astounding state of affairs. Let me refer, first of all, to the application made by Mr Chinn to the Minister of Home Affairs, and dated from Perth, 20th June, 1911The Hon, King O'Malley, M.H.R., Minister of State for Home Affairs, SIR, The knowledge that the Commonwealth Government intend making early preparation for the commencement of t i e construction of the Kalgoorlie-Port Augusta, transcontinental railway induces me to place before you my application for the position of Constructing Engineer or Manager in connection with this project. For upwards of twenty-five years I have been engaged as contractor's engineer on the construction of railways in almost all the different States of the Commonwealth; and consequently have gained, by practical experience, the versatility demanded of an engineer, where saving in cost of construction and the making of profits are the chief consideration of a railway contractor. My wide knowledge of the State of Western Australia, and its timber forests, and railways, would, I venture to think, be of great service from a business point of view, particularly where the supply of sleepers for this line is concerned, an item in itself that can be made the means of saving a huge sum of money to the Government, if managed by one as conversant with the detail of this industry as myself. Indeed, I might venture to suggest that steps should be taken in this direction without delay, for it has alread}' been hinted that private enterprise is about to make a move towards obtaining a concession over vast areas of timber, reported upon by me some five years ago, and which would be of inestimable value to the Commonwealth Government if secured by them. It might not be out of place here to make re22nd July, 1912. ference to the negotiations that have been recently conducted between your Government and myself to regarding rail weiding operations on the above with the hope that full consideration will be given to my invention before anything definite is done by way of ordering supplies of rails and fastenings. The accompanying testimonials, it will be observed, are some of those sent by me in support of my recent application for the position of in Railway Commissioner in Tasmania, when, out of thirty-eight applications received from all parts, I was, I am informed, second to the successful applicant. Trusting you will give my application y»ur I have most favourable consideration, I have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient servant, HENRV CHINN . That letter calls for one or two observations. There is a reference by Mr Chinn to his experience of twenty-five years as a contractor's engineer in the construction of railways in almost all the different States of the Commonwealth. Although this gentleman has so remarkable a record in connection with railway construction, in almost all parts of the Commonwealth, according to his own statement, not a single indication of it appears in the whole of this file of papers. There is not a single proof that he was ever engaged in any of the work which, he indicates in so general a fashion. Melbourne.",17
45,Mr GROOM,Unknown,Does he produce any certificates ?,17
46,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"No . Mr Chinn goes on to speak of his wide knowledge of the State of Western Australia, but it can only be a, knowledge derived from not more than seven or eight years' experience at the very most. Again, I wish to know where he has indicated the nature of the knowledge he boasts of in this general fashion. He speaks of a report on the timber areas of Western Australia. We all know that there are large and valuable timber areas in that State. Although I have made a considerable number of inquiries during the time at my disposal, I have found no evidence that such a report as Mr Chinn claims to have made is in existence.",17
47,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Where is it?,18
48,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"It is for the Government to produce it. The reference to this report is a rather important feature of Mr Chinn's application, and I call upon the Government to say something about this remarkable report, which the author of it appears to regard as of very considerable value. He speaks also of a railwelding invention, which he refers to as ""my invention."" Here, again, I find nothing more in all these papers than this very passing reference to such an invention. I inquired also into this matter, and I found that Mr Chinn certainly made an application some few years agn for a patent in connection with the welding of rails or metals generally, but that that application was withdrawn. I found further that in the Equity Court in Sydney on 20th October, 1910, Mr Justice Street found that this alleged invention of Mr Henry Chinn was an infringement of an existing patent. So that his claim in connection with an invention that he says would be of very considerable use and advantage in connection with the construction of the transcontinental railway is shown to have no foundation beyond what may be in his own imagination. 1 do not wish for a moment to say that this gentleman has no testimonials at all. He has undoubtedly a considerable number of testimonials of a kind, and I intend to place them on record. There is a sort of appendix to his application, containing a number of testimonials sent to him by several leading citizens of Western Ausgineer-in-charge tralia. They are of a general character, and most of the writers of them speak, I think, from hearsay. I have made inquiries from several of those who signed these testimonials, and they have explained tions. that they were given to Mr Chinn in connection with an application he made for employment on the Tasmanian railways. Mr KING O'MALLEY - As Commissioner of Railways in Tasmania.",18
49,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"Yes , as Commissioner of Railways. He always aims pretty high apparently. These testimonials have been put in in support of Mr Chinn's application for employment on the transcontinental railway without consultation with, and without the consent of, those who wrote them for another application altogether. I take it that in the circumstances they will be regarded as entirely out of court, and consequently I do not intend to deal with them further. I admit that they are entirely harmless, but I wish to deal with other testimonials that are not harmless, but are highly objectionable, and should be placed upon record in connection with the history of the present Government. I shall take them in the order in which they appear on the file. The first is from the Attorney-General's Office, Perth, and is dated 6th November, 1911. It is addressed to Senator Pearce in these terms is applying for position of Engineer in some capacity connected with the trans-Australian railway. I am not capable of judging of Mr. Chinn's professional qualifications, but these you will be able to obtain from outside sources. All I desire is that, if Mr Chinn's qualifications in all other respects are satisfactory, then his services to our party in the recent elections should not be forgotten. Wilh kind regards, Yours fraternally, THOS. WALKER. The next is a letter from Perth, dated 7th  Collier, who, I presume, is the Minister of this name in the present Labour Government of Western Australia. He writesDear George",18
50,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Who is "" Dear George "" ?",18
51,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"Thes e letters were apparently sent to Senator Pearce, the Minister of Defence, and by him sent on to the Minister of Home AffairsMr H . Chinn, whom you met over here some time ago, is applying for the position of Enof construction on the transcontinental railway. Mr Chinn, I believe, is a very capable man. and has had charge of some large public works in different parts of Australia. He is, too, a member of our party, and rendered valuable assistance during the recent elecI hope you will remember him when the appointment is being made. Yours faithfully, P. COLLIER. Senator Pearce sent these two extraordinary letters to the Minister of Home Affairs in the following wayMelbourne, 6th December, 1911. Dear Mr O'Malley,- I am forwarding for your consideration a further letter that I have received in connection with the application of Mr Chinn for a position as constructing engineer on the trans-Australian railway line. There is another letter from Mr Collier to the Postmaster-General to the same purport as the one I have just read, and the Postmaster-General also sent it on to the Minister of Home Affairs.",18
52,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,Rea d it.,19
53,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"T i m e is valuable, and as it is to exactly the same purport as the previous letter it is not necessary to read it. I have another, dated from the Trades H all , Beaufort-street, Perth, 16th November, 1911, as follows : The Honourable the Minister of Home Affairs, Sir,- I believe you have an application from Mr H . Chinn, C.E., of Perth, for the position of engineer on the' trans-Australian railway. I am desired by a number of gentlemen holding responsible positions in the Labour movement in this State to write you and say that they have known Mr Chinn for a number of years, and that his competency and reliability is beyond question. His papers will demonstrate his previous record. I may also mention that Mr. Chinn materially assisted the party in the recent election. Fraternally yours, I come now to a letter sent by Mr J. Scaddan, now Premier of Western Australia, and dated from the Premier's Office, Perth, 7th November, 1911Sir,- I understand that Mr H . E. Chinn, C.E., is making application for a post in connection with the trans-Australian railway, I believe as constructing engineer for the Commonwealth Government. I have no hesitation in recommending Mr Chinn for such a post. he is a draughtsman as well as a railway engineer, and was for a considerable period attached to Mr Teesdale Smith in connection with the construction of railways in this State. therefore commend him to your good offices, in the event of the Federal Government deciding to appoint a constructing engineer. I have the honour to be, Sir, Hon. C. E. Frazer, M.H.R., Postmaster-General, Melbourne. The statement about Mr Chinn being connected with Mr Teesdale Smith in the construction of railways in Western Australia is not correct. That letter was also forwarded by the Postmaster-General to the Minister of Home Affairs.",19
54,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,He did not say it was in Western Australia. Mr Chinn was connected with Mr Smith in South Australia.,19
55,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"The letter says "" in this State."" There is another letter sent Yours faithfully, by Mr Scaddan to the Minister of DeG. F. PEARCE. fence to the same purport as the one I have just read, and this also was sent on to the Minister of Home Affairs. These are sufficiently surjDrising, but there are some further developments which are equally interesting.",19
56,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,But you have not got much up to now I,19
57,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"We find that the various civil servants' associations throughout Australia madea protest against this appointment having been made without a vacancy being advertised in the ordinary way. The following announcement was made in the West Australian of 24th FebMelbourne. ruary, 1912 : It is understood that Mr H . Chinn bas been appointed to carry out the duties of supervising engineer for the Western Australian section of the trans-Australian railway. Up to that date there had been no advertisement that these positions were open. On the day following the notice in the West Australian, an article appeared in the Sunday Times - a very outspoken, popular, and widely-circulated ALEX. MCCALLUM, Secretary. newspaper in Western Australia-to this effectCHINN MUSIC. More Spoils for the Victors. The announcement that Mr Chinn, whose most eminent achievement to date is the inditing of long blatant screeds to Hackett's organ, or any other accommodating journal, has been appointed to supervise the construction of the West Australian section of the transcontinental railway, will be received with amazement, not to say I believe disgust, by every person in the country who. has any conception of the work and the man. Personally, we regard the result with fear and' trembling. Such a great work, involving a> I maximum perfection of construction in a minimum of time, demands the brains of a masterf u l engineer, and we do not know that Mr. Chinn is master of anything but an interminableflow of language that does not conceal anyYour obedient servant, thought. J. SCADDAN, Premier. Usually too much "" chin"" music disqualifies any man for an important post, but this Chinn seems to have made music that has caught the ear of King O'Malley or some other person of authority near the Labour throne. We understand that the Premier of Western Australia and his colleague, the Minister for Railways, were guilty of the indiscretion of recommending; Chinn to the Commonwealth Cabinet, who personally 'cannot know very much about the flatulent ink-waster. It has been suggested that the local Ministers did so in order to get rid of an importunate pest. If that is the case, they did a very bad turn to the Commonwealth, unci should warn Prime Minister Fisher of the enormous responsibility he has incurred in permitting this astounding appointment. What has Chinn ever done to justify his selection for such an important position ? know. He tried to get the construction of the Hopetoun-Ravensthorpe railway stopped while the work was in progress. He got an appointment with Messrs. Smith and Timms, the well-known railway contractors, and shortly wards the partners had such an acute quarrel over him that they separated, but came together again, and Chinn had to resume his former occupation of writing to the papers."" He wrote numerous !< letters to the defunct Morning Herald-letter s that were ""agin the Government""-and , maybe, this is why the State Labour Premier foisted Chinn on to the Federal Labour Government, and why the latter were induced to select him. But it is not fair to the transcontinental way u it is not fair to common sense; and it is not fair to the many able engineers who never had an opportunity to apply. That is one of the peculiar features of this fishy business-n o applications were called. The matter was fixed up in the dark, and nothing was known about it until Chinn's senseless and objectionable appointment leaked out like a surreptitious fact that the principals were ashamed of. The whole thing can only be regarded as a job, a sop for a yapping Cerberus, the reward of a political helot. That appeared before any public intimation was made to the Minister that these positions were open.",19
58,Mr FENTON,Unknown,Who wrote the article?  jenow the name of the writer.,20
59,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I appeal to honourable (members not to interrupt the honourable member for Perth. He has only a limited - time to speak, and if honourable members interject they will deprive him of many - minutes which are valuable to him.",20
60,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"On the 6th February - the Engineer-in-Chief, Mr Deane, wrote a -.memorandum. I intend to read only the - part which is of importance in this conmexion. Mr Deane says The Minister having decided to appoint Mr. H. Chinn as supervising engineer to take charge <i»f the construction of the western end of Kalgoorlie-Port Augusta railway, I recommend ment? - that he be instructed-to do certain work. Here is evidence that the Minister had taken it upon himself appoint Mr Chinn as supervising engineer Chinn. to take charge of the construction of the western end of the line. Mr KING 'O'MALLEY - Rea d the other ji:emorandiun that Mr Deane wrote.",20
61,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"It appears, later, that the Minister had gone rather too far in making this appointment. He had not the power to act in the fashion in which he proposed at first, and accordingly we find the position modified. We find that Mr Chinn is only appointed temporarily, and, instead of being supervising engineer, he is inWc don't structed that he is only to do certain preliminary work, and the Public Service Commissioner is approached, and permission is obtained for Mr Chinn to be placed on the after- temporary list. Of course, he gets ^750 a year, the same as the others. There is no question but that the intention of the Minister was to appoint Mr Chinn to supervise the construction of the line as an engineer, and that as long as it was in process of construction he was to be there in that capacity. Now, strangely enough, an railadvertisement appeared in the Gazette of the 24th February, that is, weeks after the appointment had been made. It reads as follows:Department of Home Affairs, Melbourne, 22nd February, 1912. NA AUGUSTA RAILWA Y. Applications are invited from Engineers (two required), under the Engineer-in-Chief of Commonwealth Railways, in connection with the construction of the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway. Applications, to be addressed to the Secretary, Department of Home Affairs, Melbourne, will be received not later than Monday, the 18th Marcli, 1912. KING O'MALLEY, Minister of State for Home Affairs. That is a most extraordinary state of affairs. Why did the advertisement appear at that late time of the day? Was it not because the Minister had been shown by some one that he had carried things on in an altogether improper fashion, and that the least he could do to save his face was to put in this belated advertisement, when, as a matter of fact, the principal position had already been filled? It may be said that only one Minister is responsible for this particular matter.",20

69,Mr FOWLER,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"I am informed by the University authorities that so far from ing an engineering degree, Mr Chinn has not so much as passed a single examination in any one of the subjects which it is necesto sary for a person to pass in connection with engineering. There is more behind but I do not want to take up too much time. I say emphatically that the statePutting ment that Mr Chinn qualified as a "" civil engineer, Melbourne University, 1883,"" is untrue, and wholly misleading. The record continuesEngaged as engineer and contractor kinds of public works in almost all the States. I dare say Mr Chinn was employed in some capacity on these works; but I want the Minister to say whether this is any dence of engineering skill or capacity the part of this man. If the Minister made the slightest investigation in this : connection he would have found such overto whelming evidence to the contrary as of itself, I feel sure, have prevented the appointment being made. that he had a Big practice for years in Melbourne. That, again, is a figment of the imagination. The man has never had any practice in Melbourne at all. Lastly, there the statement of ability in Western Australia by finding better direct route from Kalgoorlie and site shops, saving 5 miles and over ^20,000. of the The Minister cannot show that Mr. is Chinn has, as alleged, made any improvement or saving at all. I have information from Western Australia that the statement is absolutely incorrect. I also want to know from the Minister whether he made any inquiries in regard to Mr Chinn's general character. In connection with an important of this kind, the character of a man counts for something. I trust, thereit fore, that the Minister will give us very satisfactory proofs that he has made inquiries regarding Mr Chinn's character, I and that the replies are of a thoroughly satisfactory nature in all reI have 110 hesitation whatever in in saying that the man is totally I do not to find from any paper in this file that It says- the Minister and the Government behind have satisfied themselves as to fvis ability, or capacity, or character. They as appointed him soleiy and entirely on the strength of the letter sent to the Minister of Home Affairs by Labour supporters in Western Australia claiming their considerahavtion for the man, because he had done good . service for them at the last election in the State. Surely that of itself was sufficient condemn the whole thing ! Surely that is sufficient to justify me in bringing the this, matter forward in this way ! This is an action which the Government cannot justify. it as mildly as I can, and not going beyond the limits of parliamentary in language, it is an ugly and a discreditable transaction. I charge it, not alone on the Minister, but on the Government, and every member of the party that sits behind the on all Government in this House.",21

A miserable, sulky, paralytic, one-legged, one-eyed muck-worm- a hybrid without pride of ancestry or hope of posterity- a cross between a city guineapig and a country blowfly. I ask my right honourable friend, the Prime Minister, if he will give a bonus to this kid? I do not believe he will. This slandering of Mr Chinn is one of the most shameful things that ever happened in the House. It is most shameful that an honourable member should come down and challenge the Governmentshould malign the character of an innocent man, who cannot come here to defend himself, and, by innuendo and all sorts of suggestion, seek to deprive him of his method and means of making a. living. Two years ago, at the close of the last Parliament, the Opposition had sixty-seven membersforty-six in this House and twenty-one in the Senate.",21

We have been asked to build this railway, and we have to look about and get the best men.

Here is what he saidThe knowledge that you show of the proper system of running railways was most beneficial to the State, and many members of Parliament publicly acknowledged on several occasions that your intimate knowledge of railways systems, and your realization of the necessity of economical management, was the means of saving our State at least ^100,000 a year. I am off to England on Monday, and am sorry I shall not see you for some time. Honourable members opposite know as much about business as does a child.

Mr KING O'MALLEY - At any rate, he says in a letter to Mr ChinnI have known you for many years, and am confident that, should the Tasmanian Government secure your services, they will have a gentleman who possesses the most intimate knowledge of railway management. It is well within my memory, when our Western Australian railway system had drifted into a state of chaos, and was actually a non-paying concern, owing to the system of reform which you so generously gave to this country through your criticism in the public press of this State, and which reforms were adopted by the Government, I have no hesitation in stating that it was the direct means of making our railways a most paying and profitable proposition, and saved the country at least ^100,000 per annum. The people of this State are deeply indebted to you for the amount of detailed information you placed at their disposal, and which was so profitably used. I sincerely trust that, in the interests of the Tasmanian railways, you will be appointed. That is a letter of the Honourable W.

Mr KING O'MALLEY - Mr Moss, in his letter to Mr Chinn, saysI am sure that if you were appointed as Commissioner you, will admirably fulfil the position. I am pleased to record the very valuable services you rendered some time ago in connection with the criticism of Western Australian railway management It was mismanagement inherited from the time of my right honourable friend the honourable member for Swanand the great aid your tabulated and comparative analysis of the figures relating to the working of the various Australian railway systems, were to me during the discussion in the Legislative Council of Western Australia on a motion dealing with the question. That discussion brought about an alteration in the management of the railways of Western Australia which effected enormous savings to the country, and you deserve the principal credit in this matter.

If proof of your knowledge were required, it will be amply shown in the letters which you contributed to the public press of this State some four years ago, when the railway management was severely criticised.

Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Did he get the appointment? Mr KING O'MALLEY - The writer of this recommendation is the chairman of directors of the Western Australian Bank, ex-Mayor of Perth, and one of the most prominent citizens of Western Australia.

This is what he says about Mr ChinnI feel it incumbent on me, as one who took a prominent part in the discussion in Parliament I on the management of our railways, to place on record the very valuable services you rendered to this State by your detailed reports on the working of the system. These reports came at a time when little or no profits were being derived from the railways, and showed most conclusively that with proper management a handsome net return would accrue to the State. Subsequent events have verified in every way your contentions, for the net profits in the. past three years have reached the enormous figure Forrest of ^438,000, whilst the working expenses have been reduced in a similar ratio. There can be no doubt that the vast knowledge displayed by you was the main factor in bringing about the desired alteration in the man-, agement, and I am sure the greatest credit is due to you for the valuable services you rendered to Parliament and the public in ventilating the matter.

92,Sir JOHN FORREST,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"What is the use of opposite. reading all these things? Mr KING O'MALLEY - Because it is as well that honourable members should know what these people think about Mr. Chinn. Mr Randall is an ex-Colonial Secretary, and ex-Speaker of the Legisare lative Assembly. He is a man of ability. This is what he said I was struck with the earnest and effective way in which you put the whole case for a thorough overhaul of the then methods of the Department. Your criticism has, If u l ly believe, in a radical change for the better and more economic working of the system, especially as regards the main lines. I concur in the opinions expressed by the members of the Legislative Council and others on the subject, and as to your ability to effectively administer in a business way railway affairs. I understand you are an applicant for the position of Railway Commissioner in Tasmania, and trust you will be successful in your application, nnd thus be able to demonstrate your ability to the satisfaction of the Government of that State.

93,Mr WEST,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"Is he a Labour man? Mr KING O'MALLEY - No fear! I wish also to quote from a testimonial by Mr S. W. Copley, who wroteI have known him for a number of years, during which time he has earnecl and retained the good-will and respect of the people of this (Sd.) J. W. WRIGHT. State. He is a man of strong personality, and has conclusively proved that he thoroughly understands the business of railway management. Just about the time the Railway Department of this State had got into a most chaotic state, Mr. Chinn undertook the task of showing how bad matters really were, and how they could be put right. His articles in the press, extending over a large period, evidenced his grasp of the detail and intricacies of the business, and met with the success they deserved, for, on his reforms being adopted by the Government, the railways at once became a profit-earnei to a degree hitherto unknown in their history. I shall be pleased to hear of Mr Chinn's success wherever he may elect to reside. Yours faithfully, (Sd.) S - W. COPLEY. Does the honourable member for Perth know whether the writer of that is a Labour man ? Does he consider that the Honourable Charles Sommers, M.L.C., and ex-Minister of Mines, is a Labour man? Do you know, Mr Speaker, I had a little doubt in my mind when I read all these testimonials from members of the party It put a bit of fear into me. I thought, "" Is this man so able as they say he*is?"" I was willing to test him, but I always have some doubt when a man is recommended from the other side, because I know that my honourable friends not business men.

Mr KING O'MALLEY - Because .1 resulted want the House to know how these prominent persons have spoken about Mr. Chinn, and to prove that they would never have had a word to say against his ability if he had not been a Labour man. I say from my own experience that whenever a man departs from the boodleier's class they follow him to Uhe grave, and expectorate on him before the earth is covered over him. There is no hope for a man, unless he be rich, who leaves that side. They would murder him. They are like the Camoora and the Mafia (Sd.) G. RANDALL. associations in their vindictiveness.",24

98,Mr KING OMALLEY,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"My honourable friend is as destitute of all knowledge of argument as a child is of the philosophy of salvation. In the event of his becoming Commissioner, I have no hesitation in saying that the Government will have secured the services of one fitted in every way to manage and work their system to the greatest possible advantage. has been personally known to me for several years, during which time he has been closely associated with railways, and has proved himself to be a man of exceptional ability where economical working of such is of paramount importance. The series of trenchant articles written by Mr Chinn for the leading Western Australian paper, on the disregard of economy and good management of our Railway Department, gained for him the highest encomiums from members of both Houses of Parliament and the general public, and there can be no doubt that the vast improvement now shown in the profits from the railways is greatly due to the adoption of the reforms so strongly and ably advocated by him.

Mr Harriman spent $100,000,000 to shorten a line from Chicago to San Francisco by 40 or 50 miles.

117,Sir JOHN FORREST,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"Swan) [4.15]- I think that we may all congratulate ourselves that the painful exhibition just witnessed is over. The letters which the Minister has read were from very reputable people in Perth, but they all relate to an application for appointment to the position of Commissioner of Railways in Tasmania. It appears that Mr Chinn wrote for the Western Australian press some articles on railway management, and so impressed many prominent persons there that they wrote letters saying that his articles had done an immense amount of good, and expressed the hope that he would get the position for which he was applying. We are all, from time to time, asked to give testimonials, and we comply with these requests, sometimes reluctantly, and at other times with pleasure.  the letters reliable?",26
118,Sir JOHN FORREST,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"They are very reliable gentlemen, but the letters were not written in support of an application for an engineering appointment. Sir Thomas Tait, who was at the head of the Victorian Railways was not an engineer, neither, I believe, is the New South Wales Chief Commissioner.",26
119,Mr HOWE,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"Yes , he is.",26
120,Sir JOHN FORREST,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"Well , he was appointed to manage, not to construct. Mr. Davies, who was imported from England by the Government of Western Australia to manage, and Mr Smith, who went from Western Australia to Tasmania, were not engineers. All these gentlemen were appointed because of their business capacity, and the letters read by the Minister have relation to an application for a managing, not an engineering, position. The writers had no knowledge of Mr Chinn's qualifications as an engineer, not possessing engineering experience themselves. Not one of them would have vouched for Mr. Chinn's qualifications as a railway constructing engineer. It is not very pleasant have to deal with these personal matters, but the charge brought against the Minister and the Government is a grave one, and, in my opinion, well founded. The proposed railway will exceed 1,000 miles ih length, and is the greatest project of the kind yet entered on in Australia. In the expenditure of the immense sum which it will cost, we should have the advice and the assistance of the best ability and experience obtainable. Does any one say that there has been any evidence whatever produced of Mr Chinn's knowledge and capacity which would prove that he was the best man obtainable for the position? Mr KING O'MALLEY - Yes .",26
121,Sir JOHN FORREST,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"If his qualifications prove that he is the best man, my case falls to the ground.",26
122,Mr FOWLER,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,There was not a single testimonial from any of his employers.,26
123,Sir JOHN FORREST,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"In the letters put before us by the Minister there is not one testimonial from persons with whom Mr Chinn has been associated, or for whom he has worked as an engineer.",26
124,Mr WH IRVINE,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,Apparentl y there is no constructive work that he has carried through.,26
125,Sir JOHN FORREST,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"Notwithstand ing that the Minister may be a great man, I say that he is not competent to judge of the fitness of a person applying for a professional position as an engineer to control railway construction, because he does not possess professional qualifications. All over the world when the services of a man of particular fitness are required, recommendations are sought from persons qualified to judge of his professional abilities. Has not Mr Chinn been forced on the country by the Minister of Home Affairs? It is clear that the Minister did not wait for a recommendation from the head of his engineering department. In a minute dealing with the names of five applicants, Mr. Deane wrote that he would certainly recommend Mr Saunders for the Port Augusta end, and added that "" the Minister has already expressed his intention of appointing Mr Henry Chinn at the Kalgoorlie end."" Mr Deane did not say that he recommended Mr Chinn's appointment. It is clear that the appointment was made, not on the recommendation of Mr Deane, but by the Minister himself, off his own bat. It is all very well for the Minister to say, "" I am Minister of Home Affairs, and I am going to do this or that;"" but we to have to remember that this work is to be carried out, not at his expense, but with the money of the people. I have no desire to injure Mr Chinn- I do not know him, and never heard of him before-no r do I desire to injure any one else. But in common with honourable members generally, I have a duty to perform. It is my duty to see that this great railway project is not injured by men like the Minister of Home Affairs, who will make appointments of this character for political or other purposes without being supported by the recommendation of any authority who has knowledge of the subject. In work. placing this great work in the hands of incompetent persons, or any save those who are most capable, the Minister is doing a great wrong, both to the project itconclusion self, and to the people of Australia. am surprised that the Postmaster-General, who, I believe, has an acute mind, and desirous of doing right, should allow the work to be injured in the way that it being injured. He is very much interested, as the representative of Kalgoorlie, in construction of this railway, and surprised that lie should allow its success be jeopardized by the appointment of competent person. The work will not only bers of the Western Australian be delayed very seriously, but will cost great deal more than it would under comrendered petent management.",26
126,Mr FRAZER,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,The right honourable ber has no right to make such a statement in view of the fact that he has proved no incompetency on the part of the person appointed. The only charge against him is that he is a Labour man.,27
127,Sir JOHNFORREST,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"It is very Minister wrong to appoint a man solely because he can."" is a Labour sympathizer. The papers not show that Mr ,Chinn was recommended there. by any engineering authority by whom he had been employed. I am also surprised that the Prime Minister should allow his Government to be compromised, and the work to be prejudiced in this way. Surely there are in Australia men of undoubted repute and standing who should have been appointed to discharge these important duties. Surely it would be better to point such men than to employ people of whom we know nothing, and for whom no one has a good word to say. a year ago, when I expressed the hope this railway would be constructed within three years, the Minister of Home Affairs ployed. said that it would be completed in less time than that. Does he still hold that view ?",27

It must be clear to any one reading the official papers that Mr Deane did not favour Mr Chinn's appointment. I challenge the Minister to deny that statement.

I think it has been inproved that Mr Chinn's appointment was not justified by his career as an engineer; that he has never won his spurs; and that those for whom he has worked have not a good word to say for him. In conclusion, I say deliberately-and I believe it will be proved if the Select Committee, for which I intend to ask tomorrow, is appointed-that Mr Chinn's appointment is a gross piece of favouritism, a flagrant abuse of power for political purposes, and a grave reflection on the Government.",27
137,Mr MAHON,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"Coolgardie) [4-29]-After the two vigorous speeches to which we have just listened, I think it would not be out of place to endeavour to introduce into the scene of our deliberations a slightly calmer atmosphere. The attitude of the honourable member for Perth and the right honourable member for Swan has occasioned me considerable surprise in view of the fact that they repeatedly complained in this House that Western Australians have not been considered as eligible for appointments to Federal positions as are persons from other States. That has been a frequent, and, to some extent, a justifiable complaint on their part. Yet now that a Western Australian has heen appointed to do Federal work in Western Australia, there is an immediate outcry on their part.",28
138,Sir JOHN FORREST,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,Is Mr Chinn a Western Australian? I never heard of his name before.,28
139,Mr MAHON,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"The right honourable ager gentleman knows that he has been residing in Western Australia for many years. Now that a Western Australian has been apsaid pointed to a Federal position-and the posihe tion, by the way, is only a temporary one vices. - thes e honourable members are endeavourto give that statement ing to make political capital out of it .",28
140,Sir JOHN FORREST,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,That is not the reastand son as the honourable member should know.,28
141,Mr MAHON,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"What I do know is kind. that this appointment has been seized upon in a discreditable manner by certain polipoint ticians and certain newspapers. Argus, for instance, was' quite hysterical in its exaggeration, making a mountain out of a molehill. It may be there has been some little irregularity in this case, but I am sure was no greater than has been the case in connection with many appointments that have been made by various other Governfor ments, and concerning which nothing whatthat ever has been said. It has been stated that Mr Chinn has not produced any monials from persons by whom he was employed.",28
142,Sir JOHN FORREST,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,Hea r ! hear.,28
143,Mr MAHON,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"The right honourable gentleman has no right to draw from that circumstance a conclusion unfavorable to Mr Chinn. There may be a perfectly innocent explanation of the fact that he has not sent in such testimonials with his application., and the right honourable member for Swan is not justified in concluding that he has no such testimonials, or that if he has them they do not bear testimony to his good character and qualifications.",28
144,Sir JOHN FORREST,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,Does the honourable member not think that he would produce them if he had them?,28
145,Mr MAHON,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,Has he not produced testimonials from gentlemen of the highest character in Western Australia? Were not some of these testimonials from men who had been colleagues of the right honourable member and members of his Government ?,28
146,Sir JOHN FORREST,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"Onl y one, I think.  father was a colleague of the right honourable gentleman, and I believe that Mr . Loton was one of his particular personal friends.",28
147,Sir JOHN FORREST,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,Does the honourable gentleman think it is worth bothering about that ?,28
148,Mr MAHON,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"We have such truly representative gentlemen saying, not merely that Mr Chinn would make a good manof railways : but, and this is the important point, that he had experience in the construction of railways also. It is that Mr Chinn was appointed because is a Labour man and for political serI happen to be in a position a flat denial. I may here say that I cannot underhow private and confidential letters have found their way on to a file of this The writers of the letters to which I refer wrote only from their own personal of view, and not on behalf of the The Labour party in Western Australia. I am in a position to say that Mr Chinn did not render any material service to the that Labour party at the last elections.",28
149,Sir JOHN FORREST,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,The writers of the that it letters say that he did.,28
150,Mr MAHON,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"I say that he did not, and I was on the spot running a newspaper the Labour party at the time. I know the extent of Mr Chinn's services to the Labour party at the last elections was testithe writing of one article.",28
151,Sir JOHN FORREST,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,The Trades H all people do not say that.,28
152,Mr MAHON,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,The letter from the Trades H all is not an official one. I am able to say further that when the Trades H all authorities were importuned to assist Mr Chinn to secure this appointment they turned the application down. That is a fact which appeared in the public press.,29
153,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,They had some conscience.,29
154,Mr MAHON,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"That was not the reason. Their position was that, as they knew nothing of Mr Chinn's professional qualifications, they did not intend to interfere in the matter at all. I remind honourable members that the letter written by the secretary to the Trades Hall was apparently written in His private capacity. I think that there has been made a great storm about a very trifling matter. I know Mr Chinn, and although he may not have high professional attainments, many men who have not such attainments are very successful in practical life. Mr . Chinn is a man who understands how to deal with men, and the right honourable member for Swan is aware that one of the chief requirements in the construction of a railway is a man who is able to hold his own amongst men, and see that they do what is right. I have no hesitation in saying that I think the appointment of Mr. , Chinn a suitable one, and I conclude with the statement that if I had been in the position of the Minister of Home Affairs, and had before me the testimonials of Mr. Chinn, with my personal knowledge of him, I also should have given him the appointment.",29
155,Mr DEAKIN,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"Ballarat) [4.37] - It appears to me that many honourable members, including the honourable member who has just resumed his seat, are looking at this question from an exactly opposite point of view to that from which we require to regard it. It is not the business of the Opposition, who are not directly connected with this appointment, to prove that Mr. Chinn was not competent. The whole burden of proof to the contrary rests on the Minister of Home Affairs, and those associated with him. They have to prove not only to their own satisfaction, but to the satisfaction of Parliament, that at least this gentleman was in every way qualified for the position which he now holds, even if they do not attempt to show that he was the best person available. has been made in either direction, and not one word has been said in either relation. There has been no discussionof the re[4i] lative efficiency of the applicants. The appointment has been discussed as if it was simply a question whether Mr Chinn could do the work which he has been appointed to do. That is not the real question. This is whether Mr Chinn is the man who can do the work best and most economically. There has been no evidence to show that his credentials and experience have been measured with the credentials and experience of other professional men in Australia who are available.",29
156,Mr FOWLER,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"Othe r men were given no chance to apply for the position, because the appointment was given to Mr Chinn before it was advertised.",29
157,Mr DEAKIN,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"Then that point is proved. I admit that the circumstances of the case, and the procedure, are calculated to raise a great deal of suspicion; but wish to keep to the simple questions of qualification and proof of qualification. I say distinctly that the Minister has not only not proved Mr CHinn's qualifications for this position, but he has not even attempted to prove them. If he. has proved anything, it is .that, on the testimony of certain Legislative Councillors and others in Western Australia, Mr Chinn is a man who wrote some excellent letters to the Western Australian newspapers during a period of criticism of railway management in that State, and that amendments were afterwards made in connection with the management of that Department which led to a saving, generally estimated at ^100,000 a year.",29
158,Mr FOWLER,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,That claim is absolutely absurd. ',29
159,Mr DEAKIN,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"Possibl y ; but granting everything claimed, my argument is sound and convincing. This argument is that even if Mr Chinn be credited with that saving on the Western Australian railways, he has proved nothing except a faculty for detecting mistakes and blunders in existing methods of working, and to make suggestions which resulted in their great improvement. But these are all questions of railway management. They are connected in no way with railway construction. The experience of Australia, as well as of English Railway Boards, has beenI know it has in New South Wales and Victoria-that it is wise to secure as ComNo effort missioners of Railways one member who is an expert in railway construction, and another member who is an expert in railway management-the latter - is quitea dilTerent branch. This is the only matter on which Mr Chinn is alleged to have any qualification at all. There has usually been associated with these Commissioners a third., who is supposed to supervise the financial side of the railways and accounts, and generally to study their finances.",29
160,Mr LAIRD SMITH,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,You . are arguing as if he had been appointed chief engineer for the line. He is only an assistant.,30
161,Mr DEAKIN,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"I am not arguing from that stand-point. The chief engineer is he served,, how he served. Mr Deane. . For all I know to the contrary, Mr Deane's appointment may have been criticised in various parts of Australia ; but the fact remains that no one disputed, his fitness for thepost, and no one . disputes that he has behind him a long and distinguished career. This case is entirely different. Mr Chinnhas not laid before this House a shred of paper relating to his experience in any capacity, even in the management of a railway, putting aside the question of construction. He wrote letters to the papers. He made fertile suggestions. So may many other people who have an outside knowledge of railway business; but he does not show that, for a single day, in this country or any other-, he ever served even in the management of a railway.",30
162,Mr FENTON,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,Yes .,30
163,Mr DEAKIN,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"We have not had a word from the Minister in that regard tonight, or a tittle of evidence in any of the credentials that have been read. If there is anything in the papers, let it be added, and I shall make allowance for it ; buf, so far, in this debate there has not been a word tb show that he has had' the slightest practical experience as manager in any positionof importance, on any railway, anywhere. Remember, again, that I am still arguing from the question of management, although it has next to nothing to do with the challenge to Mr Chinn. The construction of the railway is under the control of Mr. Deane, a capable constructing engineer, who requires beneath him engineers, if not equally, at any rate largely, experienced in that kind of work. No one versed in railway management would think of employing, as a chief officer of a constructing engineer, a man whose experience of railways was limited to some minor employments of which we have yet to hear, and to; newspaper and other criticism. Until this line is completed, there, is no room for him as manager, or for any. one else, since there is no railway management. The work to be done is wholly and solely railway construction. We are told that he is only temporarily appointed, but. we have not yet been shown, that, he was ever concerned with railway construction. He has had a long career in Australia,, and all, except the short period when he was criticising the Western. Australian railways, has been left a blank. Weknow nothing of when he served, where We have no testimonials from his employers or his. superior officers. We have no proof of his ordinary professional standing or university degree. We have, in. fact, no evidence to. justify his choice, except that a number; of competent business men, and a lawyer or two, who happened to be members of the Legislative Council of Western Australia, have been good enough to give him warm general, certificates of little value except for their goodwill.  brand of politics, do you think there would have been this fuss?",30
164,Mr DEAKIN,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,Yes . I have not alluded to that fact.  but the right honourable member for Swan raised the question.,30
165,Mr DEAKIN,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"Other s havedealt with that fact; it comes into consideration only when it has been decided that Mr Chinn could not have been chosen for his. professional qualifications-. The question for us to determine is : for what qualifications has Mr Chinn been chosen? He has had no experience even in management or in construction. The one other 1 1 thing that: he did, the achievement of a lifetime, of. which, the Minister of Home Affairs spoke, was an alteration which is to save 4 miles in the length of a railway of which, as every one knows, there was only a trial survey in existence. A trial survey is intended to be corrected 1 afterwardsih the light of further and completer knowledge before the rails are laid down. What he did is part of the ordinary every-day task of an engineer whoruns a trial survey,' and then necessarily goes over it afterwards and corrects it before building a permanent route. Thus, the only testimony of practical efficiency with which we have been favoured is the ordinary correction of a trial survey, 1 which had to be corrected like almost every other trial survey.",30
166,Mr MASSYGREENE,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,And the country is flat all round.,31
167,Mr DEAKIN,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"Yes . Some reference was made to the difficulties of approaching Kalgoorlie by railway, but I have never seen a town in any part of the world more easily approached. The country is level, ancl you can come into it at any angle, and at any spot.",31
168,Mr FISHER,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,That argument is against you.,31
169,Mr FRAZER,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,Then - why did Mr. Deane suggest that we should go out 6 miles ?,31
170,Mr DEAKIN,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"I leave Mr Deane, who is a highly competent engineer, to answer that question, but undertake to say that there was a very good reason. Reference was made in a general way to Mr Chinn's successful - dealing with the men under him. So far I have not heard a word of testimony even on that head, and yet in the Australian. particular work in which he is now engaged it will be a very important consideration, quite apart from professional qualifications, and one in which we have terest, not to be satisfied by a simple assertion. I submit that, taking the case put this appointment at its very best, taking it without anything more than necesquite sary qualifications and natural interpretaout tions it must be admitted that, gigantic proposal such as this railway is, enormous importance as it is to the people - of Australia, the Government could not have appointed a man with more slender - qualifications than are possessed by Mr. Chinn. Is there any member on the Minwho isterial side bold enough to deny that there are at least a score, if not scores, of in Australia of longer experience and higher standing, with better testimonials struction. frorn their employers, proving their absolute fitness for this class of work?",31

173,Mr FRAZER,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,Is it?,31
174,Mr DEAKIN,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"The Minister does not, or will not, see it. Even if Mr Chinn is all that he claimed-and he claimed very little, and put in evidence of very little Mr KING O'MALLEY - A great man !",31

This is that the Government has chosen the best man available ior the post in Australia or out of it, so that we might rely with absolute confidence that this vast public work, one of the greatest ever undertaken in Australia, will be carried out in the most efficient manner. We ought to have been assured that we are not being exposed to unnecessary risk, nor those responsible for the work to unnecessary anxiety, by having associated with them a man apparently of the most imperfect qualifications, and certainly not comparable in his claim on the Government with many others outside, who were not favoured with the appointment. That is the last important consideration-the injustice that has been done to scores of able Australians, qualified by experience and by their university »qualifications Mr KING O'MALLEY - Mr Chinn is an",31

A charge has been levelled against the Government of having made a partisan appointment. I have listened carefully to most of the statements which have been made from the other side, but not one word has been levelled against the capacity of the man who is in charge of the construction of the Kalgoorlie section of the trans-Australian railway. The mover this motion contented himself with reading statements from a number of Labour e men who are go-, verning Western Australia-in favour of his appointment. Assuming that that is correct, are we to take up the attitude that each one of these men who have committed their names to paper in favour of this gentleman is incompetent to express an opinion, and that the honourable member for Perth and his supporters, who have never seen Mr Chinn, who know nothing of his work",31

181,Mr FRAZER,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"Yes , if the honourable member will give me an opportunity. These honourable members, who have never been acquainted with any of Mr Chinn's work, say, "" Because Chinn has got the support of these Ministers from Western Australia, it must be a political j o b .

The Minister of Home Affairs has demonstrated that, within recent times-non e of these letters is dated, long ago-me n on the opposite side have been profuse in their approval of Mr .

Then we get to this stage: that if it is a political job, honourable members on the other side are equally guilty with honourable members on this side.",32
182,Mr ROBERTS,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,More so.,32

187,Mr FRAZER,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"It is both true and fair. We will now assume that politics did not enter into the matter at all. Mr Chinn was an applicant for the position of Commissioner of Railways in Tasmania, and, according to reliable information, he was second to another Western Australian, Mr Smith, who was manager of the Midland Railway Company.

226,Mr FENTON,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"Maribyrnong) [5.3] I do not intend to say yery much in regard to this motion. At the outset, I must express my agreement, to a very large extent, with the remarks made by the honourable member for Bendigo on Friday last to the effect that we seem to indulge too frequently in these redistribution schemes. Under the Constitution and our Electoral Acts we are compelled to redistribute the seats owing to variations of population which may, sometimes, prove to be only of a temporary character. If the responsibility for this lies, as the honourable member for Bendigo seems to think it does, with the Constitution, we should do well to make that instrument a little more elastic in that respect. It is a very serious matter to upset at frequent intervals the electoral arrangements of the various States. Of course, we should rejoice if we knew that the population was increasing in a greater degree in the rural districts than in the city areas. The Commissioners, I understand, first fix on a quota, from which they work, taking into consideration community or diversity of interests, physical features, and other circumstances. It has always seemed to me tbqt our electoral system ought to be based on human beings, and not on areas. In Victoria, if we were to leave the representation as at present, we should have in the city of Melbourne 344,868 electors, with a quota of 38,318, and nine members ; while in the country, there would be 382,733 electors, with a quota of 31,894, and twelve members, or a difference pf considerably over 6,000 electors in each electorate as between country and city. It is unfair, in my opinion, to have a quota bf 38,318 electors within city boundaries, and only 31,894 in country districts. I sympathize largely with the honourable member for Wimm.era and the honourable member for Bendigo in their regrets about the population drifting into the city, yet the Commissioners have to face the fact that nearly half the population of the State is within that area. If we enlarge the country electorates there can be no possible encroachments on the city areas,, but there is a possibility of metropolitan areas touching on some country districts; and that has been done. The Commissioners have, I think, carried out their arduous task in a manner that reflects considerable credit on them. It has been pointed out that in some country constituencies the quota is above that fixed for the whole State. It is impossible, of course, to get figures to tally exactly, and certain considerations have to be taken into account in forming or incorporating electorates. On the figures as they stand the Commissioners have, I believe, carried out their duties as well as could be expected. Personally, as representing Maribyrnong-, I am not inclined to complain. I know that the quota has been reduced, but if one Radical section has been excised, another Radical section has been attached on the other side. In reply to the honourable member for Wimmera, who also, apparently, has no complaint to make, 1I have to say that it would be impossible to give country electors twelve members and the city only nine, with a difference of 6,000 electors in favour of the city; If I had any doubt whatever as to a mistake having been made, whether through an error of judgment or otherwise, or as to any injustice having been inflicted on any part of the State, or on the State as a whole, I should have no hesitation about referring this report back to the Commissioners in order that they might analyze i't, and submit a fresh scheme to this House. The Electoral Act was wisely framed in this regard-that Parliament is the final arbiter, and that we have power to refer back to Electoral Commissioners any scheme submitted to us. As far, however, as I am personally concerned, I intend to vote for the recommendation- '  sire to say a word or two in regard to the number of electorates in the city portion of the State of Victoria in comparison with the number in the rural districts. I do not know what principle has been in operation in other States, but in Victoria it has always been held to be a proper thing that country electors should have a relatively smaller number of constituents allotted to them than city electors. The reason for that-is that in the rural districts there is a larger area to be covered, and consequently there is increased difficulty in securing effective representation. That principle has been departed from in this case. I think, therefore, that a mistake has been committed. If I had any influence 1 would cause the error to be rectified. I really think that the Minister of Home Affairs might take the matter into his very serious consideration, and if it is not too late to restore to Victoria one of the country constituencies which will be lost under the new scheme",34
227,Mr RILEY,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"I am afraid it is too late.  nothing definite can be Idone until this House ratifies the recommendations of the Commissioners. If a fundamental error has been made, I consider that this House ought to rectify it. I submit to the Minister, therefore, the consideration whether there is any possibility of having this - scheme amended to meet the views I have expressed.",35
228,Dr CARTY SALMON,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,Laanecoorie) IS3l-- 1 ish first to express my regret 1 w .that the Minister of Home Affairs by his - own action deprived himself of the services of the most competent authority to advise him upon this question.,35
229,Mr TUDOR,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,To whom does the honourable member refer?,35
230,Dr CARTY SALMON,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"I refer to the Chief Electoral Officer for the Commonwealth. The Minister, in spite of the advice tendered to him by myself and other honourable members, persisted in appointing the Chief Electoral Officer of the Commonwealth as one of the Commissioners to divide the State of Victoria into electorates. In that I think he distinctly committed an error; because in a matter of this sort, which, should always be dealt with apart from party considerations, and into the settlement of which'party feeling should never be allowed to enter, the Minister should always be in a position to be able to consult an expert, authority as to any criticism which might be offered upon any redistribution scheme submitted. But ithe Minister wilfully deprived Mmself of that opportunity, and I , for one, very much regret that he did, because I feel that had the officer who occupies the very, high and responsible position to which I refer been allowed to remain free, and had' the Commissioner who previously . divided the State of Victoria, namely, Mr Topp, been appointed,, the position would have been much more satisfactory. I understand that the Chief Electoral Officer was not anxious to be appointed, a Commissioner. On the other hand, Mr Topp is a man. whose bona fides have never been challenged, and who, by reason of his personal knowledge of the State of Victoria, gained duringa very long public service, during part of. which he was Under-Secretary, was preeminently qualified for carrying out what all will agree is a most complicated: operation.",35
231,Mr TUDOR,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,Was it not Mr Topp's report that this House rejected in 1903?,35
232,Dr CARTY SALMON,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"I am not sure whether Mr Topp presented that report or not, but I feel perfectly satisfied that no charge was ever made against his capacity or integrity on that occasion.",35
233,Mr TUDOR,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"Hear , hear; I grant that.",35
234,Dr CARTY SALMON,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"The last speaker alluded to the fact, of which, of course, this House in its wisdom may refuse to take any cognisance, and to which it may decline to attach any weight, that in Victoria a certain principle has always been followed in regard to the proportionate representation of people in the' city and those in the rural districts. As a supporter of the principle of adult suffrage I hold that, in an ideal state, the principle of one vote one value is a necessary corollary. But it is only in an ideal state that the second principle could be made to work in perfection. It is only when equal Opportunities are given both to the electors and to those who desire to be elected that the principle of '/ one vote one value"" can act perfectly. As. long as we have disparities ruling in social and geographical conditions there will be disparities between the values of the votes of different individuals in different parts of the country. The only way in which human wisdom, can endeavour to make up for the disparity which undoubtedly does exist is by acknowledging that, although it may be very much, to be desired, it is not expedient that we should have the principle of "" one vote one value "" carried out to the full in our elec^ toral system.",35
235,Mr DEAKIN,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"Our cities grow so fast that the proportion is soon thrown out of gear. - Dr CARTY SALMON - The point which I wish to impress upon the House is this : It is not a fair thing to the country electors that they should be placed on exactly the same footing as regards reundoubted presentation as are the people in the towns. Neither is it a fair thing for the man who desires to be elected for a country consions stituency that he should be asked to cover enormous areas in order to meet with those who have a right to express their preferhaving ences on polling-day. One has only to look at the map and contemplate the size of some of the electorates which exist in additional voters there. Australia to realise the tremendous disthat parity between the operation of adult missioners. franchise in those immense country electorates, and its operation in the cities. distribution. Surely those of us who speak for rural districts are not asking too much when ask this House to allow those who are less favourably situated to have removed a porhave tion of the disparity which undoubtedly exists. The Commonwealth Parliament, in its wisdom, made provision that some allowdistribution ance might be made for country electors. Vet we find that the Commissioners purely have almost totally ignored the proobservations. vision embodied by Parliament in the Electoral Act. Parliament, in providof ing that there should be a quota, considerations provided a maximum and a minimum numdaries ber of electors for each division, the being that the minimum should be apciated proached in those divisions which are removed from the big centres of population, which cover a large area of country, and which are, from their lack of means communication, difficult to traverse. instance, the maximum number of electors for any division would be 4.1,578, and the minimum 27,718; but the division to which has been allotted the smallest number of electors is within the metropolitan area. Surely that is not in accordance with either the spirit or the letter of the law. There appears to have been wilful avoidance of there an evident duty. I have always looked deal upon the Minister as essentially fairher minded, and am surprised that he recomalthough mends a scheme which shows its unfairness by the allotment of electors to the first sion mentioned in it. He revels in figures and mathematical comparisons, and I wonber. der that he did not notice that Balaclava, which is within a few minutes of the Geneobliterates ral Post Office, will contain fewer electors than any other division in the State. In the middle portion of Victoria there is large and important mining district, extoral Act? tending from Bendigo in the north to Ballarat in the south. It is there that the auriferous land of the State lies; but Commissioners have been, so careless of the Dr Carty Salmon. probabilities of-the development of that tract of country that they have wiped off the map two of the electoral diviwhich were formerly situated there.

237,Dr CARTY SALMON,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"The Commiswe sioners have taken maps and returns, and, by processes of addition and subtraction, evolved the scheme which we are now asked to accept; but, speaking impersonally, I think that this is not the way a reof an electoral division should be made. The work should not be done by means of what I may call literary It is the desire of Parliament, and of the people, that community interest shall be one of the strongest in 'determining the bounof a division. There should not be idea a throwing together of persons not assopolitically or in their ordinary avocafar tions, and a severance of persons thus closely and intimately associated.",36

243,Dr CARTY SALMON,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"Both . The law should have been more elastic. Just the as there is a maximum and a minimum provided for divisions, there should have been a maximum and a minimum population for each State, so that Ministerial or parliamentary action could prevent such an injustice as has undoubtedly befallen Victoria. What is the case of Victoria today may be the case of New South Wales tomorrow; and I am sure that honourable members desire to look at this matter, not from the stand-point of their State interest, but in the interest of the proper representation of every State. As to the manner in which the subdivision has been made, I think it only fair to say that I do not agree with those who have thought it necessary or advisable to completely obliterate from the map two adjoining electorates. The action taken is certainly most extraordinary. Those who have had parliamentary experience must view with wonder any redistribution, and especially one following another after a comparatively brief interval, which provides for the wiping out of two neighbouring electorates.",36
244,Mr WISE,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,Is it not always the centre - of a State that suffers in such redistribution schemes?,37
245,Dr CARTY SALMON,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,No . - Mr DEAKIN - Why should the centre - suffer ?,37
246,Mr WISE,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,Because the Commissioners ^cannot begin with the outside electorates.,37
247,Dr CARTY SALMON,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"I have always -'thought that a great mistake is made in encroaching upon the centre of a State in these redistribution schemes. It would be .better to start from the centre and work ' outwards. By the adoption of that course --we should secure greater community of interest than is possible by encroaching on - the centre of a State. Even if the honourable member for Gippsland's idea is - correct, I would point out that the elec""torates which have been obliterated are .geographically in the centre of Victoria. ""It is more than unfortunate that the abolition of two neighbouring electorates - should have been thought either necessary - or advisable. I can see no justification for it. If one had been wiped out of - existence, and used to make up the necessary quota for the surrounding electorates, I could have understood the action of the Commissioners; but the summary abolition - of two neighbouring electorates, compris"" ing nearly half the State, may have been - chance, but I fear that there was a good - deal of design in it. I am informed that a proposal was made- I do not know - whether the Minister himself ever considered it-that one electorate should be abolished and that another further away to the west should be used to make up the necessary quota in the surrounding electorates. That proposition, however, was summarily disposed of. Mr KING O'MALLEY - B y whom?",37
248,Dr CARTY SALMON,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,B y the Commissioners. Mr KING O'MALLEY - It never came before me. I did not look at the scheme. I simply laid it on the table of the House. It was a matter for the Commissioners. I had nothing to do with it.,37
249,Dr CARTY SALMON,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,I hope that the honourable member does not always lay papers on the table without looking at them.,37
250,Mr ROBERTS,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,Who made this proposition to which the honourable member refers ?,37
251,Dr CARTY SALMON,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"It was made, but not by the Chief Commissioner. I understand, indeed, that, several propositions were made from time to time. The honourable member is aware no doubt that the Chief Commissioner's map is that which has been adopted.",37
252,Mr ROBERTS,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"The honourable member suggested that some one had proposed to the Commissioners a different scheme of redistribution. Dr CARTY SALMON.'- A suggestion was made, but 1 cannot say whether it was made to the Chief Commissioner or to the Commissioners as a body.",37
253,Mr RILEY,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,Not by the Minister?,37
254,Dr CARTY SALMON,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"No ; the Minister says that he had nothing whatever to do with the scheme; and as a matter of fact, the suggestion to which I refer would not have suited him.. Its adoption would have meant the abolition of a constituency at present represented by a member of the Ministerial party. I wish also to strenuously object to this practice of bringing into centres of population a larger number of electors than that to which they are entitled. If there is one thing more than another we have to deplore, it is the way in which our population is drifting into all the large centres. Instead of encouraging that tendency, we ought rather to discourage it by every means in our power.",37
255,Mr RILEY,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,If better wages are paid in the country the population will remain there.,37
256,Dr CARTY SALMON,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"I do not think it is a matter of wages. I believe that the honourable member agrees with me that a large number of people are prepared to ""accept lower wages in large cities, in order 'to secure more amusement and greater com-fort than are possible in rural districts. There is a class of people who are not much concerned about the wages they receive, as long as their employment gives them opportunities for amusement and the comforts, and even luxuries, that town l if e --affords. ' Mr Scullin - Does not the honourable - member think - that people have been driven - into the cities by the centralization policy of different Governments, and by land monopoly ?",37
257,Dr CART YSALMON,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,I believe that the centralization policy of past Governments of the State has had a lot to do with this tendency.,38
258,Mr HARPER,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,And the railways.,38
259,Dr CARTY SALMON,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"Quite so. We have, for instance, a port in the Western District of Victoria which ought to have been utilized, but of Which no advantage ' has been taken, simply because Government after Government have refused to give it the opportunity which it undoubtedly deserves. The same remark will apply to the - position in New South Wales. There the trade of country districts has been diverted into Sydney, just as in Victoria it has been driven from the country districts into Melbourne. It is unfair that the country should be made to suffer in this way. *T feel that honourable members who represent country constituencies, and who realise, from personal experience, the tremendous hardships that have to be endured both by . the men who are seeking the suffrages of the electors as well as by men and women who have to record their votes, will allow that there must be some differentiation between town and country electorates. There must be some disparity- a disparity that we cannot logically defend-bu t which, for the sake"" of expediency, we are bound to - allow to exist. That being so, the Government would have acted more fairly to the country districts of Victoria if they had provided that these two electorates should not be wrested from them. Those of us who live in the country, and who have not the advantages of those who live in .the towns, are entitled to more consideration than we are obtaining in this regard. As to the result of this redistribution, and its effect on parties in the House, it fortunate that two members of the Opposition are being made to suffer. If a subdivision "" under which country districts :would lose two representatives were found to be inevitable, it would have been far better to abolish an electorate represented by an Opposition member and an electorate represented by a member of the Ministerial party.",38
260,Mr KING OMALLEY,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,The Opposition really lose only one member. The State itself had to lose one.,38
261,Dr CARTY SALMON,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,I know that the State has to lose one representative; but such a redistribution should have been made as would not disarrange to such an extent as does that now before us the position of parties in this House. The electorates that are to be obliterated are both represented by members of the Opposftion.,38
262,Mr SAMPSON,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"And comprise country districts. Dr CARTY .SALMON - I have already dealt with that point, and am glad to learn, judging from the manner in which honourable members received my observations, that they have a certain measure of sympathy with 'them, although I do not know ithat they will show any practical sympathy.",38
263,Mr HIGGS,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,How could the honourable member justify' the consideration of party interests ?,38
264,Dr CARTY SALMON,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"What are often described as party actions are not really party actions. This very redistribution, for instance, has been described as a party one. The Government, I think, have been charged, most unfairly, in this connection. Mr KING O'MALLEY - We had two big Victorian State officers on the Commission.",38
265,Dr CARTY SALMON,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,That does not affect the question. I do not know whether the Minister in appointing them to the 'Commission made any inquiry as to their political faith. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Thei r faith is that of the honourable member.,38

324,Dr MALONEY,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,Anothe r gladiator about to die!,42
325,Mr HARPER,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"I do not feel like dying. I think, with the honourable member for Bendigo, that the primary difficulty arises from the provisions in the Constitution necessitating the re-arrangement toral districts, and which has occurred, I think, much more frequently than its framers ever anticipated. Therefore, to that extent we are tied. We must accept the Constitution, but it does draw public attention to the point that at some, period, not probably very remote, this provision will have to be. revised, by which the number of members of this House is fixed at double the number of members of the Senate, and which, I believe, was made at a time when there was considerable suspicion on the part of the smaller States with regard to the possible action of the larger States. In the light of our experience of twelve years we must see that it is utterly absurd that ihis House should, if it is to fairly represent the people of Australia, be tied down in this arbitrary fashion. The strength of the House cannot remain at seventy-five members if it is to meet the requirements of the people as the country advances. The last speaker al'uded to Victoria losing population. The cruel thing about the present redistribution is that Victoria is not losing population. If the numbers had been made up at the proper time we should not be losing a seat; in fact, there would - have been no redistribution. We mav be gaining population steadily in proportion to our area. If Queensland, with ten times, perhaps twenty times, the area, with any number of ports, each of which is a centre of population, and will lead to an increased population, goes ahead, as I trust it will, Victoria mav lose more members, not because she has declined in population or prosperity or anything else, but merely because of the increased population in Queensland or some other State, perhaps Western Australia. This is really a matter which calls for attention, that is, if the House is to remain representative of the people of Australia as a whole. However, we cannot deal with that ques' tion at present.",42
326,Mr ARCHIBALD,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"The small States, may incr^se their representation.",42
327,Mr HARPER,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"Yes , and take away representation from the other States. At the present time they enjoy an advantage under the Constitution, because they were allowed a minimum number of representatives-mor e than they were entitled to be allowed by reason of their population when the Act was framed. But by-and-by it is quite possible that they may come into the field and create still greater anomalies, of elec- than we have.",42
328,Mr MAHON,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,The only solution is to increase the number of members of the House.,42
329,Mr HARPER,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,Precisely . - Mr ARCHIBALD - That will not be fair to the small States.,42
330,Mr HARPER,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"The number of members must be in some relation to the population. In regard to this redistribution scheme, I have always thought that it was a mistake on the part of the Government to appoint public officers on a Commission of this kind. It would be far better to select three men who were outside the' Public Service. I do nof know the Chief Electoral Officer. I am not aware that I have ever seen him, but I think the present system puts him in an invidious position. I have nothing to complain of as far as his action is concerned. I know nothing of the reasons which induced the Commissioners to make this report and to propose this new arrangement, but I feel that they have not done their work well.",42
331,Mr KING OMALLEY,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,The reasons are given in the report.,42
332,Mr HARPER,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"Reason s are stated in the report, but there are other reasons not stated which weighed with them. I do not think that they have done their work well. They should have had some consideration for the fact that Victoria is the only State which has suffered in this way. Some years ago we lost a member, and now we are to lose another member. Instead of making a general redistribution the Commissioners have simply done as they did before. On the first occasion they took one electorate out of the centre, and on this occasion they have taken two electorates out of the centre with the result that the remaining country electorates are made geographically bigger. Looking at the question from a reasonable point of view I think that the Commissioners have not considered fully the effect which this method must have on the fair representation of the people, which after all ought to be the first consideration. A redistribution scheme should have nothing to do with the convenience of members or parties. The representation of the people should always be equitable and reasonable. As the first member for Mernda I had an immense addition to the area by the first redistribution when Colonel MCCay's seat was taken away, and I have had to work that district. It is not fair to the people, or to the member, whoever he is, that a district should be increased so enormously as the country electorates are likely to be through this plan of redistribution, because it is made absolutely impossible for a member to keep in touch with his constituents, and for them to keep in touch with him'. If a member has to travel, as I have had to do, over mountainous country extending 260 miles one way, and from 70 to 80 miles the other way, and containing an enormous number of centres, he cannot keep in touch with them. The plan is very unfair in that respect. I think some redistribution should have been arrived at, to the extent that the quota would permit of, on a different principle. With regard to the quota it is unfortunate for Victoria that it is to lose two members, but it is still more unfortunate for the country districts of Australia that they are to lose three country seats. Because, not only in Victoria, but elsewhere, the country districts are likely to be those to suffer. Victoria has already lost three country seats. As previous speakers have pointed out this all tends to that concentration of population which it ought to be the effort of every public man to prevent, but there it is. In my opinion, a redistribution could easily have been made which would have kept the country electorates down to the minimum number, and increased the city and suburban electorates to the highest number that the quota would admit of. That would have enabled us to carry out a principle which, I think, has been observed, not only in the State, but also in this Parliament; that is, to make the country districts, so far as the population is concerned, very considerably smaller than the city areas. We have, however, gone in the opposite direction, as the honourable member for Bendigo pointed out; and the country districts have positively a larger electoral population , than many of the suburban districts. I j do not think the position can be defended I on any principle; and if I had my way j I should refer the report back to the Commissioners with a view to seeing whether they could not make an arrangement fairer, not only in the interests of the electors, but in the interests of the country districts. I suppose, however, that the carrying of this motion is a foregone conclusion. I may say that the electors in my district are strongly opposed to the. alteration; they feel that the constituencies are being cut up in the most extraordinary way. For instance, the constituency of the honourable member for Flinders will stretch right over the mountains, and take in Healesville, Marysville, and Lilydale, while Corio will stretch out towards .Heidelberg, though it can have very little real connection with such places as Van Yean and Morang. In regard to my own electorate, the arrangement is, in my opinion, a most foolish one; there is so little community of interests between one part and another that some of the residents, when they journey to town, will come from the west, while others will come from the east and north-east. As to the name, ' I do not see why "" Mernda "" should be altered to "" Caulfield"" or "" Henty."" : In m'y judgment, ""Caulfield "" is the better, but I think we ought to retain the name of "" Mernda."" The present name was chosen by the late Mr. William Shiels, who claimed that it was the most euphonious of all in Victoria. I do not know what the word "" Mernda "" means, but I think Mr Shiels said it was a native name. ' I do not like the name '' Moorabbin ' ' ; and if we desire euphony we ought to adhere to "" Mernda,""",42
333,Mr CHANTER,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,""" Henty "" is a name connected with the early settlement of the State.",43
334,Mr HARPER,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"Variou s names have been mentioned, and I merely refer to this matter by the way. I think that the change in the electorate has not met with the full consideration it should have, and that it might have been more skilfully accomplished. I have not been in communication with anybody on the matter, but if I had been asked I think I could have given the Commissioners some information and advice which would have proved useful and made the division fairer to all concerned. My suggestion is that the report be - referred back for the consideration of the points raised by the honourable member for Bendigo and others. The honourable member I have just mentioned put the case very fairly, covering the whole ground; - and, that being so, I shall not detain honourable members longer.",43
335,Mr FAIRBAIRN,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"Fawkner) [6.16]. - I have no desire to attack this proposed division, so far as the Commissioners are concerned, because I think they have acted according to their light, and perfectly fairly.. It is a division which might be endorsed by any one, and, therefore, we cannot impute any motives. I know the Commissioners to be thoroughly honourable men; and, so far as they are concerned, I desire my position to be clearly understood. I may say a word or two, however, on the political outlook which the proposed division opens up. According to the previous division, there were in the metropolitan tricts three Liberal members and six Labour members, and in the other districts of the State nine Liberal members, three Labour members, and the honourable member for Gippsland, who, like Mahomet's coffin, hangs between the two parties. Under the proposed division, two of the Liberal seats are completely wiped out, and there is one new seat carved out of the other seats. That one seat is undoubtedly Liberal; I refer to the ""Caulfield"" or "" He n t y "" constituency. Fawkner, according to the last electoral figures, would have been a Labour seat by about 208 votes, irrespective of the absent votes and postal votes, which are now abolished. We may, therefore, say that three Liberal seats are wiped out and one Liberal seat is added, leaving a net deficiency of two. This does not seem quite a fair division from a political point of view, a view which we are entitled to take, but which the Commissioners are not, except from the point of view of community of interest. ""Community of interest"" should, I think, cover political views; people in similar walks of life hold similar views.",44
336,Mr CHANTER,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"That is not the interpretation; ""community of interest"" means commercial interests.",44
337,Mr FAIRBAIRN,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"I should have thought that "" community or diversity of interest "" would refer to Liberal or Labour views.",44
338,Mr CHANTER,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,The idea is not at all political.',44
339,Mr RILEY,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"It means community of interest in farming, mining, and so forth.",44

341,Mr ROBERTS,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"The remedy for that is , to give the farmers less work and more time to study politics, and they will also be Labour men.",44
342,Mr FAIRBAIRN,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,I am afraid that my honourable friend could suggest a great many remedies.,44
343,Mr CHANTER,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,The intention is that there should be unity of commercial interest.,44
344,Mr FAIRBAIRN,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"Commercia l interests largely embrace political interests, because the great questions debated in this Parliament are those affecting the classes to be taxed. In the last Parliament Victoria, had thirteen Liberal members, nine Labour members, and the honourable member for Gippsland.

345,Mr FAIRBAIRN,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,We should like to make it fourteen. There ought to be fair play between parties. To take away three seats and give us only one is not fair play. Honourable members opposite ought to agree to wipe out one Labour seat.,44

347,Mr FAIRBAIRN,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"If I were allowed to have a try, I could manage to do it.",44
348,Mr ROBERTS,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,The Commissioners are not influenced by the political views of those who represent particular seats.,44
349,Mr FAIRBAIRN,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"Inasmuc h as we believe nowadays that every man and woman should have one vote, we should also establish the principle of equality of value for those votes. Whether it should be a numerical equality or an actual equality is an arguable proposition. I think there ought to be, as nearly as possible, an actual equality. Consequently, we ought to recognise that a man or woman living far away from the centres of population cannot exert the influence enjoyed by those in the metropolitan area. But what do we find under this scheme of redistribution? Balaclava is .to have 32,000 electors, whilst Wimmera is also to have 32,000. The Balaclava electors have no distance to go to the poll. Consequently, a far greater number of them will vote than will be the case in Wimmera. Again, Batman is to have 35,829 electors, and Wannon 33>75 - I think that a fair division 8 has not been thought out. . We ought to make conditions as favourable as possible to people living in the country. We hope that by extending irrigation facilities we shall be able to give people in* the country some of the comforts of town life. We hope that those living in the country centres will have nice asphalted pavements and good schools for their children. At present, however, the country elector is at a disadvantage. Consequently, his vote ought to have slightly more weight. That principle has not been studied in this division. We all know how congested our cities have become, and we are now offering another inducement to people to live in town, fi is, I know, a - small inducement, but we ought not to afford any extra facilities for people in the towns to exercise more political influence than they have at present. I am aware that the congestion of population in the - cities is attributed to the fact that our railways are concentrated towards the metropolitan area. Every one of us would like to see our people more widely scattered - throughout the country districts.

In August, 1903, certain reports and maps were laid on the table.",45
356,Mr SPEAKER,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,The honourable member must now confine himself to the amendment. Amendment agreed to.,45
357,Mr BAMFORD,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"Herbert) [7.53] - In August, 1903, I objected to the redistribution of the electoral divisions of Queensland then proposed, and was fortunate in securing the support of the Minister of the day, the honourable member for Hume, who moved the rejection of the scheme. I intend on this occasion to move to refer the redistribution back to the Commissioners. When the redistribution was made the three Commissioners were, in the first place, unanimous regarding the divisions of Kennedy and Herbert, but Mr Graham subsequently saw fit to disagree with his fellow Commissioners regarding some of the other i divisions. Tfae first redistribution made the borders of the division of Herbert those marked on the map which I hold in my hand, which I ask honourable members to compare with that hanging on the wall. In 1903 Mr MCDowall, who was then a Commissioner, sent to the Government a report and map showing the distribution which had been made; but within fortyeight hours another distribution was made, and further maps were sent to Melbourne, showing an entire alteration of boundaries. I thereupon made a charge of gerrymandering against some person or persons unknown, with the result that the distribution was rejected, and a departmental Committee was appointed to inquire into the matter. Its verdict was ""not proven."" The Gommittee did not say that I was wrong in my contention. There was not - sufficient 'evidence to show that the Commissioner had been influenced in any way detrimental to 'my own interests, but there was such evidence of unfairness to myself that I had .the support of practically every honourable member of the House. honourable member for Ballarat, who then adorned the Treasury bench just as he adorns any seat that he 'occupies, thoroughly agreed with his own Minister that there was evidence, although not absolute proof, that something in the nature of gerrymandering had been attempted. Some sinister influence detrimental to myself has, it would appear, in this case also been at work. I ask honourable members to carefully exan-ine the map displayed on the wall, setting forth the redistribution scheme. Is it not significant although it is laid down that wherever possible State and Federal electoral boundaries shall be conterminous, in this case the electorate of Herbert has been so cut up as to throw the whole mining vote of Herbert into the electorate of Kennedy. If we are to consider community of interest, then it cannot be denied that the State electorate of Cook, a portion of which is now 'included in the northern part of the electorate of Herbert, should have been included in the electorate of Kennedy. There are practically no agricultural interests in Kennedy, and there are certainly none in the State electorate of Cook, so that if there is any force in the provision that, wherever possible, due regard should be paid to community of .interest, then the electorate of Cook should have been included in the electorate of Mr Bamford. Kennedy instead of being placed in that which I represent. Under this redistribution scheme the electorate of Herbert will comprise 33,364 electors, or 1,976 above the quota. On the other hand, the electorate of Kennedy under this scheme will comprise 27,177 electors, or 4,211 below the quota. If the whole of the State electorate of Cook had been added to Kennedy it would have increased by 1,693 number of electors in that division, thus reducing Herbert to 31,671-, or only 283 above the quota, tnd raising to 28/870 the number of electors in Kennedy, which would still be 2,578 below the quota. I desire now to refer to a matter which is really due to a weakness in the Act rather than to any fault on the part of the Commissioners. I do not blame the Commissioners at all for it, but the Act should be amended at the earliest opportunity in order to prevent - its recurrence. This map, showing the redistribution of 'Queensland into Federal electorates, together with the accompanying The report of the Commissioners, was issued on 8th April last, and copies of it had to be posted at every post-office in each electorate. At any time within thirty days from the date of its publication any suggestions or objections to the scheme may be sent into the Commissioners, who, under section 18 of the Act, are entitled to take such suggestions or objections into consideration, and to make any alterations they may choose. Twentyssven days after the map had been posted a deputation, according to press that, reports, waited upon the Chairman of the Commissioners, and raised certain objections to the proposed redistribution of the electorate of Herbert. Why have we no information as to the character of those objections? I wish to know now who comprised that deputation, and what objections were raised by them. Following a question put to the Minister of Home Affairs a few days ago by the honourable member for Darling Downs, I asked the Minister if he would table the whole of the papers, and he replied that he woulft do so. I desire now to know what has become of those objections, and by whom they were launched. We know nothing about them, and cannot say whether or not they were lodged with the Commissioner's before or after the prescribed date.",45
358,Mr GROOM,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,Is there no reference in the report to these objections?,46
359,Mr BAMFORD,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"We have simply the - statement that four objections were received, but the report does not state whether they were lodged by individuals or 'organizations, nor does it indicate the - character of the objections.

I am going to ask the Minister presently some further questions that may be inconvenient for him. I am not going to spare him j he has not spared me. The weakness of this part of the Act is that the Commissioners, having taken objections or suggestions into consideration after the thirty days' period has elapsed, may make such alterations as they please, and that no one knows anything - about them until their report is laid upon the table of the House.

361,Mr BAMFORD,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"It has not yet been laid cn the table. Under the law as it - exists, those who were perfectly satisfied with the first scheme of redistribution have had no opportunity whatever of objecting to the second redistribution. The same thing might apply to any other State. If a map were issued for a redistribution of Victoria on the day on which the report was laid upon the table, and too late for any objections to be entered, honourable members representing Victoria would say that that was unfair.",47
362,Mr DEAKIN,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,Does the honourable member say that this map was not laid on the table ?,47
363,Mr BAMFORD,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"I say that it has not been laid on the table at all. I asked the Minister a question on the subject this afternoon, and his answer was that he thought it had been. It was the duty of the Minister to lay these reports and maps on the table, ancl if he had done so he would be sure of it, and would not have to say that he thought they were laid on the table. I cannot too strongly emphasize my objection that no one is given an opportunity to Object to a subsequent redistribution after the first has been made, and .thirty days have been allowed for objections to' it, though the second redistribution may be entirely different from the first. We have three reports on the redistribution of Queensland divisions-on e from Messrs. Gall and Spowers, and two from Mr. c Graham, the third Commissioner. The majority report from Messrs. Gall and Spowers is the one on which the Minister is acting.",47
364,Mr GROOM,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"Unde r the Act it has only to be laid before Parliament, not on the table.",47
365,Mr BAMFORD,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"Perhaps the honourable gentleman will say what is the meaning of ""before Parliament."" Honourable members are aware that papers are often asked for which, because of the cost of printing and for other reasons, Ministers do not think it desirable to lay on the table of the House, and they lay them on the"" table in the Library. I ask the honourable member for Darling Downs whether that is to be considered laying such papers "" before Parliament."" I say that those papers should be laid on the table, and submitted to Parliament as the Act provides. It is significant that when the first redistribution was made the three Commissioners were unanimous with regard to the two electorates of Kennedy and Herbert, and those were the only two divisions on which they were unanimous. Mr Graham took exception to some of the other divisions proposed. We had subsequently a report from Mr. Graham, dated 3rd July, in which he says The Commissioners have caused a map with a description of the boundaries of each proposed Division to be exhibited at post-offices in the proposed Division, and public attention has been invited thereto by advertisement in the Gazette, dated Sth April, 1912. These maps were not signed by the three Commissioners, but by the Chairman only. I declined lo sign them because I did not consider the proposals to be the best, or even the least undesirable that could be submitted. Some of the proposals appear to me, from my own conception of Commonwealth electoral matters in this State, to be quite undesirable. I have, therefore, now the honour to' forward a report representing my individual opinions. This course was not decided upon without full consideration ; without f u l ly advocating my ideas at the sittings of the Commission; or without due recognition of the advisableness of, if possible, being in accord with the majority. To achieve this latter I tentatively gave way upon several points which I considered essential to the success of the redistribution, but ultimately the sum of these became too great. Consequently, I submit a separate proposed distribution, together with maps (showing also the proposals of the majority where practicable) and technical descriptions of the boundaries of the Divisions as proposed by me. any proposed Division regarding which the three Commissioners are in accord, separate maps and technical descriptions are not included. I ask honourable members to note clearly the statement that in the case of any proposed division regarding which the three Commissioners are in accord separate maps and technical descriptions have not been included. He sent no subsequent reports, and no further maps, regarding the two divisions of Kennedy and Herbert on which the three Commissioners were in unison on the first report. I now come to the quota, and its The fact that Herbert and Kennedy jointly the former is approximately as much above two Divisions are geographically adjacent, irregularity of enrolment. The following table shows the alterations of Herbert and Kennedy since the distribution of 1906 :Distribution. Canvass, 1903. 1908. Enrolment. Herbert (26,119) . . 33,040 6,927 Kennedy (22,111).. 21,482 It will be seen that the numbers were decreasing all the time in the Kennedy division, whilst they were increasing in the Herbert division. The natural inference, and the one to which Mr Graham points, is that the decrease in the numbers in the Kennedy division was continual, and likely to remain so, and, therefore, the surplus existing in Herbert should be taken from that division and placed in the Kennedy division. I shall read what he has to say on this matter for the information of honourable membersThe figures above quoted indicate that during the six years (1906-1911 inclusive) the enrolment within the Division of Herbert has undergone a steady and consistent increase, while that of the Division of Kennedy has steadily decreased. The objeft to be attained, therefore, is to increase the number of electors allotted to Kennedy to such an extent as to provide that the increasing enrolment in other Divisions shall not cause the enrolment for Kennedy to fal l below the minimum allowed by the law. The number of electors allotted by the majority of the Commission is-Herbert , 33,364 (or 4,302 below the maximum); Kennedy, 27,177 (or only 2,067 above the absolute minimum). vious course would be to withdraw from the surplus enrolment of Herbert a sufficieritly large number of electors to raise the enrolment of Kennedy above the quota to such an extent that Mr Bamford. bearing upon the divisious of Herbert and Kennedy. I have here the second report of In the case of Mr Graham, which is dated 18th July. Itcame to hand only on last Tuesday, and has been in the hands of the printers until today. Many honourable members have not seen this report, and I commend it to their attention.",47
366,Mr CHANTER,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,It has not yet been laid on the table.,48
367,Mr BAMFORD,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"Possibl y not; and that is one of the matters of which I complain as showing the unfairness with which I am being treated. In his second report Mr Graham sayscontain sufficient electors for two Divisions; that the quota as the latter is below it ; and that the affords opportunity for compromise in adjusting the in enrolment on the Rolls for the existing Divisions Canvass, 1909.

In order to attain this object I propose to detach from the existing Division of Herbert and add to the proposed Division of Kennedy the whole of the Subdivisions of Bowen and Mackay, containing in the aggregate 11,520 electors, which number, added to the existing enrolment of 20,709, would have the effect of placing Kennedy in a practically unassailable position in relation to electoral strength-the total, 32,229, being reasonably near to the quota, and consequently affording a margin of approximately 6,000 for increase or decrease during the ensuing five years, while Herbert, with 27,941 electors, which number wilf undoubtedly be rapidly increased, would beplaced in a position which would allow of expansion without endangering its relation to the quota. The Commissioner then deals with the questions of diversity of population and community of interestWithin the existing Division of Herbert, community or diversity of interest presents a very difficult problem when making a redistribution of boundaries for a Division containing approximately 95,000 square miles of territory. The population is practically confined to the southern half of the Division, the northern half The ob- including a very large area of almost uninhabited country. The chief interest is the production of sugar. The principal centre thereof (Mackay Subdivision) is at the extreme south, small territorially, very densely populated, ana entirely devoted to sugar-growing. this Subdivision to the north and west is the Bowen Subdivision, sparsely populated, the interests including sugar production, but to a much less extent. Proceeding northward, sugar growing country is rot again met with until the Ingham district, some 200 miles distant, is reached. Thence sugar-growing interests wax and wane in importance until the Douglas Subdivision is reached, approximately midway along the eastern coast. It will thus be seen there are two widely separated sugar districts in the Division. Of the 20,709 electors in the existing Division of Kennedy, which is of vast territorial extent and in which the interests are entirely pastoral and mining, 8,570 are concentrated . within the very small area of the Charters Towers Goldfield, the next most populous Subdivision (Cloncurry) having only 1,988 electors. There is no way of satisfactorily adjusting the incidence of the electoral population without in a measure disregarding the provisions of section 16 (a), consequently it is proposed to transfer the Bowen and Mackay Subdivisions from Herbert to Kennedy. I ask honourable members to note that Mr. Graham again suggests, after making the fullest investigation and giving it every consideration, that Bowen and Mackay should be added to the Kennedy electorate, as was done in the first redistribution. He saysThis course is recommended after mature consideration and with full recognition of the fact that a foreign interest will be introduced into Kennedy, and that portion of the sugar-growing interest will be detached from the coastal Division of Herbert. Exhaustive examination was made of all other practicable combinations without affording an adequate and satisfactory solution of the difficulty. Herbert - The proposed Division comprises the existing Division of Herbert, less the Bowen and Mackay Subdivisions, which have been transferred to Kennedy; enrolment, 27,941. Kennedy - The Division comprises the existing Division of Kennedy with the addition of the Bowen and Mackay Subdivisions of the existing Division of Herbert; enrolment, 32,229. Those are the facts. In face of them. I am justified in asking that the redistribution, as made by the Commissioners, be referred back to them for further consideration, and I believe honourable members will support me. I said a little while ago that I had asked that the whole of the papers be laid upon the table of the House. I ask the Minister of Home Affairs»now if all the papers were laid upon the table of the House. A report sent by the Chief Electoral Officer for Queensland to the Chief Commonwealth Electoral Officer, Mr Oldham, regarding this matter, has never seen the light of day so far as this House is concerned.",48
368,Mr GROOM,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"The Act requires only the report and the maps to be laid on the table. Adjoining Mr BAMFORD - If the honourable member puts that contention forward, then I say that my objection regarding the maps should also have equal weight. When an officer of the Commonwealth, occupying such a high"" and responsible position as Chief Electoral Officer for Queensland, sends a report to his chief in Melbourne, it must be written for a purpose. There may be confidential communications in it, but why does not the Minister tell us",49
369,Mr GROOM,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,The report to be laid before Parliament should not be confidential.,49
370,Mr BAMFORD,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"A paper of that sort,, which is an official document to all intents, and purposes, should be laid upon the table for the information of honourable members. Does the Chief Electoral Officer for Queensland approve or disapprove of any of these maps or plans? The Minister of Home Affairs is an oyster; he is as silent as the tomb. If he were only as fluent now as he was this afternoon, upon another matter, we should, perhaps, get some valuable information from him. I ask him now, in the first place: Is it correct that there is, a report of that nature? I say there is. Will the Minister deny it? He cannot deny it. The report exists, and it is the duty of the Minister to let us know the gist of it. What did the Chief Electoral Officer for Queensland say about this scheme? Why is there any mystery or secrecy about the matter ? We have a perfect right to demand that this official document shall be made available to the House. I am sure that if it contains any proposed matter of a confidential nature the Minister can trust honourable members to treat such matter as confidential.. Has the report been submitted to the Cabinet? Not a word can I get from the Minister ! I think that there is a most fishy odour about the whole business, and that I have been treated most unfairly. In this case the Ministry-and there are only two of the Ministers here - are guilty of moral cowardice. They will not do what they know in their hearts to be right, because they are afraid of being accused of doing what is wrong. They are moral cowards in that respect.

I went to the Chief Electoral Officer for the Commonwealth, and asked him whether, if the matter were allowed to stand over for this session, there would be ample time to complete the work for the elections, and he replied that if the matter were treated properly there would himbe ample time for the purpose. The Minister knows that, too, because the officer I am answered my question in his presence.",50
378,Mr CHANTER,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,The whole thing could has been be done in two months.,50
379,Mr BAMFORD,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"It could be done in weeks. The Minister has said, It is about the first time that he has spoken. Mr KING O'MALLEY - That will be owing to the activity of the officers.",50
380,Mr BAMFORD,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"Where is any activity being shown by the officers regarding these reports? I take the strongest possible exception to this proposal. I desire to make I a few observations now in regard to community of interest. A great deal of unnecessary importance is attached' to this In the first report sent in by Messrs. the Gall and Spowers, they referred to community of interest; but that was only from agricultural point of view. They propose the whole of the sugar districts be confined in one electoral division-this , however, is quite impossible: But there are other interests to be served. The commercial interests, for instance, are entitled to quite as much consideration as as are the agricultural interests. Then the means of communication is also entitled to consideration. Regarding on the opposite wall there is exhibited a map showing rethe Flinders division in Victoria. It comprises several interests-dairying , agriculmining, and, I believe, timbergetting-bu t no particular interest has special representation. There is not one of interests in that division over which this Parliament has the slightest control. We have no control over mining or dairying or general agriculture or the timber industry. But will any elector in the division confor a moment, that, because his own is not represented in this Parliament, his interests are, therefore, negnew lected.?' The honourable member for Flinhe ders is not here at present, but I feel quite certain that nobody will accuse him, any more than he could accuse me, of neglectto represent any particular interest. Regarding, the Kennedy division, inQueensin land, in which the pastoral and mining industries predominate, the Commissioners. put forward the plea that community of terest should be considered. We have jurisdiction over the mining and pastoral industries in the division, and no one accuse its representative of neglecting those industries. We cannot possibly have all interests represented in this Parliament; and, if we had, it would resolve itself a series of sections and cliques. We would have here a representative of the mining dustry, a representative of the agricultural interest, and a representative ing interest-of ""course, all sitting on this side of the chamber. Therefore, there is no force in the argument that community of interest should be specially considered. Regarding means of communication and commercial interests, want to point out that the hinterland Cairns, which is contained in the Herbert electorate at present, but which it is posed to put in the Kennedy electorate, commercially united with Cairns. Commissioners have cut out the whole that hinterland, which is connected by way with Cairns, and has its commercial interests identified with Cairns. Why was no consideration given to the commously mercial interests? The Commissioners have given consideration to other interests over which we have no jurisdiction, but those interests over which we have some jurisdiction, they have paid no attention. Means of communication should also taken into consideration. It may be said that a candidate for Kennedy to pass through another electorate to get to portions of that which he was contesting. missioners Granted; but he would have to do that under the proposed redistribution, and the position often arises. For instance, the able member for Capricornia has to pass through my electorate to get to a portion of his own ; and the honourable member for Mernda to-night told us of a similar state of affairs in Victoria.",50
381,Mr CHANTER,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,That applies to the Riverina constituency.,51
382,Mr BAMFORD,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"I dare say it applies condemnation to dozens of electorates, so that that arguAffairs ment should have no weight whatever with honourable members. If this map had been coming. - the first issued I should have raised no objection. But when it is stance of a few people whom we know, it becomes another matter. We do not know what the objections were, or they were lodged; and I have reason think that some were lodged on the very 'day of proceedings, or immediately in the time had expired. I read in the press no that a deputation waited on Mr Gall twelve days after the period during which will objections might be takenhad elapsed. - However, the officer has denied the statement to the Chief Electoral Officer; and I accept his denial. The press does not into usually anticipate matters twelve days ahead, though it would appear to have done inso on this occasion.

I have not yet seen the report by the three Commissioners, but only had a glance at the report of the majority. I have seen a report by Mr Graham, published on the 3rd July, and a second report by the same gentleman, published on the 18th July. The Minister of Home Affairs has just handed me another report; but the difficulty is that other honourable members have not the advantage of a like courtesy.",51
388,Mr HIGGS,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"Capricornia) [8.41] - I do not feel very keenly about this matter, and only point out that there is a great deal of difficulty in the House reviewing the Commissioners' work. We have appointed three Commissioners, and we have .received their report; and surely, if any body is able to arrive at what ought to be a just redistribution, it is the Board of Commissioners.",52

396,Mr HIGGS,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"The first set of maps issued by the Commissioners in Queensland were sent to me, and were shown at several public places., I at once accepted their plan of redistribution, although it added some 60,000 square miles to my territory. I did not feel called upon to raise any objections, and I was very much surprised later on to find a fresh set of maps sent out. I looked up the Act and found that persons who had any objection to the plan of redistribution could notify that objection to the Commissioners. - people did so, and the Commissioners, as a result, issued a fresh set of maps, on which neither myself nor any one else had an opportunity to make any suggestions whatever. That seems to be an anomaly.",52

I am not particularly concerned in the matter, but I hope that if the House does send back this report to the Commissioners they will adhere to their original plan, which, as far as I know, gave satisfaction in the majority of cases.",52
401,Mr GROOM,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"Darling Downs) [8.46].. - I am sorry that I cannot support the proposal of the honourable member for Herbert to refer back this scheme of redistribution to the Commissioners, as I considei they are on a very fair and equitable basis. I feel, with the honourable member for Capricornia, that we should be endangering our position by doing so. Under the Representation Act, Queensland is entitled to an additional member. I fear that sending the report back will endanger that State getting its proper representation. Under the original Act we had but one Commissioner for this purpose. It was felt, however, that the power was too great to be left in the hands of one man, and that the result of so doing would probably be that matters would be continually referred back by Parliament to the Commissioner. In order, therefore, to obtain a judicial decision, and to insure that qualified persons should make a thorough investigation in which Parliament might have complete confidence, it was decided in 1909 to appoint three ComSome missioners, one of whom should be the Surveyor-General, of the State concerned, oran officer in his Department. ject was that there should be upon the Commission at least one person possessing a full and detailed knowledge of the country to be divided up. In this instance, the three Commissioners appointed were instructed to subdivide Queensland into ten divisions. Honourable members have only to look at the map of Queensland to see how the population is scattered about in that enormous area. There is an immense diversity of interests. I do not suppose that any State in Australia has such a diversity of natural products as Queensland, due to varieties of climate and of geographical conditions. The Commissioners had a difficult task to perform. It must be remembered that this process of subdivision, though done under the authority of Parliament, is not simply for the convenience of the Queensland representatives. It is done with the object of allowing Australia to be represented equitably and justly, according to the different interests concerned. this case the Commissioners went into their task thoroughly. As far as I know, they were three men in whom we were justified in having complete confidence. They were Mr A. A. Spowers, the Surveyor-General; Mr W. J. Gall, a State officer who has a very full knowledge of Queensland; and Mr Graham, whom I confess I do not know except that I understand he is in the Commonwealth Electoral Office.",52
402,Mr WEST,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"If the Commissioners made a mistake, the honourable member would not object to sending a report back to them ? Mr ""GROOM - No , of course not.",53
403,Mr RILEY,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,Why did the sioners go back from their original report ?,53
404,Mr GROOM,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"The report has to be examined to find a reason for that action. The Commissioners made their investigation, and posted their conclusions throughout Queensland. I do not quite agree with the honourable member for Capricornia as to the right of a member of Parliament to take objection. It seems to me that a member of Parliament has just as much right as any member of the public to enter his protest and give his reasons for so doing. - Mr ARCHIBALD - I should do so if I fit. .. . . .

405,Mr GROOM,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"I am not suggesting that a member of Parliament should take objection for partisan reasons, or that he should do anything wrong; but on broad grounds there is no objection to a member of Parliament voicing his protest like any other member of the public.

406,Mr WEST,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,If my little village were touched I should do so.,53
407,Mr GROOM,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"I am sure that the honourable member would not do anything that was not in the public interest. . His very presence here is probably in the public interest. These reports, as I have said, were In circulated throughout Queensland, and objections were filed in due course. The objections were noticed and fully considered by the Commissioners.",53
408,Mr CHANTER,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"What were the objections, and by whom were they made?",53
409,Mr GROOM,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"Objections were received, among others, from the citizens of Mackay and from the Farmers and Cane-growers' Association of Proserpine, in which it was urged that the sugar districts of Mackay, Bowen, and Proserpine should not be added to a pastoral and mining district such as Kennedy. It was also objected that the Commissioners had cut the sugar industry quite in half, leaving one-half in Herbert, and tacking Commis- the other on to the Kennedy electorate.",53
410,Mr BAMFORD,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,It would be impossible to have the whole sugar industry in one electorate.,53
411,Mr GROOM,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,The honourable member is quite right ; but the persons affected had a right to protest.,53
412,Mr BAMFORD,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,Hav e they suffered in their representation in this Parliament?,53
413,Mr GROOM,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"No ; on the contrary, the honourable member has been a most active exponent of their interests. The Commissioners reconsidered the matter in a judicial manner, and then decided upon the saw report and the plans which are now before us. They are signed by a majority of the Commissioners. Mr Graham, the minority Commissioner, originally concurred in the report of the majority with respect to the Herbert and Kennedy divisions, but in a report which he sent in then, he filed another report, which has been presented to us, and which has been distributed tb-day. In this document he goes back upon his previous position. He saysThere is no way of satisfactorily adjusting the incidence of the electoral population without, in a measure, disregarding the provisions of section. 16 (a), consequently it is proposed to transfer the Bowen and Mackay Subdivisions from Herbert to Kennedy. He wants to go back to the original proposal. This course is recommended after mature consideration, and with full recognition of the fact that a foreign interest will be introduced into Kennedy, and that portion of the sugar-growing interest will be detached from the cpastal D i v i sion of Herbert. Exhaustive examination was made of all other practical combinations without affording an adequate and satisfactory solution of the difficulty. The Commissioners very fully and fairly weighed and considered all the objections which were made, met some of them, and. put aside others. On the whole, they have made a very fair distribution. The question for us to determine now is, whether their scheme shall be accepted. The quota on which they worked was 31,3.88, and tliey have allotted the electors as follows :Division. Electors. Brisbane ... 33,934 ... Oxley 31.679 Moreton 32,750 . . . 1,362* Da-rling Downs 32,890: . . . 1,502* Maranoa 27,090 ... 4,2g8t Wide Bay 28,960 ... 2,428t Capricornia Kennedy Herbert 33,364 ... New Division 31,263 * Above quota. t Below Tliey have obeyed the instruction of the Act in endeavouring to make the electors in the various divisions, as far as possible, numerically equal, they have paid attention to the special features required, and, at the same time, have, given attention to the peculiar conditions of large electorates like Maranoa and Kennedy. If we try to improve on their scheme by moving part of a division to another, we shall put it all out of joint, because the adjustment of these difficulties' in a big State like Queensland is exoeedMr Groom. ingly complicated and awkward. If we send back the scheme to the Commissioners for reconsideration, the public will be unable to offer objections to any other proposal, because, under the law as amended last session, it will be returned direct to us for acceptance or rejection. The general intention of the Electoral Act is that this matter shall be decided, not by Parliament, but by independent Commissioners after a judicial investigation of all the circumstances, and I think that we cannot do other than accept their proposals. It should be referred back only in exceptional cases.",53
414,Mr SINCLAIR,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"Moreton) [9.0] - I cannot support the amendment. As the proposed distribution is so little out of joint, it would be a pity to endanger it by referring it back to the Commissioners, in whom, personally, and in whose knowledge of Queensland, I have the utmost confidence. They spent a lot of time on their work, and went to very great trouble in the endeavour to meet the requirements of the State. The objection of the honourable member for Herbert seems to be that the quota is not in accordance with the total enrolment. He appeared to lay little stress on the' importance of studying com-r munity of interest. The Commissioners report thatObjections were received from the citizens of Mackay and from the Farmers and Canegrowers' Association of Proserpine, in which it was urged that the sugar districts of Mackay, 2,546* Bowen,. and Proserpine should not be added to 2gr* a pastoral and mining district, such as Kennedy..

I25t with their scheme that it would be a pity to refer it back to them. I was surprised to hear 313.S88 from the honourable member for Herbert quota. that there was a report from Mr Allars. If that be so, honourable members should know what he said. As for the second report of Mr Graham, I have only just seen it. Perhaps there is reason for postponing this matter until we have had time to read Mr Graham's second report and Mr Allars' report, if he made one; but it cannot be said that the Commissioners have not tried to consider the interests of the sugar growers as well as the very important shipping interest. In making their distribution they have certainly endeavoured to have regard to community of interest. Question-That the report be referred oack to the Commissioners for further consideration-put .

Motion (by Mr KING O'MALLEY) proposed - That the House of Representatives approves of the distribution of the State of Western Australia into Electoral Divisions as proposed by Messrs. E. G. Stenberg-, H . F. Johnston, and - A. W. Piesse, the Commissioners for the purpose of distributing the said State into Divisions, in their report laid before Parliament on the 19th day of June, 1912, and that the Divisions referred to in the report and indicated on the map as A, B, C, D , and E, be named as follows :Division A ... ...

415,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,Parramatta) £9.13] - The Minister has not even informed the House whether or not the Government are in favour of this proposed - redistribution. Mr KING O'MALLEY - The Government are in favour of it.,55
416,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"Are we to have a repetition of die vote on the last division? Is this a put-up job on the part of 27 honourable members opposite? Are the Government merely to formally submit this 25 motion, and every one of their supporters to vote against it? Is this responsible Government ? AYES. Mr THOMAS - Does the honourable member remember the occasion when he voted against a scheme submitted by one of his own colleagues-the honourable member for Illawarra-whe n he held office as Minister of Home Affairs?",55
417,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,Did we ' do that?,55
418,Mr THOMAS,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,Of course you did.,55
419,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,I suppose that we gave reasons for our action. Mr KING O'MALLEY - The honourable member did not open his mouth. NOES. Mr. JOSEPH COOK - There is an absolute conspiracy of silence on the part of the Government and their supporters.,55
420,Mr SPEAKER,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,I ask the honourable member to discuss the question before the Chair.,55
421,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,I am entitled to ask the Government for a declaration of their intentions in regard to this proposed redistribution.,55
422,Mr KING OMALLEY,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,I have .moved its adoption.,55
423,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"Does the honourable member's duty end there? Is this responsible Government, or what is it? ",55
424,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,It is a farce.,55
425,Mr MAHON,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"Coolgardie) [9..15] - It would be very much better if matters affecting the representation of the people were dealt with apart from party politics. The House ought to be prepared to consider a proposal involving the future representation of the people in a non-partisan spirit. I regret very much that the vote given by the Opposition and the remarks of the honourable member for Parramatta appear to give the treatment of these matters a party colour, which ought to be avoided. The honourable member for Parramatta was very unfortunate in referring to the fact that Government supporters voted against the Government, because when the Government of which he was himself a member submitted proposals",55
426,Mr SPEAKER,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,Order ! The horU - orable member must not refer to that matMr MAiHON - On a previous occasion a somewhat similar incident occurred.,55
427,Mr SPEAKER,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,Order ! The honourable member is now discussing a matter which the House has already decided.,56
428,Mr MAHON,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,I am referring to it ' only by way of illustration of my argument in reply to the honourable member for Parramatta.,56
429,Mr SPEAKER,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"Order ! I ruled the honourable member for Parramatta out of order, and would not permit him to refer to the same matter.",56
430,Mr MAHON,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"Well , it is sufficient to say that the Government have not given this question a party complexion. They have brought down the reports of the Commissioners, and have left the House, their own supporters included, absolutely free to do what it believes to be best and right in the interests of the future representation of the people in this Chamber.",56
431,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,Does not the honourable member think that the Minister might express his own opinion when submitting a motion like this?,56
432,Mr MAHON,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"I am not here to judge the conduct of the Minister. have his own reasons for what he has said, and I do not care to inquire into them. I should like to direct the attention of honourable members to the imperfect nature of the map of the new divisions for Western Australia which is exhibited in the corridor. It is impossible for any one who has not intimate local knowledge to discover from that map, except by very close scrutiny, what the boundaries of the new divisions really are. That being so, I ask permission to display a map delimiting the new boundaries in a manner which honourable members will be easily able to perceive. A glance at this map will enable honourable members to grasp the. extraordinary nature of the division of electorates which has been made in Western Australia. .1 say that the division made is extraordinary without intending any reflection upon the impartiality or competency of the gentlemen concerned. But clear from their report that the Commissioners have misinterpreted the instructions contained in the Act. From the second paragraph of their report it is evident that the Commissioners did not realise the imperative nature of the mandate in section 16 of the Electoral Act. They ignore altogether the paramount considerations of community or diversity of interest, means of communication, and so on, and write as if they were free to do what they pleased so long as theykept within the margin of allowance provided for. But they were not free to do as they pleased. They were bound, before having resort to the margin of allowance, to give full and due consideration to the conditions which Parliament considered to be of paramount importance; that is to say, community or diversity of interest, means of communication, physical features, State boundaries, and so on. These, I say, were the primary considerations to which they should have given attention, because it is "" subject"" to these conditions that the quota becomes ""the basis for the distribution into divisions."" The law distinctly lays it down that the margin of allowance - from the quota is to be used only "" whenever necessary."" These words must be taken as restrictive as well as permissive, and they have a significance which the Commissioners for Western Australia appear to have overlooked. They mean that the quota may be varied only in the last extremity, because the underlying principle of our law is that, so far as He may practicable, the divisions shall be constituted of an equal number of electors. This is the predominant consideration which Parliament intended should influence the Commissioners in fashioning electorates. Every otherfactor is subsidiary to this. As a matter of fact, the margin of allowance was a legislative afterthought. It extends latitude to the Commissioners in dealing with exceptional and difficult situations, but it does not contemplate the licence of a general application, because a situation might often be found-and this is the true explanation of it-wher e contiguous districts have adverse interests, and the purpose of the margin of allowance was that those districts might be grouped with other communities having greater community of interest with them, even if in so doing a departure was made from the quota. But the Commissioners in this case have not attempted to group in one it is division all having a community of interest. For instance, they describe in paragraph 5 of their report a division as a "" Gold-fields Division,"" but they have excluded from that division one of the most important gold-fields of the State which lies contiguous to the division, and have excluded also another gold-field containing a great many miners, placing both in a district which may be said to be purely farming and pastoral.",56
433,Sir JOHN FORREST,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,To what districts does the honourable member refer?,57
434,Mr MAHON,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"I refer to the district of North Murchison, which has for its .centre Meekatharra, one of the biggest mining towns outside Kalgoorlie.",57
435,Sir JOHN FORREST,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,It is a district also.,57
436,Mr MAHON,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,To a very slight extent only. There is only a handful of pastoral leases in the Murchison district. The other gold-field to which I refer is the Pilbarra gold-field.,57
437,Sir JOHN IFORREST,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,They could help that.,57
438,Mr MAHON,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,Then they should not make the pretence that they have studied community of interest.,57
439,Sir JOHN FORREST,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,The member might take the same objection with regard to Forrest and Collie.,57
440,Mr MAHON,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"I do not altogether approve of Forrest and Collie being placed m "" C "" division.",57
441,Sir JOHN IFORREST,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,They could help it.,57
442,Mr MAHON,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"That is a matter of opinion, and I think they could help it . The Commissioners have in this matter utterly ignored community of interest, and have relied upon the margin of allowance alone. They have professed to comply with the Electoral Act, but, as i i matter of fact, have violated its spirit. They have not made this distribution of electorates on the existing enrolment as they were required by law to do, but have projected themselves into the future, and on statistics compiled at the end of 1911, they have distributed the divisions on what they assume will be the electoral condition in Western Australia in April or May, 1913. To show the House how loosely these gentlemen have gone about their work, I have only to read one or two extracts from their report. Making an explanation about the Perth, and Fremantle divisions, they sayCognisance should be taken of, and due weight given lo, available official returns bearing upon the tendency towards increase or decrease of electoral enrolment during the past few years within the proposed Divisions, whilst consideration would also have to be given to the probable effects of the present outlookWhat are the "" probable effects of the present outlook?"" Now, what does that mean? The phrase is certainly very obscurein order to insure that the actual enrolment in the proposed Divisions, at the time of the general election due next year, shall be as near to the then existing quota as it is possible to' provide so early in advance. That is an admission of the charge I have just made: that they have distributed the divisions, not on the existing enrolment, as pastoral they were required by law to do",57
443,Sir JOHN FORREST,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"Oh , yes; they have a certain margin.",57
444,Mr MAHON,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"If the right honourable member had listened, he would have heard me show that the margin of allowance is not to be used except where necessary, and not subject to due consideration having been given to those elements which Parliament regarded as paramount.",57
445,Sir JOHN FORREST,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"They have full discretion, I think. honourable Mr Mahon - I differ from the right honourable member.",57
446,Sir JOHN FORREST,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"Rea d the Act, then.",57
447,Mr MAHON,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"I have read it very caref u l l y. The Commissioners are bound by law to make the quota on the existing enrolnot ment, but here is a clear and plain"" admission that they have made the distribution on what they conjecture will be the enrolment eighteen months later. To show that I am not misinterpreting them, I refer honourable members to the following paragraph in their reportThe Commissioners are of opinion that their first and foremost duty is to submit such recommendations as will secure in each of the proposed Divisions the nearest approach to the quota of enrolment at the lime of the impending general elections in 1912. I am not aware of any general election in 1912. I suppose there will be one in 19/3, but that reference shows that it was a future quota, not a present one, which influenced the Commissioners. They assume that Parliament has given them power to peer into the future, and to distribute the divisions on a prophecy, or estimate, or conjecture. Then they sayThe Commissioners also consider themselves .justified in assuming that the provision contained in the Commonwealth Electoral Act for the creation of Divisions of equal electoral strength-o r as nearthereto as circumstances will admit-in dicates an underlying principle and a desire on the part of the Legislature of giving to all votes, as far as possible, an equal value, an object that, in the opinion of the Commissioners, can only be effectively achieved by securing to each Division at the time of an impending election ar. enrolment as near to the quota as is practicable. That clearly shows that the Commissioners have gone outside the functions delegated to them by Parliament, and have formed the divisions, not on the figures supplied to them by the Chief Electoral Officer of the Commonwealth, but on what they imagine will be the quota in 1913. They write about the desire of the Legislature to give all votes as far as possible an equal value. I cordially endorse that sentiment, but instead of giving each vote the same value throughout the divisions of Western Australia, they have placed in one division nearly 5.000 electors more than they place in each of the other four, and, in order to give that increase, they make this extraordinarily shaped division. They have included in it districts that have always been in communication with the port of Geraldton, and which have no communication or community of interest whatever, except common citizenship, with the distant region to which it is proposed to join them.",57
448,Sir JOHN FORREST,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,I think that is the milk in the cocoanut.,58
449,Mr MAHON,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"I believe it is, but that does not affect the question. I think the right honourable member will admit that, when he originally formed the division, he placed the Murchison country in with Geraidton - Sir JOHN FORREST - A very large one.",58
450,Sir JOHN FORREST,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,The numbers have changed since then. We had to do it.,58
451,Mr MAHON,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"That may be, but the numbers^ have not changed so fundamentally as to give to one division 5,000 electors more than each of the others, and, in order to do so, to make this extraordinary addition to a district which has always been connected with the port of Geraidton.",58
452,Sir JOHN FORREST,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,Kalgoorli e complaining.,58
453,Mr MAHON,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"But the Murchison people have complained, and are complaining. I do not know that Kalgoorlie should complain. Kalgoorlie will always have the biggest end of the stick. I should like to deal with the reasons why these gentlemen have put 5,000 more voters into one division than they have into the others.",58
454,Sir JOHN FORREST,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"I hope you will, deal with all the divisions, and not only with one. We should like to have your views on the others.",58
455,Mr MAHON,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"I am not aware that any serious objection is taken to the others, but if the right honourable gentleman has any objection to offer, I presume we shall hear from him later. I hope the House will insist as far as possible on having an equal number of electors in the divisions, because the fundamental idea of our government is one man one vote. That is the bedrock principle of parliamentary representation, and a necessary corollary to that is that, one vote shall have one value, that every unit of the community shall exercise the full power of every other unit in the election of a representative to Parliament. Whether this principle be right or wrong, at any rate, it has been fought for over many years, and. having triumphed it ought to be observed in the spirit as-well as in the letter. Whenever we fashion electorates unequal in the number of their constituents we sap this basic principle. We may extenuate it by arguments such as the honourable member for Bendigo used 'the other night, that u country electorate should have a smaller quota than a city one, because of the greater area and the difficulties which voters have in getting to the poll. But when all this is admitted the fact remains that we are departing from a. vital principle of democratic government if we sanction such a variation between two electorates as 5,000 votes. Now, the Commissioners say that Division "" D "" shows a decreasing enrolment. It has shown a slightly decreasing enrolment.",58
456,Mr MAHON,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,Not a very large one.,58
457,Sir JOHN FORREST,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,I will show you by-and-by.,58
458,Mr MAHON,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"Will t h right honourable e member deny that Division "" D "" contains the bulk of the auriferous area of Western Australia, that a new gold-field may be found there at any time, and that a new gold-field would within a few weeks is not attract thousands of adults to that spot?",58
459,Sir JOHN FORREST,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,Do you think that we must act on that principle?,58
460,Mr MAHON,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"It is quite as reasonable for me to estimate that a new gold-field will be found, and that the population will increase, as it is for the Commissioners to assume that the population will decrease. Furthermore, let me remind the right honourable gentleman that nine-tenths of the work of the transcontinental railway, so far as Western Australia is concerned, will be done in and around Kalgoorlie or within the Kalgoorlie division. That work will attract between 2,000 and 3,000 persons, including the workers and their families, and those who will cater for their wants, so that the probabilities are, not that Division "" D '* will decrease in enrolment, but that it will increase. I would like to point out also that, in the matter of community of interest nnd means of communication, the Commissioners absolutely ignored those primary and elementary considerations in fashioning these divisions. Suppose that a miner at Nannine wanted to go for any electoral purpose to the centre of the electorate of Kalgoorlie. He would have to travel a journey of 990 miles, or a total distance of 1,980 miles. The Commissioners themselves admit that there is no direct means of communication.",58
461,Sir JOHN FORREST,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,The distance cannot be 990 miles.,59
462,Mr MAHON,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,I will give the right honourable gentleman the figures. From Nannine to Geraidton the distance is 390 miles.,59
463,Sir JOHN FORREST,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"Oh , by that way ! That is not the direct route.",59
464,Mr MAHON,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,What is the direct route-acros s country such as the right honourable gentleman travelled on an exploring expedition ?,59
465,Sir JOHN FORREST,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,You mean the distance by rail.,59
466,Mr MAHON,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"The right honourable gentleman knows quite well that there is no population in a great part of the intervening country, and that a man would take his. life in his hands who travelled through tiiere in certain seasons of the year. shall give the distances.",59
467,Sir JOHN FORREST,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,I am quite content. I thought that you meant the distance by the direct route.,59
468,Mr MAHON,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"No , I said the distance by rail, and that is the only means which a man would have of going. He would have to travel a distance of. T.,980 miles.",59
469,Mr MATHEWS,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,You might as well put in the figures.,59
470,Mr MAHON,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"From Nannine to Geraidton the distance is 390 miles, from Geraidton to Perth 294 miles, and from Perth to Kalgoorlie 375 miles.",59
471,Sir JOHN FORREST,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,For what purpose would a man want to go there?,59
472,Mr MAHON,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,He might require to go there for an electoral purpose.,59
473,Sir JOHN FORREST,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,Is not Nannine the north division?,59
474,Mr MAHON,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"I am aware of that. I am speaking of a man at Nannine who is enrolled in Division "" D'.""",59
475,Sir JOHN FORREST,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,Is Nannine in that division?,59
476,Mr SPEAKER,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,Will the right honourable member for Swan cease these interjections ?,59
477,Sir JOHN FORREST,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"I am not interjecting, sir, but asking for information.",59
478,Mr MAHON,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"Yes ; Nannine is placed in "" D "" division. We have this Murchison country united to other country which has no community of interest, and which the Commissioners admit has no direct means of communication by rail. The Commissioners evidently felt that the inclusion of this territory, which has always been in the other electorate since Federation, required a good.deal of buttressing. They obviously felt that their action in this regard was extremely vulnerable, and therefore much of the report is devoted to an attempt to justify the inclusion of this territory with Kalgoorlie. The House will be amazed at the extraordinary statements which they make in the report under the head of community of interest. On page ro they sayThe Coromissioners full y appreciated the nature of the ""community of interest"" existing between the Murchison gold-fields and the coastal districts round GeraidtonI should think so, because from the earliest days these electorates, both under the State and under the Commonwealth, have been associated with the port of GeraidtonI and have given due consideration to these before including the Cue and Mt. Magnet Electoral Districts in the proposed Division "" D . "" If they had given due consideration to ""it I must say that, their reasons in support do not appear in this document. It has also been noted that no means of communication by rail exist between the Eastern and Murchison Gold-fields, and that presumably therefore, these arguments might be used in favouro f including the Murchison Gold-fields, with Division "" E ""These gentlemen are bound by law to give paramount consideration to means of communication, but here they actually admit that there is no means of communication by rai] between the districts they have linked together. principally on account of what may be alleged to be "" community of interest."" in The requirement of ' - community of interest ' ' also goes overboardThe Commissioners, however, are of the opinion that "" community of interest,"" when applied to a large industry like the gold-mining industry of Western Australia, would not be correctly interpreted if based upon geographical considerations only. "" Community of interest"" is not necessarily linked with geographical considerations, which is a matter to which the Commissioners were required to give separate consideration and weightWhilst admitting that the geographical position should be given all the consideration which is due to it There is no evidence in the report that the geographical position was given any considerationthe Commissioners hold the view that a much wider interpretation should be given to the term. Now we will see what the wide interpretation isThere are many interests of paramount importance to all gold-fields, such as the general trend of mining legislation governing the conduct of mining operations, the statutory regulation of labour on mines, the inspection of machinery, the railway rates for gold-fields' supplies, and other important items of consideration which the Commissioners claim should receive prior consideration to purely geographical points of advantage or disadvantage. In other words, they place their opinion before the mandate of Parliament. every single one"" of the questions they set out here to establish a community of interest is a question not under the jurisdiction of this Parliament, but entirely under the jurisdiction of the State Parliament. What do we mean when we place in our Electoral Act the requirement of community of interest? We mean, of course, that the people who are called upon to elect a member of this House shall have common interests allied to the work which they have in hand of returning a representative. Well, every one of the items which the Commissioners relied upon to show community of interest between this very remote region and Kalgoorlie is a question entirely outside the scope of this Parliament. It is clear from the admissions in the report that the Commissioners, valuable their work has otherwise been, have not, in the spirit of the law, carried out the duty which this House imposed on them. I contend that the words "" quota of electors,"" in section 16, clearly means electors actually enrolled when the quota was ascertained. cannot mean electors to be enrolled, as obviously no one can foretell the number existing at a future time. The Commissioners are, therefore, required by law to form the divisions from the existing rolls of electors; and this they have not done. What they have done is to anticipate from statistics compiled in 1911 what the total Mr Mahon. enrolment will be in April, 1913, and define the new devisions in accordance with the anticipated enrolment. The . Commissioners were entitled to adopt a one-fifth margin of allowance to be used "" whenever necessary,"" but this was contingent on their giving due consideration to requirements which Parliament regarded as paramount, namely, "" community or diversity of in terest,"" ""means of communication,"" and so forth. The onus, therefore, lies on the Commissioners to show - first, that due weight was given to the above statutory requirements; and, second, that it was ""necessary"" to adopt such ""margin of allowance"" as gives one division nearly 5,000 more votes than any of the other four divisions.",59
479,Sir JOHN FORREST,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"It is not 5,000?",60
480,Mr MAHON,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"Ver y nearly; the exact number is 4,792.",60
481,Sir JOHN FORREST,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,That is not above the quota.,60
482,Mr MAHON,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"That does not affect the' Now, matter; there are 4,792 more votes in one division than in others, and I say that that is not according to the spirit of the law, which provides for equal electorates. They attempt no justification for forming divisions in anticipation of future enrolment, contenting themselves with the vague statement that "" consideration would also have to be given to the probable effects of the present outlook,"" ami "" that the shortage of the quota would be more than made up by increasing enrolment between December, 1911, and next year's Federal election.""' Again, in paragraph 33, they state that they ""consider themselves justified in as-' suming "" the intention of Parliament, and so forth. In forming divisions on "" assump-. tions "" and on "" anticipations"" of estimates of future enrolment, their intention however may be excellent, but their action is outside their authority. In paragraph 23 the Commissioners admit that they have disregarded the statutory requirement in respect of "" means of communication"" between Cue, and Mount Magnet district, and K a l -, goorlie. They also appear to have ignored' They the mandate to preserve "" community of interest,"" although their reasoning as to this is somewhat unintelligible. I shall not dwell further on that point, but merely deal with the point of the excess number of electors placed in one division. The grounds on which "" D "" division is given nearly 5,000 excess electors are entirely speculative. No one can attempt. to forecast with accuracy the movements of population, especially in a mining country like Western Australia. Division "" D "" includes vast auriferous areas, in which a rich discovery of gold may at any time occur. In the past such a discovery has drawn to a new field from 3,000 to 4,000 adults within a month. Division "" D "" also embraces about five-sixths of the Western Australian area, through which the transcontinental railway will pass. This work calls for an army of men, who, with their dependents and those who cater for their wants, may add from 2,000 to 3,000 voters to the "" D "" division roll. If estimates are to be considered at all, then it is more reasonable to expect that by election time "" D "" division will have some 40,000 voters-abou t 11,000 in excess of any other division-tha n that its electoral strength will relatively decline. I do not think I need detain the House any further on that point, but I should like to recur to the question of the legality of the action of the Commissioners in distributing the electorates, not on a quota of the enrolled electors, but on what they assume will be the quota some months hence.",60
483,Sir JOHN FORREST,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,I do not think they have done that.,61
484,Mr MAHON,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"They have distributed the divisions on what they assume the quota will be eighteen months hence. This matter has been submitted for the consideration of an eminent barrister whose opinion the Commonwealth Government continually take on constitutional questions. I allude to Mr Frank Duffy, K . C , who had before him the Commissioners' report, and all the documents necessary to form an opinion; and the following are the questions submitted to him, and his answers to the same1. Have the Commissioners acted illegally their scheme of distribution so far as the State of Western Australia is concerned?-Yes . 2. Does the report of the Commissioners show that they have acted beyond the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1902-1911?Yes. 3. Have the Commissioners acted illegally in ignoring this?-Yes .",61

486,Mr MAHON,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"Mr Frank Gavan Duffy, K . C , one of the leaders of the Victorian Bar, and a counsel employed in nearly all big cases by the Federal Government - ther e should be equal electorates.",61
487,Sir JOHN FORREST,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,I am very glad to know that. [42],61
488,Mr MAHON,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"Hi s opinion is that the Commissioners have exceeded their powers. The fourth question wasIn what respect have the Commissioners acted illegally, and in what respect is the report illegal and without jurisdiction? In departing from the prescribed ""quota "" on the hypothesis of a change expected to take place in the number of electors in the various districts by the time of the next general election. Mr Duffy adds that, in his opinion, Parliament should be asked to invalidate the proposed distribution and should send it back to the Commissioners for them to make a fresh one. In conclusion, I repeat that I cast no reflection upon the Commissioners.",61
489,Sir JOHN FORREST,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"The honourable member has been doing so all the while, though.",61
490,Mr MAHON,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"That is a very ungenerous inference. I have criticised the work of the Commissioners very freely, but I do not think that I have impugned their motives or intentions. I cast no reflection upon them in any way. Nor do I think that the House, by returning this plan of distribution to the Commissioners, will be casting any reflection upon them. They are fallible human beings, liable to err, as we all are; and I presume that the most that can be said is that they have committed an error of judgment in this case. I confidently appeal to the House, on the grounds I have mentioned, not to sanction the scheme. If we were to establish a precedent, and to allow the (Commissioners in Western Australia to distribute the electorates according to what they expect will be the conditions existing eighteen months in advance, there is no reason in the world why other Commissioners should not distribute divisions according to what they think will be the conin ditions four or five years in advance.",61
491,Sir JOHN FORREST,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,They do not exceed the maximum in any case.,61
492,Mr MAHON,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"I have dealt very fully with that point, and established my case. The right honourable member will have some difficulty in rebutting the arguments used. I think that a mere error of judgment has been committed, and that it will be no reflection upon the Commissioners to return the scheme to them, with an intimation that the House considers that, as far as practicable - and it is eminently workable in this case The State of Western Australia should be cut up into five equal divisions, and this House should intimate that it does not sanction the action of the Commissioners in speculating as to what the enrolment will be in the future; but that they should confine themselves to the strict letter of the law, and make their distribution on the existing enrolment of electors. Mr SPEAK.ER --Do I understand that the honourable member moves an amendment ?",61
493,Mr MAHON,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,No . sir; I Chink it will be sufficient to vote for the rejection of scheme.,62
494,Sir JOHN FORREST,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"Swan) [9.59] The honourable member for Coolgardie has fought his case pretty hard, but I should like to point out to him that he has not dealt with the 'distribution of electorates generally, but only with the electorate which he represents. We must take what he says cum gram salis, inasmuch as he has not taken the least notice of the boundaries of any other electorate than his own. I should like to point out, also, that I do not know what procedure would be adopted if this scheme is sent back to the Commissioners, because, to my own knowledge, one of the Commissioners is away in Europe. I do not think it would be proper or legal to appoint a new Commissioner. Probably those who remain in the State would have to decide the matter. It appears to me that you cannot bring a fresh Judge into a cause, and ask him to decide upon an issue that has been half tried. own knowledge, Mr Stenberg, one of the Commissioners, is not in Western Australia' at present. I think he ought to have been asked to stay until this matter was dealt with. Unfortunately, the procedure that is being adopted today is not unknown to tiiis House. We have had the same sort of thing previously.",62
495,Mr MATHEWS,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"In the last Parliament, for instance.",62
496,Sir JOHN FORREST,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"Yes , I very much regret that the habit seems to be to refuse approval to electoral schemes submitted by the Commissioners.",62
497,Mr ROBERTS,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,The right honourable member commenced the habit two years ago.,62
498,Sir JOHN FORREST,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"I do not take all the responsibility for that. Moreover, we have three Commissioners now, whereas we had only one previously. .That is an important difference. If this scheme is returned to the Commissioners for Western Australia, and they take some time to reconsider their position-as they must dothe chances are that the old arrangement will prevail at the next election. For my own part-lookin g at the matter from a selfish point of view-the existing arrangement suits me. But the present procedure shows, I think, how unsuitable is the plan of returning these electoral schemes to Parliament for a final decision. I am sure that no one will think that I wish to cast a reflection upon any honourable the member, but it must be evident that very few of us- I might almost say none- are competent to express an opinion about the subdivision of any other State than our own. I have perhaps had more experience than most honourable members in the matter of arranging electorates, and being a professional man myself, may be expected to know something about work of this kind. But I confess that I have not taken the trouble to gain any personal knowledge about what are suitable arrangements for Queensland or even Victoria. But I am asked here to give my vote as to whether arrangements proposed by expert Commissioners appointed by the Crown for other States than my own are good, and should be adopted or rejected. I am competent to give an opinion upon the work done in Western Australia, because I have an intimate knowledge of the subject. That illustrates how unsuitable a tribunal this House is for settling such a To my matter. I hope that the Government will take the subject into their consideration so that we may adopt a better system, in future. Whatever is done should be final, and such schemes should not be referred to this House, in which three-fourths of the members know nothing about the subject upon which they are called upon to vote. The present Prime Minister, on die 23rd November, 1909-whe n sitting in Opposition - expressed a very sound, opinion which we might very well follow.",62

500,Sir JOHN FORREST,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,I am supporting the Government this time. The Minister of Trade and Customs seems to wish to drive me on to the other side.,62

502,Sir JOHN FORREST,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"I did not take the action to which the honourable gentleman refers from, motives of self-interest, because the arrangement against which I voted suited me personally.",62

504,Sir JOHN FORREST,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"The arrangement I voted against was a bad one, although it suited me personally. No one who knows anything about Western Australia would say that it was a good one. The Prime Minister, speaking on the 23rd November, 1909, saidAn attempt to manipulate electorates take the work of electoral redistribution the hands of a responsible officer appointed for the purpose, is about the nearest possible approach to political corruption.

Lest it may be thought that, because I support the present arrangement, it is a good one from the point of view of my party, let me say that it is not so. For instance, you pay regard to the voting in October last, it is not certain that our party be successful in the Perth electorate, or in the Fremantle electorate.

517,Mr SPEAKER,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,The right honourable member is now going beyond the motion.,63
518,Sir JOHN FORREST,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"Then I shall merely add that I am not actuated by personal interests when I say that the Commissioners have done well. The arguments they use are difficult to gainsay, and they are men of good repute ancl of high standing. I have known him all my life.

521,Mr MAHON,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,Ye t the right honourable member voted against his scheme.,64
522,Sir JOHN FORREST,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,I was careful to say that I considered him to be a man of the highest integrity.,64
523,Mr MAHON,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,Ye t the right honourable member voted against his scheme.,64
524,Sir JOHN FORREST,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,Because I thought he had committed an error of judgment.,64
525,Mr MAHON,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,That is all we say occurred in this case.,64
526,Sir JOHN FORREST,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"But this scheme is submitted by three Commissioners, and "" in a multitude of counsellors there is safety."" Although an interjection that I made might, possibly, have conveyed a suggestion to the contrary, I believe that the honourable member for Coolgardie considers that the Commissioners in this case are men of unblemished and unassailable character. No doubt they are. I desire now to point out that the number of electors on.the rolls for the Murchison gold-fields has greatly diminished during the last two and a half years. The number of electors in Cue has diminished by 1,660; in Lenora-whic h is not in the Murchison gold-fields, but is now included in the electorate of Kalgoorlie-the number has diminished by 1,018; in Mount Magnet, by 1,347; in Menzies, by 1,211; and in Mount Margaret, by 1,123. Thus, in those five districts, which are now in the electorate of Coolgardie, but, under this scheme, will be transferred to the electorate of Kalgoorlie, there has been, during the last two and a half years, a diminution of 6)359 i'i the number of electors on the roll. Then, again, the electorate of Kalgoorlie has now only 20,255 voters, or 10,136 below the quota; and Coolgardie has only 24,177, or 6,214 below the quota. During the same two and a half years' period the adjoining agricultural and pastoral district of Swan, liowever, has made an increase of 7,921 electors. It now comprises 48,997 electors, or no less than 18,606 above the quota. It is therefore clear, I think, that it would not be justifiable to give the electorate of Dampier, as it is now to be called, a number of electors above the quota, and to have the number of electors in a district that is diminishing, below the quota. It is curious that the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, who, under this scheme, will have in his electorate 3,640 voters above the quota, is not complaining of this increase. M i. MAHON - If the right honourable member had a potential majority of 14,000 he would not complain.",64
527,Sir JOHN FORREST,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"That is immaterial. Three thousand six hundred and forty miners in Cue and Mount Magnet will now be within the electorate of Kalgoorlie, and we find that the honourable member who represents that electorate, instead of complaining, is supporting the new arrangement. The honourable member for Coolhas gardie, on the other hand, evidently wishes to nullify the agricultural and pastoral votes in the proposed new electorate of Dampier by adding the miners' votes of Mount Magnet and Cue to the number. He wishes to mix mining votes with agricultural and pastoral votes, thus destroying the principle of ""community of interests.""",64
528,Mr MAHON,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,Are not the miners' votes already mixed with agricultural votes?,64
529,Sir JOHN FORREST,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"The honourable member knows that miners and agriculturists do not generally share the same political opinions.

531,Mr MAHON,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"Coolgardie) [10.22] - I wish to make a personal explanation. The right honourable member for Swan made the statement a few minutes ago that I had addressed to honourable members of the Opposition a letter asking support of my action against the adoption of the report of the Commissioners appointed to distribute the State of Western Australia into Federal electorates. That statement is ab-solutely incorrect. As honourable members are necessarily unacquainted with local conditions in Western Australia, and with the tlaw points involved in the action of the Commissioners, what I did was to prepare a letter, which I addressed to certain honourable members, setting forth the actual facts. I did not ask that they should vote either in one direction or the other.",64
532,Sir JOHN FORREST,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,Why did I not ceive a copy of that letter?,65
533,Mr MAHON,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"The right honourable member may receive one in due course. Possibly the letters were not all posted simultaneously. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON (Lang) {10.24] - When the House met this afternoon, I asked the Treasurer a question in reference to a regulation that has been embodied in the notices to those doing business with the Commonwealth Bank. This regulation warns depositors that the bank will not be responsible for any fraudulent withdrawal of money, and I asked the Treasurer whether such a regulation was not in defiance of the will of the Parliament as expressed in the refusal of both Houses to agree to the insertion of such a provision in the Commonwealth Bank Bill. The Treasurer replied in the negative. He further used words to the effect that I was not quite correct in my statement of what occurred, and that the question was never tested. I wish to direct attention to the fact that this clause was in the. original Bill, and that the effect of it is identical with the clause now embodied in the regulations of the bank, which the Treasurer said was not so. This is the clause to which I referWhere a person fraudulently represents himself to be a depositor and presents the depositor's pass-book, and complies with the rules of the bank, and thereby obtains any money belonging to the depositor deposited with the bank by way of Savings Bank deposit, the bank shall not be responsible for the loss sustained. That was in the Bill when it was sent up to the Senate. The Senate sent the Bill back with an amendment omitting that clause. When the Senate's amendment came before the House, the Treasurer moved That the amendment be disagreed to."" The record of this will be found at page 4530 of for the 15th December, 1911. Then, on the 19th December, after several honourable members on both sides had pointed out the iniquity of this provision, and how unjust it was to depositors that the Commonwealth should shirk its responsibility, the Treasurer receded from his former attitude and asked the leave of the House to withdraw his motion. It was only on the leave of the House to withdraw the motion being granted that the right honourable gentleman moved that the Senate's amendment omitting the clause should be agreed to. It will, therefore, be seen that, in his answers to my questions this afternoon, the right rehonorable gentleman was absolutely misleading. Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin-Min ister of Home Affairs) [10.27] - All the letters I received from Mr Deane I laid on the table of the House.

534,Sir JOHN FORREST,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,"I have had no communication with them. Mr KING O'MALLEY - The strangest thing of all is that private and confidential letters should come to the knowledge of honourable members opposite. I should like to know whether such a thing ever happened to them in their lives. For days before there were tit-bits going around the House that we were about to get something. The right honourable member for Swan also launched a question about the Chief Electoral Officer. I am going to look into this thing. The time may have arrived when, if these officers intend to be on the other side, it may be necessary that they should join the other side.",65
535,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ENGINEERS FOR KALGOORLI E TO PORT,What does all this mean? Mr KING O'MALLEY - It means that honourable members opposite are not playing the game.,65

Mr KING O'MALLEY - Does the honourable gentleman know it?",66

Service of this country, and have been loyal to every Minister. That is the complaint I have to make against the honourable gentleman. If he has been made the victim, of any tricks of this kind in his Department, I sympathize with him to that extent. Above all else, officers should be loyal to their Minister. That is their first duty;, but the honourable gentleman ought not to impugn their loyalty without the strongest possible grounds.",66
