1,Dr LIDDELL,Unknown,"Is it the intention of the Minister of Home Affairs to close the polling booth at Brookfield, New South Wales? If so, I ask him to reconsider the matter, seeing that the closing of the booth would be a gross injustice, as it would cause great inconvenience to a large number of electors.",11
2,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"If the honourable member will repeat the question tomorrow, I shall be able to furnish him with the necessary information. I cannot answer it now, since I was unaware that such a question would be asked. SUGAR INDUSTRY . EMPLOYMENT : ROVAL COMMISSION.",11
3,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"Some time ago. when there was a good deal of trouble in finding employment for men in Melbourne, I suggested to the then Minister of Trade and Customs that his officers in northern Queensland should at the end of every crushing season, prepare a report, which would ultimately be available to members, showing what labour had been obtainable, whether there was any stand-over cane, and, if so, why, and other particulars connected with the labour' question. I ask the present Minister if such reports have been furnished to him, and, if so, whether he will make them available to honourable members?",11
4,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The Queensland inspectors of cane furnish monthly reports, available to members and to the press; but hitherto the press has taken little notice of them.",11
5,Mr ARCHER,Unknown,"In view of the. fact that the coming recess will be the only opportunity before the next election of inquiring into the sugar industry, if it. is desired to do so, will the Prime Minister state whether it is the intention of the Government to appoint a Royal .Commission, or any other body to inquire into all the circumstances surrounding the industry and the various interests affected by it? If such is the intention of the. Government, will the Prime Minister subscribe to the view that that body should be composed principally of experts with special knowledge of the industry, and its surroundings, and not entirely of politicians?",11
6,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Whil e not desiring to give at this stage a definite and distinct reply, I see no necessity for a Royal Commission in regard to the sugar industry - at present. Any Commission, if appointed, would have to be of such a nature as would give entire satisfaction, not only to Queensland, but to the people of the whole of the Commonwealth. PRINTIN G COMMITTEE. Report (No. 4) presented by Mr ED WARDS, read by the Clerk, and adopted. FEDERALCAPITALSIT E.",11
7,Mr HALL,Unknown,"The Seat of Government (Yass-Canberra) Bill, having now passed through both Houses, will the Prime Minister indicate what steps are to be taken to expedite the final settlement of the tal site question?",11
8,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The first thing to be done is to discover a suitable site foi. a city in the area which has been selected. My view is that when a site-ther e may be more than one-ha s been recommended, members of the Parliament should be given an opportunity to make at least one visit to it, before being asked whether they will ratify the selection. But whilst all expedition will be used, we must not be too fidgety. Due care and caution must be observed, to insure the selection of the site available. Negotiations with the Government of New South Wales will be commenced as soon as the Bill becomes an Act.",12
9,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"As ho further legislative step in the matter can be taken until next session^ I ask the Prime Minister whether during the recess he will ascertain from competent authorities how longit would take to erect the buildings necessary to enable Federal affairs to.be transacted in the permanent Seat of Government, also as to the cost of their erection, so that he may give the information to Parliament on its re-assembling. Some years ago the New South Wales Government Architect obtained plans of all the leading Parliament Houses in the world, and prepared rough' estimates of the time which would be needed to build the internal portion of a suitable edifice, ing the decorative part to be finished later. Will the Prime Minister during the recess have the matter inquired into, so that the information may be available at. the beginning of next session?",12
10,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Expert s will be employed by the Government to"" discover the most suitable site in the area which has been chosen, and to obtain such information as may be necessary to enable Parliament to deal with the matter. I hold that there is a misconception as to the probable cost pf commencing the Federal Capital. Personally, I should like to see Spartan simplicity observed. We should build, as cathedrals are built, commencing with sihall structures, to be added to as our necessities demand, until we have completed buildings which will be a credit to the Commonwealth. Mr J, H . CATTS - I understand that the Minister of. Home Affairs has already taken preliminary steps in this matter. I ask him if, during the recess, he .will make a strong effort to have the survey of the Capiarea completed, so that, on the reassembling of Parliament, we may be able to go ahead with the preliminary arrange-, ments for building the Federal city. Has the honourable gentleman made arrangements for getting surveyors? Can he give us a' general idea as to what steps have been taken ?",12
11,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"Before answering the honourable member's question it appears necessary to mention that all questions relating to the Federal Capital come within the purview of the Department of Home best Affairs, and arc to be addressed to the Minister administering that Department. Replying to the honourable member for Cook, I mav say that even before the Capital Site Bill had passed, negotiations were passing with the New South Wales Government as to surveying the territory. Wo have alreadv had an offer of expert assistance from that Government, and I am hopeful that we shall obtain the services of the officers who have been engaged on similar work elsewhere. No time will be lost in doing everything that may be necessary.",12
12,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Minister of Home Affairs, as he has invited questions on the subject, whether, in the preparation of next year's Estimates, during the recess, he will cause a sura to leavbe put down for the establishment of the Federal-city. If he does that, it will be evidence of the earnestness of the Government in this matter.",12
13,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"When the necessity for expending money arises, the Government will be prepared to carry out whatever obligations may arise.",12
14,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"I ask the Prime Minister if he will at once enter, into negotiations with the Government of New South Wales as to the area which it is ready to concede, and other matters connected with the Federal Capital site question, so that, when Parliament re-assembles, we shall be able to take action towards establishing the Seat of Government as soon as possible.",12
15,Mr FISHER,Unknown,I think I answered that . question when I said that negotiations wiTT be opened up with the Government of New South Wales as soon as the Bill has become an Act. FINANCI AL RELATIONS : COMMONWEAL TH AND STATES.,12
16,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,"As the Premiers of the States meet in conference during the recess to discuss the financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States, will the Prime Minister inform the House as to the proposals of the Government for the re-adjustment of financial matters.",13
17,Mr FISHER,Unknown,I have always been favourable to a discussion of the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States; but this is not a fitting time for it . The general financial policy of the Government will be submitted early next session. 1 do not think anything can be gained by discussing the question until the Premiers have met and considered it in the light of their needs. CADETENCAMPMENT S.,13
18,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,Is the Minister yet in a position to answer the question respecting cadet encampments which I asked a few davs ago?,13
19,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"The honourable member asked wliether the cadets attached to the Sydney public schools are to be taken into camp during the Christmas holidays, ancl charged £ 1 5s. each. The following telegram on the subject has been received from the New South Wales Military"" Commandant :No foundation for statement. All camp expenses military cadets defrayed from cadet vote.

Ordered to be printed. POSTAL VOTING .",13
20,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"Has the attention of the Prime Minister been directed to the report in this morning's newspapers of the disclosure in Queensland of what appears to be serious corruption and malpractice under the operation of the postal voting system? If so, what steps does he propose to take to prevent such occurrences in Commonwealth elections?",13
21,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I have personal, as welt as other, knowledge of the unsatisfactory manner in which postal voting is conducted 1 in Queensland. The law has been amended! in that State, and when a Bill to amend our Electoral Act is introduced, the matter will have to be dealt with very carefully. PAPUA: DELIMITATION OF BOUNDARY.",13
22,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,"H as it come officially under the notice of the Minister of External Affairs that the German Government has appointed a Commissioner to deal with the delimitation of the boundary between British and German New Guinea ? If it has, can the Minister state when the work is to be begun, and whether Australia will be charged with any part of the expense incurred by the joint Commission ? Has the Government been conPAPERS. sulted in the matter?",13
23,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"The Government has not been consulted with regard to the appointment of the German officer. That, of course, was done by the German Government. Information as to the appointment was forwarded officially to this Government, with an intimation that the officer mentioned had set out for New Guinea.",13
24,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The-Commissioner s have wide, general powers to decide the details themselves.",13
25,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"That is so. This Government recommended the appointment of Mr Sabine, the Surveyor at 'New Guinea, and his appointment has been approved of. His instructions are wide, but whatever proposals are made by the joint Commission have to be submitted to the Imperial and German Governments before they are finally decided upon. The work is the delimitation of the boundary of part of a Commonwealth territory, and! we pay the cost. DEFENCE DEPARTMENT. NA - BRENNA N TORPEDO.",13
26,Mr KELLY,FIELD ARTILLERY AMMUNITION WAGGONS,"I wish to ask the Minister representing the Minister of Defence a question with reference to the statements made by him in this Chamber recently as to the want of ammunition waggons for the field artillery. Was that shortage brought uncier the notice of the ex-Minister of Defence by the experts of the Department, ancl if so, will he submit the reports of those experts to honourable members at the earliest opportunity?",14
27,Mr HUTCHISON,FIELD ARTILLERY AMMUNITION WAGGONS,"I cannot say whether the experts drew the attention of the ex-Minister of Defence to the fact. I have no doubt that they did so. At any rate, the whole of the facts are in possession of the present Minister, who will be in a position to submit to honourable members A statement on the subject later on.",14
28,Mr DEAKIN,FIELD ARTILLERY AMMUNITION WAGGONS,"H as the Honorary Minister acquainted himself with the statement made by the Minister of Defence in the Senate on this subject, in which the .Minister is reported to have denied that there was any deficiency in the supply of artillery ammunition waggons, stating that they were either completed or now in hand and would be delivered in due course?",14
29,Mr HUTCHISON,FIELD ARTILLERY AMMUNITION WAGGONS,"Ammunitio n waggons have been supplied for some of the arms of the force, but they are certainly not suitable for active service field work.",14
30,Mr DEAKIN,FIELD ARTILLERY AMMUNITION WAGGONS,That is not what the Minister of Defence said.,14
31,Mr KELLY,FIELD ARTILLERY AMMUNITION WAGGONS,"I think the honourable member for Ballarat had in his mind limbers and not ammunition waggons. Can the Honorary Minister state how many ammunition waggons for field artillery for first line transport, which are essential to keep quick-firing artillery in action, are at present in existence in Australia? Three field artillery brigades and one howitzer brigade in the English service require 186 ammunition waggons, and I wish to ascertain for purposes of comparison how manv waggons of this tvpe we have.",14
32,Mr HUTCHISON,FIELD ARTILLERY AMMUNITION WAGGONS,Will the honour and able member give notice of the question?,14
33,Dr MALONEY,FIELD ARTILLERY AMMUNITION WAGGONS,"In regard to the Brennan torpedo, the patent rights in which were acquired by the British Government at a cost of over ,£100,000, I desire to ask the Minister representing the Minister of Defence to make inquiries with a view of ascertaining whether the right which the Victorian Department of Defence obtained from Mr Brennan, in consideration b f £ 1 , 0 0 0 advanced for experiments, to use that torpedo was transferred to the Commonwealth when the service was taken over, and if in that way the Commonwealth Government has acquired the right to use it in the defence of our shores.",14
34,Mr HUTCHISON,FIELD ARTILLERY AMMUNITION WAGGONS,I shall make the necessary inquiries. BRENNANMONO - RAI L.,14
35,Mr TILLEYBROWN,FIELD ARTILLERY AMMUNITION WAGGONS,"I wish to ask the Minister of External Affairs if there is any truth in the press reports that the Government contemplate buying Mr Brennan's mono-rail invention? If the Government have any such intention, will they give the House an opportunity of dealing with the matter before negotiations are completed? Personally, I do not like the proposal.",14
36,Mr BATCHELOR,FIELD ARTILLERY AMMUNITION WAGGONS,The Government will not commit the Commonwealth to any serious expenditure in this matter without giving the House an opportunity of considering it.,14
37,Mr BAMFORD,FIELD ARTILLERY AMMUNITION WAGGONS,"As the matter is of considerable importance to the States equally with the Commonwealth, will the Minister enter into negotiations with the States-to obtain their co-operation in giving the invention a trial between now and the opening of next session ?",14
38,Mr BATCHELOR,FIELD ARTILLERY AMMUNITION WAGGONS,"If the States are disposed to take the matter up-and , of course, it is primarily a railway questionthe Commonwealth will be glad tp cooperate with them, but no proposals have yet been made by any of the States in that direction. If any are made the Commonwealth will be prepared to meet them.",14
39,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,FIELD ARTILLERY AMMUNITION WAGGONS,"^-Is it not a fact that the mono-rail is as yet only in the experimental stage, and that the money which is desired is for further experiments in the hope of perfecting it? Will the Minister bear that in mind in considering any proposals regarding the matter?",14
40,Mr BATCHELOR,FIELD ARTILLERY AMMUNITION WAGGONS,"The question is at present entirely in the experimental stage, the point which the Government have to consider is whether they should enter into what is more or less of a speculation. The possibilities of the invention in the event of its being successful are so vast that it would be a very good thing for the Commonwealth to have some direct interest in it, but at present, as the honourable member rightly observes, it is entirely expertmental, and'the Government are bearing that fact in mind in considering the whole matter. ELECTOR AL ROLLS.",14
41,Mr JOHN THOMSON,FIELD ARTILLERY AMMUNITION WAGGONS,Can the .Minister of Home Affairs now supply the information which I asked for yesterday with reference to the preparation of the new electoral rolls?,15
42,Mr MAHON,FIELD ARTILLERY AMMUNITION WAGGONS,"The information required by the honourable member is as follows :New rolls for the States of New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, and Tasmania are now being printed, and it is anticipated that the work will be completed in the whole of these States in about eight weeks. With regard to Western Australia, rolls have been compiled and negotiations are almost complete as to printing, which may occupy from six to eight weeks if the work is carried out locally as desired. The preparation of new rolls for the State of South Australia has been deferred until the State Parliament has disposed of the amending Electoral Bill now before it, when it is hoped that the Commonwealth and the State will be able to co-operate in the preparation of a new set of rolls. SECRET DRUGS, CURES AND FOODS : MR. BEALE'S REPORT . Dr CARTY SALM.ON - Will"" the Prime Minister state what the position is in regard to the issue of the report of the Royal Commission on Secret Drugs? Are copies .to be supplied to those who desire to have them, and upon what terms?",15
43,Mr FISHER,FIELD ARTILLERY AMMUNITION WAGGONS,"I purpose following the same rule as was followed by my predecessor, who decided that copies could be had on application. I suppose the price will be the cost price. I do not think it is advisable to distribute the report in the - ordinary way. ADELAID E CUSTOMS CASES. Mr - WATSON - Will the Minister of Trade and 'Customs state whether he has yet laid upon the table of the Library the papers in connection with the case of Harris, Scarfe, ancl Company, Adelaide?",15
44,Mr TUDOR,FIELD ARTILLERY AMMUNITION WAGGONS,The papers have already been laid upon the table of the Library. NA DEPARTMENT. RETURNS FOR 1906-MARKE D NEWSPAPERS - NE W SOUTH WALE S TELEPHONE SERVICE-SYDNE Y LETTER DELIVERIES .,15
45,Mr STORRER,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"Will the Postmaster General state why no figures are given in reference to the capitals of the States in the returns for 1906 in connection with post and telegraph offices? If that information is being prepared, when is it likely to be issued ?",15
46,Mr THOMAS,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,I understand that the reason why what the honourable member refers to has occurred is that the States were told to make out their statements on lines similar to those followed before Federation. I think that next year returns will be given of the revenue and expenditure for the General Post Offices of the various capitals.,15
47,Dr MALONEY,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"In view of the fact that everv member of Parliament,.and most citizens, receive newspapers marked with pencil, the markings serving to draw attention to the particular printed matter which it is desired to bring under notice, will the Postmaster-General consider the advisability of altering the present system of the Department of dealing with such marked newspapers so that people who innocently send or receive them may not be penalized ?",15
48,Mr THOMAS,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"I shall make inquiries, and if it is only a matter of regulation, and does not in any wav affect the carrying of newspapers through the post as newspapers, I will have the restriction removed.",15
49,Mr HENRY WILLIS,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,H as the Postmaster-General any funds available for the extension of the telephone service in New South Wales during the ensuing year?,15
50,Mr THOMAS,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,I am afraid that at present I have not.,15
51,Mr FULLER,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"I should like to ask the Postmaster-General whether we are to understand from the statement he has just made that all the new telephone services in New South Wales for which provision has been made, and which in some cases the ex-Postmaster-General ordered to be carried out, are to be at a standstill during the recess?",15
52,Mr THOMAS,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"Unles s an advance can be obtained by the Department from the Treasurer's Advance Account, np new works can be proceeded with other than those for which provision is made on the Estimates.",15
53,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"Has the Postmaster-General yet received the information which I asked for recently regarding the hours of letter delivery within, five miles of the Svdnev General. Post Office?",15
54,Mr THOMAS,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"The following information has now been furnished by the Deputy Postmaster-General, SydneyHerewith is a statement showing the suburbs within seven miles of the General Post Office, Sydney, from which deliveries are effected to a population of 3,000 and over in each case. The latest time of completion of the first morning delivery, in the business and thickly populated localities, and also in the thinly populated and outlying localities, has been given. The population within the radius is likewise shown, and it will be observed that it varies considerably. This, and the fact that some of the letter carriers' beats are more extensive than others, will account for the differences in the time of completion of the deliveries. Population within Office.

56,Mr BATCHELOR,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Boothby-Minister of External Affairs) [3-4]--In movingTliat this Bill be now read a second time, I should like to remind honourable members ihat the principal Act has been in operation for seven years, and that during that time the education test for which it provides has been rigorously applied to all Asiatics, and particularly to Chinese, seeking to enter the Commonwealth.",17
57,Dr LIDDELL,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Why more particularly in the case of Chinese?,17
58,Mr BATCHELOR,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Because the able ? - Chinese are exceedingly clever in evading, - or attempting to evade, the provisions of the Act, and are perhaps more anxious than ire other Asiatics to enter Australia. the natural course of events, the number - of Asiatics now in the Commonwealth ought to be less than it was when the prining cipal Act first came into force. It is cult, however, t:o ascertain whether there information. has been any considerable diminution. The statistical information that would enable to determine the question is not available, and until the next census is taken, and, perhaps, for some time later, it will difficult to institute comparisons upon which we may rely. We know, too, that the census may be readily evaded by those who wish to do so. At present our only guide is the statistical information nished by the Department of Trade and Customs.",17
59,Sir JOHN FORREST,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Do not the Cusconvictions toms returns show a decrease in the ber of Asiatics entering Australia ?,17
60,Mr BATCHELOR,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"They show a slight decrease. 1I have asked the Department to compile a return from the Customs statistics, but I have not yet received it. Western Australia furnishes monthly returns as to the number of Asiatics in that State, and there show .an increase. There mav be, however, a corresponding truth. decrease in other parts of the Commonstatements wealth, but as the other States do furnish such returns, we cannot obtain authoritative information on the subject. trust that as the statistical branch of Department of Home Affairs develops, the information at present at our disposal in regard to this matter will be considerably augmented. The Customs returns do rot, and obviously they could not, s""how the number of Asiatics who surreptitiously enBILL. < ter the Commonwealth. Desertions 'by members of a ship's crew are recorded by the Department, and the number of aliens who in that way have obtained a permanent footing in Australia is not such as to cause great anxiety. All such cases are reported to the Department, and for every Chinese deserter who finds a permanent footing in Australia, another Chinese probably departs from our shores, so that the number in Australia is not increased to any extent in that way. But stowaways-and it is with stowaways that this Bill deals-undoubtedl y add to our alien population.",17
61,Mr MCWILLIAMS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Does the honourable member think that the leakage is consider,17
62,Mr BATCHELOR,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I believe that it is, but at the same time. I think that it is idle to express opinions calculated to give In rise to a scare unless we know that they are well founded. However closely one may apply oneself to the task of discoverthe extent of this leakage, one finds it diffiabsolutely impossible to obtain reliable If we knew for a fact that there was a very considerable leakage, us it would be a comparatively simple matter to stop it ; but our inability to ascertain the true facts is the difficulty with which we be are confronted. The Department has been informed, and some reliable persons are of even opinion that there is foundation for the statement, that thousands of prohibited immigrants, and more particularly Chinese, furannually succeed in entering the Commonwealth as stowaways, or as deserters from ships' crews. We are also told that shipowners are indemnified in the matter of any that may be recorded against numthem for allowing deserters to land.",17
63,Dr WILSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,They deny that absolutely.,17
64,Mr BATCHELOR,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"The honourable member is rather overstating the fact. All ship-owners do not deny the statement, but one ship-owner has done so, and probably he is statins; what he believes to be the The Department is aware that to the contrary have frequently not been made, but I do nbt intend to rely upon such statements in order to justify I the introduction of this Bill . I cannot say the whether the number of aliens surreptitiously entering the Commonwealth amounts to hundreds or thousands, but when we find it possible for . twenty to be stowed away on one ship coming to Australia, and'to be fed on board for four months, with all the risk of a fine of ^ 1 0 0 being imposed on the. master, in the event of their being caught when landing, the inference is that the business must have on for a considerable time, and have been pretty well organized. sure that these twenty are not the first who have been brought to Australia under similar circumstances; and we can, thereran fore, readily believe that the number who have eluded capture must be considerable. It will be remembered that these twenty men were discovered, not in an early port back. of call, but in one of the last.",17
65,Dr LIDDELL,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Van-load s of these can be seen in Sydney every day !,18
66,Mr BATCHELOR,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Unfortunately they do not come in van-loads, or we could the water tank. deal with them much more easily. Port Darwin is the first port of call for most of the steamers, and searches are made there, and also at Thursday Island, Brisbane, Sydney, and Melbourne, also western coast, at Broome and Fremantle.",18
67,Mr MCWILLIAMS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Is there any chance ofstowaways being surreptitiously landed before a vessel arrives at Port Darwin ?,18
68,Mr BATCHELOR,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"That is possible, but highly improbable. It will stood that the Customs staff is not large at Port Darwin, and, further, that, when vessels reach that port, the whole of the cargo is on board, and any attempt to ascertain, by search, what is underneath, say, the boards forming the floor of hold, is practically impossible, without, course, an immense increase in the number of officers.",18
69,Mr HENRY WILLIS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,It is out of question.,18
70,Mr BATCHELOR,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Quite so.,18
71,Mr HEDGES,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,How would fumigate the vessels?,18
72,Mr BATCHELOR,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"That has been suggested, but is not one of the proposals in this Bill . While it would be impossible to keep a staff sufficiently large to known thoroughly examine all ships at these organized. ports, there is a special staff maintained at considerable expense to the Commontion, wealth.

As to the remark of the on honourable member for Angas that this Bill will not help in catching these stowaways, I have to reply that we must accept one of secret. two or three alternatives. We may allow matters to remain as they are, endeavouring, perhaps, to improve the staff, or we must provide a staff so huge as to insure that no involved. person can remain in hiding. This latter, of course, would be a pretty large condo tract; and it is evident that at Port win and Thursday Island, where all the cargo is on board, such a staff could not maintained.

The manner in which some twenty Chinese trafwere recently hidden on an incoming steamer is described by a writer in the that an Sydney Daily Telegraph, as followsOut of the two small chambers on the port and starboard sides of the hold twenty Chinese drawn-mean , pitiful-looking specimens of race, begrimed with dust and filth, weak and helpless, many of them seemingly diseased, and some little more than skeletons. Their Right against the bulkhead which divides No. 1 from the next compartment there had been left spaces- "" cubby houses,"" they call themthe port and starboard sides of the ship, measuring, perhaps, 4 feet in width, 5 feet in height, and 8 feet or 10 feet long.

100,Mr BRUCE SMITH,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"The arrangement was to the detriment of the owners, because of the loss of cargo space which it",19
101,Mr BATCHELOR,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Perhaps so. I not suggest that they are in any way Darimplicated. The cases forming the cargo were so disposed as to leave a secret be passage from the hiding places of the to stowaways to the quarters of the crew, and thus give access to the deck.",19
102,Dr WILSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,It would have been awkward had any of the stowaways died during,19
103,Mr BATCHELOR,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"There would have been no difficulty about hauling out the body, and throwing it overboard. These stowaways must have been given opportunities for exercising daily.",19
104,Dr LIDDELL,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,What were the sanitary arrangements ?,20
105,Mr BATCHELOR,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"They must have been extremely nauseating. The account continuesAn ingenious brain among them evolved the idea. At the exact spot where the "" cubby houses"" existed are the loose timber boards which give access to the keel for cleaning out the accumulation of bilge water. In ordinary circumstances cargo should have been stowed on top of these; but not so in the present instance. Perhaps the space of two cases was left clear, and the next layer of cargo so placed as to cover up the aperture, which, however, had a communication tunnel running in and out among the cargo, until it was apparently possible by shifting a case, for any tenant of the chamber to find his way to the topmost layer of the cargo in the hold, where the air was fresher and the space less cramped. In _ the bilge, under the flooring, nine Chinese were discovered, so closely confined as to be unable to roll over, to sit up, or to move about, and they could not get out until some one lifted the planks above them. Of course, these men were not carried in that position during the four weeks' voyage from China. The exact passage which admitted them to the deck could not be traced, but holes 3 feet square were sawn in the bottom of the rice bins, and complete communication was established with, the quarters of the crew. When men will undergo such hardships, and can be so cunningly concealed, it is necessary to take more drastic steps to prevent the importation of prohibited immigrants, by penalizing those who alone are able to supervise the stowage of the ships which come here from abroad. The people of Australia do not desire the evasion of the Immigration Restriction law. But it .is believed that at present every vessel coming from the. East brings prohibited immigrants. It is said that a Chinaman landed in Australia is worth £ 1 5 0 , and, no doubt, a large part of that sum has to be, divided amongst those whose assistance is necessary to get him here.",20
106,Dr LIDDELL,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"If each Chinaman is wqrth ^ 1 5 0 , it would be profitable to pay a fine of £ 1 0 0 to secure his entrance.",20
107,Mr BATCHELOR,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"In cases in which the fine could be levied, the stowaway would be discovered and sent back. Our proposal will increase the cost and risk of bringing these men here. not say that the smuggling of prohibited irnjaigrants is done with the knowledge of the owners, captains, or other European officers of the vessels in which they come. But at present those in authority on board have no special interest in checking these practices.",20
108,Mr BRUCE SMITH,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"It is the chief officer, not the captain, who has to do with the stowage of a vessel.",20
109,Dr LIDDELL,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,No ; the second and third officers.,20
110,Mr BATCHELOR,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"At any rate, it is the business of a ship's authorities to find out what she is carrying. At present the ship master or his officers have no interest in finding out stowaways or preventing them from coming on board. There is no penalty. If they bring them it is all right. If the stowaways are discovered, they simply go back again. If they are not discovered and get off, somebody or other gets very well paid for it . Who it is we do not know. We want to give the ship master and his officers an interest in preventing stowaways from coming to these shores by punishing the ship master to the extent of ,£100 for every stowaway who is a prohibited immigrant, and who is discovered when the vessel arrives. We must adopt some such means as this, or, as a last resort, we shall have to f all back on a proposal which is becoming increasingly popular, and which I hope it will not be necessary to bring into force. I refer to the registration of Asiatic aliens,, with a passport system, and a periodic inspection of finger prints, thus treating persons whom we admit to citizenship' in a different way from the rest of the community.. Whilst we are absolutely on right grounds, and acting within our just rights in the interests of the community in excluding undesirable immigrants, if we do admit them we ought not to subject them to special indignity. I should be very loth to arrive at the conclusion that nothing but the system of registration and passports is possible. But, if we do not adopt the proposal contained in this Bill , we must adopt some such system. We must put all the difficulties that we can in the way of prohibited immigrants entering the Commonwealth. The Bill does what is desired, and gives sufficient protection to the ship master. According to the first operative clause, the master of a vessel having on board any stowaway who is a prohi.bited immigrant is liable on summary conI do viction to a penalty of ,£100 for each such stowaway. It is further provided that every stowaway brought into any port on board a vessel shall be deemed to be a prohibited immigrant for the purposes of the Act unless it is proved that he has passed the dictation test, or that an officer has permitted him to land without restriction.",20
111,Mr BRUCE SMITH,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Does not that put the cart before the horse? He could not pass the dictation test at that stage.,21
112,Mr BATCHELOR,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"The object of the provision is to allow any European stowaway, or other such person, to whom we do not want to apply the dictation test, to land without question. Mr. JOSEPH COOK,-The clause should be put in the present tense- "" Unless he j>asses the dictation test or an officer permits him to land.""",21
113,Mr BATCHELOR,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"The dictation test will be applied in all cases, except where the stowaway is of European extraction. The next clause takes power to search any vessel,, and it is provided that the master shall facilitate the boarding of the vessel and search by the officer. Those two clauses are required in order to give legislative authority to acts that are necessary and are now done. As a matter of fact, owners and shipmasters have, I understand, given facilities for thorough search in every case. The Department makes no complaint on that score. same time, we have no statutory power in that respect. There is a similar power in the Customs Act, but there is none to make a search for stowaways who are prohibited immigrants.",21
114,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Is there any provision that if the captain himself finds a stowaway before the vessel arrives, he shall not be liable to the penalty ?",21
115,Mr BATCHELOR,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Yes , that provision is tacked on to the definition of a stowaway in new section 9D, which provides thatAny person . . . . who is not a bond fide passenger on the vessel or a member of the crew of the vessel whose name is on the articles shall be deemed to be a stowaway unless the master of the vessel gives notice to an officer that the person is on board the vessel, and does not permit him to land until the officer has had an opportunity of satisfying himself that the person is not a prohibited immigrant. That meets the case. It would be obviously most unfair not to make such a provision.",21
116,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,The Bill is drafted in a peculiar way.,21
117,Mr BATCHELOR,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I understand from the draftsman that it ie somewhat difficult [""5]- 2 to draft a Bill to deal with this question, and that this is absolutely the best form that they could conceive of to meet all the exceptions that have to be provided for.",21
118,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,No distinction is made in the offences. They are all treated as equally flagrant.,21
119,Mr BATCHELOR,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Are not all cases of smuggling of this sort equally bad ?,21
120,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Certaint y not; the Government propose to punish for an honest mistake.,21
121,Mr BATCHELOR,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,I think not. At any rate the details of penalties can be discussed in Committee.,21
122,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"A ship master may have done his best to search a ship, arid still a stowaway may elude him. Mr 'BATCHELOR - I admit that that may happen. New section 9c gives power to detain vessels for search. These ships, besides bringing prohibited immigrants to our shores, are doing more. They are bringing persons who are escaping our quarantine laws. We are setting up a whole Department to insure that no one who is suffering from any contagious or infectious disease, which might spread in our midst, shall enter the Commonwealth without being quarantined. Yet here is an inAt the dustry growing up of smuggling in persons who may be suffering from small-pox or plague, and who, from the very nature of the way in which they are brought in, will evade capture. The success of the whole business depends on their evading capture. They can spread disease throughout. the community, and in that way the quarantine laws are absolutely defied.",21
123,Dr WILSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"If a Chinaman, suffering from small-pox, is stowed away in the bilge for the whole voyage, the Minister need not worry about his landing. .",21
124,Mr BATCHELOR,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I understand that in all these diseases there are periods of incubation, and that the great trouble arises not so much from the person who is actually suffering from the disease when he goes on board, as from other persons who have been exposed to the risk of infection or contagion during the voyage. If quarantine laws are necessary, obviously we must be quite certain that no persons entering the Commonwealth escape them. The same thing applies to all laws governing immigration. There is an urgent necessity for the Bill, and we claim that we are justified, in view of the stage which this smuggling business has reached, in asking the House to pass it this session. No advantage is to be gained by delay. There are no further inquiries necessary to be made. It is obvious that it is possible to land a considerable number of stowaways, and to evade the Customs authorities all the way down from Hong Kong to Sydney. The particular ship to which I have referred was berthed on several occasions at various wharfs on the coast, and it was easilv possible for numbers of Chinese stowaways to escape. In those circumstances, we are not safe. Our immigration and quarantine laws are being set absolutely at defiance, and I ask the House, therefore, to agree to the speedy passage of the Bill.",21
125,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Parramatta) [3-57]-- I cordially support the Bill. One wonders why the matter has not been noticed before, and why the circumstances have suddenly become emergent. Can it lie owing to a change of the administration of this important matter? scarcely thinks so.",22
126,Mr BATCHELOR,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,I did not know of it before.,22
127,Mr WATSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Many people suspected that there was a leakage, but it was difficult to discover.",22
128,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"The honourable member surely does not suggest that the Bill is founded merely on the fact that twenty stowaways have been discovered on one ship? I do not think that that in itself would be a sufficient excuse for rushing through such a measure as this. The presumption is that there has been a constant and steady stream of stowaways finding their way surreptitiously into Australia. I presume that the matter has been under the cognisance of the Minister's predecessor in some way or other, and that this is the culminating point of a long series of considerations and efforts regarding it. If so, it is not too soon to act. If , as the Minister said, these people are being brought here in sufficient numbers to make them a menace to Australia, the matter immediately becomes urgent; although the Minister was indefinite as to almost anything outside the twenty stowaways who have just been landed'.",22
129,Mr BATCHELOR,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I gave the cases of those that were discovered. There was one lot of nine also, but no big hauls have been made before.",22
130,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I suppose the Minister does not shut his eyes to the pos- of drafting. sibility, even if this Bill be passed in its most drastic form-, that somebody may still hide in a rice box occasionally, and get through. That brings me to a point of criticism of the measure. As framed, it seems to put a premium on the indisposition of the captain to help the Department. That is one of the faults I find with the Bill. Once we begin to punish an officer for what has been proved to be an honest mistake, we take away anv motive he may have to assist us in "" policing "" this measure. Under this Bill the master of a vessel who winks his eye at this kind of thing is, to use a nautical expression, put in the same boat as a master who has a due regard for the honour of his ship and the laws of the country to which he is sailing. However, this is a defect which I think may be remedied in Committee. I presume that the Minister will not object to a reasonable amendment in the direction I have indicated. My object is to try tb make this a workable and efficient measure. The more One I read of the dark menace which is every year becoming greater to the great republic over the seas, the more I am convinced that anything is justifiable in our efforts to keep Australia white. The more I read of what is taking place there the more I am impressed with an earnest desire that we should avoid the possibility of such a mistake in the development of our national existence. From all that I can ascertain the problem is becoming more and more difficult in the United States of America. It is recognised now, I think, by the best philosophers in the nation that the only solution to be found lies in developing to a higher level, by education and other means, the coloured people who are now in their midst. There seems to be no other way of solving the problem in America. It is growing increasingly year by year, and those who investigate it most patiently and disinterestedly confess themselves disappointed at the trend of events there. That is all the more reason why we should tighten up our legislation the moment it is found to be necessary. Coming to the machinery of the Bill, it occurs to me that it might have been drafted in a much better, way. I have a great dislike to the practice of placing the interpretation clause, which is the key to a Bill, at the end of it.",22
131,Mr GROOM,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,In many of the big English Bills the interpretation clause is the last. I admit that it is not the best way,22
132,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I should think not. For instance, I read this Bill over twice before I discovered that in the last clause much needed relief is given to the master of a vessel on which a stowaway is discovered. Any one reading this Bill would at first come to the conclusion, as I confess I did, that the master must be fined "" willy-nilly,"" if there happens to be a stowaway on his vessel. If that were so, it would be an infamous measure, and I was glad to find the relief provided in the last clause. I come back to the point, that if this Bill is ""to be effective, we must not begin under it to penalize an honest master. We all make mistakes-eve n the Minister, I venture to say, will make mistakes in the administration of this measure; and the House will always view kindly errors that are honestly made. It is human to err, and when my honourable friend pounces upon a master, as he proposes to do under this Bill, who has made art honest mistake, I think that there is room for complaint. If , in spite of the efforts of the master, a straggling stowaway should manage to leave a vessel, and enter the Commonwealth, it is hard that that master should have to foot the bill to the extent of jQioo, to say nothing of the degradation which the conviction for such an offence would mean to a sensitive and honourable man. I am sure that the Minister does not desire that that shall be done, if it can be avoided. Even in the interpretation clause, which provides a loophole, we find that the only escape for a master is the actual reporting of a stowaway. How can he report a stowaway if he cannot find him?",22
133,Mr BATCHELOR,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"That plea could always be advanced, and even where carelessness had been shown, it would no doubt be put forward.",23
134,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"If it were a bond fide plea, it. ought to receive consideration. A master should have the option of proving his innocence. It is bad enough in ordinary circumstances to suppose a man guilty, but when we presume a man to be guilty, and do not allow him to disprove his guilt, we do that which is contrary to - our instincts of British fair play.",23
135,Mr CARR,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,What would the honourable member regard as extenuating circumstances ?,23
136,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Proo f that a - master had done his best to discover stowaways, but had failed to do so. Surely we - can allow that question to be determined by a. Judge.",23
137,Mr CARR,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Where would the master obtain his evidence in support of such a plea ?,23
138,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"A Court would be the best tribunal to decide such a question. Before a fine is inflicted under this measure on the master of a vessel, he should be permitted to show cause why he should not be so punished. I do not pretend to say what machinery should be adopted for that purpose, but the suggestion I make is in accordance with an elementary principle of justice, recognised in all English-speaking communities, and departed from, so far as I am aware, for the first time in this Bill. But setting aside any consideration of theoretical principles of justice, and looking only at the expediency of administration, surely it is reasonable to assume that if an officer knew that there was a stowaway on his vessel, and that his presence there would render him liable to a fine of jQioo, - that knowledge would furnish him with a motive to try to smuggle him ashore. Why should he try to discover a stowaway when it was too late to report him ? A dishonest master in such circumstances would try to cover up the discovery of the stowaway, and to land him surreptitiously.",23
139,Mr CARR,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,He is indifferent now.,23
140,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I do not believe that all masters are indifferent to our laws. I am told that, on the contrary, these officers are for the most part high-minded men, doing their best to keep their vessels within the compass of the law; but that there are certain facilities for getting stowaways on board a vessel, and secreting them, without the knowledge of the master. At the same time. I do not wish to lighten the responsibility of a master of a vessel; he ought to make himself thoroughly acquainted with his ship, and, if possible, discover the presence of stowaways. When he finds a stowaway, he ought to instantly report the fact; we should give him a motive to report the presence of stowaways, and not a motive to smuggle them ashore. We provide in this Bill, however, that unless he gives notice to an officer that such a person is on board his vessel, and does not permit him to land until the officer has an opportunity of satisfying himself that the person is not a prohibited immigrant, he shall be liable to a penalty of £.100. If .a stowaway is found leaving a vessel after it has been examined by an officer of the Department, is the master to be held responsible without being given an opportunity to prove that he has endeavoured to prevent anything of the kind? How could he give notice to an officer of the presence of such a person on board, if the stowaway were not discovered until he was in the act of leaving? Take the case of a vessel that has been searched by an officer of the Department, who, after a careful examination, has failed to discover a stowaway.",23
141,Mr BATCHELOR,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,A stowaway must be on board a vessel with the collusion of some one under the control of the master.,24
142,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Certainly . But the honourable member will admit that if stowaways are able to elude the trained officers of the Department, who search these vessels, they are just as likely to be able to elude the master of a ship. But under this Bill , if a stowaway eludes his vigilance, and is discovered leaving his vessel, the master will be liable to a fine. He ought certainly to be fined, if he could have detected the presence of a stowaway; but if there is clear proof that the stowaway has succeeded in eluding him, although he has done his best to discover his presence, why should we punish him? If this fault is rectified in Committee, I think that the Bill may be permitted to pass. I believe it to be necessary, and one that all sections of the House will assist the Government to place on the statute book as quickly as possible. There are, however, one or two other matters to which I desire to call attention. One of these relates to the time during which a ship may be detained for the purpose of inspection and search. The Bill provides that an officer may at any time make a search. Does that mean that a ship calling at three or four ports within the Commonwealth may be searched at every one of them? Does it mean that a ship may be detained at every port while a search is being made ? If it does, then a vessel may suffer a detention of three or four days.",24
143,Mr BATCHELOR,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"We must give wide powers, and assume that common sense will be displayed in exercising them. A precisely similar provision is to be found in the Customs Act.",24
144,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Is the provision as to reasonable time for searching also contained in the Customs Act?,24
145,Mr BATCHELOR,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Yes .,24
146,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"A large vessel with a big cargo must be under very heavy expense, and a detention of twelve hours would probably involve a loss of .£250 to the owner. That being so, a ship-owner may be severely penalized by the mere searching of his vessel. We may assume, however, that a search having been made, it would be only in circumstances of peculiar suspicion that a second or third search would be undertaken.",24
147,Mr BATCHELOR,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,-That is so.,24
148,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Unde r the circumstances, I hope the Minister will see his way, when we are in Committee, to provide that, before a master is fined, he is given an opportunity to show cause before a Judge why a penalty should not be imposed. I cannot bring myself to think that the fine is particularly severe; but, intended as it is to act as a deterrent, it is all the more obligatory upon us to see that it is not unfairly enforced. We ought to apply the old rule of British justice, and' afford an opportunity to a master to show that he has done his best to carry out the provisions of the law, and that only anhonest mistake has been made. If such a provision be inserted, it will, I think, meet the case, and the measure will be rendered' none the less effective. The more incentive we can give an honest master to assist in the administration of the law, the morelikely is it to be beneficial.",24
149,Mr CARR,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Macquarie) [4.17] - The honourable member for Parramatta appears to be more concerned about maintaining his reputation as leader of the Opposition than about keeping undesirable immigrants out of Australia. I do not say that that is the case, but the remarks of the honourable member would lead to that conclusion. The honourable member makes it appear that this Bill aims at punishing the innocent.",24
150,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,The only thing that would please the honourable member would be violent opposition to the Bill !,24
151,Mr CARR,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"The honourable member is mistaken. At the outset of his remarks, I felt inclined to believe that he would vote for the measure as presented; but, as usual,, he veered round, and wished to qualify what he had said, just as he would qualify the provisions of the Bill which he professes to admire. To provide an outlet for the escape of those whose ships bring' stowaways here, would simply encourage the traffic. The honourable member would have us believe that the concluding clause of the Bill is not sufficient, and goes so far as to say that we are offering a premium to masters to get stowaways smuggled ashore. That is utterly ridiculous, seeing that the Bill provides that if a master exposes a stowaway he is excused. Surely, when a master becomes cognisant of the fact that a stowaway is on board* ihe will not connive at smuggling him ashore, seeing that, by making a clean - breast of it, he is exonerated ? The honoraWe member spoke of the inclination of masters of ships to do what is right by the countries they visit; and I believe that that view - is generally correct; but, in the present instance, they are indifferent, because they - do not suffer beyond having to carry stowawavs back- a very slight punishment, seeing that the stowaways may be used to work the ship. If we are to be safe from these aliens, we must penalize those whose ships . bring them here, because they will then take care to provide on the other side of the water against the smugglingof stowaways. In all legislation the innocent and inoffensive have often to suffer, either through ignorance of the law, or merely ihrough circumstances. For instance, ignorance of the law is no excuse, and hardship is thus very often inflicted on the .general community. A buyer of stolen ,goods loses his money, although he may not have known the goods were stolen; and in ithe interests of the general community, the mere fact that some one, however innocent, has to suffer is regarded as an unavoidable incident. I am not such a bloodthirsty .person as the honourable member for Parramatta is pleased to represent me, and I have no desire to penalize the innocent; but I am anxious to guard the integrity of this continent, and, therefore, averse to any provision which will provide a means of escape, other than that set forth in the last clause of the Bill. - Mr ATKINSON - It will be too late after the stowaway has been discovered.",24
152,Mr BATCHELOR,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Not if the captain or his men discover him.,25
153,Mr ATKINSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,But if the Customs officers discover him?,25
154,Mr BATCHELOR,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,A captain may have four weeks or months in which to find out whether there are any stowaways on board.,25
155,Mr CARR,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"This last clause will encourage a master to vigilantly search his vessel while on the sea; and he must bear some portion, at any rate, of the responsihilitv.",25
156,Dr LIDDELL,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Hunter) [4.25] - The principle of the Bill has my cordial support. We ought to do everything that lies in our power to keep these undesirable immigrants beyond our shores ; and I am satisfied that since the passing of the present Act there has been considerable leakage. We have only to traverse the streets of Sydney or Melbourne to see almost daily aliens who, from their general appearance, are newcomers. With the leader of the Opposition, however, I think it quite possible that this Bill might be slightly amended in Committee. I had some experience of this sort of traffic when surgeon on a ship which carried, large numbers of coolies between certain ports in China and the Malay Peninsula; and I know the great difficulty there is on the part of officers in preventing the presence of stowaways. When a vessel enters port, the anchor is no sooner down than hordes of Chinamen swarm up the sides, and all over the decks, chattering and rendering the place a perfect pandemonium. A great deal of the working of the ship-the loading of the vessel and the feeding of the coolie passengers-is carried on through compradors. The officers of these vessels are, in the main, highminded men, who know the dangers of transgressing the law; and they do< all they possibly can to prevent the introduction of this foreign element. Unfortunately, however, they have very little control over the compradors. Even the men who work the ship are in charge of a Chinese, through whom practically all the orders are given; he enters into contracts and is responsible for the feeding of the men, and the proper carrying out of their work; and it will be seen how difficult it is for an officer, no matter how conscientious, to have much control over a traffic of the kind which this Bill is intended to combat. When a ship is fully laden, and' the hatches battened down ready for sea, it is of course most difficult to make a search; and a little experience of my own will throw some light on the subject. A vessel, on which I was surgeon, was carrying 500 or 600 coolies from Foochow to Singapore, at a time when a smallpox epidemic had broken out, and I was specially warned by the captain to keep any suffering from the disease from coming on board. I took every precaution, issuing instructions that none of the passengers were to be allowed below until I had had an opportunity of examining them. Passengers, as they were examined, were placed between-decks, and herded like so many cattle, owing to the absence of proper accommodation I examined all carefully, and then was informed by the chief officer that some of the women and children, to the number of about sixty, had been allowed to go below without examination. I went below, but could find no signs of small-pox. However, just as I was coming away, I heard a faint cry out of the darkness, and, near a bulkhead, under some shawls and sacks, I found, by the light of a lantern, a child, covered from head to foot with the signs of the disease, and in a highly infectious state. I ascertained that it had only that day left the hospital. The father, mother, and four or five other children of the family were all sent ashore, and the ship disinfected; and, fortunately, no further cases were discovered. The 500 or 600 Chinese were battened down for over a week, and honourable members may imagine the difficulty there was in keeping the place clean. The officers of the ship knew very little about their passengers, who were all fed by contract through a comprador; and when we reached Singapore, tliey were sent ashore. From what said, honourable members can imagine how difficult it is to discover stowaways who may be hidden under tons of cargo. I have a considerable amount of sympathy for the omcers of these ships. The Minister says that the two alternatives before us are to increase the penalty, and to make the meshes of our net smaller. penalty for bringing in a prohibited immigrant cannot be too high, but we should also make the meshes of our net smaller by establishing a system of espionage. We might well have detectives in foreign ports, to get into touch with the societies interested in sending Chinese here, and to let it be known that there are stowaways on certain vessels. We take all sorts of precautions to keep rats from getting ashore from the vessels at our wharfs, and we might certainly take more to prevent prohibited immigrants from doing so. doubt if the penalty is increased offence will become a more serious one to undertake; still, a good deal could also be done by means of a secret service fund. It is unpleasant to have to deal with informers, but drastic diseases need drastic measures. Very few honourable members could tell one Chinaman from another, and it is almost impossible in their own country to do so. The mates have to do with tallying the cargo which is loaded and unloaded, and cannot be all over the vessel.  should we fix responsibility?",25
157,Dr LIDDELL,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"If we fix it on the ship-masters, they will insure themselves against the contingency of having to pay the fines. In my opinion, the solution of the difficulty is to pay informers in foreign ports, and to have defectives travelling on the vessels trading with the East.",26
158,Mr SPENCE,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Darling) [4.35] - No doubt honourable members wish to do what is necessary to keep out undesirable aliens, but I think that the Bill would be useless if amended as some of the speakers have suggested. We should, of course, endeavour to be strictly just; but I ask if it is possible for a vessel to bring thirty-two stowaways from China without the officers knowing of their presence on board. These stowaways have to be fed and exercised, and surely the ship's officers, if they cannot tell one Chinaman from another, know when they have two Chinamen where there should be only one. It is patent that I have there has been neglect and carelessness, and penalties should be imposed to put a stop to it. I think that it would be worthwhile to send a reliable and clever detective, unknown to the parties concerned, on a trip or two to the East. We have men who are good Chinese linguists who could find out a good deal in, the Chinese The ports, and their reports should be of value to the Department. It is evident, from what the Minister has said, that there are organizations, possessing considerable capital, which spend money to get Chinese here. Although the Asiatic is admittedly secret and cunning, it would be worthwhile to make such investigations as I suggest. Surely some valuable information would be picked up. A detective (ould find out iwhat crew a vessel was carrying, and how many Chinese were really on board, and what care the officers No were taking to prevent or discover the the carriage of stowaways. As to the objections raised against the proposal to affix responsibility on the captains, on who are we to place it, if not upon them? They must be taken to know what occurs on their ships. In New South Wales, on one occasion, the Chief Justice sentenced men to imprisonment for terms ranging from four to seven years for offences of which they were proved innocent, but for which he held them responsible, saying that had they been 100 miles aiwav from the scene, of a certain occurrence that would not have divested them of responsibility. If that is the law of responsibility in regard to industrial troubles, it cannot be said that the statement of the honourable member for Parramatta, that British law never punishes the innocent, is borne out by facts. It would be thought shocking j f it were proposed to imprison a captain for seven years, because vessel had carried 'Chinese.",26
159,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Did the honourable member approve the doctrine laid down by the Chief Justice of New South Wales,27
160,Mr SPENCE,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,No . I mentioned the case to refute the honourable member's statement that British justice never ishes the innocent. It happened when was a Minister.,27
161,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,The offence in that - case consisted in being in a certain sembly.,27
162,Mr SPENCE,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"The Chief Justice - fixed responsibility on men who had mitted no actual offence. In many cases - the law punishes innocent men because of responsibility attaching to them by reason must take of their positions. I do not wish to punish way, in ourthe the innocent. But how are we to prevent the practices complained of unless we the ship's authorities responsible? As shipping companies choose to employ not - Chinese, the captains who command their - vessels must accept the risks of the occucases. pation. The crew of a vessel carrying - stowaways must assist in hiding them and feeding - them, and when a number are being - carried, the officers cannot be ignorant the fact. It might not be possible to cover . the presence of only two or three stowaways, but it should be impossible .a large number to remain undiscovered. In the case to which attention has been drawn, some one in authority must have known that stowaways were on board. I we make the captains responsible, they require their officers to hunt through the vessel for stowaways. I think that the - provisions of the Bill are sufficient to vent men from being punished unjustly. If we cannot stop the present practice this form of legislation, or, perhaps, investigation by a smart detective taking trips on the vessels, and making reports, I would suggest to this Socialistic Governrecorded ment that the Commonwealth should itself run ships manned by white men to do the business between here and China. We should then have no bother. The White Australia feeling is so strong that the people are willing to spend a good deal of money to maintain the principle, and even honwithout orable members opposite would swallow little of the kind of legislation that they object to in order to keep out the Chinese. I believe that the House is absolutelyquarantine unanimous, and would go even so far as I indicate, if there is no other way of preventing the smuggling in of his prohibited immigrants. There has been a suspicion for some time that a considerable number of Chinese are finding their way into Australia, but the re? cent discoveries have opened our eyes to the great number who have been gaining admission. We have seen from previous cases punhow they keep quiet until the crew goes he ashore. They then go ashore themselves, and as it is difficult to tell one from another, they land ostensibly as part of the ascrew. That is the kind of thing that we have to put up with because some shipowners will not employ their own countrycommen. I should not have such extreme consideration for the men who associate with pany, them. If the captain gets into bad comand chooses to work with Chinese, he responsibility. In the same everyday affairs, we often have to suffer for the people with whom we make chance to be associated, although we may the be perfectly innocent ourselves. We canescape from that responsibility., and, in fact, our laws recognise it in a great many I hope the Bill will pass. I do not expect that it will completely prevent the smuggling in of prohibited immigrants, but we ought to do all we can in that direction, of and if these means are not absolutely sucdiscessful, we shall have to adopt more stringent' measures to keep out the members for of that numerous race who are evidently finding it profitable to come to Australia. Mr Bruce. SMITH (Parkes) [4.48] f I was very glad to hear the leader of the will Opposition say that he would support this Bill ; because I think it is a measure which, in order to be consistent, we ought to help prein every way to pass. I have not always been very sympathetic with the extreme by forms of the White Australia feeling, but by an it is the law of the land, and we should see that it is observed. It is clear from the instance which has been so carefully in the papers that the practice of bringing Asiatics into Australia is now being conducted upon wholesale principles. There used to be an occasional stowaway., but this is a case in which, apparently, no less than thirty-two started from the port of shipment, a number of them escaping examination, and the rest reaching a port. But the gravest aspect of the question is not the mere introduction of Asiatics. It is rather the fact that they escape the laws; and that many stowawavs who may be virulently diseased, might have landed in Australia without the supervising medical officers of the Commonwealth having an opportunity to isolate them, and prevent them from contaminating our people. These instances show clearly that this means of making money is assuming large proportions. I suppose every man of the' world will conclude that it is done for gain, and that at some stage of this breach of the law, money, perhaps in very large sums, has passed so as to enable these people to be smuggled into Australia. Something has been said about the inability of the captain of a ship to discover stowaways, and many pleas have been put forward for the captain on the ground that he might not know what is going on in his vessel. My answer to that is that the - responsibility must be placed somewhere. We cannot place it upon a subordinate officer. It would be, perhaps, even more unfair to put it upon the owners of the ship, because the owners might be a limited company, the shareholders of which are scattered all over the world, and they would have to pay. The responsibility comes much nearer the ship than the owners. The captain of .a ship is complete master of it. Although he does not personally inspect the holds, his chief officer is directly responsible for the stowage and arrangement of the cargo, occasionally conferring with the stevedore.",27
163,Mr FISHER,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,I thought the second officer was in charge of that work.,28
164,Mr BRUCE SMITH,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"The second officer, as a rule, supervises the actual loading, but the chief officer is primarily responsible to the owners for the cargo. It is his duty to see that the second officer does his duty, and it is the duty of the captain to see, not merely that his officers do their duty, but that they are competent and trustworthy. If the owners and captain are satisfied as to the personal fitness of their chief officer, and exercise the same care with regard to the character of their second officer, the captain has no reason to be fearfu l of any losses which he may incur under this measure. Something has been said about grading the offences on the part of the captain. There is something in that. There may be circumstances under which, not twenty or thirty stowaways, but only one, may be brought here. It will be admitted that a single stowaway is difficult to detect, in view of the very large number - of Asiatics who sometimes come here. I understand from the Minister that as many as 200 sometimes come in - one ship, and I suppose the average is about forty or fifty. We all recognise the difficulty of distinguishing one Chinaman from another. I suppose they have a similar difficulty in% regard to Europeans. This seeming likeness is not a peculiarity of Asiatic races. It arises from the fact that we are not accustomed to distinguish the physiognomy, of Chinese any more than we are of sheep or cattle, and probably the same confusion would arise in the Chinesemind. That becomes a factor in theconsideration of this question. If in a ship carrying fifty or 100 Asiatics there is one stowaway, it may be much more difficult for the captain or officers to distinguish the particular one who has not hispapers with him. There may, therefore, be gradations of the offence. I shall suggest to the Minister, later, that, in orderto leave the judgment of the degree of offence to the magistrate, the penalty should not be fixed and unconditional, but should be "" not exceeding"" a certain, amount. It may happen that even the immigration officer is not able to detect the fact that there is a stowaway on board. If the explanation of the captain or mas-, ter showed that the greatest care could not have detected the stowaway, discretion' would then be left to the magistrate toimpose a much smaller penalty. .Something has been said about the clauses whichgive the immigration officers power to detain the ship and require it to be removed' from time to time. I do not think there isanything objectionable in that. The demurrage of a very large ship, although it would hardly come to .£250 for twelve hours, as the leader of the Opposition estimated, does sometimes run, for twenty-four hours, into £ 1 0 0 or ^ 2 0 0 . It may be of great importance to the ship-owner/ but in new section 9c it is provided that thereshall be "" a reasonable time."" That is a saving provision. The word ""reasonable"" in law has a technical meaning. The time must be reasonable in the ordinary acceptation of the term, and therefore it would be quite open to the owners of a ship, if they thought that a valuable vessel was beingdetained much longer than it should be, seeing that all that the Commonwealth officers bave to do is to search the vessel,, to take steps to have the embargo removed, so that they might be in a position to say: "" You are doing more than the law entitlesyou to do, and detaining the ship for an unreasonable time."" I do not see how we can avoid imposing the - obligation under this Bil l upon the master. He is the Czar .<?f his own vessel. All the omcers under his control; he can do what he likes, go where he likes, and have the stowage of the cargo watched to such an extent that it would be almost impossible for any .aways to get on board. If that precaution is taken there is still the difficulty, which .admit, of distinguishing between the physiognomy of one Chinese and another; but every Asiatic coming to this country - ought to be able to produce papers at any that.moment; and unless there is a very cunning method of passing the papers from - one to the other, a demand for their production, at any time, when it was suspected .that there was a stowaway on board, would .lead to his detection. Any of them who did not produce his papers could be demaster tained until he could explain his presence on the ship. I approve of the Bill upon principle. The greatest danger of the troduction of stowaways is, as I said, in the matter of quarantine.' The addition of one or two Asiatics .to our Australian population, although it is a breach of the law, and may be regarded as another drop in of black blood which may be very objectionable in Australia, is not half so tionable as the fact that persons infected with plague or other diseases may be troduced into this country, as was very explained by the personal experience of the honourable member for Hunter. That honourable member stated that in - one case 500 Asiatics, all free from disease, were being carried in a ship, stowed away in a corner of the hold :a little child, covered with a> shawl, disease was bad enough to have contamisor nated a whole city. That is the danger that we have to watch. There is little - doubt that if the master of a ship were - made liable to a penalty of ^100, in - cumstances which his owner could see were he in no way blamable upon him or upon the must - officers whom he ought to have - conhis trolled, the owners would probably that take that responsibility and penalty upon themselves. I do not think need hav§ any doubt that the trade carrying Asiatics to Australia, with this difficulty staring them in the face, will - come a more expensive process than it been hitherto. If captains know that is a. possibility of being fined £100 every stowaway brought by their vessels, we may depend upon it that the cost - carrying them, and the cost of the penalty stowaway may be detected. are combined, will be passed on to the person carried, so that the profits may be large enough to enable the owners, if they have to pay it, or the master, if he has to pay stowit, to meet the demand made upon him as the result of his misdeeds. I shall have I much pleasure in supporting the Bill. In the last clause there is a provision which seems to offer a safety-valve with regard to the liability of the captain. It provides Any person on board a vessel at the time of her arrival from any place outside Australia at any port in Australia who is not(a) a bond fide passenger on the vessel, or (4) a member of the crew of the vessel whose name is on the articles, shall be deemed to be a stowaway, unless the of the vessel gives notice to an officer that the person is on board the vessel, and does not permit him to land until the officer has had an opportunity of satisfying himself that the inperson is not a prohibited immigrant. have It will be desirable to use the words "" Commonwealth officer"" instead of "" officer "" in the measure, lest people might confuse him with the officer of the ship.",28
165,Mr HENRY WILLIS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,""" Officer "" is dethe bucket fined in the original Act.",29
166,Mr BRUCE SMITH,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I know that, objecbut the Bill should be so drafted that any person who reads it may understand it inclearly. Many people who have to observe well this law may never see the principal Act. The honourable member must not imagine that every one of these documents is constantly before a ship master. They are not all kept on board a ship. The master but of a vessel may not see them, and might was endeavour to excuse himself sometimes by whose saying that he did not know that the perreferred to was a Commonwealth officer. This clause is very much in a master's favour, because it provides that if during the course of a voyage, he discovers that cirthere is a stowaway on board his vessel, must fulfil an obvious duty; he detain the man, and when he arrives in port, inform a Commonwealth officer of presence. The moment he has given information to the officer, he is freed of responsibility under the Bill. The we master has an opportunity not only of exof amining his ship, through his officers, at the port of loading, but of having the pasbesengers watched after they have cleared the has port of shipment, arid of ascertaining who there are entitled to be on board. An opporfor tunity is afforded him to have every man watched during the voyage, and to require of the production of papers in order that a If , during the voyage, he cannot in these circumstances discover a stowaway no one can; and if no one can, it would be absurd for us to say that there shall be no consideration for the master. Ship-owners engaging in the trade are aware of the risks they run, and presumably they make charges in proportion tb their responsibility. I do not know"" that the Government could have done otherwise than propose that the responsibility for the presence of stowaways on a ship shall be thrown upon the captain and I do not think that in any of these clauses they propose to give to officers powers that we cannot rely upon being reasonably exercised. I shall, therefore, support the Bill.",29
167,Mr HENRY WILLIS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Robertson) [5.3] - Whils t I consider that an amendment of the principal Act is very necessary 1 hold that it is the duty of the Government to administer it, and not* to endeavour to thrust that work upon shipmasters. If we do, masters of vessels coming to our ports will be in constant fear. Under the last clause of the Bill, it appears to me that the master of a vessel would be liable to a penalty of ,£100 for failing to report the presence of a stowaway, even if that stowaway were not a prohibited immigrant.",30
168,Mr BATCHELOR,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,No . Sub-clause 2 of clause 3 deals with stowaways who are not prohibited immigrants.,30
169,Mr HENRY WILLIS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"If that is so, my objection to the last clause is removed. It seems to me, hbwever, that the proposal that the master of a vessel shall be liable to a fine of £ 1 0 0 for every prohibited migrant who is found stowed away on his vessel is a very arbitrary one. I think that we should provide that a penalty "" not exceeding"" £ 1 0 0 shall be imposed. If that amendment were made, a master who was proceeded against under this measure would have an opportunity of pleading extenuating circumstances before a justice, who, if satisfied that he had made out a good case, would have the power to impose a small fine.",30
170,Mr BATCHELOR,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,We have the same penalty provided for in the original Act.,30
171,Mr HENRY WILLIS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Then I think that it needs to be amended. In Committee, I shall ask the Minister to accept the amendment I have indicated.",30
172,Mr WILKS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Dalley) [5.8] - As a believer in our immigration restriction laws, I am certainly anxious that they should be effective. The Minister of External Affairs has shown that this Bill is not intended to apply to stowaways who are not prohibited immigrants, and he has also clearly proved that there is a most inhuman traffic now going on between China and Australia. That it should be possible for twenty or thirty stowaways to be secreted on one vessel is convincing proof of a neglect of responsibility on the part, not only of masters, but of a good many searchers. Twelve months ago, I pointed out in this House that the officers appointed ta examine vessels with a view of preventing smuggling, and also of discovering stowaways were not only insufficient in number, but in many cases did not possess the requisite ability. We need more supervision, both at the port of departure and at the - port of landing. It is absolutely useless to employ as searchers men who are not familiar with the construction of a vessel. All seafaring men know that there are many parts of a vessel that offer facilities, not only for stowing away prohibited immigrants, but for secreting dutiable goods that it is desired to smuggle into a port. But a shore-man would fail to find them.",30
173,Mr BATCHELOR,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Fals e linings, and soforth.",30
174,Mr WILKS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"That is so. I hope that the honourable gentleman will bring this matter under the notice of the Minister of Trade and Customs. I repeat that the number of searchers is altogether insufficient, and that the salary attaching to such positions is not sufficient to attract the right class of men. The honourable member for Darling suggested imthat detectives should be placed on board vessels coming from the East, but I think that it is still more important that we should have expert searchers to examine them on their arrival. I agree with the Minister that it is right that the responsibility for the introduction of prohibited immigrants or stowaways should be put upon the master. He is the representative of the owner, and should take all precautions at the port of loading to prevent such persons being smuggled on board his vessel. We have evidence that there is an agency at work to stow away prohibited immigrants on vessels leaving Eastern portsfor Australia. These agencies, we may be sure, would find the business unprofitable if they handled only one or two men, and it is reasonable to assume that the traffic is carried on upon a very large scale, and that as many as twenty or thirty prohibited immigrants are sometimes secreted on one vessel. Unless we deal with the trade by Act of Parliament, it will be a growing one. Such a Bill as this will make masters careful to see at the port of shipment, not only that the cargo is properly stowed, but that the facilities which their vessels offer for stowing away prohibited immigrants are not availed of. There can be no doubt that these unfortunate stowaways have to submit to horrible privations. I certainly do not wish to see them landed here,, but, at the same time, I do not desire to see unfortunate human beings used as the mere tools of agencies abroad, and called upon to undergo terrible privations, in order that those agencies may make a few pounds. It seems to me that this Bill is in the interests of the Asiatics themselves. The honourable member for Darling has very properly said that ship-owners who choose to employ a Chinese crew for the sake of economy must take the risk of Chinese being smuggled on board their vessels, and of their being called upon to pay a heavy fine for allowing them to land here. Ship-owners will now recognise the danger of employing Chinese crews, and if they do not see fit to employ white men, so that the presence of Chinese stowaways may be readily detected on board their vessels, they must take the consequences. The bulkheads of a vessel, and also the ventilating pipes are favourite places for planting dutiable goods, as well as stowing away human beings, and if expert searchers were employed, these and other parts of a vessel that lend themselves to such purposes would not escape their attention. We cannot hope to have a thorough system of inspection whilst mere clerks are employed to do this work. I support this Bill, and trust that the Minister will bring under the attention of the Minister of Trade and Customs the point I have made as to the need of strengthening the staff of searchers and examiners, and of securing expert men for the work.",30
175,Mr TUDOR,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,It was Customs officers who found these stowaways.,31
176,Mr WILKS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Quite so, but other stowaways must have been coming through. Either the officers are not as efficient as they ought to be, or there are not sufficient of them.",31
177,Mr ATKINSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Wilmot) [5.16] There is a large influx of undesirable immigrants in the wav the Minister has shown; and I hope the House will support this measure. This importation of undesirable immigrants is not only a flaunting of the law on the statute-book, but contains within itself great danger of the introduction of all sorts of diseases. I quite admit that the responsibility should be placed on the master of the vessel; but there should be some provision whereby he can demonstrate his ignorance of the presence of the stowaways, so that the penalty may be at the discretion of the magistrate. In the case that happened the other day, when thirty-two stowaways were found on a ship, it is clear that the master could not establish his innocence, because he must have had some knowledge of the fact. I should make it incumbent on n master to prove his innocence; that is, to show to the satisfaction of the Court that he had exercised all proper vigilance.. If a master were really innocent-thoug h it is not likely that many such cases will come before the Court- a fine of .£100 seems to me excessive; and, therefore, I suggest that there should be some discretion allowed, in the belief that the effectiveness of the measure would in no way be interfered with. I am glad that this matter has been taken in hand so promptly by the Government. While, perhaps, this measure represents all that we can do at present, there must be something wrong with the oversight that is exercised by the Department, because the facts that are within common knowledge show that this traffic has been' going on steadily for a long time. The Minister should endeavour to secure greater efficiency and better methods; and I quite agree with the honourable member for Dalley that the officers employed should have a knowledge of ships and of the various devices likely to be employed in the way of false linings, and so forth. I hope the Minister will adopt the suggestion I have made, but if he should not, the fact would not prevent my supporting the Bill.",31
178,Dr MALONEY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Melbourne) [5.21] This question of the influx of Asiatics was first definitely taken in hand by the late Mr Kingston, when Premier of South Australia, who declared that the leakage chiefly took place in the port of Sydney. At that time Mr Kingston had to fight the powers that be in the port I have just mentioned, because he could not there get the slightest assistance in carrying out a policv of exclusion. I have here a return which was prepared at the instance of Mr Kingston, showing that in the twelve months, ending 14th April, 1893, there had been a leakage of 667 Chinese as between the arrival of the steamer at Port Darwin, the first port of call, and the steamer leaving that port on returning to China.",31
179,Mr BATCHELOR,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,At that time there was a penalty of .£500 for every Chinaman introduced into South Australia.,32
180,Dr MALONEY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Accordin g to the return I have mentioned, the names of the ships concerned were the Airlie, Tsinan, Changsha, Guthrie, Chingtu, Cattertlcun, Taiyuan, and Menmuir. Some of these vessels belong to the Eastern and Australian Steam-ship Company; and in the press lately an officer in a high position in that corporation stated that their - vessels never engaged in such traffic. I throw this returni down as a challenge to that gentleman's veracity. At the time of which I speak, the following telegram was sent by Mr Kingston to the then Premier of New South WalesFurther inquiry at Port Darwin makes it apparently perfectly clear that the systematic evasion of the Chinese Immigration Restriction Acts, by which nearly 1,000 Chinese have been introduced into Australia during the last fifteen months, results from the laxity with which the law is administered in Sydney. I think that pressure might be brought to bear on the Judges who adjudicate on such cases in Hong Kong. This is a matter referred to in a little brochure which I published; and the truth of the statements I make can be proved on reference to the China Navigation Company. The quotation is as followsThe China Navigation Co. Ltd. is our best aud most direct means of communication with all the East. The company gives more encouragement than any other trading in foreign seas to young Australians whose desire is towards the ocean life. Seven of the officers of the Taiyuan were Australian born. Also, its representatives have fought a battle or two in our behalf in the way of keeping out bogus return passengers. They prosecuted an eminent Chinese merchant in Hong Kong for holding, and endeavouring to deal in, various bad nationalization papers. Some were forged, some bought from those who had no intention of returning themselves, but who were quite ready for a deal with any of their countrymen ready to take the risk of personation. The company, however, was, by an eminent English Judge, cast in costs, the law, as interpreted by the oracle, ordaining that it was the business of Australia to keep her own coasts in this way, and to deal with all cases as they occurred, and within her own gates. As a matter of fact, there were then upwards of T15 forged naturalization papers and certificates in the Court, and the Judge knew they were there; but in that b'ind fashion which is sometimes observed, he refused to confiscate them; and the shipping company was mulcted in costs for endeavouring to prevent this traffic, i think it only fair to the company to mention these facts. In the East, the Government of the United States spend large sums of money in quarantine administration ; so far do they go, that every officer of a ship, whether white or coloured, has to be vaccinated if they leave the port of Hong Kong for Manilla. IThe reason for this is that 1,100 dead bodies, including upwards of 200 cases of plague, smallpox, and cholera, are annually thrown into the streets of Hong Kong; and the Government of the United States insist that the Consul for the States shall vise every bill of health. I maintain that if the vessel which brought these stowaways to Australia, called at Manilla, those in charge broke the United States law, inasmuch as the men were not vaccinated before leaving the port. I think an arrangement might be entered into between the Commonwealth and the United States for joint action at Manilla, so as to prevent a recurrence of the evasion; and I suggest the employment of the use of carbonic acid gas. Of course, I have no desire to destroy human life, but I know that there is no better unionist than the Chinaman-seein g that 10,000 of them left work because one of them had been struck by an English official-and that none are more true to a combination when once they have made up their minds. Having regard to this characteristic, I tliink that if , in Hong Kong and. other eastern ports, carbonic acid gas under pressure were put into the holds so that every rat and insect, should be killed, ]no Chinaman would ever be induced to go below deck again.",32
181,Mr HENRV WILLIS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,The Chinamen know the effects of carbonic acid gas now.,32
182,Dr MALONEY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I can assure the honourable member that they do not. And I maintain further that the use of this gas would prove a most efficient means of preventing the introduction of Asiatic diseases. If the rats which carry the fleas containing the plague germs were killed before they could reach Australia, the chance of disseminating the disease in this country would be very much lessened. If we gave 75 per cent, of the ^100 fine to informers at the ports of call, very few stowaways would be left undiscovered, and if we gave 50 per cent, to informers at this end, very few would remain uncaught; but it is useless to give small rewards.",32
183,Mr BATCHELOR,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,We must be careful not to make it profitable to send stowaways for the sake of the fines.,33
184,Dr MALONEY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"The ' Chinese comprador system sufficiently guarantees the honesty of every person connected with English banking' and other companies in the East, even in Japan, and seeing that every Chinaman sent to Australia is worth at least .£200, it is easily credible that the shipping companies can protect themselves against loss. I do not say that the companies enter into agreements of this kind : but I know that they will not accept a Chinese passenger who may be returned to them unless they are protected against possible loss. We hear a great deal about our immigration restriction, but the shipping company trading between Hong Kong and Macao, a distance about as great as that between Melbourne and Geelong, is required, if it brings from the Portuguese port any European likely to be a burden on the rates of Hong Kong, to send him back to England, Germany, or whatever may be his native land. I sliould like the honourable and learned member for Parkes to give attention to that matter. The Chinese Navigation Company has had to instruct its officers to be most particular in regard to, not only second class, but also first class passengers, to protect itself from loss under this law. A ship's authorities, too, are liable to a fine of ;£roo if they take to India a white man who is unable to get a living there. I am tired of hearing of the harshness of our law. It is less severe than the laws of two countries I have named, which are governed absolutely from Downing-street. In India a white man has no privileges at all. The condition of stowaways, especially in the tropics, is pitiable in the extreme, and, notwithstanding the ingenuity with which the cargo is arranged to provide breathing spaces, I have no doubt that stowaways are often smothered. Only a short time ago it was telegraphed from America that a number of dead Chinamen were discovered in a box, under circumstances which indicated that they had been stowaways. Of course, should a death occur on board ship, the crew would get rid of the body by throwing it overboard. If a Chinese passenger were to die, however, it would be worth the while of the ship's surgeon to embalm the body, because there are societies in China which would pay a large sum on receiving it. The most profitable cargo that a vessel can have is dead Chinamen. For the conveyance of these bodies to China as much as ^100 each is paid.  thrown overboard.",33
185,Dr MALONEY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"No nation loves its dead or venerates its parents and grandparents more than do the Chinese, but the crew of a vessel has no means of preserving the body of a stowaway. It is necessary to watch the northern coasts of Australia much more strictly than has hitherto been done. No climate is too severe for men of this splendid race to live and thrive in, and if there is any laxity in our northern ports great numbers of them will find their way into Australia. I have known many Chinese living here, and have formed 1 friendships with some. When they have intermarried with white persons, they have generally brought up their families well, and what Chinese blood is in our community will in time disappear. What we have to guard against is the fresh influx of Chinese. We should join forces with the United States of America, which has already stood between us and the Asiatic races, and today does more than is done in any port in Australia to keep away disease. While I have quoted from a return showing that the strictures of the late Mr. Kingston in regard to the laxity of inspection at the port of Sydney were just, yet, speaking as a medical man, and a former ship's officer, I say that in no other part of the Commonwealth are ship's passengers, officers, and crews more keenly scrutinized on arrival from abroad than they are in Sydney. In regard to the Bill there is no party in this House. The honourable member for Parramatta on a former occasion spoke as strongly as any honourable member has spoken in favour of a White Australia. As he had been accused of not being in favour of a White Austialia originally, I referred to his earliest speeches in Hansard, but I find that he has always spoken as sincerely on this subject as any one could who had the matter at heart.",33
186,Mr DEAKI N,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Ballarat) [5.40] - It , would have been unnecessary for me, a supporter of the Bill, to add to the speeches which have been made, had it not been for the strictures which have been passed on some Customs officials. These are due perhaps to want of knowledge of the development of our administration in regard to immigration. In the first year of Federation hardly any stowaways were discovered, though attempts to evade the immigration law were made in other directions. For a time the Act was administered with a certain amount of liberality, because statistics showed the Chinese in Australia to be decreasing, but as the number of those coming - here showed no signs of growing less, the law was eventually administered more strictly. As the ordinary methods of admission were closed, the Chinese commenced - and a more ingenious race is not to be found - to devise means for defeating the law. For the sake of economy the administration of the Act was intrusted to the Customs officials. They, though efficient for their own particular work, did not always make satisfactory immigration oflicers, and others of greater special aptitude were substituted, until the service was fairly satisfactory throughout Australia, though in one or two ports some principal officers showed little interest in this part of their duties. Gradually the system has been improved. But as crevice after crevice has been closed, the greater has become the pressure on new means of entrance. Thus the trade in stowaways has been increasing under pressure. I can say from personal knowledge that within the last three years the system of inspection in every port in Australia has been revised, and means which it is not advisable to discuss on the floor of this chamber, have been adopted to prevent aliens from gaining admission to the Commonwealth. The statement of the Minister was most exhaustive, and rendered it unnecessary for those who advocate a stricter administration of the law to add anything, though he wisely refrained from saying much that might have been said as to the means adopted. It is highly desirable that the methods of the Department, which are varied from time to time, should remain unknown, so that there may be a useful uncertainty in the East as to when, where, and how searches will be made. One of the results of our latterly improved methods of inspection is the capture of the twenty stowaways to which re- ference has been made. It must be remembered, however, that no sooner is one entrance closed than another is opened. There have been persistent rumours of the introduction of Chinese away from the recognised ports, but, although on four or five occasions within the last three Mr Deakin. years we have carefully and quietly examined the districts in which this is alleged to take place, we have not discovered any infiltration worth mentioning. It is most probable that when the ports are hermetically sealed we shall have to become vigilant at places where it has not hitherto been necessary to keep guard, and it may be requisite to undertake more difficult and somewhat more expensive schemes than the Commonwealth has yet faced. The Minister may feel assured that he has the support of Parliament if he continues to perfect this side of the Department of which he has charge. If the Bill now before us proves satisfactory in this regard, we hope that he will not hesitate to take the necessary administrative steps to cope with any further directions, whatever they may be, that this infiltration will take. I believe it to be relatively very small, but if it were allowed to succeed in any particular direction, it would soon become large. If the Minister needs any further legislative authority after this, I venture to say that he will find this House at all times ready to supply it. It is hardly fair to criticise officers chosen and promoted for their ability and zeal in the discharge of their duties as Customs officers, because they do not readily, or at orice, adapt themselves to this entirely different course of dealing. We are really immensely indebted to the Customs Department as a whole, and to its officers^, for what they have done. If they are not perfect in this special field, the Minister may be satisfied that the House will support him in adding special officers. A method which we found very fruitful of results lies in multiplying the inducements to others outside the Customs to assist us in discovering any influx of Chinese. I think that by the extension of that method we can with fair effectiveness police any part of Australia which they are likely to enter. If we do not at once discover the means by which they get there, we can, at least, discover the fact of their entry, and be able to cope with the means afterwards. At least as much as I have said is due to the officers of the Department, some of whom have been exceptionally energetic, while those who have shown themselves at all indifferent in this particular work are being steadily stimulated.",33
187,Sir JOHN QUICK,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Bendigo) [5.49] A constituent of mine yesterday drew my attention to what he considered a gross injustice which it was intended to inflict by the Bill upon shipping proprietors. I think, however, after today's debate and the explanation given by the Minister and other honourable members, it will appear that there is strong justification for the proposed legislation. Although it appears on the face of it that the offence is merely - bringing a vessel into port having stowaways on board, there can be no doubt that the essence of that offence is founded upon some neglect or breach of duty. I am convinced of that after .hearing the explanation of the honourable member for Parkes, who has special knowledge of these matters. It is obvious that if the Customs - officers can discover the stowaways when the ship comes into port, the captain of the ship could either have prevented them from being secreted in the ship at the port of loading, or discovered them during the voyage. The proposed new offence is therefore practically founded upon the negligence of the captain in the original - preparation for the voyage, or upon some deliberate connivance on his part. - It is only right and proper that some duty should be imposed, either directly upon the ship-owner, .upon the captain, as representing the ship-owner, of seeing that^ prohibited immigrants are not sneaked into the territorial waters of the Commonwealth. After hearing the complaint of my constituent, I had decided to suggest that a proviso be added, to the effect that the captain should : be liable, unless he proved to the satisfaction of the Court, that such stowaway did not secrete himself on board through his negligence 01 connivance. But, &f.t|er hearing the debate, and the special opportunities which the captain has in supervising the loading of the cargo, inspecting the ship during the process, and seeing that there are no stray holes and corneis where stowaways can be concealed, and the further opportunities which he or his officers, agents, or servants have during the voyage of discovering prohibited immigrants on board, I have decided to abandon the suggestion. I think, on the whole, the objection can be met by the suggestion! of the honourable member for Parkes-that , if the captain proves that he has done his best, but failed to discover the stowaway, and has not been guiltv of negligence or connivance, so far as can be reasonably judged, the Court should be allowed to take those special circumstances into consideration in awarding - penalty.",34
188,Mr BRUCE SMITH,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"That' can only be done if the penalty is made "" not exceeding £lOO.""",35
189,Sir JOHN QUICK,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I think it is simply a maximum penalty, under the principal Act.",35
190,Mr BATCHELOR,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,It is a fixed penalty in the original Act.,35
191,Mr HUTCHISON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,How can you prove that he has exercised sufficient care?,35
192,Sir JOHN QUICK,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I propose to cast upon the captain the onus of proving that he was not guilty of negligence or connivance. If he shows that, the Court should have power either to let him off or to lessen the penalty. Such a provision would remove any grounds for complaint about drastic or unfair legislation. I am now convinced, however, that it is not necessary to go to the extent of putting in the proviso that I had intended to propose, so long as the Court has jurisdiction in dealing with each particular case to adjust the penalty according to the aggravating or mitigating circumstances of the act. It might be .very hard, in a case where, for instance, a man concealed himself in a or well with his head just above the top of the water, to detect him. There might be other cases where stowaways escape the utmost vigilance and resourcefulness of the captain in his search. If the captain proved that he has done everything possible, his efforts to comply with the law might be taken into consideration. On the other hand, the point occurs to me that if the Customs officers are able to discover the stowaway, the captain should also be able to do so.",35
193,Mr BATCHELOR,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"And they .discover him in a few hours, while the captain and his officers have at least sixteen days in which to do so.",35
194,Sir JOHN QUICK,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"That appears to be the answer. I should like the Minister to take into consideration, the question whether the fine can be adjusted according to the enormity of the offence.",35
195,Mr GLYNN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Unde r the Acts Interpretation Act of 1904, the penalty specified means the maximum penalty.",35
196,Sir JOHN QUICK,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"That meets the point. I think, therefore, that when the facts justifying this legislation become well known, there will be no grounds for the outcry which we are accustomed to hear at times against Federal legislation. There is a general concurrence of opinion that our the White Australia policy should be enforced as effectually as possible, and that there should be no possibility of leakage or filtration ofprohibited immigrants through loopholes such as have been discovered by law. the stowaways. I am glad to have the assurance of the late Prime Minister that the greatest amount of supervision was gradually exercised by his Administration, and that methods of inspection have improved and increased. The Customs omcers at the various ports deserve the greatest praise and credit for the vigilance by which they have discovered stowaways in the cases that have been brought before Parliament and the country. There is ground whatever for attacking them or accusing them of neglect of duty. The officers who discovered the twenty Chinadecision men on board the Eastern ought to have their services recognised in a very substanCompany tial way. By their action they promptly brought under the attention of the country the evil which it is now proposed to remedy. It seems absolutely impossible that twenty Chinamen could be concealed on board a steamer, as those men were, without negligence or connivance on part of the captain or his officers, servants, or agents. My only doubt was whether captain might not have some slight ground of excuse for failing to discover a stray of Mr. Chinaman who got into some out-of-the-way hole or corner. At any rate, there should be a difference between the case of twenty Chinamen and one solitary violation of the law. After all, the offence is not allowing the man to enter the Commontion wealth, but of bringing him into port. was While in port he is still outside the Cuswaters of toms house line of defence, and may not be able to land. He is not a prohibited immigrant until he has actually landed without passing the education test. The new offence lies in his being secreted on board the ship, and being brought into territorial waters of the Commonwealthnot into the territory of the Commonwealth itself. The point which I was troubled about might be met by allowing the Court, in each case, to. adjust the punishment cording to the seriousness of the negligence or the suspicion of connivance which may exist.",35
197,Mr GLYNN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Angas) [5.58] - If the evil does exist to the extent mentioned by posite offence. the Minister-and in this he seems to be supported by the honourable member Ballarat-w e must make the legislation fairly stringent, because, if. there are stowlead aways now, and there is a possibility of their not being detected, we may soon have in a very large stream of them coming in. At any rate, the practice is a defiance of the At the same time, I would urge the modification of the Bill in the direction that has been suggested, so that where it is clearly shown that the master of the vessel is not conscious of the existence of the been stowaway, and has done everything that could reasonably be required of him in the way of search at the port of loading and throughout the voyage, he should be exempt from these provisions. I say that for a reason quite independent of those urged no by other honourable members. It is quite possible that this legislation may be held to be bad if it is too drastic. We had a in the case of Kingston v. th«Peninsula and Oriental Steam Navigation in 1903. A vessel, clearing out from one port of the Commonwealth, was exempted from liability to duty by the sealsbeing affixed. Those were not to be broken, in any way, but when the vessel entered another port of the Commonwealth it was found that the seals had been broken, the something having been done within the territorial waters of the Commonwealth be the fore the vessel cleared out. BRUCE SMITH - The offence was that coming into port with broken seals.",36
198,Mr GLYNN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Not altogether. The Court held in that case that the offence was a composite one; that the privilege of exthat of emption from Customs duty, on condiof non-consumption, was granted, and indicated by a seal having been affixed whilst the vessel was in the territorial the Commonwealth; that subsequently the vessel went beyond the territorial limits, and returned with the seals broken. That was the primary chargethe seals that were properly affixed within the territorial limits of the Commonwealth, the as an indication of exemption from duty, were afterwards broken.",36
199,Mr BRUCE SMITH,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,I think that the honourable member is giving too much promiacnence to the fixing of the seals.,36
200,Mr GLYNN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I do not desire the fact that we have always spoken of it as the "" broken seals case "" to be deceptive. The Privy Council declared that it was a com",36
201,Mr BRUCE SMITH,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,But this Bill profor vides for another sort of offence.,36
202,Mr GLYNN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I am endeavouring to up to that. It may be different in the sense of being more objectionable from the point of view of international law, since there is absent from the offence the element - of something being done in territorial waters, before the voyage commences, on a - condition not subsequently respected. That is the point. The whole offence under this Bill is that of coming into our territorial waters with something having been done - outside over which we have no control.",36
203,Mr BRUCE SMITH,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,No ; the offence is bringing in men who are prohibited immigrants.,37
204,Mr GLYNN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"The offence under this Bill is different from that to which I have just referred. In this case a vessel clears out, not from a Commonwealth, but from a foreign, port, and the main offence for which we propose to punish the master is that of clearing out from a foreign port with stowaways on board. It may be hypertechnical, but I wish to point out that this Bill goes so close to violating a primary .principle of English jurisprudence that, if we are not careful, it may be held to be toad. It is just possible that the principle embodied in the Customs Act, by which we declare that the mere averment that an offence has been committed shall be primd facie evidence that it has been committed, may be held to be bad. The de'Cisions that have been given up to the present with regard to these primd facie assumptions are that they are, although valid, altogether repugnant principles of English law. The question has been raised, but a decision of the final Court of Appeal has not yet been given. Clause 3 is a drastic provision, since it seeks to declare a man a prohibited immigrant contrary to fact. Under it we assume that a stowaway, unless it can be shown that he had previously passed the education test, is a prohibited immigrant, although when he is asked by an officer to pass it, he is capable of doing so. This Bill is incorporated with the Immigration Restriction Act of 1901, and the amending Act of 1905, and the definition of "" prohibited immigrant"" in the Act of 1905 determines its scope. ""prohibited immigrant "" under the principal Act is one who is unable to pass at dictation a certain language test, and under clause 3 of this Bill, it is declared that if a stowaway, within the meaning of a subsequent definition, is found on a vessel on its arrival here, he will be presumed to be a prohibited immigrant, although he has never been subjected to the education test, and, notwithstanding that, when he is, in the regular course, in a position to be subjected to it, he passes it. That seems to be repugnant to all principles of justice. A man is to be convicted for doing something that he has not done. Unless we are careful as to the phraseology we employ, the Court may hold that this provision is bad, as being too great a limitation upon the general principles of international law. I would suggest, therefore, for that reason alone, that we should provide that if a captain can prove that he has not been guilty of negligence-that he has taken every reasonable precaution-h e shall be exempt from the provisions of the. Bill. I accept the statement of the Minister that the facts justify the introduction of this measure, although we know that we have often been influenced by scares in passing legislation with regard to coloured immigrants. In 1888, the arrival of the steamer Afghan with some hundreds of Chinese on board gave rise to a great scare. It was said that we were to be swamped with Chinese immigrants, and a meeting of the Premiers of the States was called, with the result that the more drastic immigration restriction laws of the States were initiated. That scare was not justified, because it was shown that the arrival of the Chinese by the Afghan was merely a spasmodic influx, and that during the preceding two decades there had been a steady-decline in the number of to the Chinese who came to and remained in the States. We must, however, accept what the Administration tell us, and perhaps on the whole they are justified.",37
205,Mr BAMFORD,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Herbert) [6.10] - We have reason to congratulate ourselves upon the way in which this Bill has been received. At one time in the history of the Parliament it would have met with a hostile - reception.,37
206,Mr MCWILLIAMS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Every one desires that the law shall be carried out.,37
207,Mr BAMFORD,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"When the first Immigration Restriction Bill was introduced in this House there was a good deal of opA position to it, and many arguments were used against its becoming law.",37
208,Sir JOHN FORREST,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,We have had similar legislation in the States for the last twentv years.,37
209,Mr BAMFORD,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Quite so, but the right honourable member knows that a good deal of opposition was displayed in this Chamber to the passing of the'first Immigration Restriction Bill.",37
210,Sir JOHN FORREST,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,I do not think so.,37
211,Mr BAMFORD,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"It was hotly debated and much opposition was shown to it. It is pleasing to find that honourable members now realise that every effort must be to preserve the health of the people the purity of our race. The honourable member for Ballarat complimented the cers of the Department of Trade toms on their diligence in searching vessels and discovering stowaways. 1, too, gration; wish to compliment them, but at the same time. I find fault with the Department. On many occasions I have urged in this House the desirableness of making a more prehensive and exhaustive examination of vessels from the East. coming down the Queensland coast. I believed-and subseappointed quent events have shown that my belief shall was well founded-that large quantities of opium were being introduced by such vesing sels. I suggested to the then Minister at hibited what point the opium was coming in, and pointed out that there were only six searchers in the service, five of whom were stacurred tioned in Sydney. In such circumstances, not how could vessels be properly examined? The Customs officers 'in the smaller ports of the Commonwealth have a great deal of work to do. They have often, to work very paid, long hours and to ask them to make exappointed haustive examinations of these vessels is some cases to request them to put a strain upon their powers of endurance. Nevertheless they have done good work, and I think that the Department has a step in the right, direction by appointing more searchers, although it has been very dilatory in doing so. I also had informawhere tion regarding some of the ships carrying shall cargoes of frozen meat from Australia to labour, the East. On the return voyage the retion frigerating chambers on these empty, and the shoots which carry from the machines to the chambers are also supposed to be empty. But in some cases assist there has not been wanting evidence that these shoots have been occupied beings. I do not know whether steps have been taken to examine them since I called attention to the matter, but they certainly offer a stowaway a means of secreting himbers self during portion of the voyage, and ""there is ample evidence that in some cases they have been so occupied. It has been urged by some honourable members that provision for the imposition of a penalty ;£ioo under this Bill should be so amended as to provide for a penalty "" not exceedhave ing "" ,£100. The right honourable member for Swan has referred to the Immigration Restriction Acts of the States, and I pose to draw the attention of the House Mr Bamford. .an Act that was passed by the Reid Admade ministration in New South Wales in 1898. and Some honourable members of the Opposition in this House supported that Ministry, and offipossibly one or two of them were members and Cusof it. The Act is described asAn Act to place certain restrictions on immito provide for the removal from theColony of prohibited immigrants; to imposecertain disabilities upon them whilst in the Colony; and for other purposes incidental to, or consequent upon, the before-mentioned objects. comSection 8 of that Act is as follows: The master and owners of any vessel from which any prohibited immigrant may be landed before such immigrant is passed by an officer, for that purpose by the Government be jointly and severally liable to a penalty of One hundred pounds in respect of the landas aforesaid from his vessel of any proimmigrant, and to a further penalty of Twenty pounds for each such immigrant solanded in excess of the number of five : Provided that the total amount of penalties inin any one voyage of the vessel shall exceed Five thousand pounds, and the vessel' may be made executable by a decree of theSupreme Court in satisfaction of any such-, penalty, and the vessel may be refused a clearance outwards until such penalty has been -, and until provision has been made by the master, to the satisfaction of an officerunder this Act, for a conveyance out in of the Colony of each prohibited immigrant too great who may have been so landed. There is no qualification whatever there,, the amount being stated definitely. Sectaken tion 14 of the same Act provides-^ The penalty for any contravention of this* Act, or of any regulation made thereunder no higher penalty is expressly imposed, not exceed a fine of Fifty pounds sterling, or imprisonment, with or without harduntil payment of such fine or an addito such fine, but not exceeding in anyvessels are case three months. the air Then section 10 providesAny person who shall in any way wilfullv any prohibited immigrant to contravene the provision of this Act, shall be deemed tc by human have contravened this Act. That Act was passed ten years ago in New South Wales, and is similar to our principal Act; and, therefore, honourable memopposite cannot take exception to the provisions of the Bill in this connection. I rose particularly to express my keen disappointment that the Bill, which is one to the amend the Immigration Restriction Act. of does not go further. Had it been described simply as a Stowaway Act I should not much fault to find with it ; but. under the circumstances, I am surprised that no provision is made to meet an emergency toprowhich reference has been made on many to occasions by members of the Labour Party.. How is it that there is no clause providing that men may not be landed here for what is neither more nor less than strike breaking?",37
212,Mr BATCHELOR,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,That is more a matter for a Bill dealing with contract labour.,39
213,Mr BAMFORD,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Not so; because, in the opinion of the late Mr Kingston, Sir Edmund Barton, and the late Attorney-General,, men, who otherwise would be regarded as amenable to the provisions of the Immigration Restriction Act, mav be landed and allowed to remain here for six months or longer, the only condition being that, when the vessel which brought them sails, they must go with her. Indeed, the state of affairs which I have indicated has already arisen. In Sydney, during the coal lumpers' strike, men were brought - into the harbour and placed on punts, which, under the Act, is technically a landing, and were permitted to work in the place of the strikers; and the authorities were powerless to interfere. There was a similar occurrence at Pinkenba. near Brisbane, where men were landed on the wharfs and worked as labourers; and I repeat that I am much disappointed that the Government have not availed themselves of the opportunity to make the Act sufficiently comprehensive to prevent this sort of evasion.",39
214,Dr WILSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,We may have another opportunity when there is more time. ',39
215,Mr BAMFORD,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I am afraid that the honourable member would not be found very liberal in his attitude towards' such a measure. I believe that the leakage, referred to by the honourable member for Ballarat, does go on along the north-west coast of Australia; and I do not see how it is to be prevented, unless there is a cruiser provided to patrol those waters. Malays come across in their boats for the pearl-fishing; and there is nothing to prevent trie landing of men, in return for liberal passage money, and their gradually drifting into the settled portions of the country.",39
216,Dr WILSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Eve n if we had a flotilla of cruisers we could scarcely prevent the landing of men on a coast-line so long.,39
217,Mr BAMFORD,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"The coast-line, though extensive, has only a limited area where men would be likelv to land, and that is, possiblv, somewhere between Port Darwin and Kimberley. Under present conditions there is ample opportunity to lancl undesirable immigrants, and that there is a desire to do so., is shown by the case of the Eastern. Chinese risk their lives on vessels bound down the coast, because by so doing they are brought directly to the populous centres, where their fellow countrymen are to be found; and I think that there must be many undiscovered cases. These ships arrive every fortnight; and, in view of recent events, it may be assumed that on every trip, Chinese,: in greater or lesser numbers, are brought. No doubt it is a compliment that these men should risk their lives in order to obtain admission to Australia, for if the country had not a good reputation, they would not display such anxiety to come here. I do not at present see how I can move an smendment to meet the case of strike-breakers to which I have referred; and I only express my regret that the Government have made no provision to prevent the landing of men under such circumstances.",39

We are beginning to realise at last that the Government intend to proceed with the various planks of the Labour platform, seeing that this BilP represents the first plank, namelv, a White Australia. It is rather unfortunate, however, that the policy embodied in the Bill is one accepted by every section of the House.",39

Now that we have set our hands to the plough, we should not turnback under any circumstances. The older I grow the more I am convinced that a pohcy of the kind must be pursued, particularly when we find how extremely difficult the racial question is becoming in other countries. And now that we have incurred considerable expense in this connection, and, if I may sav so, some international danger, we should do the work thoroughly, and see that the Acts we have already passed are' not evaded. Of course, we must provide that an innocent offender is not unduly punished, while insisting on ship-owners-who , as a rule, are wealthy men-anc l captains, officers, and crews', taking every precaution.",39
222,Unknown,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 7.45 - p.m.,39
223,Dr WILSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"The honourable member for Herbert gave some amusing instances of the manner in which stowaways have hidden themselves on board ship. I should not like to speak disparagingly of China men, but, considering the way in which these men try to get into Australia in fiance of the law, they must be regarded with as little sympathy as we give to burgdiscovered lars. Their attempts to evade the law been strange enough to give material an interesting novel. In one case, a numhindered ber were packed on top of the"" boilers. Perhaps they selected that place to disinat fect themselves by the heat, so that they should not introduce disease. The honoring able member also spoke of the possibility of stowaways being carried in the refriceive gerating chambers. That could be done - only by the connivance of persons on board. mised this reward. Perhaps they would be taken cheaply, back loading is' taken by our carriers, though, if by^any mistake the refrigerating machinery was set in motion, they would probably be converted into frozen produce, and the thawing would be a very difficult process. Men have hidden themselves the water tanks, others in the smoke box. The case has its serious side when we conto sider how likely it is that disease may introduced by these stowaways. The honficult orable member for Bass is aware that outbreak of small-pox occurred in Tassummary mania because of germs in clothing which had been shut up in a box for twenty years or more. When the clothing was sorted, persons living in the house attacked with the disease. When smallstowaways, pox, cholera, plague, or any other epidemic breaks out in the East, the people become ter has no knowledge of the facts. very frightened, and, no doubt, many to get away to other places. Should such persons succeed in evading our Customs and quarantine authorities, they might bring into Australia the germs of any of these awful diseases. Though quite healthy really no penalty. themselves, they might carry disease germs in their clothing. One of our most imporcan. tant duties is the protection of the public health, and for this reason alone we should do all that is possible to prevent the migration of undesirable aliens. The honunderstand, orable member for Herbert said that, bably, many Chinese are landed on our north-west and northern coasts, and in Northern Territory. We have such an - enormous coastline, and the country is sparsely populated, that it is almost possible to prevent this. If we used - cruisers to intercept the vessels which supposed to bring these people, we should need a great number of them. One vessel would be of little use. Seeing how much stowaways can stand, it seems likely that Chinese put ashore with but a small supply : of provisions, could exist for a long time dewhere there was water, and might ultimately reach centres of population without it being that they had been smuggled into have the country. A way in which the smugfor gling of Chinese into Australia might be would be to employ officers whose duty it would be to board Eastern vessels their first port of call in Australia, and to travel with them round the coast, maksearches for stowaways while at sea. I understand that the Customs officials rejQ$ for every alien stowaway discovered, and these officers could be proThis would be an as additional incentive to keenness, though, as a rule, our officials do their work well without the expectation of anything in addition to their salaries. Should stowaways be discovered, the masters or officers of the vessel carrying them should, on reaching in Sydney, Brisbane, or Melbourne, be prosecuted and fined. It might be necessary appoint a dozen of these inspectors, but be their employment would render it more diffor stowaways to escape detection. an The Bill makes a ship-master liable, on conviction, to a penalty of £ 1 0 0 for each stowaway j but 1 think that the penalty should be ""not less than £ i o o . "" It may be that some one under his comwere mand has connived at the presence of because of a profit which he makes out of the business, while the masIn try such a case, it would be unfair to make the master liable to.such a heavy penalty.",40

225,Dr WILSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I do not know that they When Chinamen, returning to Australia, die on board ship, the surgeon and chief officer are paid for preserving the imbody, and returning it to China. This, I is provided for in the passage promoney. I believe the amount is generally paid to the chief officer and the doctor, the and I dare say some of the crew participate for lending their services. The Bill so might be modified in dealing with the masimter, because he may not have the slightest knowledge of the breach of the law. No are owner or captain of a vessel encourages stowaways. It has always been the cusfor tom when stowaways are found! to put them ashore if possible at the first port away. of call. I found that stowaways discovered on vessels that I have been on were treated very roughly by the master.",40

227,Dr WILSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"It is quite possible none of that money goes to the master or the owners. If it does, then the men are not stowaways but really passengers, beagain. cause their passage money is paid. The master of a big modern vessel would not lend himself to that sort of thing.",41

I wish to see some provision made so that innocent men may not be punished. We should be fair. It is quite impossible the master of a vessel to go into all the places where these men might be stowed",41
241,Mr WATSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,He would get at the same result by punishing the officer who allowed it to be done.,41
242,Dr WILSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Unles s the master has legal recourse upon the officer who is responsible, it will be impossible for him to that punish him to the extent of the fine.",41
243,Mr WATSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,He would punish him enough to be sure that he would not do it,41
244,Dr WILSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Unti l the articles are fulfilled the master cannot dismiss the officer.,41

246,Dr WILSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"It would be difficult for the master to prove that the officer had guilty knowledge. In cases of this kind we are dealing with some of the wiliest men on the face of the .earth. I am glad to notice in new section 9B we are taking the be power of search. It is necessary that the CommonAvealth should have it, if only in connection with the quarantine laws. Stowaways might introduce serious diseases into Australia, and. we must have power tovessels to prevent that. Does the Minister intend to provide in this Bill for the quite modern form of stowaway known as materialized mandarins? The possibilities of airships and of mediums are soin these days that materialized aliens This Bill' an opportunity to guard against that danger. I have noticed that cases of goods they containing condensed milk and similar articles are branded "" stow away from still boilers."" Someprovision should be made in the Bill for branding these prohibited' immigrants in the same way. In the winter time, when the weather is very cold in those northern ports, the searchers might be instructed to pay special attention to vicinity of the boilers, while in summer to they would do well to adopt the suggestion of the honourable member for Herbert, and The Bill must afford a great deal of assistance to the Minister and Parliament in carrying out the White Australia policy, to which we intend to adhere at all costs' If it is as effective as we hope, the leakage will be so small as to become almost infinitesimal, and we shall be able to show to the rest of the world that it is possible to carry out such a policy with very little friction and with great benefit. The final result must be to the great advantage of the whole - of the people of Australia.",41
247,Mr KNOX,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Kooyong) [8.14] - I can hardly imagine that any honourable member who has previously supported the White Australia policy wilT refuse to accept the general principle of the Bill . Recent revelations have made it necessary to give to those who administer the Immigration Restriction Acts, greater power of search ancl of punishment, and consequently I shall support the second reading of the measure. But we are entitled to ask the Minister to amend clause 3 so as not to - make it absolutely mandatory on the Court, without considering extenuating circumstances, to inflict a fine of ,£100 in every case.",42
248,Mr BRUCE SMITH,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"The Minister is going to modify that by inserting the words "" not more than.""",42
249,Mr KNOX,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I am glad to hear it. A fine of this inflexible character may seriously affect masters of vessels who have no criminal intent, and have - exercised, to the best of their ability, the necessary precautions in dealing with a class of people who display considerable cleverness in evading observation as stowaways. I think that we shall all agree with the principle of the Bill , and I accept the assurance that the provision as to the penalty to be imposed will be modified. The Bill will have a valuable effect in preventing the introduction of disease, and the power of inspection which it confers will be a wise and desirable addition to those which the authorities already possess. I am satisfied that commercial men outside will agree that the House was perfectly justified in passing a measure of this character in order that there may be no evasion of the law in respect of a class of immigration that must 'be limited, and, in some cases, absolutely restricted. I think that the Bill will be accepted, and I hope that, subject to the modification I have mentioned, it will - speedilv become law.",42
250,Mr KELLY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Wentworth) [8.17] - Like other honourable members on all sides of the House, I recognise that some such Bill as this is necessary to deal with a danger that has recently become all too apparent. Mr WIT . KS - It is becoming a traffic.",42
251,Mr KELLY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"It is becoming, apparently, almost a traffic. I have risen, not so much to express my views in that regard, as to suggest to the Minister one or two improvements that I think might be made in the Bill . For instance, one of the most important provisions deals with the power that the Commonwealth takes to detain for a reasonable time, for the purposes of search, any vessel upon the Australian coast line. I wish to point out to the Minister that that power may be abused, not by the Commonwealth officers- I do not anticipate that they are likely to abuse it-bu t by persons who desire to inconvenience the master or owners of a vessel trading on the Australian coast. Let us assume, for instance, that in a Queensland port, some one, who has a grudge against a certain shipping company, lodges with the Customs officers there the information that, deep in the hold of one of that company's vessels, lie four and twenty gentlemen of China. The Customs authorities of that port then proceed to unload the vessel, in order to make a reasonable search. They go to the trouble of searching the hold for these aristocrats beyond the seas, and find none, and yet the vessel has been detained while this fruitless search was being made. It is in order to prevent such an occurrence, that I suggest that this provision might be hedged about with a safeguard, making it a punishable offence for any one to knowingly lodge a false information against any ship. The word "" knowingly "" is almosf too wide, because it would allow a way of escape, but any one who wilfully misleads Commonwealth officers into the belief that there are stowaways on a vessel, and so subjects them as well as the vessel to a waste of valuable time, ought to be severely punished. I make this suggestion in the hope that the Minister, when we reach the Committee stage, will draft some such amendment as I have outlined. With such a provision inserted, I think there could be very little objection to the Bill. As to the point raised by the honourable member for Kooyong regarding the maximum penalty of ,£100, I am not quite clear as to whether this Bill would come within the scope of the Acts Interpretation Act which provides that any 'penalty mentioned in an Act shall be the maximum.",42
252,Mr CROUCH,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,That is only where the penalty appears as a foot-note to a section.,42
253,Mr KELLY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,I thought that that was so. I do not think there would be any harm in making a fine of £ 1 0 0 the maximum penalty.,42
254,Mr BATCHELOR,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,It is absolute in the mittee. original Act.,43
255,Mr KELLY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"If it is the absolute to feel secure. penalty under that Act, then it would seem that it ought to be the absoof Mr. lute penalty in this case, since the express my appreciation Bill deals with a far more serious which honourable members of offence than that of landing a prohibited measure.

257,Mr KELLY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Unde r the last clause the Bill a master has power to clear himdoes self. I admit that the chief officer who, believe, supervises the loading of these sels, and must therefore have far greater opportunities and knowledge than the master himself, would probably be in a position to imperil the master and the whole ship's company.",43
258,Mr WILKS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"The second officer usually supervises the loading, but the chief officer is responsible.",43
259,Mr KELLY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"We have to place the responsibility somewhere. The captain, uncier existing usage, has to take the sponsibility for the navigation of his sel, although, in all probability, it is chief officer who lays the course, and does most of the work in that regard.",43
260,Mr WATSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Excep t in difficult parts.,43
261,Mr KELLY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"And in that case, the master voluntarily takes up the work, make sure that no mistake will be made. This fixing of the responsibility upon masters will have the result of making them particularly careful to see that the loading of their vessels at ports of call in the East is properly carried out, that no spaces are left where men might be stowed away. The honourable member Melbourne once made the noble suggestion that these vessels should be filled with carbonic acid gas. If they were, could live below, but the only weakness of the proposal is that it would be somewhat difficult to get the gas out again, since it always sinks. I do not wish to detain the House further. This is not a party question. I think that, with one exception, honourable members endorse the principle of a White Australia, and I hope, therefore, that the Minister will accept friendly suggestions in Comconditions. If that be done, a measure may emerge such as will give us every reason BATCHELOR (Boothby-Minister External Affairs) [8.26] - I desire to the spirit in have greeted this House is to prevent any evasion of the law, and that all parties are agreed upon the absolute necessity of keeping Australia white. Durthe debate several amendments have been suggested that might, or might not, imAs to the criticism of the honourable member for Herbert, that the of Bill does not go far enough, in that it not apply to contract immigrants, or I place a prohibition upon a ship's crew vestaking the place of men on strike at ports of call on the Australian coast, I admit at once that it does not attempt to do anything of the kind. It is designed to deal with a matter of extreme urgency, and it has the advantage of not being highly controversial. At this stage of the session, it would be absurd for the Government to bring down a proposal that had no reasonable chance of being carried. The House is practically unanimous as to the redesirableness of passing the Bill as it vesstands, and we may therefore look forward his to a clear passage. As to the penalty for which it provides, I admit that there is some force in the contention bf those who say it is somewhat hard that a master who has taken every reasonable precaution to to discover stowaways on board his vessel should be subjected to the same fine the as is one who has not done so. I would point out, however, that offences under this measure will be dealt with by Judges in the different States, and that if we and made £ 1 0 0 the maximum penalty we might have different fines imposed in refor spect of the same offence.",43
262,Mr BRUCE SMITH,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,No two offences no person can be exactly parallel.,43

265,Mr BRUCE SMITH,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"And the alternative is that we should have the same punishment imposed for different offences. . Mr WATSON - Then let us increase the maximum. ' Mr BATCHELOR - The honourable member's suggestion is worthy of consideration. We must remember what the possibilities are. If we do not stop this business of carrying stowaways, we shall expose Australia to the peril of an absolute abrogation of the quarantine' laws. penalty ought to be sufficient to act as a deterrent, though I do not say that the minimum must necessarily be the maximum. The honourable member for Robertson suggested that it would be a scandal, amounting almost to a miscarriage of justice, if the punishment amounted to some few pounds per head for bringing a number of Chinese stowaways here.",44

271,Mr GLYNN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Angas) [8.35] - There is certainly a difficulty in leaving it to the various Courts throughout the Commonwealth to say whether an offender shall be fined is. or .£100. For exactly similar offences we might have a captain fined ,£5 in one Court and .£100 in another; and that would undoubtedly create a strong sense of dissatisfaction. In my opinion, the minimum ought to be made fairly low.",44
272,Mr BRUCE SMITH,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Le t it be not less than ,£25 or more than .£100.",44
273,Mr BATCHELOR,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,At present the Bill is consistent with the principal Act.,44

275,Mr WILKS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Dalley) [8.37] - Fro m any what has been said by the honourable memthe ber for Angas this evening, I gather that he is desirous of reducing this penalty in the interests of the captain. But, while it is true that a captain who brought only one on stowaway might suffer an injustice if the secminimum were made high, I cannot underthe stand how there could be any injustice in the case of a captain who brought thirty stowaways. The more stowaways there are, the higher should be the penalty, because there would be reasonable suspicion of connivance; and I do not think that the minimum should be less than ,£100, if we are to insure greater care on the part of the officers of ships.",44
276,Mr CROUCH,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Corio) [8.39] - I should be sorry if the minimum lowered, because it seems to me that the fines inflicted would depend upon the political colour of the magistrate. toria, under the Factories Act, the fines inflicted by magistrates who did not approve of the legislation were often ridiculously inadequate, sometimes being as low as is.; and in other Acts of the State care has been taken to meet the case of justices who try, not to administer the law, but to impress their own views on the country. If we fix the minimum at ,£25, we shall find it very rarely exceeded. If an alternative is desired, let the honourable member for Angas move that the fine be not less than j£roo or more than ,£125 or .£150. a prohibited immigrant is brought here in a fairly open manner, the captain must be fined £100, while in the case of a stowaway it is proposed that the penalty may be only £25.",45

278,Mr CROUCH,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"The honourable member seems to sympathize with the captain who errs inadvertently; but I point out that, under the present Act. such inadvertence incurs a penalty of ,£100, and I have heard no complaint on that score.",45
279,Mr WATSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"South Sydney) [8.42]. - Unde r the first Immigration Restriction Act, the penalty was one not exceeding .£100, with the result that in New South Wales, where, I suppose, the magistrates are just as good as the average, the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, from 1901 to 1905, when the amending Act was passed, committed offences month after month, and were never fined more than £ 5 . Such a fine was, of course, no deterrent; and the Government were compelled to make the penalty .£100, after which there was a marked falling off in the number of convictions.",45
280,Sir JOHN FORREST,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,How did the company manage to avoid offending?,45
281,Mr WATSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,The higher penalty caused the company to exercise stricter supervision.,45
282,Sir JOHN FORREST,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,But the company are fined a good many times now.,45

Should a captain "" declare"" all the stowaways on board there will be no penalty to pay. Had the carrying of stowaways without reporting them been an offence making the ship's master liable to a heavy fine, the officers of the Eastern would probably have discovered the twenty-two men who were found by the Customs officials. Is it to When be imagined that some of the crew did not know that they had stowaways on board? The men could not have travelled all the way in the cargo holds.",45
285,Dr WILSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,The captain may not have known about them.,45
286,Mr WATSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I do not say that he did ; but had the officers known that they would be held responsible, and that their positions depended on their vigilance, the stowaways would probably have been found. If an officer knew that neglect to find stowaways would make him liable to be put off at the first port, he would exercise every precaution, because when a man loses his billet through negligence,' and has that marked on his "" discharge,"" he does not find it easy to get another. Unless there is a substantial minimumpenalty, the Bill may be merely waste paper.",45

288,Mr WATSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I prefer the amount fixed in the principal Act; but in an aggravated case I would increase the penalty. In .my opinion, we should retain the minimum penalty of £,100.",45

It is not rich corporations that we propose' to mulct, but masters of vessels whose average pay is from ^ 2 0 to £ 2 5 a month.' We do not suspect that they connive at the introduction of aliens unknown to the authorities, but we throw on them the nominal and actual responsibility for the negligence of the subordinates whom they control. The honourable member for South Sydney has relied upon an illustration which seems to me to scarcely bear on the case. The offence of which he spoke is that of allowing prohibited immigrants, known to be on board, to escape. honourable member for Dalley, too, is dwelling on the one case only-that of the twenty-two Chinamen who were discovered on the Eastern, who might have had the plague. It must be recognised that masters cannot always be considered personally liable for actual negligence, because in foreign ports they are generally at the office of the agent while their vessels are loading under the supervision of their officers and the stevedores. But as the legal head of the ship, we make the master responsible in order that he may be stricter with those under his control. I stated this afternoon that I thought that there should be a minimum and a maximum penalty, and that discretion in determining the amount of the fine should be left to the magistrates. It is a reflection on them to say that they cannot be trusted To impose the proper penalty in every case.",45
290,Mr WATSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I gave an instance in point. Mx. BRUCE SMITH - It was not necessarily in point. Magistrates are not all alike. There was no evidence that the men concerned were not ordinary sailors who had undergone medical examination, and whom it would have been no heinous offence to let into the country. happen that, notwithstanding all the precautions of the captain and his officers, a stowaway remains undiscovered until the vessel unloads, and if it were proved to the satisfaction of the magistrate that everything had been done, though in vain, to discover his presence there, it would be a hardship to impose the maximum fine. The question is, shall a captain who is receiving only £ 2 0 or £ 2 5 a month, and has - made every effort, though in vain, to prevent a stowaway from travelling on his vessel, be subject to the maximum fine; or shall we vest a. discretion in the magistrates which will allow of the imposition of a minimum fine of £ 2 5 ? The amount of the fine should depend on the gravity of the offence. We must assume that our magistrates are reasonable men, who will administer the law honestly, and are capable of dealing with these offences as the circumstances dictate. I suggest to the honourable and learned member for 1 Angas that he should use the words "" not less than £ 2 5 nor more than , £ 1 5 0 . "" I can conceive of cases in which a fine of £ 1 0 0 would be insufficient punishment, because it might happen that the master had knowingly brought stowaways, in the hope The of getting a substantial reward by conniving at their escape.",46
291,Mr SAMPSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Mak e the minimum fine £ 5 0 and the maximum ^ 1 5 0 .,46
292,Mr BRUCE SMITH,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I think that the magistrates should be permitted to make the fine as low as £ 2 5 for each stowaway, because it is possible for an individual stowaway to travel on a ship without detection, notwithstanding the closest search by the captain and his officers.",46
293,Mr HUGHES,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"West Sydney - At torney-General) [8.57] - The action which we now propose has been forced on the Government by continual evasions of the law. The Act of 1901 provided a penalty not exceeding ,£100, but the magistrates almost invariably imposed fines which were too small to have any deterrent effect, and consequently an amendment was passed, taking away their discretion. The case of the Eastern, on which twenty-two stowaways were discovered, must not be regarded as unique, or even as very unusual. It is unusual for so many men to - be found, but not for so many to be stowed away. Moreover, it is in the last degree improbable that the captain would be unaware, during a voyage from Singapore, or any Chinese port, to Sydney, of the preI t may sence of so many stowaways on board his ship. If he did not know that they were there, he must have been negligent, or his officers were not doing their duty. When the Navigation Commission was at Fremantle, a steamer arrived with ten stowaways, who were found in one of the ship's boats, covered with canvas. As the boat was perfectly clean, it was obvious that there had been collusion. Indeed, it is only by the collusion of the ship's authorities that stowaways cart travel for any considerable distance. Under this Bill , a stowaway has to be a person of whom the master gives no notice to the officer, or does not prohibit from landing. If the master does one of those things he is safeguarded; if not, he is liable. It has been suggested that the minimum penalty should be £ 2 5 , and the - maximum £ 1 5 0 , but no master, so far as I know, couldpay even £ 2 5 per head for - half-a-dozen stowaways. Consequently the argument that the penalty should be reduced to £ 2 5 in order to enable the poor master to scrape through, falls to the ground. The ordinary master of a ship is no more able to pay six times ^ 2 5 than he is to pay six times £ 1 0 0 . In the principal Act the penalty may be recovered from the master, owner, agent, or char° terer. If an amendment of that sort were made in this case it would give the Commonwealth recourse against everybody who might otherwise evade the Act. What would happen if the master said he had not got the money ? Does any one suppose that the master, when called on to pay a fine of ,£100, has to do so out of his own pocket? The company, and not the master, pays in every case. fine has to be paid, and very properly, by the employers of every person on the ship. While there is a good deal to be said for the amendment put forward by the honourable member for Angas, I am inclined to think that the heavier the penalty is made the more drastic will be the regulations made by the companies. The companies will insist upon masters and officers making such diligent inspection of the ship that not one stowaway shall remain undiscovered. A ship is not a hay stack. It can be inspected . A hunt for a bundle of cigars or 1 a tin of opium might fail, but it is impossible for a man to evade for ten or fifteen days i a a ship the constant and vigilant search of men whose business it is to find him out. The penaltv must stand ns it is.",46
294,Mr HENRY WILLIS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Robertson) [9.5] - This appears to be very good electioneering matter. Each side is trying to go one better than the other. The Attorney General stated that the measure is directed not against the master but against the shipowners, so that the easiest way to recover the fine is to make it very heavy. The honourable member for South Sydney thn:w himself into a great passion over it. That an Innocent man should be fined only £ 2 5 seemed to cause him great frenzy. He thought the penalty should be made £ 5 0 , and then urged that if it were made £ 1 0 0 the subordinate officer whose duty it was to see that there were no stowaways would be dismissed at the first port. Then he seemed to subside because he had the poor man down. He said the Peninsular and Oriental Company allowed a large number of their crew to walk off one at a time, and were willing to pay £ 5 per head for as many of them as ran away, and that it was only when the fine was increased to ; £ i o o per head that tiiey stopped the desertion of their crew. Is not that a silly statement? The Peninsular andOriental Company want their crews to man their ships. The men ran away of their own accord, and cost the company £ $ a head. Since the fine was made .£100 they have not allowed their crews on shore, I suppose, or otherwise we should have heard of their running away. The fine has been made so high that the poor fellows are kept in imprisonment all the time they are in port. The argument has also been advanced that the Bill is needed to prevent the introduction of disease, but is it reasonable to suppose that the officers would knowingly allow men suffering from plague The or other infectious diseases to remain on board in seclusion ? What we should do is to punish those who break the 'law intentionally. For those cases the fine should be made £ 1 0 0 , but if the master is innocent he should receive clemency.",47
295,Mr HUGHES,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,He may be guilty of culpable negligence.,47
296,Mr HENRY WILLIS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Perhaps he has done his best. . The Bill seems an excellent placard for the elections, and each side appears to be vieing with the other to get the credit at the polls for keeping out objectionable immigrants. In these cases, if a man is guilty, I should fine him , £ 1 0 0 ; if he is innocent, he should be ' treated leniently, and I would let him off with a fine of £ 5 rather than the minimum of ,£50. If I could be assured of any support I should move for the insertion of the words "" not exceeding,"" before the words "" One hundred pounds."" This Bill is really no amendment of the principal Act at all. Honourable members opposite are simply grinning up their sleeves and laughing at the people. They say that their objective is a White Australia. I suppose they will make the maximum fine in this case ^ 1 5 0 . The Minister appears to have been very busy over a small matter. A few men have been smuggled into Australia, and this has caused a great amount of excitement. Mr 'BATCHELOR - The Bill was introduced before the discovery of the last lot of stowaways.",47
297,Mr HENRY WILLIS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"It appears to have been on the tapis for a considerable time. The last argument in favour of the Bill was that men were being distributed all along the shore, between Port Darwin and Sydney. The ex-Prime Minister stated today that, although the most vigilant search has been made all along the coast, very little information was obtained to prove that men had landed anywhere the but at the recognised ports of call, the.whole thing is a case of ""Much ado about nothing."" The Bill was framed because of clamour by the Labour Party.",47
298,Mr HUGHES,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"If the offence so rarely hysterical. occurs, the penalty will be rarely inflicted.",48
299,Mr WILKS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Dalley) [9.15] - The honing orable member for Parkes, and several others, have urged that it is wrong to proproves vide a maximum penalty of.^100,'and to give no discretionary power to the magishonorable trates before whom a case under would come. I would remind them that in one of the most effective Statutes that we master. have passed, there are precisely similar provisions as to penalties. I refer to the Cusbetter toms Act, section 24 of which provides that some masters no person shall use any unlicensed carriage, have a very strong boat, or lighter, for the conveyance goods subject to the control of the Cusloss sustained whilst carrying them toms, and concludes with the words ness. "" Penalty : Twenty pounds."" When the honourable member for Parkes suggests that at an hysterical pry is being raised for the imstowaways, of position of an absolute penalty in this who have been case, I cannot refrain from reminding him that we have anymost of the provisions of the Customs from pointing out that under it the owner invite honourable members toendread of an unlicensed boat, who, perhaps, would not earn £ 2 ios. a week, is liable to a leader, penalty of £ 2 0 for doing certain things.

Then again, section 19, which rewould be effective or acceptable lates to accommodation on wharfs, concludes with the words, "" Penalty : Twenty ment. pounds."" There is no alternative penalty case imposed under that section.",48

Our desire in passing it is to see that the provisions of the principal Act are not effective. evaded, and that being so, I fail to see why any objection should be taken to the penalty for which this clause provides.",48

307,Mr ATKINSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Why make the minimum so high- a master might be perfectly: innocent.,48
308,Dr CART YSALMON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I am satisfied that no bench of magistrates would convict a perfectly innocent man. Cases arising - under this measure will be heard by magistrates not in a village or a hamlet, but in the principal maritime cities of Australia, and I am sure that they will carry out the law they have to administer. In the article to which I referred, it is stated that the Customs officers are negligent; but, in my opinion, there is no justification for that assertion. Our Customs officers exercise all the supervision which the manning of the Department will allow, and I believe that they do their work thoroughly and satisfactorily. As soon as we erect a barrier, as we have very properly done in this case-and I am glad to find the honourable member for Parkes', even at this late period, agreeing with our action-w e stimulate the ingenuity of those' who wish to pass over it . I think that the party now in office had some justification for urging from time to time that a leakage was taking place, and I certainly consider that the Customs officers are not to blame for it to anything like such an extent as are those who are trading on our shores, and who should obey the law instead of systematically breaking it . as in many cases they are undoubtedly doing.",49
309,Mr SAMPSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Wimmera) [9.25I Recent experience, as well as the information that has been supplied during this de'bate, show that the Bill is a necessary one. We have already passed an Act imposing heavy penalties on the masters and owners of vessels who allow prohibited immigrants to land on our shores; but it has been found that, in order that that Act may be made - effective, it is necessary to impose heavy penalties on those who introduce prohibited 'immigrants as stowaways. It has been suggested, during the discussion of this clause, that the master of a vessel on which these stowaways were found would be called upon to pay the penalty for which it provides, and that it is too severe. I therefore propose to move that certain words appearing in the principal Act shall be - added. Under that Act, the master, - owners, agents, and charterers of any vessel are liable to the penalties imposed. I propose to move That after the word "" master,"" paragraph gA, 'the words ""owners, agents, and charterers"" be - inserted.",49
310,Mr ATKINSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Wilmot) [9.27] 'That amendment would be worthy of sup!port. As it stands the clause applies only to masters, and although at first sight it would appear that they alone should be liable, since they have the best means of ascertaining what goes into their vessels, I agree with the contention that probably a master would be unable to pay a fine of £ 1 0 0 for each stowaway discovered on his vessel, especially if it carried as many as were recently found on a steamer arriving in a Commonwealth port. That being so, I think it would be wise to extend the liability in the way proposed by the honourable member for Wimmera. If we spread the liability over the master, owners, agents,' and charterers, we may rest assured that still greater precautions will be taken, to prevent the introduction of prohibited immigrants as stowaways. If there is an innocent case, a fine of £ 2 5 would be quite sufficient, or, at any rate, there should be some discretion - as between £ 2 5 and, say, £150.'",49
311,Mr BATCHELOR,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"What is an "" innocent case''?",49
312,Mr ATKINSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"That is for the Court to determine; and those who are liable will have to prove their innocence. It is not probable, however, that defendants will very often be able to bring forward proof of the kind. One or two stowaways may avoid the vigilance of captain and officers, and the first person to discover them will be the Customs officer; in such a case, there ought to be a minimum penalty. Of course, where twenty or thirty stowaways are found, it would be absurd for a captain to assert that he had no reason to suspect their presence. I heartily support the amendment.",49
313,Mr GLYNN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I understand that the honourable member for Wimmera desires to submit a proposal, and I ask leave to temporarily withdraw my amendment. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. Amendment (by Mr SAMPSON) agreed toThat after the word "" master,"" new section g\ (1), the words ""owners, agents, and charterers,"" be inserted.",49
314,Mr ROBERTS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Adelaide) [9.34] From my reading of the principal Act, I think that a further amendment is rendered necessary by that just agreed to. It should be provided, as in the original Act, that the owners, agents, and charterers shall be "" jointly and severally "" liable ",49
315,Mr HUGHES,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"West Sydney-Attor ney-General [9.35] - I point out that this is a criminal offence, while the words "" jointly and severally "" properly refer to civil process, and, therefore, would be out of place in this clause.",49
316,Mr GLYNN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Angas) [9.36] - I move That after the words "" penalty of , "" new section 9A (1), the words "" not less than nor more than"" be inserted. It will be a mistake to give unlimited liberty to' magistrates, who are in a position of great responsibility. If a stowaway is found on board, the captain, whether innocent or not, must be fined; and, under the circumstances, when there is something approaching proof of innocence, there should be a lower penalty. As to a minimum of ,£50 not being high enough, I point out that under the States Immigration Acts the poll tax was only £ 1 0. It is true that in New South Wales the poll tax was £100, but I do not think that it was as efficacious as the poll tax in the other States. Mr W. H. IRVINE (Flinders) [9.38]. - I do not' quite understand the answer of the Attorney-General to the honourable member for Adelaide. Unless the words "" jointly and severally "" are inserted, the clause will mean that the master, owners, agents, and charterers are'liable to pay the one penalty amongst them, though I take it that the intention is that each of them shall be liable to punishment.",50
317,Mr HUGHES,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"The intention, I think, is that the master, or owner, or agent, or charterer shall be liable, but not the whole of them.",50
318,Mr WH IRVINE,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"That may be the reading of the original Act, but I must confess that the meaning is a little obscure, and I do not know that it has yet been tested. Whatever may be the meaning of the section in the original Act, the intention now is the same ; and why not make the laiw uniform ?",50
319,Mr HUGHES,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Does the honourable member suggest that each should be liable for whatever penalty there is?,50
320,Mr WH IRVINE,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I take it that the desire is to have the same penalty for bringing stowaways into port as there is for allowing them to land; and, if so, we ought to adopt the same language. As the clause stands now, I doubt whether a conviction could be obtained against any one of the parties named, without bringing all into Court, whereas the intention is that the authorities shall be at liberty to sue them either jointly or severally; therefore, I think that the suggestion_of the honourable member for Adelaide is perfectly correct.",50
321,Mr GLYNN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"In order to allow the honourable member for Wimmera to move a further amendment, I beg to withdraw the Fifty amendment now before the Chair. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. Amendment (by Mr SAMPSON) agreed toThat before the word "" liable,"" new section. 9A (1), the words "" jointly and severally"" be inserted. Amendment (by Mr Glynn) negativedThat after the words "" penalty of,"" new section 9A (i ) , the words ""not less than Fifty nor more than"" be inserted.",50
322,Mr ROBERTS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Adelaide) [9.48] - I am of opinion that the Minister will be well advised to accept an amendment in the last line of the second section which it is proposed to insert. Every stowaway is to be deemed a prohibited immigrant unless it is proved that he has passed the dictation test, or that an officer has permitted him to land without restriction. The word "" permitted "" has a meaning similar to that of the word "" allowed,"" and it could be reasonably argued, if a stowaway gets ashore, that an officer had "" permitted him to land."" One man can permit another to do a thing by not being able to prevent him from doing it, or by. neglecting to. prevent him. Stowaways who had escaped the vigilance of the Customs officers might claim that the officers had permitted them to land, because they had neglected to prevent them from landing. The master of a vessel having on board a stowaway who is a prohibited immigrant is to' be liable, on summary conviction, to a penalty of £ 1 0 0 , and, in addition, under the principal Act to a penalty of £*o<* if he allows that prohibited immigrant to land; but under the wording to which I am taking exception it might be argued that the stowaway was not a. prohibited immigrant, because the Customs officers bad "" permitted him to land "" by not preventing him from doing so. The meaning attached by Courts to particular phrases is often very different from the ordinary acceptation of their significance, and we are sometimes astounded at the construction placed on words by the legal mind. I am of opinion that instead of the phrase "" has permitted him to land,"" we should siv ""has given him permission to land,"" and therefore I move That the words, "" permitted him,"" new section OA (2), be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words ""given him permission.""",50
323,Mr GLYNN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Angas) [9.56] - In my opinion, it would be better to leave the word ""permitted,"" which, must be taken to mean a conscious act on the part of an officer, and not merely neglect to prevent. If the honourable member's interpretation were accepted, one might say that a truant is a boy who is permitted to be absent from school because the master has neglected, or failed, to compel his attendance. An objection I take to the provision is that it does not require an officer to administer the dictation test. Every stowaway is to be deemed a prohibited immigrant unless it is proved that he has passed the dictation test, and it lies with the master of the vessel to show that he has done so; but there is no obligation on an officer to administer it.",51
324,Mr BATCHELOR,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,It s administration is not necessary in these cases.,51
325,Mr GLYNN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Then we assume that a man is a prohibited immigrant because he is, a stowaway.",51
326,Mr CARR,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Is not the fact that he is a stowaway - prima facie evidence that he is a prohibited immigrant?,51
327,Mr GLYNN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,It seems to me that we are pretending that a man is a prohibited immigrant when he is not. Would it not be more straightforward to say that all stowaways shall be deemed to bo prohibited immigrants?,51
328,Mr ROBERTS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,The object of the Bill is to throw on the master all the responsibility for stowaways.,51
329,Mr GLYNN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Then we should say so. It would appear that we cannot be honest in our immigration restriction legislation. Why not say straight out that if a stowaway is brought here and discovered the penalty shall follow ? This only shows how a little departure from political morality is followed by a big one. I should have liked to include the words ""or on application to an officer to be tested has not been required, or failed, to pass the education test."" That would be consistent. There is no doubt that the words "" permitted him to land without restriction "" mean that the officer has not administered the test",51
330,Mr ROBERTS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,We must continue to leave the Act so wide that in administration persons may be admitted without the test.,51
331,Mr GLYNN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"No officer would permit a stowaway to land who was a double offender, first by being a stowaway and [«<* ] second by being a prohibited immigrant. I really do not know, what the provision does mean.",51
332,Mr BATCHELOR,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"The object is to exempt persons who stow away, but who are of European race. - Mr HUGHES (West Sydney-Attor ney-General) [10.3] - The ambiguity that the honourable member for Adelaide observes in the clause is perhaps accentuated by the fact that, whereas in this case "" permitted"" means that the officer has given the person permission - to land, the words "" does not permit to land "" in new section 9D mean that the master"""" has not prevented him from landing."" But if the definition of a stowaway given in new section 9D is read into this clause the ambiguity seems to disappear, because "" stowaway "" is defined to mean a person of whose presence on board the vessel the mas.ter has not given notice to an officer, or whom the master has not allowed to land. A stowaway therefore is a person who in the very nature of things is still on the vessel. I quite agree with the honourable and learned member for Angas that it would be better to include in this clause the words "" or on application to an officer to be tested has not been required or has not failed to pass the dictation test."" If that amendment is made, the last line""or that an officer has permitted him to land without restriction ""-is surplusage. If the word "" permitted "" is made clearer ' in the way suggested, the whole case will be met, although I venture to say that the wording is clear enough as it stands, and would be given the required interpretation by the Courts.",51
333,Mr BATCHELOR,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Boothby-Minister of External Affairs) [10.8] - I am prepared to accept the amendment of the honourable member for Adelaide. I would point out to the honourable member for Angas that these exceptions are intended to apply to two classes of persons. If a man. is allowed to l.'an.cl without restrictiion he is franked, while a man who has passed the dictation test is not a prohibited immigrant even if he is a stowaway. The clause applies only to a man who is both a prohibited immigrant and a stowaway, who has failed to pass the dictation test or has not been permitted to land.",51
334,Mr GLYNN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Angas) [10.10] - I merely put forward the amendment I indicated as a suggestion. If there is any doubt about the efficacy of the words used I prefei to leave them as the draftsman put them, because he has thought the matter out. What seems to have been in the mind falsely of the draftsman, who, perhaps, is right, wealth is that there is no power to send away this man, who is presumed to be a prohibited of immigrant. Under the principal Act, the in master and the shippers have to take a proimprisonment."" hibited immigrant back, but in this case the stowaway is only technically a prohibited immigrant, assumed to be so only for the purposes of this measure, unless the test applied, and hence there is no power to send him away.

The grounds of the decision were, first,.that the word ""immigration"" in Constitution had a very limited meaning; and, secondly, that the dictation test, we colloquially call it. had not been proceive perly applied. The officer read over fifty words of English to Minahan, and asked ""Do you understand that?"" said "" No."" The officer then said: "" Then if I read it out to you, you cannot write it "" ; and defendant said, ""No."" The tion?

343,Mr BATCHELOR,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"The honourable member's proposal would lead to our obtaining no information. No one would care to give information unless he was absolutely certain that it was correct, and one could not lie sure on the point unless one had been on board a vessel and seen stowaways there.",52
344,Mr KELLY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"The honourable member is not such a careful student of language as I thought he was. My amendment would apply only to those who ""wilfully and falsely "" gave information. The information must not only be false, but wilfully false.",53
345,Mr CROUCH,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,How could a man give information unless he gave it wilfully ?,53
346,Mr KELLY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Then let us say"" that "" whoever wilfully gives false information."" I am quite willing to amend my amendment to read in this way. Mr .ROBERTS - The Ministry naturally object to the spreading of any false information.",53
347,Mr KELLY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"The further I look into this matter, the more I am satisfied that Ministers do not care whether or not a Bill introduced by them is turned into an engine of black-mail.",53
348,Mr CARR,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,What is the use of setting up a bogy?,53
349,Mr KELLY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"There are two classes of persons who might- I do not say that they would-endeavou r to use the clause, as it stands, for a wrong purpose. It may, perchance, be that a rival shipping company, wishing to detain a certain vessel in port, lodges an information with the local Customs authorities, that a certain number of gentlemen from China are stowed away in its hold. The whole of the merchandise on board has to be taken out; perhaps a day or two is wasted, and no stowaways are found; but the rival shipping.company is immensely benefited by the failure of that vessel to depart according to scheduled time.",53
350,Mr ROBERTS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,I am surprised at these allegations against the integrity of shipping companies.,53
351,Mr KELLY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"My allegations as to the frailty of human nature apply even to my honourable friends opposite, so why not to shipping companies?",53
352,Mr CROUCH,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Unde r the principal Act, an officer may detain any ship, but what the honourable member suggests has not happened under that provision.",53
353,Mr KELLY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"What has happened is a very strong reason for endeavouring to make sure that none but bond fide information is [116]- 2 supplied to the Department. In the circumstances, seeing that the Dep.' rtment has been afraid to act on all its information, surely it is our duty to try to purify the sources of the Department's information.",53
354,Mr BATCHELOR,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,It would be most dangerous to insert such a provision as the honourable member suggests. We might as well drop the Bill.,53
355,Mr KELLY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Will the Minister explain why he holds that view?,53
356,Mr BATCHELOR,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Boothby-Minister of External Affairs) [10.37] - I am sure that the honourable member for Wentworth really desires to prevent the possibility of a ship being detained in port on a frivolous charge. But whilst it is perfectly true that a good many yarns are circulated as to the presence of stowaways on board vessels, there are certain quarters from which we obtain information that can generally be relied upon as being absolutely accurate. If we were to insert this amendment, the chances are that we should close up all those avenues.",53
357,Mr KELLY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,To what sort of avenues does the honourable member refer ?,53
358,Mr BATCHELOR,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Avenue s from which we obtain information as to the probability of stowaways being on board a vessel are necessarily more or less subterraneous, and we might as well drop the Bill as insert the amendment. If we agreed to it, no one would be prepared to give us information. We have frequently held up vessels, and in everv case the masters have given us every assistance. Never has there been a suggestion that in any one of those cases the vessel should not have been detained. The honourable member is proposing to meet a difficulty that does not, and is not likely to exist.",53
359,Mr KELLY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,-It has not existed because the Department has not acted on the information supplied.,53
360,Mr BATCHELOR,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,We act only on information obtained from reliable sources. i l r . KELLY - My amendment would not touch reliable sources.,53
361,Mr BATCHELOR,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"It certainly would. Information may pass through several channels before reaching the Customs authorities. Those who pass it on to us are unable to say whether or not it is accurate, and the honourable member's amendment, if carried, would, therefore, close up all such avenues. In attempting to meet a possible, but highly improbable, danger, he would create another difficulty, and I am confident that his amendment would make the Bill absolutely ineffective.",53
362,Mr KELLY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Wentworth) [10.30] - So far as I understand the Minister, he tells us that the persons who would be most afraid of appearing - before a magistrate on a charge of wilfully giving false information are the persons who invariably give reliable information to the Department.",54
363,Mr BATCHELOK,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,I said nothing of the kind; the honourable member is misquoting me.,54
364,Mr KELLY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I hope the Minister will not be quite so heated and unfair, and I point out to him that he will be able to see the report of his remarks in Hansard. The Minister's position, in short, is that reliable persons will be afraid of being charged with wilfully giving false information.",54
365,Mr BATCHELOR,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Undoubtedly .,54
366,Mr KELLY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Such a thing is inconceivable.,54
367,Mr BATCHELOR,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"It is not a question of reliable information, but of whether the source is reliable. - Mr KELLY - If a person gives false information bond fide, my proposal will not touch him ; it is only when he wilfully and consciously gives false information that he becomes punishable. The penalties, which mav strike honourable members as harsh, are, it must be remembered, only the maximum, according to the Acts Interpretation Act.",54
368,Mr ROBERTS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Can the honourable member give one instance where there has been false information given?,54
369,Mr BATCHELOR,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,There has never been any complaint about the holding up of a vessel.,54
370,Mr KELLY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,We have the serious statement by the Minister himself that he cannot rely on a great many of the informants who come before him.,54
371,Mr ROBERTS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,What prompted the honourable member to submit the amendment ?,54
372,Mr KELLV,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,A study of the Biil.,54
373,Mr ROBERTS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Then the honourable member knows of no case of false information ?,54
374,Mr KELLY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I know of no case; but I am legislating for the future. If the Minister in the past had acted on all the information given to him, what the honourable member for Adelaide says would carrygreat weight; but the Minister has to disblack-mail ? regard many sources of information because he was afraid they were tainted.",54
375,Mr ROBERTS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"If the discretion of the Minister has worked well in the past, why not leave things as they are?",54
376,Mr KELLY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Because the present Minister may not always be in office; and until some penalty against wilfully false information is provided, I do not see how he can be sure that the information is bond fide.",54
377,Mr HUGHES,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"An informer's information is always supposed to be 'wilfully and knowingly false, when it cannot be verified, or it turns out to be unfounded.",54
378,Mr KELLY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"If a person lodging an information were held to be guilty of mala fides until he proves himself to be innocent, I should not press my proposal ; but we know what the procedure is. The prosecution's counsel has to show such a train of facts as to prove conclusively that false information has been wilfully given.",54
379,Mr ROBERTS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,The hare will never be caught in that net.,54
380,Mr KELLY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,The hare will never be caught if there is any chance of a man's guilt being in doubt for a moment. But there will be a pretty severe warning held out to persons who are willing to wilfully perjure themselves for their own or their employers' benefit.,54
381,Mr HUGHES,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Who does the honourable member think is going to give information under such circumstances as he proposes ?,54
382,Mr KELLY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,I think that any person who has information to give bond fide will still offer it.,54
383,Mr BATCHELOR,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Why multiply the difficulties in the way of getting information ?,54
384,Mr KELLY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I do not see that my proposal would multiply difficulties; quite the contrary. If members of the Labour Party, who have always sought to gain advertisement by means of the White Australia policy, are content that the Minister may pick and chooseTns to the sources of information, they stand convicted as mere poseurs. I seem to be under the disadvantage of arguing with a Minister who has made up his mind; and, under the circumstances, I think we ought to have a quorum. [Quorum formed]. The Committee are entitled to know whether the Minister proposes to provide any safeguard against black-mailing manoeuvres on the part of men of straw.",54
385,Mr ROBERTS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Who is to be subject to,54
386,Mr KELLY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"The shipping companies and, indirectly, the Commonwealth through the risk it runs of its officers' time being wasted. I propose no limit of the vast powers which are already incorporated in paragraph i . , clause 9C, under which Commonwealth officers may detain for a reasonable time any vessel they suspect of containing stowaways. That is a very proper power to take, but I object to the Commonwealth authorities being moved, on the information of persons knowing that what they allege is false, to prevent vessels on which no stowaways from leaving port. If Ministers have art amendment which will meet the case, no one will be better satisfied than I shall be. But I am aware that the numbers are against me, and if the Labour Party prefers that the Government shall be saddled with the responsibility of - encouraging blackmail, I cannot do more than indignantly protest. I deeply regret that Ministers should view with antipathy a proposition designed to strengthen the Bill . When speaking on the second reading, I ' stated that I considered the measure to be necessary, and I have not moved to amend it. What I propose now is merely the addition of a safeguard in the interests of ship-owners and of the public.",55
387,Dr LIDDELL,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Hunter) [10.47] - I hardly think that persons such as the honourable member for Wentworth referred to would be able to pay a fine of ,£100, though, no doubt, as they are a timid lot, liability to a penalty might deter them from giving false information. I rose to ask whether the Customs omcers who find stowaways obtain rewards of £ 5 for each discovery.",55
388,Mr BATCHELOR,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Yes. In some cases the reward has been increased to £i°,55
389,Dr LIDDELL,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"If the discovery is due to information from outside sources, is the person supplying that information rewarded ?",55
390,Mr BATCHELOR,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,That is which I cannot discuss.,55
391,Dr LIDDELL,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"The should encourage persons to supply information, and I think that the Government will do well to act on my suggestion that protective agencies should be established in foreign ports.",55
392,Mr KELLY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Wentworth) [10.50] The Minister should inform the Committee as to the steps taken to obtain the information. He says that there are sources generally known to be reliable, and that information from unreliable sources is disregarded. We are entitled to know what method is pursued in this matter. It must be very faulty, because Ithe other day twenty-four mandarins from China were found secreted in the hold of a vessel in Sydney harbour; yet, twenty-seven leaders of labour in this Chamber do not desire to have it criticised ! Does information come to the Department, or is it sought for systematically ?",55
393,Mr BATCHELOR,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"The honourable memthere are ber, if serious, must be aware that, if I were to explain the methods of the Department, the effect would be mischievous.",55
394,Mr KELLY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"The Minister persists in misunderstanding me. I do not ask for the names and addresses of those who lodge information, but whether it is sought for systematically, and paid for , or whether it comes haphazard, those who give it going unrewarded.",55
395,Mr BATCHELOR,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"On this subject, I can give the honourable member no info, m ation.",55
396,Mr KELLY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Thoug h the Minister has been but a short time in office, he could obtain information from the officers of his Department, and I regret that he will not give me an answer to a reasonable request. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Bill reported with amendments. Standing Orders suspended; report adopted, and Bill read a third time. NA ENCOURAGEMENT BILL . CONSIDERATION OF SENATE'S AMENDMENTS.",55
397,Mr SPEAKER,MANUFACTURES,"Before leaving the chair I think it my duty to call the attention of the House to two of the amendments proposed to be made in this Bill. They are Nos. 7 and 8. No. 7, beside immaterial things, proposes to add "" steel "" to the items on which bounty may be paid. This a matter word, taken by itself, would involve, not an increase of the total amount of approGovernment priation under the Bill, but a possible alteration of the destination of certain sums of money unspecified, though the probable effect of the insertion of the word ""steel,"" together with the other proposed words, "" Sheet or plate,"" amendment No. 6, would be a limitation rather than an extension of the grant. Amendment No. 8 proposes to make the bounties payable not only on pipes of an internal diameter not exceeding 4 inches, but on all up to a diameter of 6 inches. This is an alteration of the destination of a grant, though, probably, of trifling extent, and, I am informed, is intended to bring the proposal into harmony with the Tariff Act. Admittedly, under the ruling of the honourable the President of the Senate, reported on pages 4165-7, of vol. xxxix. of Hansard, of last year, these two amendments are beyond the authority of the Senate. If the House decides to accept them on their merits, its privileges should be guarded by some reference to them in the message to be returned to the Senate after they and the other amendments have been considered. In CommitteeClause 11I f the Minister finds that the rates of wages, or any of them, are below the standard rates prescribed by any Commonwealth or State In dustrial authority, or, in the absence of any such standard applicable to the case, are below the standard rates' paid in the locality in which the goods are manufactured, the Minister may withhold the whole or any part of the bounty payable. Senate's Amendment - After ""manufactured"" insert "" or in the absence cf any such standard rates respectively, are, on application by the Minister to the President c i the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, declared not to be fair and reasonable by him or by a Judge of the Supreme Court of a State or any person or persons who' compose a State Industrial authority to whom he may refer the matter."" Motion (by Mr FISHER) proposed - That the amendment be agreed to.",55
398,Mr BRUCE SMITH,MANUFACTURES,Parkes) [11.1] - Will the Minister in charge of the Bill explain the effect of the amendment?,56
399,Mr FISHER,MANUFACTURES,"Wide Bay-Treasurer ) [11.2] - The original provision was that the wages prescribed by Wages Boards 01 Arbitration Courts should apply. There are, however, some States where' there are no Wages Boards or local Arbitration Courts, and the amendment simply amplifies the policy of the Bill, so that the average rates of wages of a neighbouring State may apply, in order that there may be, as nearly as possible, uniformity throughout the Commonwealth, if the industry is established in more than one State.' amendment involves no new principle.",56
400,Mr KELLY,MANUFACTURES,"Wentworth) [11.3] - The clause as it left this Chamber placed the onus upon the Minister, and seemed to give him all the power that could possibly be required. The amendment appears to introduce quite a new principle and perhaps to involve the introduction of the new protection.",56
401,Mr FISHER,MANUFACTURES,"The amendment will improve the clause, because it allows the matter to be referred to an authority outside the Minister.",56
402,Mr KELLY,MANUFACTURES,"I confess to some difficulty in realizing the exact scope of the amendment at such short notice, but it is surely loosely worded. Apparently there are a number of persons to whom the matter can be referred to discover the standard rate of wages.",56
403,Mr FISHER,MANUFACTURES,The Parliamentary Draftsman states that the amendment is practically on all fours with a provision in the Excise Procedure Act.,56
404,Mr BRUCE SMITH,MANUFACTURES,"Parkes) [11.4]-The amendment appears to supply three strings to the bow. It would perhaps makeit clearer to insert the word "" alternatively "" after the word "" o r "" the second time occurring. This would make it absolutely certain that the parties interested could not run from one tribunal to the other. I take it that all that is wanted is the right to go to one or the other.",56
405,Mr FISHER,MANUFACTURES,"Wide Bay-Treasurer ) [11.5] - The Parliamentary Draftsman thinks that the insertion of the word "" alternatively "" will make no difference in the meaning; but I am quite willing to accept it if the honourable member for Parkes thinks it will make the amendment Sir WILLIAM LYNE) [n.6].. - I hope the Prime Minister will not accept any amendment at this stage of the session. I do not want the Bill to be referred back to the Senate again lest anything should happen to prevent its passage.",56
406,Mr BRUCE SMITH,MANUFACTURES,"Parkes) [11.7]. - In some cases an attempt has been made to get decisions by the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, and also by a State Arbitration Court. I believe the Shearers' Union at one time appealed to a State Arbitration Court, afterwards extended its ramifications intoother States, and then contended that it was The entitled to apply to the Commonwealth Court. My object was to prevent anything of that sort happening under this Bill, but. I quite appreciate the fact that we should avoid if possible making any amendments that will necessitate the Bill being referred back again to the Senate at this - stage of the session. I am therefore willing not to press the suggestion if no other amendments are made.",56
407,Mr KELLY,MANUFACTURES,"Wentworth) [11.9] - I am .grateful to the honourable member for Hume for his recently-born anxiety to place this measure on the statute-book. I can remember that only a few months ago the honourable member showed his .anxiety to pass this Bill into law by introducing it in the last hour of the dying session, and then, when - even the schedule had passed and another - twelve minutes would probably have sufficed to finish the work, throwing it under the table rather than risk a decision in another place. I am deeply gratified at the newfound zeal of the honourable member. I trust that the Committee will act upon it, and return the Bill, as far as possible, without amendment.",57
408,Mr BRUCE SMITH,MANUFACTURES,"Parkes) [11. n ] . - After consulting the Parliamentary Draftsman, I am clearly of opinion that the amendment I suggested is not required, because this is a power given to the President of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration to refer the matter to other authorities, and. I am sure he would not make a reference to more than one Court. Motion agreed to. Remaining amendments in clause n - agreed to. Amendment in clause 14 agreed to. ScheduleDescription of Goods.

409,Dr WILSON,MANUFACTURES,"Corangamite) [11.112],Is it not intended to take notice of Mr. Speaker's remarks on this question?",57
410,Mr FISHER,MANUFACTURES,Wide Bay-Treasurer ) [11.13] - Mr Speaker's remarks simply indicate that if there is any breach of the rights of this House it is so slight that it is sufficient to call attention to it. I shall move later that the Bill be returned with a message indicating what Mr Speaker has said regarding the rights of the House.,57
411,Mr KELLY,MANUFACTURES,"Wentworth) [ n . 14] - If we merely pass Mr Speaker's remarks on to another place and at the same time announce that we concur in the irregularity to which he has felt it incumbent upon him to draw attention, our action will be a doubly strong precedent for s'imilar conduct by the Senate in the future. If we desire to intimate that it must not be taken as a precedent, we shall have to adopt some other procedure. Motion agreed to. Resolution reported; report adopted.",57
412,Mr FISHER,MANUFACTURES,"Wide Bay-Treasurer ) [11.15] -1 ° accordance with what you have said, Mr Speaker, as to safeguarding the rights of this House, I beg to move That whilst of opinion that amendments Nos. 7 and 8 made by the Senate strictly are in excess of the powers of the Senate as declared by the President of the Senate on the 3rd October, 1907, yet, in view of the insignificant nature of the excess, the House agree to those amendments on condition that the matter is not to be drawn into a precedent.",57
413,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,Parramatta) [n.16] - I understand that the sole reason assigned in the proposed message is the slight excess.,57
414,Mr FISHER,MANUFACTURES,The slight excess of their powers in the one case and the slight narrowing of them in the other.,57
415,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,Is it not desirable also to make some reference to the stage of the session at which we have been called upon to deal with the amendments?,57
416,Mr FISHER,MANUFACTURES,Mr Speaker thought that the message I have proposed would be sufficient.,57
417,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,"I think that it would be much stronger if we made the addition I have suggested. We cannot be too careful in conserving our own powers, and I am not quite sure that if we had more time at our disposal more notice would not be taken of the action of another place. In the circumstances, perhaps it would be well to mention in the message the stage of the session at which we have been asked to deal with this matter as an additional justification for our action in surrendering our rights in regard to Money Bills.",57
418,Mr ROBERTS,MANUFACTURES,"Adelaide) [11.17] - I have no desire that there should be any difficulty between the two Houses at the present moment; but I certainly agree with the leader of the Opposition that had this matter come before us a little earlier in the session a more emphatic protest than is suggested might have been made. I regret that we have not more time to consider the very important statement that you, Mr. Speaker, have made to us. If we are .to protest at all against what appears to be a gradual dribbling away of some of the privileges which this Chamber ought to hold most clear, I think that language may be employed that is less calculated to give offence to another place than is that suggested. As we intend apparently to make a protest against the action of the Senate- a protest not, in the main, of a very forcible character-it seems to me that we should avoid the use of language calculated to give unnecessary offence. therefore suggest that the word "" insignificant"" be struck out. Its use is likely to make members of another place believe that in our opinion the amendments they have proposed, after careful consideration, are not all that they might be. I have no doubt that Mr Speaker has considered the matter; but whilst I pay the greatest respect to his opinions, I have opinions of my own, and I am sure that the Prime Minister will not object to my giving expression to them. In the utmost good faith, therefore, I suggest that our protest would be equally effective and less calculated to give offence if the word "" insignificant "" were left out.",57
419,Mr MCDONA LD,MANUFACTURES,"Kennedy) [11.20] I regret that we should be called upon to deal with this question in what are practically the closing hours of the session. On a number of occasions another place has made amendments calculated to strengthen its position in regard to money Bills, and to lessen those which we possess. We have been content, however, to make what is really an idle protest. Whilst I do not wish to hamper the passing of this Bill , I certainly think that the time is not far distant when we shall have to take up a strong stand against the action of the Senate in interfering with such measures.",58
420,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,Is any serious harm - done in this case ?,58
421,Mr MCDONALD,MANUFACTURES,"I am not referring specially to what has been done in this case; but we have to remember that a usurpation of power is generally gradual, and that in that way dangerous precedents are set up.",58
422,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,It is well always to remember that two Houses can play at the assertion of power.,58
423,Mr MCDONALD,MANUFACTURES,"There must come a time when either one House or the othev must assert its rights. If the Senate possesses this right, then the sooner the country knows it the better. It does not represent the people as this House does, and it is just as well that we should know which Chamber has the power of the purse. New South Wales, with a population of about 1,500,000, has in the Senate the same representation as has Tasmania with a population of less than 200,000, and I do not think that the first-named State considers that it is properly represented there.",58
424,Mr BRUCE SMITH,MANUFACTURES,Is this an. opportune time to strike matches? I,58
425,Mr MCDONALD,MANUFACTURES,Perhaps it is not. I am simply pointing out that cases of this kind have occurred again and again just at the close of a session when every honourable member is anxious to get away. The sooner we make some protest against this constant encroachment upon our powers by the Senate the better for the Commonwealth.,58
426,Mr KELLY,MANUFACTURES,"Wentworth) [11.23] - I admire the energy that the honourable member for Kennedy displays on behalf of the privileges of this House and of the constitutional position that it occupies as the guardian of the public purse. But on this occasion we are faced with two duties. It is held by a large majority of the members of this Parliament that in the interests of the people the Bill now before us should be passed this session. Consequently at this stage of the session I anr forced to the conclusion that we must pay more regard to the interests of the people in the immediate passing of this measure than to a desire to vindicate our constitutional rights, more especially when those rights, after all, have been infringed to only a very small extent. I therefore hope that nothing will be done to bring about a conflict between the two Houses with regard to this measure.",58
427,Mr FISHER,MANUFACTURES,"Wide Bay-Treasurer ) [11.26] - In answer to the honourable member for Adelaide I would point out that the word "" insignificant "" refers to the excess, and not to the amendment actually made, so that it does not reflect on the action of the Senate. Question resolved in the affirmative. ADJOURNMENT.",58
428,Mr FISHER,MANUFACTURES,"Wide Bay - Treasurer ) £11.27] - In movingThat the House do now adjourn, I wish to express the hope that honourable members will assemble tomorrow prepared to deal with a large volume of business in a very short time.",59
429,Mr KELLY,MANUFACTURES,Is it necessary to meet at the usual hour tomorrow in view of the small amount of business remaining to be dealt with?,59
430,Mr FISHER,MANUFACTURES,"We expect to receive some business f rom the Senate, and if we have to wait it will be open to Mr. Speaker to suspend the sitting Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 11.28 p.m.",59
