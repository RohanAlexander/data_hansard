1,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Some time ago the Leader of the Opposition brought before the House the fact that objection had been made to the enrolment of a Miss Annie Irvine, and - I now read to the House the report of the Chief Electoral Officer on the case. It is thisThe objection to the retention of the name of Miss Annie Irvine on - the Balaclava roll did not arise from information supplied by a political organization, ur any person other than an official. It originated in the return, by the Postal authorities, of the referendum pamphlet addressed to Miss Irvine - at her plucf of living, as appearing on her enrolment claim, with the endorsement "" unknown."" A subsequent inquiiy was made by the Registrar, through the local police, who also reported Miss Irvine "" unknown."" There undoubtedly .appears to have been some misunderstanding in ithe mailer on the .part of both the police and 'Postal authorities; and while the inclusion in the - claim of the name or number of the house in which Miss Irvine resides (full postal address) - would, as suggested by the Divisional Returning - Officer, have enabled Uiat lady to be located beyond question, I think it should not have been very difficult to find her without this added information, having regard to the limited number - of houses in Hughenden-road. Prior to the issue of the notice of objection by the Divisional Returning Officer, it appears that nn alteration had been made in regard to the local mail delivery, with the result that - official notification of objection reached Miss Irvine in due course. Tf Miss Irvine will be so good as to return the .notice of objection to the Divisional Returning Officer, wilh an endorsement that she is still living at the address given by her in her claim, he will intimate thut the objection has been with-drawn. The endorsement referred to in the last paragraph is asked for in compliance with the provisions of the law. I lay the report and correspondence on the table for the information of honourable members.",12
2,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"In this case an elector's name was struck off the roll because a referendum pamphlet posted to her had ""-been returned with the endorsement "" Unknown."" I ask the Minister how it is that the names of persons by whom the pamphlet was received have also been 1913. struck off the roll ?",12
3,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"If the honourable member will bring under my notice particular instances, they will be investigated. Cases of error will arise under .the best Departmental organization. BILLMr MCGRATH - Case s of error are very numerous just now.",12
4,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"T l i e y are alleged, for party political purposes and for no other reasons, to he very numerous just now.",12
5,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"It is stated in the report that the Miuister has just read that if Miss Irvine had given her full address and the number of the house in which she .is living there would have been no trouble. The house was not then numbered, though it is numbered now. But seeing that there live in the house, Mrs. Irvine, her mother, and Miss Elsie I r vine, as well as herself, and that letters are delivered there practically every day, there should not have been' any difficulty in discovering whetiier Miss Annie Irvine was liviug there, and whether she was qualified by residence to vote in the Balaclava divisiou.",12
6,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"The report states that the Department does not regard the difficulty of finding the addressee, even though the full postal address was not given, as sufficient reason for the action subsequently taken, but in justice to the officer concerned, let me point out to the right honourable member that if - he' goes through the papers which I have laid on the table he will . f in d "" Not k n o w n "" written on the back of the referendum pamphlet by the Postal Department, and the same statement by a sergeant of police. It was on that information that action was taken.",12
7,Mr FISHER,Unknown,The information is in sufficient. The case shows that trouble will occur if such information is regarded as sufficient. POSTAL ELECTRICIAN S.,12
8,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"As the judgment of the Arbitration Court, on the appeal by the Postal Electricians Union, is against the Postmaster-General's Department, do not the Government think that the Treasury should pay to the union the costs of the appeal, which amounted to about £60? Mr AGAR , WYNNE - If the House will allow me, I shall e x p l a in e x a c t l y how the matter stands. Leave g r a n t e d . .",12
9,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,"The Public Service Commissioner took the matter in hand a f t e r Mr Justice H i g g in s ' a w a r d was made, and he sent to the Secretary of my D e p a r t m e n t a m e m o r and u m , in w h i c l i he saidImmediately upon the award coming into operation, the rates of pay of employees in the positions designated in the award must be adjusted to the amounts prescribed in the award. Cadet and jun'or mechanics are to be paid according to age, as prescribed in the award. Cadet mechanics will in future be designated as junior mechanics. All mechanicians receiving less than £ . ,S per annum will be advanced to that amount. Senior mechanics, foremen mechanics, exchange foremen mechanics, telephone inspectors, mechanicians, battery men and foremen battery men, receiving less than the minimum prescribed in the award, are to be advanced to such minimum. Persons hitherto employed as junior mechanics, mechanics, electrical mechanics or wiremen, are to be designated and paid as junior mechanics, at the rate according to age as prescribed by the award, with district allowance, where payable, according to locality. evidence as to age sliould be furnished within a reasonable period. The only exceptions to be made are in the cases of temporary mechanics who have passed the prescribed examination for mechanics, or those who are employed in the telegraph workshop (hitherto generally designated as electrical fitters) and who can be reported as thoroughly competent workshop hands. In such cases, the employees will be designated as temporary mechanics, and will be paid at the rate of £168 per annum, with district allowance, where payable In certain cases, the adoption of the award rates may mean a slight nominal reduction in the present rate of pay to temporary employees, e.g., electrical fitters in certain States are paid at the rate of us. per day, which, upon a basis of 313 days in a year, is slightly in excess of ,£i6S per annum. It sliould, however, be noted that in future temporary employees must receive the same public holidays as permanent officers, and that their hours will be reduced from forty-eight to forty-four hours per week. On receipt of that circular , the officers of the D e p a r t m e n t issued an order to the D e put y Postmasters-General in all the States, that wages were to be p a i d in accordance with the construction put on the award by the P u b l i c Service Commissioner.

12,Mr FISHER,Unknown,I w o u l d not say it here.,13
13,Mr AGAR WYNTSTE,Unknown,"The J u d g e of the A r b it r at i o n Court is himself very sensitive.

20,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! to the Postmaster-General that he omit from his statement adverse references to the Judge.,14
21,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"I ask your ruling , sir, as to whether the President of the A r b i tration Court, when adjudicating upon industrial questions, does not stand in quite a different relation to this House from that occupied by a H i gh Court Judge ?",14
22,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"On the point of order, I wish to say that this Parliament is expressly invited*'by the Conciliation and Arbiti-a'tion Act to review the decisions and proceedings of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court in certain circumstances.",14
23,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,On motion.,14
24,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"In the circumstances, submit that the references which have been made to the Judge of the Arbitration Courb by the Postmaster-General are quite in order.",14
25,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I point out that there is a regular and an irregular method of procedure. If an honourable member desires to criticise the conduct or utterances of a Judge, the proper method by which to proceed is by a substantive motion .",14
26,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,"I shall not refer any further to the matter. When the case came before the Judge again, in order to meet the objections raised by the Public Service Commissioner, be amended the award. I told the deputation that waited upou me that the Government would pay whatever was right as from the date of the original award, and that no advantage whatever would be taken by the Department of any reduction due to the interpretation of the award. I said that the men would all be paid in full , as from the date when the original award came into force. W it h reference to the question put by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, I can only say that I have a sympathetic feeling towards that matter. I shall look into it , and see what can be done in connection with it .",14
27,Mr ERAZER,Unknown,"I wish to say that, when occupying a seat on the Treasury bench, I made a statement which, judging by the cheers from both sides of the House, met with the full approval of honourable members at that time.",14
28,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order! Does the, with- honourable member desire to make a speech ? I suggest Mr Frazer - I wish to ask a question, but I must make a few remarks in explanation first. I made a statement, with the approval of the House, that if there was any considerable delay in getting a decision given by the Court so far as casual mechanicians were concerned, the award would be dated back to the 1st July, 1912. I wish to ask the Postmaster General or the Prime Minister whether it is intended to honour that promise ?",14

31,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"No , none whatever.",14
32,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"I wish to put a question, without notice, to the Prime Minister. Is he aware that owing to the proclamation declaring an alleged small-pox area in and around Sydney, the whole of the trade of Riverina has been alienated from New South Wales? Will the Prime Minister take into consideration the advisability of rescinding the proclamation, and so restoring to New South Wales that lost trade.",14
33,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I will consider the matter.,14
34,Mr WEST,Unknown,"I should like to ask the Prime Minister whether he has seen a press report to the effect that Dr Cumpston has described the non-passing of the Vaccination Bill by the New South Wales Legislative Assembly as "" a calamity."" I wish to know whether .Dr Cumpston made this statement in respect to the Bill by the instruction or with the approval of the Federal Government?",14
35,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I have issued no instruction of any kind in connection with this matter.,14
36,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Prime Minister a further question, without notice. Having regard to the fact that the New South Wales Parliament have not passed a Compulsory Vaccination Act, will the Government now, in the absence of such, take steps to remove the embargo that is crippling Sydney, and has been doing so for months past? Mr JOSE PH COOK - I regret more than I can say that I do not see my way at the present time to raise the embargo. I hope the honourable member will take my assurance that I am giving to this very important questiou all the consideration I can, and that it is causing me a great deal more anxiety than it is him. At the earliest moment that the way is clear, the embargo will be lifted. We need no urging to do it . LIEUTENANT - GOVERN OR OF",15
37,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Minister of External Affairs whether he has seen a letter, signed by Dr Strong, who has charge of the welfare of the in habitants of Papua, i u which it is stated that because H is Excellency the Lieutenant-Governor held a certificate that he had been successfully vaccinated and showed signs of recent successful vaccination, it is quite impossible that he could acquire true small-pox ? - I would also like to know whether that opinion is shared by the head cf the Quarantine Department, because, to me, it is an absurd one. . Mr Glynn - Throug h the courtesy of the honourable member I have read the letter to which he has directed attention. Tho facts are that the Lieutenant-Governor arrived on the 23rd July, that he had been vaccinated for more than fourteen days previously, and within a period of tliree years. As a greater precaution, however, he was again vaccinated before leaving Sydney. On the 28th July he noticed a slight rash, and im mediately placed himself under the acting medical officer, who recommended a short period of isolation, as he thought that in some cases it might be impossible to at once diagnose true small-pox. The acting medical officer, however, soon discovered that the oriirial diagnosis was correctthat it was not true small-pox, but was a disease eguivalent to Kaffir milk-pox. Not only Dr Strong, but Dr James, made an examination, and both bore out the original diagnosis, that the case was not one of true small-pox.",15
38,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,But they said that it was quite impossible for him to get true small-pox.,15
39,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I do not know what these technicalities amount to ; but I do know that, in order to inspire greater confidence, the Lieutenant-Governor submitted himself to a period of isolation. NA CONFERENCE.",15
40,Mr BRUCE SMITH,IMPERIAL DEFENCE,"Since the House met ou Friday last, reports have appeared in the newspapers to the effect that the Prime Minister and the Minister of Defence have made important statements concerning the necessity for holding an Imperial Naval Conference. Some PAPUA. rather important details seem to be briefly expressed in those reports. Will the Prime Minister give the House the benefit of the information that he gave to a private gathering?",15
41,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMPERIAL DEFENCE,"I am not aware that I gave any information to a private gathering, except that I made the most general reference to the fact that we had requested the Imperial Government to convene a conference, with a view to determining future constructional developments in connection with the Navy. That is all I have said. The newspapers are doing the rest, and I cannot help that.",15
42,Mr HIGGS,IMPERIAL DEFENCE,I wish to ask the Prime Minister whether he will lay on the table of the House any correspondence which has passed between the Government and the Imperial authorities in regard to the-. holding of au Imperial Conference ?,15

47,Mr FISHER,IMPERIAL DEFENCE,"I understood from the reply made to the inquiry in reference to Miss Irvine, that the Registrar desires, the notice to be returned, otherwise her name will be struck off the roll. That seems to me an excess of duty which is quite unnecessary.",16
48,Mr SPEAKER,IMPERIAL DEFENCE,"Order ! The honourable member is making a statement, and not asking a question.",16
49,Mr KELLY,IMPERIAL DEFENCE,"I assume that the honourable member intended to ask a question. I am informed that the law in regard to objections requires that the person objected to must either orally or in writing answer the notice of objection. That has not yet been done in this particular case, and I think that all the departmental officers desire is that the formal course of the law shall be observed.",16
50,Mr MCDONALD,IMPERIAL DEFENCE,"I desire to ask the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs whether he will cause the list of persons to whose names on the roll objection is' taken to be exhibited every half-year, or every quarter - as may be most convenient-in places where the public may have an opportunity of seeing them. He stated just now that he would have these lists exhibited in the Registrars' offices. I would point out that from some portions of my electorate the Registrar's office is 600 miles distant. In these circumstances, will he have the lists posted at every post-office and receiving office ?",16

53,Mr KELLY,IMPERIAL DEFENCE,"I am not aware of any departmental action having been influenced by representations made to it. The Leader of the Opposition asked me to give him some information with regard to the lodging of objections and removal of names from the rolls of the Korumburra division of Flinders. The Chief Electoral Officer reports as follows: I am advised that(a) Seventy objections have been lodged since the last election. (6) Eighteen of the names involved were brought under notice by an outside organization, but were not objected to until exhaustive and independent inquiry had been made. [c) The Registrar has not lodged any objection without careful inquiry, and without having fullest grounds for belief that the persons objected to do not live in the division, and have not so lived for a period of not less than one month.

Is it a .fact that, under the Commonwealth Bank Act introduced by the Fisher Government, and passed in 1911, the Governor of that bank is invested with absolute and unconditional power* to deal as he thinks fit with the bank funds and credit without any controlling influence by the Government or by any board of trustees or directors? 2. Is he officially aware that the Governor has, on his own authority, recently purchased one pf the most valuable blocks of city property in Sydney, beyond the bank's requirements for banking purposes? 3. Is he aware that the Governor has, on his own authority, entered into an undertaking to erect on the land referred to, a block of buildings which will involve-wit h the cost of the - land-a n expenditure of over ,£200,000? 4. Has the erection of this building been intrusted to Mr Kirkpatrick, a Sydney architect, to carry out the project by day-labour methods? 5. Is . he officially aware that the - Commonwealth Bank is entering into competition with the Savings Banks of the various States by taking charge of the premises previously used in the post-offices for that purpose in 1,700 town centres, thereby compelling the States Governments to rent or build new premises for the on of their State Savings Banks, and"" thus duplicating 1,700 offices and staffs all over Commonwealth for the purpose of receiving who deposits from the same people? 6.

79,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The answers to the questions are: 1. Yes. 2. The late Government, at the request of the Governor of the bank, acquired, under the Lands Acquisition Act, a block of land at the corner of Fitt and Moore streets, Sydney, for the Commonwealth Bank. I am informed by the Governor of the bank that the block is suitable for the purposes of the bank. The Governor has not informed me as to whether the land is more than is required for banking purposes, ancl I have asked for information on this point. 3. I believe that the Governor of the bank verbally consulted the former Prime Minister before entering into arrangements for the construction of. a building, the cost of which, with the land, will probably be over ^200,000. 4. Mr Kirkpatrick, Sydney, is architect for the building. Tenders have been called for the erection of same, and are now being considered. 5. Yes 6. The excess of expenditure over receipts in establishing the bank at the chief cities in Australia, also in London, ami throughout Commonwealth, amounted to ,£46,636 12s. yd. 7.

85,Mr SAMPSON,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Wimmera) [3.45] - I take it that the Government desire to get these Estimates passed as soon as possible, and that any remarks we wish to make on the Budget should be reserved for another occasion. In view of the tremendous in crease proposed in the expenditure for the this year-somethin g over £5,000,000i t is rather disappointing to find that only prea small proportion of the increased expenbeen diture is to be incurred in connection with those services which are necessary to the development of the country interests of the whole of Australia. On looking through these Estimates I find that an in NAVAL BASES. crease of £255,000 is proposed in the expenditure of the Home Affairs Department, and an increase of £244,000 in the upon expenditure of the Postmaster-General's Sir Department. In other words, an increase Prime of £499,000 is proposed in the expenditure of the two Departments which more particularly touch the country interests of Victoria. Last year, of course, in connection with wireless telegraphy there was placed on the Estimates a large amount which, probably, may not occur this year. Last year new works und«r the Home A-ffairs Department were proposed to the amount of £400,000, whereas this year the new worksunder the Department are estimated to cost £320,000. First I desire to refer to the proposals for erecting new post-office buildings in Victoria. I admit that the proper course is to deal with these Estimates in relation to the whole of Australia; but probably honourable members are more familiar with those proposals which refer to their own State. I intend, therefore, to deal with some of the items for post offices in Victoria only. On the Estimates for this year a total sum of £85,000 is provided for post-office buildings in this State. Of that amount about £55,000 is to be expended in the metropolitan area, and only about £30,000 is to be expended in the country districts on the erection of post-office buildings. I think that a large proportion of the £55,000 is to be spent on new offices within the metropolitan area. In other words, about one-half of the total sum is to be expended in connection with the Melbourne Post Office and a new parcels office. Having regard to the enormous increase which is proposed in the expenditure for this year - a n increase of over £5,000,000- a very small projiortion of that amount is beiug devoted to the - erection of country post offices.",19
86,Mr ROBERTS,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"That is very serious, as this is supposed to be a country Ministry.",20
87,Mr SAMPSON,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I am discussing the question from the stand-point of the in terests which are most largely involved. Let us turn for a moment to the expenditure on telephones. These Estimates show an increased expenditure of £244,000. Last year the expenditure was £835,000, and this year the proposed expenditure is £1,079,000, being an - increase of £244,000. From that amount we have to deduct certain heavy expenditure on switch-boards. That means that the expenditure on our Post and Telegraph services shows, in some instances, a decrease, so far as country districts are concerned. Instead of what we supposed to be an increase in connection with this large Budget, there is really to be a decrease in the expenditure on purely postal services. .",20
88,Mr LAIRD SMITH,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,Is not the f a u l t in allocating the expenditure ?,20
89,Mr SAMPSON,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"No . The switchboards which are to b.e erected will absorb nearly the whole of the proposed increase of £244,000 in connection with the services.",20
90,Mr ROBERTS,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,An increase of switchboards is to be expected at present.,20
91,Mr SAMPSON,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"We have also a proposal to increase by £147,000 last year's expenditure on the Federal Capital, the proposed vote for this year being £285,000. That item ought to be struck out altogether. At this early stage in the history of the Commonwealth, when we have 3,""000,000 square miles of country to develop, and when we require railways and telephone services in all directions, it is our duty to spend the money available on purely developmental works. Justification for the expenditure of this money on the Federal Capital is not, and cannot be, shown. I have heard it said more than once that the Capital could be made a good business proposition; that, witha territory of 900 square miles, we could build the Capital and lease the laud on such - advantageous terms as to secure a fair return upon our expenditure. That being so, we ought to have a comprehensive scheme, showing the direction which the expenditure should take, and the prospect of making the Capital self-supporting in the near future.",20
92,Mr HIGGS,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,It is time that the honourable member gave this up.,20
93,Mr SAMPSON,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It is time the Committee inquired more searchingly into the expenditure that is being heaped up year after year - For the last three years we have been complaining about the enormous increase in Commonwealth expenditure and taxation. Yet we find that we are asked this year to spend about £5,000,000 more than was expended last year, and that we have no more information to guide us than we had twelve months ago. The very thing of which we complained last year we have to complain of this year-that we have no business-like guidance in voting these large sums of money. The Federal Capital should be dealt with separately, and on its merits, and the Committee should be given an idea of the extent to which the proposed expenditure is going to commit us. Twelve months ago we were told that the £110.000 then voted was but the first i stalment of a total expenditure ot £3,000,000.",20
94,Mr ROBERTS,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,Who made that statement ',21
95,Mr SAMPSON,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The then Minister of Home Affairs. We are asked this year to agree to an expenditure of £285.000 on the Federal Capital, or an increase of £147,000 on the amount expended last year, yet we are given no information as to how far the passing of this item will commit us to a 'total expenditure of £3,000,000 or £4,000,000. I think we ouglit to have a Public Works Committee, which could make the fullest inquiry into the proposed expenditure ou the Federal Capital, and place before us a scheme which, perhaps, would show that the Capital could be built without making too great a demand on the Federal Treasury. We ouglit to have some such assurance before we vote this money. I intend to vote against the proposed expenditure on the Federal Capital until I have received further information as to the extent to which it will commit us, and whether is likely to run us into an aggregate expenditure which this young Commonwealth perliaps would be unable to stand.  very parochial.",21
96,Mr SAMPSON,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I am not. This is uot the only proposed expenditure which should be looked into. Take, for in- direction. stance, the expenditure proposed to be made in the Northern Territory. We are constantly being asked to vote money in that direction, without having before us anything like adequate information as to the future of that great tract of country. We are asked this year to spend £59,000 iti respect of new works in the Northern Territory. In addition to f i e proposal to expend £400,000 on a branch railway line, and to the expenses of administration running up to £50,000, we are asked this year to vote £59,000 for new works in the Territory. Of that sum only £14,000, consisting of a proposed vote of £8,000 for the construction of roads and bridges, £2,000 for water conservation north of the Katherine River, and £4,000 for the erection of wind-mills and pumps, can be described as expenditure on developmental works. We should have the fullest information in regard to all future ject. expenditure in the Territory. I think, also, that the £6,000,000 or £7,000,000 proposed to be expended in constructing n - a railway line through the centre of Australia could be more advantageously employed i u carrying out some great developmental scheme within the Northern Territory itself. I have my own views concerning that part of Australia. I believe it is possible to develop it , but that it can be developed only by the construction of public works within the Territory itself. We know, for instance, that rain falls tliere only during three or four months of the year.",21
97,Mr LIVINGSTON,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,That statement applies to only part of the Territory.,21
98,Mr SAMPSON,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The honourable member is mistaken. Darwin has the highest rainfall record, and it is only during four months of the year that rain falls there.",21
99,Mr LIVINGSTON,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,What about the tablelands!,21
100,Mr SAMPSON,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"They are really a drier part of the Territory. It will be impossible to carry on agriculture successf u l l y there without water conservation; and the first step which we ought to have taken was to appoint an engineer, witli it experience in the construction of irrigation and water conservation works in tropical countries, to furnish a report to Parliament as to the best means of conserving the water now running to waste in the .Territory. Water conservation is undoubtedly the first essential to success. We are, however, doing nothing in this We are voting this money blindly. I would also draw attention to proposed votes for certain Socialistic schemes like that of the Commonwealth Clothing Factory.",21
101,Mr JENSEN,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,Are these the actions of a Government which was going to guard the public funds?,21
102,Mr SAMPSON,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I am discussing this question from the stand-point of tha guardianship of the finances of the Connionwealth. We are asked to vote £85,000 for the Commonwealth Woollen Mills, and there are also large items in respect of the Commonwealth Clothing Factory and the Harness Factory. If it is wise to call for tenders for the construction of public works, why is it not equally wise to call for tenders for the supply of harness, woollens, and clothing?  British Royal Commission on that sub",21
103,Mr SAMPSON,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,I hold that what is good in the one case ought to be good in the other. I know that the Clothing Factory has already reached the Socialistic ideal in turning out suits of clothing of the same pattern and the. same size.,21
104,Mr HIGGS,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,A r e not the employees being treated well?,22
105,Mr SAMPSON,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I am dealing, not with the employees, but with the question of Socialistic schemes. These three schemes were introduced by the late Government, and were condemned by me at the time. No doubt considerable expenditure has been incurred in carrying them on up to date; but when business men find that they have embarked upon a bad speculation, and that their expenditure is not likely to fulfil anticipations, they abandon the enterprise, considering the first loss to be the best.",22
106,Mr LAIRD SMITH,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,Surely 'he honourable member is not censuring his own Government.,22
107,Mr SAMPSON,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"If T had my way, I would cause the position to be reviewed, to see if it would not be better to put these contracts into private hands. We frequently hear irom members of the Opposition statements condemnatory of the Legislative Councils of Australia; indeed, if the Legislative Councils were abolished, the stock and trade of the Socialist party would virtuall y disappear. Hut Governments whose legislation has to be passed by Legislative Councils have shown themselves more liberal than the Commonwealth Government, as I shall prove by citing a concrete instance. The Government of Victoria, before throwing open for settlement the land in the central part of the Mallee, constructed 66 miles of railway, at a cost of about £200,000, to give access to it , at the same time excavating large tanks along the railway line, and in places distant from the line, and grubbing some scores of miles of road. That is as it It has been too often £he practice in Australia to wait for private enterprise to blaze the trail, and to withhold railways and water supply works u n t i l the certainty that they would be profitable was obvious. This Mallee land, having been rendered fit for settlement, was thrown open for occupation. when I endeavoured to get the last Commonwealth Government to erect a telephone line, the cost of which would be about £2,000, to serve the district, I was told that the people of the district would have to guarantee a certain part of the estimated loss on the work, and this Government takes the same position. The Victorian Government has spent £200,000 in opening up the district, but this Government will not spend £2,00 0 to help the people there without a guarantee of £ 1 5 0 , which it is difficult to secure, because in the beginning settlers find it very hard to get money to finance even their own immediate wants. Yet a telephone line was erected to give communication between Melbourne and Sydney, at a cost of from £25,00 0 to £30,000 without a guarantee.  could get the £2,00 0 he needs by reducing the Federal Capital vote by that amount.",22
108,Mr SAMPSON,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I do not think that the money would be expended in the way in which I want it expended, even if the Federal Capital Territory vote were reduced. I point out, however, that the Postal Department is the only Commonwealth Department that can assist the development of the country. When I first read the Budget speech, I was under the impression there was to be a large expenditure in country districts, in extending telegraphs and telephones, and in renovating or constructing post offices; but the expenditure is iiot to be as large as I hoped for. Of course, this Government has a hard row to hoe, in having to make provision for the commitments of its predecessor. But before Parliament agrees to expend large sums in the Northern Territory and in the Federal Capital Territory, it should be given all the information necessary to enable it to determine the wisdom of the proposed expenditure. The sum of £50,000, or more, has been spent in administrative work in the Northern Territory without inducing more than half-ashould be. dozen new settlers to go there. ",22
109,Mr SAMPSON,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It is proposed to spend in the Territory £400,000 to construct a - line of railway from Pine Creek to the Katharine River. We do not know that that line is the best that could be constructed for the development of the But Territory, and we do not know whether there should not be an investigation to ascertain if it wil l follow the best route. It is proposed to spend money in the Territory before it has been decided whether the freehold or leasehold form of tenure shall be adopted. I do not think that the country w i i l ever be settled on a leasehold tenure; the history of the world is against that. We are similarly in a position of darkness regarding the Federal Capital Territory. I intend to vote against the proposed expenditure there, unless the Government gives us the in formation needed for a proper conclusion as to its proposals. In my opinion, the information that we require can he obtained only by a Committee; an5 there should be laid before Parliament a scheme which will make the Territory self-supporting within the near future. If the Government is prepared to give us this information, and to postpone the vote, I shall suspend my judgment on it for the time beiug; otherwise 1 must oppose it , because I think that it should be knocked out. So much money is needed for the development of the country that it is a crime to spend hundreds of thousands of pounds in the Federal Capital Territory., If it should be necessary for the Commonwealth to do its parliamentary work elsewhere tlian in Melbourne, tliere are other cities to which the Parliament could be moved.",22
110,Mr ROBERTS,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"If the fate of the vernment depended on the "" honourable member's vote, he would support an expenditure twice as large as is proposed.",23
111,Mr SAMPSON,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The honourable member is not a mind-reader, and knows nothing about it . He is merely making a guess, as he does i u regard to most matters. It is proposed to spend a large sum on naval works, but we do not know whether there is, or is not, any justification for the expenditure. Of course, our naval defence preparations must continue, but we do not know that the money is being spent to the best advantage, and depend for information entirely on the reports of the departmental' officers. We have no expert advice with regard to it . It is proposed to make up the expenditure to £27,000,000, and yet we have no expert information as to the manner in which the money is to be spent."" Would any good business man spend money on such slight information as is given to us in this matter ? I hope that before money is voted for public works generally, the Government will show us exactly how it is to be spent, so that we may judge as to the utilit y of the works, and the value of the proposed expenditure. We need a Public Works Committee. I am not prepared to say what the constitution of the Committee should be. If practicable, the Committee should be composed of members of the Parliament, because they would be the best fitted to conduct investigations into proposals for expenditure; but it might be difficult for such a Committee to travel all over Australia making investigations. If not composed of members of Parliament, it should be composed of other competent men, or there should be' a number of independent committees. Men should be chosen possessing business as well as expert knowledge, who would preseut to Parliament reports which would guide us in our decisions, and enable the people who pay the taxes to kuow that their money is being spent to the best advantage.",23
112,The CHAIRMAN,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,The honourable member's time has expired.,23
113,Mr HIGGS,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Capricornia) [4.15] - I am afraid that my speech will be nearly as dry as that delivered by the Treasurer, because I have so many figures to bring under the notice of honourable members. I wish to direct attention, if the Chairman will permit me to say so, to the tricks of the righ t honourable gentleman. Go- A Government should be open to criticism, and one ought to be allowed to use the strongest language in referring to it . If the word "" t r i c k s "" is not in order, I might be permitted to refer to the "" devices "" of the Treasurer. Referring to the right honourable gentleman the other day, I reminded honourable members that an old dog was wanted for a hard road. I am anxious today to direct their attention to the method by which the honourable gentleman gets his business through this House. He has on the paper a Loan Bill , which covers the expenditure for new works included in these Estimates",23
114,Mr FENTON,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Not all. The Loan Bill proposes the borrowing of £3,080,000, whilst these Estimates cover an expenditure of £3,268,569.",23
115,Mr HIGGS,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The honourable member forgets that the Treasurer does not mind about a million pounds, and he might let my statement go. Would it not have been much more straightforward for the Treasurer to get his Loan Bill through first, in order to test the feeling of honourable members with respect to the proposed borrowing of money? He puts the Loan Bill well down on the business paper, and then brings forward Estimates of Expenditure for new works which are to be - sovered by the Loan Bill .",23
116,Sir JOHN FOKREST,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"No ; these works have nothing to do with the Loan Bill ; they are to be paid for out of revenue. . Mr HIGGS - Then I must have made au awful mistake? I remember that when I was travelling on a London 'bus a man looked up at the top deck and said, "" There is room up tliere."" The conductor said, "" There is no room up there."" The intending passenger in sisted that there was, and the conductor then said, "" Go up and see."" The passenger went up on top of the 'bus and said, "" There is room here."" well,"" said the conductor, "" I must have make a mistake. I would not be here if I had not made a lot of mistakes in my time."" No doubt, that little story describes my position just now, and probably I should not be here if I had not made a number of mistakes in my time. VVe have included in the Loan B i i l a vote for the construction of the K a l goorlie to Port Augusta railway of £1,400,000; for the construction of a railway in the Northern Territory, from Pine Creek to the Katherine Eiver, £400,000; for the construction of a railway from Port Moresby to Astrolabe, and for the construction of wharfs in Papua, £ 6 0 , 0 0 0; for the purchase of land for post and telegraph purposes, £170,000; for the purchase of land for defence purposes, £300,000; for the construction of conduits and laying wires underground, £425,000 ; shops. & c , Cockatoo Island, £ 1 7 5 , 0 0 0; and the erection of London offices, £150,000",24

118,Mr HIGGS,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"My point is that the Treasurer should have brought the Loan B i ll forward first, that we might settle the question whether we are prepared to borrow for defence purposes.",24
119,The CHAIRMAN,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,The honourable member is no doubt aware that he cannot discuss the Loan Bill on these Works Estimates.,24
120,Mr HIGGS,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"A certain amount of money is to be provided for new works out of loan if Parliament passes the Loan Bill for the borrowing of £3,080,000, which the Treasurer intends us to discuss later on. My point is that the right honourable gentleman is, so to speak, sneaking in these New Works Estimates before we have dealt with the Loan B so that if we reject the Loan Bill these new works will have to be provided for out of revenue. It will be seen that the right-honourable gentleman has two strings to his bow.",24
121,Mr BAMFORD,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,He is very deep.,24
122,Mr HIGGS,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,The right honourable gentleman is as deep as a well.,24

124,Mr HIGGS,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I take exception to it , "" Very because I am entirely against the honourable gentleman's proposal to borrow for defence purposes. He is well aware that we cast into the outer darkness his Loan Act for the borrowing of £3,500,000 for the coustruction of the Fleet. We would not have that, and said that we were going to construct the Fleet out of revenue. The right honourable gentleman is very ingenious. He says now that the Government will not ask for a loan of money with which to construct the Fleet. They say that they will construct the Fleet out of revenue, but will borrow for other public works. Doubtless the Treasurer concluded that it would be very dangerous to. suggest the construction of the Fleet out of loan money.",24

126,Mr HIGGS,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I have here, at page votes are 232 of the Estimates for revenue and expenditure for the year ending 30th June, 1914, the abstract of the expenditure proposed on new works and buildings. I find that the expenditure proposed in connection with the Department of Home Affairs amounts to £ 1 , 1 2 2 , 7 6 8; the Postmaster-General's Department, £1,079,700; the Treasury, £ 4 , 8 6 0 ; Defence Department (not including construction of Fleet), £ 6 9 2 , 3 1 1 ; and External Affairs Department, £ 6 8 , 9 3 0; or a total for additions and new works of £3,268,569.

Does the right honourable gentleman deny that?",24
127,Sir JOHN FORREST,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Yes ; these works ill , are not to be paid for out of loan.",24

The right honourable gentleman has got his way at last. I remember that, when he attended an Imperial Conferpresses ence, I think it was, he said that cur contribution to the Empire, if we did our duty, sliould be £5,000,000 a year.

137,Mr ROBERTS,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,Why does the honorDefence able member for Wimmera support Government that proposes to double the expenditure on the Capital site ?,25
138,Mr HIGGS,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I will repeat the views which I expressed in this House on this subject on 28th August, 1912. I said I am sure that the naval scheme will break clown unless it is modifier!. Australia will not be able to foot the bill. I think that the Minparty will have to have on its programme next year a plank which will enable us to modify the scheme in a useful direction. We committed next year to a line of steam-ships. It would be wise for us, instead of spending so many millions on warships alone, to spend several millions of the money on convertible merchantmen, which might be used as war in time of need, whilst in peace time they might be used for carrying passengers and mails to and from Europe. We can make our new r plank- a Commonwealth-owned line of steamers - fi t in with that idea. We shall be able to conI struct fast convertible merchantmen, and in that way do something of a useful character Australia, instead of putting our money into which, as every expert tells us, are only for the scrap-heap in the course of a decade. That is what I said last year, and it exmy attitude all along towards this huge exrjenditure ou the Navy. The present scheme of the Treasurer is the outcome of the alarm which was created a few years ago when Mr Winston up Churchill, President of the Board of Trade, speaking at Dundee, said that the scare wasfalse, sham, ancl lying panic: started in the of the Conservative party. The British Labour party, in a letter to the honourable member for Wide Bay, who was then Prime Minister, described the panic which has been engineered for political I Sir Josiah Symon, too, when interviewed we on his return to Australia, said I was in England during the progress of the and it was apparent that the whole busiwas really worked up for party purposes up mostly by the Tory newspapers. It certainly is a singular circumstance that, on the same day, the leading newspapers in Melbourne, Sydney, and Adelaide, contained leading articles in favour with Dreadnought.",25

142,Mr HIGGS,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It may be that certain persons are looking for titles. It may be that they desire to get titles from the I m perial Government at a cheap rate. am not quite certain that one should object, to a man who, has rendered greatpublic service, or who haa acquired distinction i u the domain of art, science, or literature, getting, something in the nature of a tag to his name; but it is wrong foi persons to endeavour to get 1 titles from the Imperial Government by loudly proclaiming their patriotism. When I was in the Old Country, a member of the House of Commons told me that seeking titles was really the religion of the people of Loudon. He said that the obstacles in the way of carrying out all democratic reform in the Mother Country did not come so much from persons with titles as from those who were endeavouring to obtain them.",25
143,The CHAIRMAN,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,I am afraid that the honourable member is wandering away from the Works Estimates.,26
144,Mr HIGGS,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,I understoodthat on this point I was at liberty to roam a little.,26
145,The CHAIRMAN,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,But the honourable member's observations must have some connection with the Estimates.,26
146,Mr HIGGS,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Without pressing the point that I should be allowed to discuss grievances before Supply, I will getback to the questiou of Defence. I say that these scares are raised by interested parties, by persons who wish to proclaim their loyalty, as did some individuals in Queensland, who clamoured for more contingents being sent to South Africa , and who, at the time, were interested in certain meat contracts. I have here the opinion expressed by Mr ""Francis W . Hirst, the editor of the Economist, London, at the International Peace Conference, which was held in Washington, in December, 1910. He saidWar scares were largely inspired by armament contractors, and these contractors would ultimately drag various countries into bankruptcy. That is what the Treasurer will do. The whole country will be ""in pawn if the present Government remain long i u office. Mr Hirst continuedBrazil's purchase of Dreadnoughts was absurd, and Japan's rivalry with the United States was crushing the Orientals. Great Britain and Germany were wrecking themselves by their expenditure on armaments. If we ask the Treasurer why we should expend £5,700,000 in defence this year, he will probably reply that we are beset by an enemy in the East-by Japan. He will probably say that we have posI sible enemies in Europe, and that, therefore, we must incur a big naval expenditure. I am inclined to support the view which was expressed by Mr Hirst, that, in all probability, the armament contractors have a great deal to do with the armament expenditure which is going on throughout the world. They are in terested in having huge sums spent in their ship-yards, and in various other works. Here are the profits of A r m strong, Whitworth, and Company Limite d -1910 , £ 3 5 1 , 9 2 1 ; 1911, £527,866. During the same years the profits of Vickers, Son, and Maxim were £288,044 and £510,668 respectively. Tliese people will build war-ships for Japan or any other couutry; so how can they boast of their patriotism ? We do seem to be a most curious people. I uotice that a great disturbance is being made just now in the New Hebrides. The missionaries complain that the British laws which were enacted to prevent the sale of arms, am- (munition, and grog to the natives disadvantage the trader, and urge that France has enacted no such laws. Is it not veryo strange that the Imperial Parliament should prohibit the sale of guns to the natives for fear they may shoot one another, whilst offering no objection to Vickers, Son, and Maxim manufacturing guns for the Japanese, or any oTher possible enemy of Britain ? Indeed, so far from condemning it , the Imperial authorities appear to think that it is a very good thing for trade. I believe we are extremely foolish to allow armament contractors, politicians, and soldiers, who are interested in these firms, to gull the publie throughout the world into spending millions of pounds, in order to swell their dividends. . Mr Rodgers - This is a general indictment of the Fisher defence policy.",26
147,Mr HIGGS,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It is intended to be an indictment of the proposal of the Treasurer, and a general indictment of the actions of the. Governments of Britain , France, Germany, and other countries.",26
148,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,What about the Labour Government 1,26
149,Mr HIGGS,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I have not time to deal with that matter. I view this question from the stand-point of one who, having looked at the list of representatives who have appeared in this Parliament, and who have passed away, does not expectto remain here many years, and who, therefore, deems it to be his duty, while he is here, to give expression to his true views. I say that we are being gulled by the so-called patriots of the Old Count r y into shouldering an abnormally heavy burden. I know that the Treasurer has said that our contribution towards the defence of the Empire ought to be £5,000,000 annually.",26
150,Sir JOHN POKBEST,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,If we contributed at the same rate as do the people of the United Kingdom. I did not say that we ought to pay that amount ,27
151,Mr HIGGS,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"There can be only one inference drawn from such a statement, namely, that we ought to contribute £.5,000,000 annually to the defence of the Empire. To read the after-dinner speeches of some persons in the Old Count r y , who declare that they are very pleased to see how manfully Australia is shouldering the burden of Empire positively makes me ill . Probably some of these people «have never been outside of the radius which is represented by the distance between Paris and London. body wishes to learn what Australia is doing for the Empire, let him visit the country districts of the Commonwealth. Let him go into Queensland, where he will see persons who are absolutely denying themselves the comforts of life, as we in the city know them, who fell trees, plough the ground, and sow maize without getting any return for it - all for the sake of the Empire. The plains of Australia have been whitened by the bones of pioneers who have toiled for the Empire; and when we pay in terest on the loans which have been made to us by British capitalists, I say that we do quite enough.",27
152,Sir JOHN POKBEST,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,We have had money.,27
153,Mr HIGGS,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Yes ; and we are paying a very high rate of interest for it . There is no suggestion that we should go in for repudiation. I believe that the money which has been loaned to us by British capitalists is safer than is the money which has been loaned by them to other parts of the globe. But when we pay 4 per cent, or 4^ per cent, interest upon that money we have no right to be charged another 4 or 4£ per cent., in order to insure that that interest shall find its way safely to London.",27
154,The CHAIRMAN,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Order ! The honourable member's time has expired.  The Treasurer, in delivering his statement with reference to new works, said that the amount to be'expended on additions, new works, buildings, & c , was £3,971,000, which amount is set down on page 40 of the Budget-papers, and he also told us that we must add to that amount loan moneys to the extent of £1,070,000, also set down, on page 40 of' the Budgetpapers; but if we turn to page 59 of the Budget-papers we shall see a further statement as to the amount which is to be expended, which does not tally, so far as I can make' out, with the figures on page 40. On page 59 there is set down the sum of £7,086,628 for additions, new works, <fcc., and if wo deduct from this the amount of £1,196,829, accumulated from the previous years for the construction of the Pleet, it leaves - a gross expenditure of £5,889,799.",27
155,Mr FENTON,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The honourable member is dealing with the main. Estimates, and not with uew works. If any- Mr FLEMING - I am dealing with the * additions and new works on these Estimates. We find from figures elsewhere that the loan money to be spent on additions and new works amounts to £4,219,000. Therefore, we have tliree statements showing different results; but I have noticed, further, that the daily press have drawn still another result from the Budgetpapers. In one newspaper yesterday it appeared that the total expenditure for new works was to be £2,968,000, or taking into consideration the unexpended balance from last year of £430,000, a grand total of £3,398,000. It seems to me that we should try to make the Estithe mates as plain as possible to the people. I am not finding fault with this Budget any more than with previous Budgets, but if financial statements are brought down and submitted to honourable members in such a way that we cannot understand them, how much less can we expect the public to understand how we are handling the finances? It seems to me that the whole matter needs recasting. I come of Scotch parentage, and like most people with Scotch parents, I think I know something of finance; but when I go through the Budget-papers to find out how we are going to spend the money I cannot fathom them. The CHAIRMAN' - The honourable member is making a general Budget speech, aud is not speaking to the Estimates for new works.",27
156,Mr FLEMING,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I am dealing with the items set down for expenditure on new works, but I have completed my general observations on the amount to be expended, and wish now to come to definite items. I notice with pleasure that the present Administration propose to expend a greater sum on telephone and telegraph extension than has been spent in the past, because we are to have an increase this year of £150,000 over ""the expenditure of last year. In no way could money be better spent. As a country member, and as one brought up a long way from a railway, knowing the disadvantages under which the settlers labour, and the difficulties with which the pioneers have to contend, I say we cannot spend money more profitably than in extending the telephone ancl telegraph system. I listened with a great deal of interest to the remarks made on both sides of the House on Friday last dealing with the question of telephone construction, and it seemed to me that the honourable member for Parkes made a statement which was very business-like. The honourable ' member laid down a system which seemed to me to meet the case in every way'. He pointed out the vast difference between construction of telephones required for cities and those suitable in the bush. The honourable member for Denison afterwards treated us to a dissertation on the mechanical side of the telephone construction branch; and while uot in any way trying to gainsay the knowledge of the honourable member or to belittle his remarks, I would point out that his statement dealt merely with main and trunk lines.",28
157,Mr LAIRD SMITH,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I said there were three zones, and that country lines cost £ 1 2 6s. a mile, which is surely cheap enough.",28
158,Mr FLEMING,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The whole tenor of the remarks of the honourable member was that we must construct telephone lines in the best possible manner: that we must make them as good lines as can be laid down. I disagree entirely from the honourable meinber on that point. While cities must have permanent lines laid down and constructed in a thoroughly workmanlike manner, it does not matter how ramshackle a line may. be in the bush so long as it does for a year or two. The main tiling in the bush is to run up a temporary job so that the people can get the use of the telephone. In the various out-back portions of this great continent, we find telephone lines constructed of ordinary wire, and attached to trees, and along lines such as these much business is done, much social intercourse is carried on, and by means of them many valuable lives have been saved. They cost almost nothing to construct, b ut they can do much good business in their limited way, just sis much as the most expensive lines that could be constructed; and it seems to me that it would be a very wise course indeed for the Administration to adopt to put up these temporary lines where there is any demand for them. As soon as these temporary lines are brought into use, ""and the people become accustomed to the use of telephones, they will be quite prepared to foot the bill for the erection of more expensive and better lasting lines; but what they require to begin with are merely temporary lines, to bring thern into touch with those i u the outlying parts, and to enable them to do their business; also in times of distress to save those lives which"" are so valuable to Australia. As soon as people find out the in creased facilities for transacting business and the increased safety that accrue in the bush through the construction of telephones, they will be quite prepared to allow us to include in the Estimates before Parliament votes for the construction of telephone lines to a muchgreater degree than we do at present. Another thing which seems to me to redound to the credit of the present Administration "" is the increase proposed for rifle . clubs. Nothing stands more prominently in a patriotic light than the increase of these clubs. No doubt, for the last few years they have received nothing like the consideration which should be theirs.",28
159,Mr FENTON,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,How much more is on the Estimates for them this year?,28
160,Mr FLEMING,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The vote is increased this year by £7,500. Though not a great increase, still it is an increase, and, to my mind, nothing can be of greater value, because, as I suppose most honourable members know, a great many of our young fellows in the country districts have been discouraged owing to the little consideration they have beenreceiving. These are the men who should be put in the position to defend Australia, and when the day comes, I know they will be able to put up any fight that is necessary. They are prepared to form rifle clubs throughout the country districts, but, of late, owing to the little consideration they have had, or owing to the cold way in which their requests have been received, tliey have lost enthusiasm.",28
161,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,They cannot get decent rifles.,29
162,Mr FLEMING,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"That is so; indeed, they could not get consideration of any sort. But this increase will do something to stimulate their enthusiasm. The memdecided. bers of these rifle clubs are the type of. men we need to encourage. We do not wish to teach our men the lust of conare quest, but we need to fit them to defend Australia. The two increases which have mentioned are things that will enthe able us to improve ourselves in the fence of Australia. There is only one inject crease in regard to new works to which cannot give my full support, and that the £71,000 put down for woollen mills. It seems to me that, afc the present ture, we can spend our money in a much wiser and more profitable way than putting it into these Socialistic enterSydney ? prises.",29
163,Mr TUDOR,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,Will you move to strike out the item?,29
164,Mr FLEMING,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"If the honourable member will support me, I shall do so. If I could get the support of the House to knock out this increase, I would move to do so, because I am of opinion that we oould spend this money in a much better way. We lead the world ducing the raw material, and if we are not in . a position to manufacture it , then I say let us encourage the production the raw material, and let some one else manufacture it .",29

But in the present conditions I have accepted Protection, as it is Australia's accepted policy. A man might as well talk against the wind as talk Free Trade; we have settled the position for the time beiug; but, if ever it comes to a fight again, there will be no doubt as to which side I shall take. I am quite prepared to fight the question when it comes to be fought, but now for the time being the matter is settled, the fight having been put aside because there are so many things of f ar greater importance to be The time may come' again when the people will realise the necessity for a change, but, at present, there greater things to be considered; we have sunk minor differences in order to I try to act together to take Australia on lines which we believe to be the true delines of progress and development.

I wish to know what those honourable members who are prejuncpared to spend money on woollen mills will say to a symbol that was exhibited by when our Australian Fleet entered Being patriotic, I purchased oue of the symbols, and found on the back the words "" M a d e in Japan."" We are not making our own patriotic symbols, yet gentlemen opposite decry me when I say I am a Free Trader. Could we not spend money in a better way than in establishing woollen mills when we allow our natural enemies to send us the symbols which, we are supposed to wear on such a great day of patriotism as that in promarked by the arrival of our Fleet ?",29
168,Mr MCDONALD,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,How do you connect of those' symbols with woolleu mills?,29
169,Mr FLEMING,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Honourable members are making a great cry about spending money to develop our secondary industries; they are making the primary in dustries carry the secondary industries; and then they come along cheerfully and They are deluding people when they talk of Free Trade Protection. However, I do not wish The to be led off the track.",29
170,Mr TUDOR,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,Did the Government buy those symbols from Japan ?,29

174,Mr FLEMING,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I do not want to beat the cymbal. We are spending our money in ways which are not justifiable, and allowing things to be brought into this country which should be excluded. In regard to this Budget, the present A d ministration deserve the support of every right-thinking Australian, but it is up to their suppoiters, wherever they can, to point out. the defects of the present proposal. The Treasurer, it seems to ine, would be well advised if he could submit financial proposals in a plainer and more business-like way, so that not only we, but the newspapers, who have taken this subject up wrongly, and the people throughout Australia, might be in a position to understand exactly the state of the finances.",30

178,Mr FENTON,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Whether they were or not, I cannot say, but if they were, honourable members on the otlier side would only be following their usual unpatriotic lines. 1 would advise the honourable - member for Robertson to look at the item, "" Money to be expended on rifle ranges, & c , "" under the head of each State. find, if he does, that the money allocated in 1912-13 is somewhat above the sum which is provided in these Estimates. In the course of his speech he intimated that £100,000 was provided here, and so many more thousands provided elsewhere, and said he was glad to see the items on the Estimates. "" Yes , "" I interjected, "" but , unfortunately, the votes will not be spent."" That is my opinion. honourable member will find, if he makes an inquiry, that the last Estimates allocated more money for rifle ranges than the present Administration propose to spend this year.",30
179,Sir JOHN FORREST,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"They spend it , though.",30
180,Mr FENTON,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"That is true, I admit. Judging from the way in which things are being conducted, the present Government are out to try to finish the present year with a surplus bigger than that of the previous year. They are on the right road to do that.",30

They will not have an opportunity of spending half of this money, because every effort is being made to postpone a work to wait for the advice of another expert. Already the Commonwealth has paid large sums to get reports on some of the very works . which are now under consideration. I am very glad that the Prime Minister is in the chamber. Seeing that there was in trai n a proposal for duplicating the cordite works, He will why is it that these Estimates are practically silent on the point, when it is well known, according to the reports of experts, that if the works were duplicated, we would save almost at h i r d of the cost in the manufacture of the whole cordite required for big guns and small arms? These Estimates are absolutely silent ou that point; but, on a comparatively unimportant matter, the expendiThe ture is more than doubled. For the Federal Capital site, £285,00 0 is set down here. I suppose that the expenditure of that sum will practically be held up until such time as an elaborate report is presented to the House from the gentleman did not who has come from America. I had an opportunity of looking at his design, and, though not professing to he an expert, I say that the design is a splendid one; hut it seems to me that, in this and other matters, it is a case of ' ' ""Let us bring a man here; let us have a report;, give him ample time to get a report ready."" Now, by the time that most of these reports are ready, the greater part of the financial year will have passed by, and we shall have a bumpingsurplus a3 the result of unexpended votes. my mind, what is needed most in connection with the expenditure on the Capital site is the advice of expert engineers. So far as architecture is concerned, we have to wait some time. I understand that the gentleman who is going to report on the Capital site is an architect. take it that the proposed works, in regard to water supply, sewerage, and generally, fal l within the province of an engineer. If we allow our Australian engineering talent to submit to architectural talent from the United States, I think, despite all the expenditure we are indulging in by getting his report, we shall find ourselves lauded in greater difficulties in the near future than we have had in thd past.",30
189,Mr RODGERS,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,Did you hear the honourable member for Melbourne say that it was a statesman-like act to secure his services ?,31
190,Mr FENTON,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"My honourable colleague and I do not always agree. He is perfectly liberty to express his own opinion on subject. I think that very little good the is likely to accrue, notwithstanding the War, great capabilities of Mr Griffin. sider that he has come upon the scene little too early as an architect. I believe that quite likely his services would valuable at some time in the future. l prepared to divide the Committee on item for the Capital site with a view its reduction. The works to be carried out tiiere at present and in the near future should be of an engineering class, not of an architectural class. I desire here to cross swords with the honourable member for Wimmera, who said-and his statement) was approved by the honourable meinber for Robertson-that he was distinctly adverse to the expenditure of public money on woollen mills at Geelong. He said, also, that he was opposed to spending money in making saddlery for our mounted men.",31
191,Mr SAMPSON,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I say that the whole of these questious should have been reported on, and we should have had information as to the prospects.",31
192,Mr FENTON,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I am quite with the honourable meinber there. I favour a Public Works Committee, but it is a marvel that he did not include in his criticism the whole of the factories that we have in operation. If it is a righ t thing for To the Commonwealth to manufacture cordite and small arms, it is equally right to make saddles for the A r m y, clothing for the soldier, and woollen material out of which .to make clothes. The honourable meinber simply showed how illogical he is. We bave too many honourable memI bers here, I am sorry to say, with a strong leaning towards the contractor. We have only to refer to the records of what, took place in actual war time to find out how many contractors in Australia robbed the British Government, and the Australian Governments too. Not only the boots and the saddles, but the hay and the chaff-in fact, nearly all things used by the soldiers-were adulterated or badly manufactured. Y e t honourable members on the opposite side arc prepared to revert to that disastrous method-to bring back the contractor.",31
193,Mr ARCHIBALD,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,The contractors found money to put them there; why should they not?,31
194,Mr FENTON,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I do not know wheat ther the honourable member for Robertthat son was in the State Parliament at time of . the South African but immediately it was conI concluded, inquiries were made by the a authorities for the British Government, in conjunction with the Australian Gobe vernments, and it was found out how the a m contractors had robbed the taxpayers of the Australia, and of the Empire, by the to stuff they supplied. A man who walked 2 or 3 miles in a pair of the boots supplied would be a cripple. What kind of patriotic men were these contractors ?",31
195,Mr RODGERS,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,That was the f a u l t of supervision.,31
196,Mr FENTON,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Thes e are the type of men whom my honourable friends opposite call patriots. These are the kind of men who are only too ready when a man's back is turned to put their hands into his pocket and rob him. A contractor who would supply boots made of inferior material, and adulterated hay and chaff for the horses of the soldiers, in time of war I consider to be the biggest robber in the community.",31
197,Mr GROOM,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,You do not say that all contractors are of that type?,32
198,Mr FENTON,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"No ; I am talking of a particular class. What has been our danger in the past might be our danger in the future. In Australia today there are men lift in g their heads very high, riding in carriages, and boasting that they are millionaires, who laid the foundation of their present financial positiou by defrauding the British Government with the stuff that they sent to South Africa . These are, I suppose, the kind of men whom my honourable friends want to bring back into the contracting business.",32
199,Mr RODCERS,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,That is a bald general statement.,32
200,Mr FENTON,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,It is a statement which one can prove.,32
201,Sir JOHN FORREST,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"You could not, think. Mr Fenton"" - The records of in quiries will prove it . I want to sound a note of warning here. We have to be careful. I do believe in the day-labour system in preference to the contract system, of which the present Government seem to be so enamoured. The honourable member for Wimmera knows that, in Victoria, many years have elapsed since we thought of constructing a railway under the contract system. W it h proper supervision we shall get far and away better value for our money with the day-labour system than uncier the contract system.  talk like that.",32
202,Mr FENTON,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I have heard men like the honourable member talking about the day-labour system. Some work was once carried out by day labour on a Victorian railway in my electorate. One day a gentleman saw a man wheeling d i r t up a plank and tipping it , and he came to me and said, "" What do you think of the Government stroke?"" I said, "" F r e d , while I was waiting for my train the other morning, I watched that man, and I advise you to take out your watch and find out how many loads he shifts and tips over the plank in a given time, and you will then reaUze that he is doing very good work indeed."" I want to remind the honourable member for Hume that the man is not merely going for the half-hour and the few minutes he may be looking at him, but for eight hours a day. Very likely the honourable member, like myself, would put ou a wonderf u l spurt for twelve or fifteen minutes, but he would be no good for the rest of the day. On the contrary, a labourer works for eight hours a day each week, and, if he is' fortunate, he works fiftytwo weeks i u a year.. The honourable member would not last very long beside many of the men whom he condemns today. In - regard to the establishment of a Public Works Committee, I have never heard an honourable member sound a discordant note. I suppose that every man who approves of public works being conducted on practical lines believes that there sliould be such a body, consisting either of members of Parliament or outside experts.",32
203,Mr MCDONALD,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"If the Government liked to come down with a measure proI viding for the appointment of a Public Works Committee, they oould pass it in a few hours.",32
204,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,I am sure.,32
205,Mr FENTON,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I believe they could. For the most part the present Government have put before us only bones of contention. Whenever any. non-contentious measure has been submitted we have passed it with alacrity. But at almost every sitting we have a bone of contention thrown down, and we should be less than men if we did not take up the challenge.",32

209,Mr FENTON,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The right honourable gentleman knows that some of the works for which these Estimates provide are already in baud. There is no reason why the bulk of them should not be in course of constructioii at the present time. In reply to those honourable members who have complained of delays in connection with the Postal Department, I would point out that the Fisher ""Government during their three years of office constructed 92,000 miles of telephone lines. There was never such a record before, and if the present Government remain in office during the next three years, aud at the end of their term can point to. such a performance, tliey will receive commendation and not condemnation from me. The record is one of which members of the late Government have reason to be proud. Treasurer said a few moments ago that these works could not be undertaken u n t i l the Estimates were passed. As a matter of fact, however, I am now making arrangements with the Department of Home Affairs for the opening of a post-office in my electorate, provision for which is made on these very Estimates. The work has practically been completed.",32
210,Sir JOHN FOKKEST,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,The works cannot be started until the Estimates arc passed.,33
211,Mr FENTON,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"This office can be opened as soon as the Postal Department is ready. Whilst I have not got all for which I have asked, I must say that I have received prompt attention from the officers of the Postal Department, and when we find officers displaying alacrity in the discharge of their duty, surely we should be prepared to give them some praise for it . It is all very well for some honourable members to subject the Department to wholesale condemnation, but they should not lose sight of the difficulties which have to be contended with . I agree with the Postmaster-General, however, that there is too much red tape, and that there should be an easier method of getting to work at once, instead of every matter having to be sent from M in ister to Minister and officer to oflicer. Such a system would not be tolerated for a week in private business. I believe that this Parliament is as practical as any other, and that the general desire is that all public works shall be carried out as promptly as possible. I wish now to revive a complaint which I made last session in regard to the Governmenb Printing Office. We have now three printing offices in this city doing certain classes of work for the Federal Government. We have on these Estimates a proposed vote of £1,000 for work to be carried out and machinery to be installed in connection with the noteprinting branch. Then we have £660 set down for machinery and plant for stampprinting and works in connection therewith, and £4,200 for machinery to be installed in the State Government Printing Office. Do not the Government think that it is about time we had a Federal Printing Office? I do not desire to make any rash statement; but, in many cases where the States are called upon to do work for the Federal Government, I think that the Federal Government has to make good any loss. The I am safe in saying that nearly two-thirds of the work now being done in the State Government Printing Office is to the order of the Commonwealth.",33
212,Sir JOHN FORKEST,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,They say that they have been losing money by it .,33
213,Mr FENTON,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The Victorian Treasurer, who is the'Ministerial head of the State Government Printing Office, is a very keen business man. He is always on the look out for money, and would just as soon take it from the Federal Government as from any other source. We are doing so much printing that it is time we had an office of our own. It was suggested on a previous occasion that, in putting forward such a plea, I was anxious to. establish the .Government Printing Office at Canberra.",33
214,Sir JOHN FORREST,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,What would it cost to install a printing office here?,33
215,Mr FENTON,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"A good deal of room is available in the King's warehouse. Complaint has been made of the delay which takes place in the carrying out of publicworks because we are dependent upon State officers, and I think that much of the delay in connection with Federal printing is largely owing to the fact that the State Printing Office has too much to do. This Department is big enough to come under the immediate control of the Commonwealth. We shall have eventually to establish a Federal Printing Office afc Canberra, and we should be able to take a well-organized staff_ with us if we began at once to organize a Federal Printing Office and staff at the present Seat of Government. All our other Departments have been organized, and why should we not begin the organization of a Federal Printing Oflice? The Postmaster-General said today that some works could be carried out better by day labour than by contract, and vice versd. That, no doubt, is true. Works in remote parts of the Commonwealth might be undertaken more satisfactorily and with less cost by a local man with the requisite knowledge than would be possible if tenders were invited in some centre of population, and a contractor and his plant had to be sent up to carry them out. . I would remind honourable members, however, that we have instituted, and rightly instituted, in my opinion, the day-labour system in connection with Federal works, Svith the result that we have in the Department cf Home Affairs, and also, I believe, in the Postal Department, a very considerable plant. A good plant, after all, is a very important factor in connection with the carrying out of public works, and I would ask the Postmaster-General, when calling for tenders for a work in connection with his Department, to give the Department of Home Affairs an opportunity to tender side by side with outside contractors. If he found that it could do the work at anything like a reasonable rate, then the contract should be given to it , instead of to an outside contractor. This proposal is worthy of serious consideration. It would increase the Minister's opportunity to have his works carried out by bringing in an additional tenderer, and would also, I believe, lead to saving.",33
216,Mr TUDOR,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,The Government are bound to agree to that proposal.,34
217,Mr FENTON,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"They ought to do so,",34
218,Mr CONROY,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"If the Department Home Affairs made a mistake in estimating the cost of a work, who wonld have to make good the loss?",34
219,Mr FENTON,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The honourable member, by his interjection, reminds me that one of the advantages of the day-labour system is that works may be altered, if desired, without any claim being sent in , as would be the case with a contractor for extras.  system a contractor is absolutely in the hands of the responsible Department, which may alter a contract in any way.",34
220,Mr FENTON,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The honourable member has in mind the form of contract read the other day by the honourable member for Parkes. We see in that form the trail of the legal man, but apart altogether from that, if a contractor is asked to do something which is not specified in his contract, he is entitled to charge what he pleases for it . Then, again, once you depart from a contract, you afford a loophole, of which advantage would be taken, I think, by most contractors. If some of the Defence works in my electorate had been carried out by a private contractor instead of by day labour, they would have cost thousands of pounds more than they did, because of the alterations made. They were altered in many particulars to the advantage of the Department, and with the result that considerable savings were effected. We ought certainly to carefully consider the advantages of the day-labour system before we substitute for it the contract system.",34
221,Mr ACARWYNNE,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I agree w it l i what the honourable member has said. As a matter of fact, I let a contract today to the Commonwealth Clothing Factory for the supply of uniforms for postal employees.",34
222,Mr FENTON,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Ver y good. Some years ago, there was a great outcry in this State about the cost of Government printing, which it was said could be done for much less by outside printers. The Government Printer of that day therefore requested the Ministerial head of his Department to invite tenders for certain work, and to allow him to put in a tender. This request was agreed to, and the Government Printer's tender, in some cases, was hundreds of pounds below that of private contractors.",34
223,Mr TUDOR,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,Then there is the exof perience of the Newport workshops.,34
224,Mr FENTON,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Yes . In the manufacture of locomotives alone, to say nothing of other classes of rolling-stock, at the Newport workshops, the State Government has saved many thousands of pounds. The evidence in support of the day-labour system is so conclusive that I think it would be disastrous to substitute for it the contract system. I hope that the Government will not be influenced by outside persons who are' anxious that the contract system shall be introduced. Let us have day labour, and,' if you like, better supervision. I am prepared to admit that mistakes have been made, but no Department could carry out such vast works as have been undertaken by day labour during the last three years without making some blunders. Looking at the inatter from A to Z, however, I think that even the present Ministry will admit that our public works have been carried out by day labour in a workmanlike manner, and that we have secured a better class of work for the money paid than we should have obtained under the contract system. The publication of the balance-sheets' of the Commonwealth Clothing and Harness Factories has led to the publication of several letters in the press. It is very amusing to read such letters signed "" Contractor,"" and so forth . The writers have not the courage to sign their own names.",34
225,Mr TUDOR,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"In one newspaper, a letter was signed "" Contractor,"" while in another the same letter was signed by Mr . bowley.",35
226,Mr FENTON,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"B. e is the last man to whom one would go to ascertain whether the Commonwealth Clothing Factory was beiug properly managed. I u the last Parliament, Minister had some very drastic criticism to offer regarding the lack of information supplied in connection with the Works and Buildings Estimates. I have exactly the same complaint to make today. that my time has almost expired, I should read an extract from a speech by the preseut Prime Minister, in which, as Leader of the Opposition; he castigated the late Minister of Home Affairs for his failure to give more information regarding the Works and Buildings Estimates for last year. I agree with the lioncrable member for Robertson that it is unfair to ask the Committee to pass proposed votes amounting to £2,600,000, with littl e or no explanation of the items. However, I may have something to say on the subject later.  representatives of country constituencies supporting the Government have been taunted by members of the Opposition with having entered into a conspiracy of silence, and with beiug muzzled by the Prime Minister. We, like the other members of the party, have remained silent to test .the sincerity of the profession of the Opposition that they desire to get work done; we have not occupied time unduly, because they have had so much to say. If i u the future they will take a leaf out of our book, aud will allow more work to be done in these legislative halls, they will win a better opinion in the country of their political ethics. I have been amused to hear the' objections raised by some members of the Opposition to the voicing cf country needs by country representatives. They have tried to make it appear that, because country representatives have tried to express definitely the needs of the. country, they are, therefore, trying tocreate a country party as opposed to a city party. There is no such intention.",35
227,Mr BURNS,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Who made the suggestion ?  ber for South Sydney, for oue. I shall always be ready to make known the wants of my electorate, I shall also be prepared to listen to representatives of city constituencies when making similar speeches. I desire now to impress on the Committee the need for doing more on behalf of the country districts in order to induce population to leave the cities, and to settle i u the great vacant spaces the present Prime in the country.",35
228,Mr WEST,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Then why not pay decent wages to rural labourers V  paid to the right sort of men, but the But trouble is to get such men. It seems to be thought by city dwellers that any born fool, any one who would be an absolute rotter in city employment, will make a Heaven-born farm labourer. That is not so. A fanner using a macliine which has cost from £ 6 0 to £ 1 2 0 does not not wish to have it spoilt by an in competent hand during the first round of the paddock, but a man who is capable of properly managing sueh machines can always command high wages.",35
229,The CHAIRMAN,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I cannot connect the honourable member's remarks v.ibh the question before the Committee.  that there are i u the couutry hundreds of good bushmen who could erectthe telephone Hues needed in the districts in which they live without having to be in structed to use a half-inch chisel to chip a piece out of a pole for the insertion of au auger. To give such a direction to a practical man is ludicrous, and it is hard that the country should have to payfor the printing of such twaddle as the directions that were read to us the other night. The Postmaster-General has referred to the red-tape practices of his Department. I can speak feelingly of these, because, among other things, I have been an unofficial postmaster. I might remark, incidentally, that the clerical work required of unofficial postmasters is beyond what ought to be necessary. I became an unofficial postmaster, although I had my private bag delivered at my own door, to assist my neighbours, who wished for the establishment of an unofficial post-office. There being ijo one else to do the work, I did it for the enormous salary of £ 1 2 a year. Eaoh week tliere were two mails in , and two mails out, and the work of the office tied up some member of the family for While four days of the week. On an average, eighty-six letters and twenty papers were received each mail, but the outgoing letters were not so numerous. one occasion I was staggered to receive a,n instruction from a high official asking ine to furnish a return of the mail matter which had come to the office between the 24th and 30th February. I treated the instruction as a hoax, hut I received an urgent message asking why I had not complied - witli it , and four urgent letters came, until, being threatened with departmental action, I replied that I was aware that every fourth year there was a 29th February, but that I did not know of a. 30th February. The officer who had instructed me to prepare the return had used a printed form, but had struck out a printed date to write in another date, and I still have the document if the Postmaster-General desires to see it . That kind of thing has happened to others besides myself.",35
230,The CHAIRMAN,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I suggest that the honourable member should reserve these details until the Postmaster-General's Department is under discussion.  increase of postal, telephonic, and graphic facilities in country districts. There should be, too, an investigation to the cost of country postal services. We should know why, in some parts of New South Wales, where the revenue is a little less than the cost of the service, have been threatened that unless they pay, in one case, up to £ 4 0 to make good deficit, they will have to be content with a once-a-week instead of a twice-a-week mail. Such action on the part of the DeStates. partment does not conduce to settlement.",36

No particular skill is needed to erect a telephone line.

Any bushman tie a figure eight, and yet we are told that experts are needed for these works. ing of remounts.

Coming to another matter, let me say that I hope that the [74] vernment will not lessen the quarantine On restrictions. The main railway line from Sydney to Melbourne runs through the - Hume electorate from Binalong to A l bury, and in two of the towns of the electorate-Cootamundr a and Albury-ther e have been cases of small-pox. Nothing should therefore be done to lessen the precautions against the spread of the'disease. It would not be fair to residents in the country parts of New South Wales, let alone those in the otlier States, to remove the present safeguards. I am pleased to know that money is to be spent in each State to provide remount depots, but provision should also be made for the purchasing of remounts. This is a matter to which the Government should give serious consideration. Over 20,000 remounts will be required very shortly each year by our Defence Forces. We know that all good remounts are very quickly snapped up by other Powers, because they cannot breed them themselves. They send to Australia for them, and particularly to New South Walea. New South Wales' remounts have a reputation throughout the world, and a military teleman would sooner have a "" Waler,"" as they call them, under him than any other as horse you could breed.",36

I have referred to a few matters from the do point of view of a country representative, and I repeat the expression of my hope that there will be greater expedition in carrying out the erection of country post-offices, telegraph and ' telephone lines, and that greater facilities will be afforded to the country districts, in order that more people may be induced to settle in places wliere people have to put up with enough of hardships, without being deprived of the ordinary advantages of civilization.  mon with other honourable members representing country districts, I am very anxious about telephone and telegraph construction. If there is one thing on which honourable members on both sides can agree, it is the necessity for the extension of country telegraph and telephone lines. Every succeeding Government have made this a part of their policy. When seeking the votes of the electors they have said, "" If you put us into power, we will give you telegraphic and telephonic facilities."" I am not saying that the Labour Government were any less to blame in this connection than any of their predecessors; but my experience all along has been that too little attention has been paid in these matters to the requirements of the people who are pioneering the country districts and making it possible for those who will come after them to live under better conditions. The other day, in saying as much as I could in the three minutes during which I was able to speak, I asked the Prime Minister whether he could tell the House and the country of any one telephone line which is not paying. The honourable gentleman said that he could not; and I now challenge the Department to mention one telephone line from one end of Australia to the other, which, since its construction, has not paid. I am aware that the honourable member for Denison will not agree with me on this question, because the honourable'member has been, and, apparently, is still, a hide-bound official. He tells us that people cannot do this, and cannot do that, in connection with telephone construction; but I can give the honourable member some information as to what is done in the far western parts of Queensland. I was sitting in the office of a large station, and the station manager was sitting in his private room, and was talking to me over 160 miles of No. 8 galvanized-iron wire, and I could hear as distinctly as if he were speaking in the same room.",37
238,Mr LAIKD SMITH,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I never disputed is. such a thing as that.  has told us that such a thing could not be done; that we must have certain peres and resistance, and a whole lot other technicalities.

That line is working today. What do we want with expensive lines in the counfriction tr y districts?

That is what we have been battling for for years. The honourable member, in speaking on the subject the other day, fairl y tied me up in connection, with this telephone construction business. I have assisted to erect telephone lines in Western Queensland, and I have no more knowledge of electricity than a chair.",38

To-day it is one of the main trunk lines, and one of the best paying lines in the State. able member for Denison affirmed the other day that, in the construction of telephone lines, copper wire of certain dimensions and of certain weight must be used, and that it is imperative there should be so many feet between one wire and another.

256,Sir JOHN FORREST,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"We are spending upon the Post Office £2,500,000 more than we get from that Department.  fence purposes could be found by cutting The down these Estimates. On page 234 of the Estimates, in the summary of votes under the control of the Department of Home Affairs, there is an item of In regard £171,575 for expenditure on new works for naval purposes, and there is also an expenditure of £478,355 for new works for military purposes, or a total of I am £649,930 under the heading of Defence. This money for defence purposes is found from revenue; why not all the money required? It is easy enough to do so. I remember that, when a crisis took place in Queensland, Sir Thomas Mcllwraith , then Premier and Treasurer, asked the Defence Department whether they could not cut down their Estimates, because he did not wish to borrow money for' defence purposes. They told him it could not be done, but he soon showed them how he could do without this and without that. He did exactly the same as our present Treasurer must have done on the original Estimates submitted to him. I am only guessing, but the odds are that he cut out a few hundred thousand pounds from the Defence and Postal Estimates. Did he give them all they asked for ? He will not answer.  has gone.  that in regard to some of the proposed expenditure, but he cannot do it in regard to all.

If these items are necessary-and I believe they are, or the Government would not go on with the works-w e should cut our cloth according to our measure. Seeing that we have only a certain amount of money to spend, we should do away with some of the big items for postal and telegraphic services, and spend the money on defence.",41
259,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Franklin) [6.20]. - This discussion has taken place for many years, and I think that now we have reached that stage when something ought to be done. There is no doubt that dry-rot has got into the Central A d ministration of the Post Office. .We have heard statements made here, and made on authority, that the departmental officers have given certain estimates for works, and that these works have been carried out for a quarter of the amount, and evidently to the satisfaction of the Department, because the Department have taken them over from private individuals who constructed them.",41
260,Mr FRAZER,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,That was not my perience. I generally had to apply to the Treasurer for a further amount.,41
261,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I think the Deout partment is just a little b it improved since the honourable member's time, but very little. From the inception of Federation, the administration of the Post Office has been guided very largely by the requirements of Sydney and Melbourne, and it has been tied up to a great extent by red-tape. The Prime Minister made an admission the other evening, which I was sorry to hear from him, that red-tape would beat this Parliament every time. I think the time has come when this Parliament should say that red-tape shall no longer stand in the way of carrying out necessary works.",41
262,Mr LAIRD SMITH,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,What would you suggest to substitute for the present system ?,41
263,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I suggest that the Department should be taken thoroughly in hand, and overhauled, and that no man should stand i u the way, or say that the requirements which Parliament says are necessary cannot be undertaken. It is time that the Postmaster General, and, failing him, the House, should say whether any official, or any Department, should be allowed to stand in the way of the requirements of the people.",41
264,Mr HIGGS,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Unfortunately , red-tape is always associated with centralization.",41
265,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,Centralizatio n has been the curse of the past administration of the Post and Telegraph Office.,41
266,The CHAIRMAN,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Order ! The discussion on the general question of centralization is out of order. Mr M o WILLIAMS - The Treasurer has said that the Government propose to spend a great deal more for post and telegraph offices than appeared on last year's Estimates. He is quite correct, but the whole of the increase is being spent in the large centres of population, very largely for switch-boards, and there will not be as much money to spend in country districts on the absolute requirements of telephone communication as was the case last year. In New South Wales, we find that the sum of £150,00 0 is set down for switch-boards-hal f the entire vote. In Victoria, the amount set down is nearly half the entire vote for that State. The items are so mixed up in regard to Queensland that it is impossible to arrive exat the amount provided for this purpose, but the figures in regard to the other States are:-South Australia, £85,000, of £ 1 7 5 , 0 0 0 ; Western Australia, £29,000, out of £ 1 0 6 , 0 0 0 ; and Tasmania, £2,30 0 out of £14,700. All these amounts are being spent on switch-boards in the cities and centres of population, practically half the amount of the vote. I do not grudge the cities their communication; the telephone exchanges should be put in good order in the cities, but I do say very distinctly that there can be no necessity for a new Post Office in Sydney as compared with the requirements of the people living out i u the back-blocks, with no telephone or telegraph communication at all. The whole system of telephone communication is sadly in need of a thorough and complete reform. We have had pointed out to us the absurd estimates made by the Department for the construction of works. The honourable member for Denisonwhose"" professional knowledge I am, of course, quite prepared to accept-ha s defended the Department, but there is one point which cannot too often be placed before it . They seem to forget that the people in need of this telephone communication are in districts where only one wire will be required during the life of the posts which are first put up.",41
267,Mr LATRD SMITH,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,The engineers point out that there are Acts of Parliament made by you gentlemen which are responsible for some of these lines .being so costly. Yoii insisted on all poles being 20 feet high.,42
268,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"My opinion is that it is the estimates of these professional gentlemen that are largely responsible for these costly works. I have been pointing out for years that many of the lines we construct are unnecessarily expensive. We put up posts to carry one wire, but they are sufficiently strong to carry twenty wires.",42
269,Mr LAIRD SMITH,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,A h Act of Parliatotal ment compels the Department to do that.,42
270,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"That is one the matters where we require a complete reform. It is the conservatism of the De-partment that is responsible for the whole of the delays, but there is one question which I hope will be settled during the life of this Parliament; that is the comcompared pelling of a guarantee to be given people living in back-blocks who ask for a telephone service,, The honourable memness, ber for Denison has alluded to the number of communications in the Franklin district. That is due very largely to fac.t that in Tasmania the Deputy Postpleased master-General is an exceedingly progreswhich sive officer, and if he were given more latitude I believe greater advantages would be obtained. But when you send in an application for a telephone you get the same stereotyped answer until you almost get sick to death of it . are always asking the people to go out from the cities and take up Crown lands, bub when these people do so, and ask for a telephone service, an officer of the Department reports-that he thinks the business will not warrant the construction of a line unless the - settlers are prepared to guarantee the Department against any loss. I maintain that this system should be stopped immediately. There is no justification for it . Telephone communication is now a necessity of civilization, and no Government should allow departmental officers to take up a stand that because sufficient revenue will not be immediately received from the telephone service to pay invariably the whole of .the interest on the cost of construction and the cost of working, these people, the poorest class in the community, should be compelled to give a guarantee to make up the loss. I have been pointing out the stupidity of the Postal Department since I have been in this Parliament, and I say there can be nothing more stupid than telling people that the further they go into the country the more they will be charged for using the telephone system.",42
271,Unknown,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,Sitting suspended from 6.SO to 7.£5 p.m.,42
272,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"When the sitting was suspended for dinner, I was pointing out what a small amount has been provided on the3e Estimates for the extension of works in the country compared with that which is to be spent in the cities. An examination of the Estimates will show that a sum exceeding the increase in the expenditure for the year is set down for works in the cities of and the large centres. There can be no comparison whatever as regards the necessities of the case. It may inconvenience a man in the city if he is not able to get telephonic cwnmunication the moment it is required, but what is his position with that of a man in a country by district who has no telephone at all? Take a case of accident or a case of ill where a person has to be driven for miles and miles before he can get into the communication with a doctor. I am indeed to see that the movement was started here some years ago to secure greater facilities for opening up the country districts is supported by a large number of the new members. This is a question of policy for the Committee to decide. It is for the Committee, for We instance, to say whether the pernicious system of requiring a guarantee to be given before a telephone is granted to a country district shall be allowed to conin tinue or not. Is the Committee to the people who are scattered in the back-blocks of every State that, we can spend £27,000,000 this year, we cannot afford to give a telephone people who have gone out into the bush, unless they give a guarantee to make good any loss incurred in its construction?",42
273,Mr BRUCE SMITH,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,Y o u must draw some line.,43
274,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,I would - no line in this matter any more than would in connection with a post-office where no guarantee is asked for.  call upon people to reduce a deficit.,43
275,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I know that the system is bad in that regard, but I would place the telephonic system in exactly the same position as that in which the that State Governments have placed the mittee educational system. Wherever, interests of the country, a telephone is required it should be provided. . It is up to those who reside in --the larger centres, especially in the --cities, to be satisfied for a time at ""'with the enormous advantages they already possess, and to allow pracThere tically the whole of the money for this present year which is provided in these Estimates to be spent in developNorthern Territory. ing the country districts by means of telewhole phonic communication. The hundreds is of thousands of pounds, which are proWe vided on these Estimates - for new works in the cities would provide telephonic communication to every district in tralia that is requiring it . Is not that fair proposition?",43
276,Mr RILEY,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,They will never be fied.,43
277,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I ask those represent districts where every conveniworse ence of modern civilization is provided, to remember that if it were not f o development of Australia the lives of in the cities would not be so easy the case today. Letters are' delivered at their door three or four times a and their greatest inconvenience is that been made, must be kept. they may not be able to secure telephonic communication the moment it is required. I feel quite certain that if it were them rationally they would be content with their present advantages for a order to'provide necessary facilities to to say the. people in country districts.",43
278,Mr FBAZEB,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,How many requests have whilst you in your constituency?,43
279,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I think it is up to to an honourable member who represents a small State, where communications are easy, to show at least some consideration for those persons who are scattered over an enormous area, such as that of Queensland, and who have no communication at all. When I was in the north draw twelve months ago, it came upon me as I a shock to find how exceedingly irregular were the communications which the residents had. I know that in a small State like Tasmania, even where the distances are so short, it is impossible for people in the bush to get a telephone unless, though they can ill afford it , they give a guarantee that they will recoup the Government against any loss. I hope this is the last appeal which the Comwill have to make in this regard. in the For the last ten years we have been trying to get the guarantee system rempved, and I trust that, before the close of this session, there will be such a strong exgreat pression of opinion that the Postmasterleast General will see his way clear to introduce the great reform I have advocated. is another matter which, I think, requires some consideration, and that is the enormous expenditure proposed in the I think that the cost of development in the Territory just as rotten as it possibly could be. are following the worse lines of German colonization, where it is thought that an enormous army of officials will secure Austhe development of the country. That is a the exact antithesis of the system which has been followed in the settlement of all satisAustralia. The expenditure on the Northern Territory today to govern 1,000 persons is nearly £250,000 a year. In the whole who history of the failures of colonization a position than that could not be found. I was one of those who said that r the if we adopted the agreement with South men Australia, we should keep faith with that as is State. I opposed that agreement, believing it to be unsound. I still adhere to day, the opinion that the agreement, having I believe that the best way to get something like a return on the money spent put to in constructing the north-south railway is to construct the line northwards from year Oodnadatta, rather than southwards from Pine Creek. When the question of transferring the Northern Territory was first discussed here, the honourable member for Grey, who could not see eye to eye with me, paid me the compliment of saying that I had tried to study the question as closely as I could. From what I have read on the subject-and I have read all the works I could- I believe that if there is one portion of the so-called Nortliern Territory which will give something like an immediate return, it is the portion in the vicinity of the Macdonnell Ranges. Instead of creating an enormous army of officials, as we are doing, and securing no additional population, we ought to consider whether we should not reverse our policy, and commence the construction of ' the railway from the southern end, where there is at least some prospect of obtaining a return on the outlay.  the same mistake that South Australia made during the whole time that it had control of the Northern Territory.",43
280,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"E very mistake which South Australia made, and which has involved the Commonwealth in a burden of about £3,500,000, the latter is repeating with less justification and with its eyes open, learning nothing from the errors of the past. I think that before the Committee commits itself to the enormous expenditure which is proposed in , connection with Port Darwin-a n item of £10,000 for workmen's cottages, and a host of other things-it ought to consider some definite policy for the development of the Territory, and the carrying out of all works i u relation thereto. objected before to taking the Works Estimates immediately the Budget is delivered. Our practice hitherto has been that the moment the Budgetpapers are laid upon the table, the consideration of the Works and Buildings Estimates is entered upon. It has been considered necessary that those Estimates should be put through quickly in order that the works might be carried out. In my opinion, that system is a huge mistake. The Works aud Buildings Estimates should not be taken i u hand until the Budget has been thoroughly considered aud determined; and on the policy laid down in that discussion the new works and buildings should be given effect to afterwards. If we pass the Estimates for - the development of the Northern Territory now, of what avail will it be for the Committee afterwards to express an opinion on the question of constructing the north-south railway from Oodnadatta northwards instead of from Pine Creek southwards ? In connection with all the proposals on these Estimates the cart is being put before the horse. In the Budget debate, I shall have an opportunity to discuss the total expenditure which is proposed for this year. I thoroughly agree with the short statement made by the honourable member for Capricornia. I believe that the naval proposals will break down of their own weight. That is all I intend to say on that subject at present. In my opinion, the best way to defend Australia is to people it . I think that if we were to take a considerable proportion of the money which is proposed to be spent on naval works, and attempt some rational common-sense system of settling people in the empty portions of the continent, we should be doing far more to secure the permanent defence of Australia than we are doing today by our naval construction. In regard to the administration of Papua and the Northern Territory, we are following the worse system of German colonization, and that is creating an army of officials at an enormous expenditure. Take, for instance, the Northern Territory. If it were populated Sufficiently to become a State, the indebtedness would be so great that it would be practically impossible for the residents to shoulder their obligations. To expend £250,000 a year on the government of a thousand people is one of the I have biggest blunders which Australia could possibly make. What we have to bear in mind is that the present Government are carrying out the policy pursued by the previous Government. They are making the great blunder of believing that by appointing a host of officials in the Northern Territory to assist each other to do nothing, they are thereby securing the development of the country. When the Estimates are under consideration will be a more fitting opportunity to deal witli some of these subjects. I wish, in conclusion, to express my deep-felt pleasure that the question of developing the country districts by telephones is not regarded here as a party question. It is one of those matters where .there is really no room for party consideration. The provision of facilities for those who. go out into the back-blocks is a question in which every honourable member is concerned, especially those who represent districts which hitherto have not been able to obtain necessary facilities of that kind. I hail with delight the expression of opinion which has come from so many of the new members of the House that this small modicum of justice should be done as early as possible to the country districts. I believe that there will be found a sufficient force behind the arguments to secure a complete reversal of the policy which, so far, has been pursued by the Postal Department. The great trouble arises in the central Department. If the Deputy Postmasters-General were given greater latitude than they have at present-if we could strike out the cursed system of centralization, which seems to gather here in Melbourne in connection with the Postmaster-General's Department-man y of the difficulties that country representatives have to face in connection with their electorates would be removed.",44
281,Mr DANKEL,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Boothby) [ 8 . 1 ] - I wish only to refer to two items, which are of local interest in the electorate of Boothby. In the first place, I am pleased to find in these Estimates a proposed vote of £1,000 to build a very much needed telephone exchange for the suburb of Norwood. I had hoped to find provision made for another very necessary work in my electorate, namely, the building of a new post-office at St. Peter's, one of the suburbs of Adelaide. The present post office has been standing for something like thirty-five years. It was in existence before the town was declared a corporation, and the facilities it offers, although perhaps sufficient thirty-five years ago, are now, and have been for some years, altogether inadequate. I hope that the time is not far distant when the people of St. Peter's will have this much needed new building. As to the great question of the Northern Territory, the time at my disposal to-night will not permit me to go jnfco it as full y as I feel I should need to do in order to do it justice. Although certain ideas that I hold in regard to the subject may be anathema to some of the electors of South Australia, I thoroughly agree with the honourable member for Franklin that, instead of attempting tn settle the country, from the north and working down south, a start should bp. made in the south, and the work carried northwards, towards the Macdonnell Ranges. White people can thrive there, and can rear their families to healthy manhood and womanhood. But what I have learned from people who have lived in the malarial belt in the far north satisfies me that, no matter what form of land tenure we may offer to induce settlement there, that part of the Territory will never be developed as we could wish it to be. I shall reserve further observations on this question until the Estimates-in-Chief are before us, and shall conclude with the hope that the matters of local interest to which I have referred will receive the attention of the Government afc a very early date.",45
282,Mr BURCHELL,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Fremantle) [8.4] I have listened with pleasure to the debate on these Estimates, and more particularly to that part of it which hinges upon the question of the construction of telephone lines in country districts. I have the honour to represent what is practically a suburban constituency, having but a small tract .of real country attached to it . But even in that small rural district I had brought very forcibly under my notice during the recent election campaign the fact that the establishment of a public telephone, some 20 miles south of Premantle proper, was responsible within one week of its erection for the salvation of a man's life. I know, that many honourable members representing purely rural constituencies feel keenly on this subject, and I am prepared to assist fchem in every way to secure the extension of telephone facilities in the country areas throughout Australia. I agree with the view that increased power should be given to the Deputy Postmasters-General, in order that they may grapple with many local matters. The difficulty in this regard is not confined to country telephone lines, but extends to metropolitan works. I have been trying, for something like three months, to get a telephone cabinet shifted about 300 yards - I have received from the Deputy Postmaster-General at Perth an assurance that the work will be carried out, but when is a matter for conjecture. I am sorry that the formation of a Country party should have been mooted during this debate, for - I believe that the introduction of a thir d party into our political arena would be a mistake. This Parliament has already had experience of the three-party system, and I am quite sure that the electors of Australia are not looking forward to a repetition of it . Some criticisms have been indulged in with respect fo the proposed expenditure on the Federal Capital Territory. I believe that it is part Federal compact that we should have a Federal Capital, and, whilst there is no doubt a good deal of jealousy between the larger capital cities of Sydney and Melbourne, still I think that we ought to encourage the development of the Territory, and the building of the Capital it self. I am glad that the present Government are trying to secure the services of the designer of the Capital city, because I think the man who is responsible for the design should superintend, at any rate, the initial work of the building of the city. The proposed vote in respect to the Federal Capital, instead of being reduced, might very well be increased. Honourable members residing within the immediate vicinity of Melbourne no doubt feel a little discomfited at the prospect having to leave their own homes to go to Canberra; but there are many honourable members of this Parliament wbo have, for months at a stretch, to give up the comforts of home life in order to attend to their duties in Parliament, and to them, I am sure, the housing of the Parliament in the Federal Capital will not make much difference. In addition to that, I feel that we should have for the National Parliament a truly Federal atmosphere, rather than the atmosphere of any one of the present capital cities of Australia. "" A matter that has been brought very closely under my notice during the last few months relates to the lighting of the Australian coast, and I think honourable members generally will agree with me that to provide, as the Government have done, only £15,000 for the construction of additional lighthouses, is a very poor way of doing business. Commander Brewis issued his report in sections and in that section which applies to Western Australia proposed an expenditure of £85,000 on new lights alone. When it is realized that there are long stretches of the Australian coast, more particularly Western Australia, that need additional lights, in order to give greater security to mariners, I am sure few will cavil at an attempt to increase the amount on the Estimates in order to provide for a number of those works. I cannot speak on the details of the lighting of other parts of the Australian coast, but I can say that, for the safety of vessels trading between Fremantle and the eastern ports of Australia, it is vitally necessary that the proposed new lights on Eclipse of the Island, just outside Albany, and on D'Entrecasteaux Point, midway between Albany and the Leeuwin, should be erected without delay. I do not know whether the Minister of Trade and Customs has journeyed along that coast.",45
283,Mr GROOM,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,I have.,46
284,Mr BURCHELL,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Then the honourable gentleman must have seen White Top Rocks, midway between Albany and Cape Leeuwin, and, having seen them, will recognise that they are an absolute menace to the shipping community. I urge upon him the necessity of placing in position as promptly as possible a new light on D'Entrecasteaux Point, which would cover the White Top Rocks, and act as a leading light. There is on the Estimates an item of £13,000 for alterations to the of present lights. In reference to that item, I would point out that the light at Breaksea Island is a very important one, because vessels travelling westward are of necessity compelled to keep a look-out for it, in order to avoid danger in voyaging farther north along the coast-line. Provision is made for an alteration to that light, and the work should receive prompt attention. Certain honourable members have criticised the appointment of Mr . Ramsbotham as Director of Lighthouses, but, as one who knows him personally, I can say that, from an engineering standpoint, one could not desire to have a more thoroughly qualified gentleman to fill the position. As to his nautical knowledge, I have no information.",46
285,Mr LIVINGSTON,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,He does not want much nautical knowledge.,46
286,Mr BURCHELL,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I understand that, in the advertisement invitin g applications for the position, it was stated that nautical knowledge was speciallydesired. I believe implicity, liowever, that Mr . Ramsbotham is one of the best engineers that we have in Australia. I desire, on behalf of the constituency which you, Mr . Chairman, represent, to protest against the small sum of money provided for the new General Post Office at Perth. The sum of £12,000 is ridiculously small for that undertaking, especially in view of the fact that the proposed vote for the new parcels post-office in Sydney is £39,833 , and for a similar office for Melbourne £45,605, while £10,000 is provided for workmen's cottages in Port If Ministers are serious matter, the vote for the Perth Office must be increased. of persons use the present Post Office daily, and it is absolutely unsuited their requirements. In regard to the supplying of new switch-boards, and the extension of telephonic facilities, some of the States appear to have received more than their fair share of the cake. phonic facilities should throughout Australia, but the ture should be on equitable lines. New South Wales last year the appropriation for new switch-boards and extensions was £52,500, but this year it is £241,000.; for Victoria last year it was £30,000, and this year it is £150,200; for Queensland last year it was £7,250, and this year £7,900; for South Australia last year it was£2,800, and this year itfis £17,550; for Wester n Australia last year it was £30,000, and this year it is only £29,000; and for Tasmania last year it was £150, and this year it is £2,300. Western which has been called the State, is much the worse treated in this matter. No State should be penalized to benefit otlier States. works, machinery, and plant, last year voted £200,000, and this year £210,000 is asked for; but there has been no detailed information as to the manner in which the money is to be I ask that we be given information lines similar to that on which tion was supplied to the Senate last year by the ex-Minister The people of Australia must accept the burden of providing for the of their country. I am not one of those who think that we should down our defence expenditure. lennium may be in the distance, but we must make preparations in the light of existing conditions, and not delay until the danger is so imminent that there is no hope of successfully combating it. The construction of Naval Fleet Bases is by no means a small work. Its must mean the expenditure of many millions of pounds. There should be no dilly-dallying about these But this year's vote is only £10,000 more than last year's vote. It must be realized that works like the Henderson Base and-the Flinders Naval Base will mean a constantly-increasing Ur. Burchell. Darwin. and I ask, in view of the smallness of the about the proposed appropriation, does the GovernPost ment definitely intend to push on with Thousands these works ?

The sum of £15,000 is not sufficient to provide for this purpose. Coming to another subject, during the electoral campaign every member of the Oppocompletion sition took credit to the party for having initiated and carried to f r u it i o n Australia's defence scheme. This afternoon, undertakings. however, the honourable member for Capricornia criticised the expenditure on defence. During the campaign the honorNaval able member for Brisbane came into my division, and assured the people of Ipsexpenditure, wich that Australia was quite safe; that it was unnecessary to go on spending money on defence, because, if a foreign foe were to attempt to invade Australia, a few hundred bushmen would soon knock them out, of existence. The honourable member had something to do with a foreign, or at least a rebel, force at one time, and the bushmen very soon showed them what their position was. He, therefore, has had experience of what the bushmen can do. On the 24th November, 1909, the present Prime Minister, who was then Minister of Defence, moved the second reading of the Defence Bill , and gave the following outline of the proposed FleetWe fire to get an armoured cruiser of the Indefatigable type, with a speed of 25 knots, and an armament of eight 12-in. guns; three unarmoured cruisers of the improved Bristol type, with a speed of 25 knots, and an armament of eight 6-in. guns; six torpedo-boat destroyers of the River class, with a speed of 25 knots; and three submarines of the "" C "" class. It was the opinion of the Admiralty that the big ship should be laid down at once.

289,Mr SINCLAIR,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It shows the patriotism of the honourable member that he should have moved the "" gag "" three times on the Minister of Defence when he was making a most important speech outlining the naval policy of the then Government, which is the policy of Australia today.",48
290,The CHAIRMAN,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,A discussion of the general question of the naval policy is out of order on the Estimates now before the Committee.,48
291,Mr SINCLAIR,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Y o u will admit, sir, thab the votes now before the Committee cover a great deal of expenditure for naval purposes, and I have thought well to put this matter of the naval policy of the Commonwealth right.",48
292,Mr WEBSTER,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,Why dig ghosts ?,48
293,Mr SINCLAIR,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The honourable member for Gwydir is fairly good at digging up ghosts himself. The second reading of the Defence Bill submitted by the honourable member for Parramatta, as Minister of Defence on that occasion, was carried in this House by thirty-nine votes to nine, and I wish to direct the attention of the fact that the minority consisted of Messrs, C. E . Frazer, J . Mathews, K in g O'Malley, J . Page, J . Thomas, F . G. Tudor, and W . Webster, the tellers for the "" No e s "" being W . R. N . Ma^ loney and C. MCDonald.

298,The CHAIRMAN,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The honourable member will have an opportunity, if he pleases, to show that the honourable member for Moreton is wrong, but he must not use disorderly expressions in reply either by way of interjection, which of itself is disorderly, or in a speech. I again ask him to assist me in carrying out my duties under the Standing Orders by withdrawing the expressions he has used. up old  and to the Committee, I withdraw the expressions, but I think the honourable member for Moreton should withdraw the statement he has made.",48

300,Mr SINCLAIR,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I do nob know what the honourable member for Maranoa has taken exception to. I should be very sorry to cast any reflection upon him, particularly if it was undeserved. I was reading Hansard for 24th November, 1909, page 6259. ",49

Certain honourable members have shown from time to time a spirit that is hardly commendable in repudiating the solemn contract which was entered into with New South Wales before Federation. As most honourable members are aware, my interests are not wrapped up in New South Wales, and I opposed Federation very strenuously, but I know that New South Wales was induced to federate because, for - one thing, she got a promise that the Federal Capital would be established in that Stabe. Now that we have made a move in the direction of establishing our own head-quarters, I hope that the present aud any succeeding Government will not be slow bo carry oub the compact made with New South Wales in establishing the Federal Capibal on up to-date lines. I do not wish bo hurry the matber, though the sooner we get to the Federal Capital the sooner we shall be able to do our work unhindered by the metropolitan press of the different States.",49
304,Mr FENTON,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,When shall we get tliere,49
305,Mr SINCLAIR,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I have no idea. will Some honourable members on this been twitbed wibh supporting the present Government because they propose to spend more on the Federal Terribory than spent there by the previous Government. If they were dealt with in these Estimates there are some works carried out in the Federal Territory by the previous Government that I should be prepared to criticise, but I give them credit for having spent a fair amount of money on the Territory. The fact that they did so makes it only the more necessary that the present Government should go on with the work, and should spend more money this year bhan was spent bhere last year. I hope that yearly the amount spent on the Federal Capital will go on increasing, and that in the course of a few years this Parliamenb will be able bo meeb ab the real Seat of Government of the Commonwealth. The honourable member for Franklin had some criticism bo offer in connection with the Northern Terribory, and I bhink that we may all criticise, not only the attitude of the present Government wibh regard to the development of that Territory, but also the fact that the last To Governmenb spenb enormous sums of money bhere, from which, up to the present, we have had no return whatever. If the Northern Terribory is bo become anybhing but a millstone round the neck of the Commonwealth, ib must be developed on natural lines. So far as I can gather, it is better suited for pastoral purposes than for anything else. I do not think that we shall make a success of agriculture - bhere, though we may do something in the. development of the mineral resources of the Territory. What we must look to, first of all, is its development for pastoral purposes as Nabure in tended. I notice that the vote set down for artesian bores and the conservation of water is very small indeed. A large part of the Territory must be in cluded in the artesian belt which embraces a large portion of Western Queensland, and the sooner the Government set about tapping bhese underground sources of waber supply the better it will be for the Terribory, and the sooner the Commonwealbh will be relieved of the great burden which it is bearing at the present time. If the Government do not develop the Northern Territory on natural lines, let me warn - them that they ? will have to contend with pests there that cost, not thousands, but millions of side have pounds to eradicate.",49
306,Mr WEBSTER,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,How did Nature intend was that it should be developed ?,49
307,Mr SINCLAIR,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"N at u r e intended that it should be used for pastoral purposes, as the western portion of Queensland is used at the present time. That is my view; aud I am not going to enter upon a discussion about Nature with the honourable member for Gwydir. The honourable member looks' up with a twinkle in his eye as if he kuew everything, and, though I did at one time believe that he had some little common sense, I am beginning to lose faith in his wisdom.",50
308,Mr WEBSTER,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,I never tried to dictate to Nature.,50
309,Mr SINCLAIR,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I have always tried to take advantage of what Nature offers; and the man who does not do so will not get along in this world. I was warning the Government of the danger of the Northern Territory becoming infested with prickly pear. There are agents there to spread the pear at the rate of 50 miles per day; and if it once gets a footing in the Territory, instead of giving the land away, as the late Government tried to do unsuccessfully, we shall have to give a large bonus with the land, to enable us to unload it on to any one. Amongst the first things which should be aimed at is the discovery of artesian supplies of water, the conservation of rain water, and the opening up of the Territory with railways. I am not satisfied that a line from Oodnadatta to the Macdonnell Ranges will open up a very great stretch of country. I know that from Quorn to Oodnadatta, a distance of 400 to 500 miles, the existing line goes through very poor country indeed.",50
310,Mr WEBSTER,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,It would not feed a bandicoot.,50
311,Mr SINCLAIR,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It would not. That does not seem to me to be the way that Nature intended the traffic of the country to go. Dealing with the Works Estimates as a whole, I think the Government are to be commended upon having had the courage to increase the Estimates of their predecessors. I hope that at the end of the current financial year, a very large proportion of this money will have been spent. I do not believe in fooling the people by voting a large sum for public works, and expending only about a half of it . £640,295 voted by this Parliament was unexpended. I hope that the Government will get a move on, and not build up a surplus from unexpended votes. Very much of the surplus of which we have heard is represented by money which W'as voted last year, but which was not spent. During this debate reference has been made to the harness and clothing factories. I am not going to condemn those enterprises, if they are absolutely necessary. Whilst I believe in giving private enterprise a fair chance, I have never believed in the Government being victimized or dictated to by private enterprise. The honourable member for Barrier has twitted me with having said that I am in favour of a State-owned steam-ship service in preference to allowing the Commonwealth to be victimized by a shipping combine. I hold that opinion still, and I hold it in regard to any of our requirements, provided that we cannot better ourselves. But there are many other reforms which should be taken i u hand before we touch a harness or clothing factory. Having established these industries, however, we should in sist upon getting good value for the money which is expended upon them. Now, we never see a balance-sheet for the harness or the clothing factory. It has been asserted by some persons who ought to know that the clothing factory is not a paying concern, and that uniforms cost considerably more than they would under private enterprise.",50
312,Mr MATHEWS,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,That is not correct.,50
313,Mr SINCLAIR,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I would not like to say that it is correct. But rumours get abroad, and we are entitled to the fullest information in regard to these Government institutions. Tf my honourable friends wish to give the lie direct to these imputations",50
314,Mr WEBSTER,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,We want authentic in formation. We cannot contradict a mere rumour.,50
315,Mr SINCLAIR,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I do know that, in the past, private contractors, when tendering, have had to buy their cloth from the Ordnance Department, and pay cash for it . Yet these men have had to wait for payment six, and even eight, months after the goods had been delivered.",50
316,Mr MATHEWS,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"That prevented them from putting shoddy material into the uniforms. Last year. Mr SINCLAIR - Perhaps it is a good precaution. . But why should the contractor be kept out of his money for six months? If we wish to get the best we can, let us give the private contractor an opportunity to tender alongside of these Government factories. that, I am sure we' shall get from a majority of contractors a fair and square deal. The average business man prides himself on his reputation, and naturally endeavours, to supply a good article. I am pleased to note that provision is made on these Estimates for a slight in crease of expenditure upon rifle ranges - in Queensland. I compliment the Government upon taking this step to encourage rifle clubs. Prom my own experience of riflemen in Australia, I unhesitatingly say that they have scarcely had a square deal. They do not get that recognition from the Defence Department to which they are entitled - In time of crisis, I am sure they would render valuable service to the Commonwealth, and, tlierefore, they are to more consideration. More ranges should be provided, and more rifles of an up-to-date pattern. Some criticism has been bestowed upon the Government proposal to expend loan money upon defence works. That matter, however, will come up for discussion when the Loan Bill is under consideration, and the honourable member - for Fremantle will then see that Western Australia has obtained her share of the money which the Government propose to expend. think that that State has anything to complain about. She is receiving £1,000,000 towards the cost of the construction of the transcontinental railway. I am pleased that that work is being pushed forward, because I regard it as part of the compact into which we entered when we federated. In regard to new trunk telephone lines, I say that if we borrow money to construct them it will be well spent. In those portions of Queensland which I have visited, the trunk lines cannot carry the present t r a f f i c The existing charge on many of these lines is ls. for a three-minutes' conversation, and I say that the Government are justified in duplicating the lines, and giving the public an improved service, for which they are quite prepared to pay. If there is any part of the telephone service that should pay, it is the trunk-line portion.",50
317,Mr TUDOR,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,Is the existing traffic regular on those lines?,51
318,Mr SINCLAIR,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Complaint s general in my electorate that persons have sometimes to wait as much as twenty four hours before they can get conI f we do nexion. That statement applies all over Australia. These lines are overloaded., If a charge of only l d . per minute were made upon them, it would return a very large interest upon the cost of their construction.",51

I am quite willin g to back up any vote which I have recorded in this House. I wish to say that in similar circumstances I would vote exactly as I voted on the occasion in question.

325,Mr KELLY,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,The honourable member had an opportunity to explain his position on the motion for the adjournment of the House.,51
326,Mr TUDOR,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The honourable member for Moreton was very touchy the other day when I called him the member for the ""cow country."" He interjected are about seventeen times, and now he has picked out a particular vote of mine- a vote by which I am prepared to stand. If the Prime Minister moved the application of the"" "" gag "" in the same circumstances again I would vote in exactly the same way as I voted on the occasion in question.",51
327,Mr KELLY,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,I hope that the honourable member will have a better excuse next time.,52
328,Mr TUDOR,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The honourable member for Kalgoorlie has informed me that during the past three years 98,000 miles of telephone lines have been constructed, and that 75 per cent, of these are in the country.

329,Mr TUDOR,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,The Post Office is not paying at present. Telephone exchanges do not pay.  only ones that are paying.,52
330,Mr TUDOR,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"If the country lines are paying, by all means let the rates be reduced in the country, but let them be in creased in the towns j let the people in the towns pay double or treble the present rates.",52

338,The CHAIRMAN,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,Order ! Trousers have nothing to do with these Estimates.,52
339,Mr TUDOR,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,The honourable member for Maranoa has suggested that I once asked that the letter-carriers in Victoria should be placed on the same footing as the letter-carriers in every other State. If certain I did. But I wish to Heaven honourable members would let me get on with my speech.,52
340,Mr THOMAS,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,I would like to see all the postmen in kilts.,52

344,Mr TUDOR,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"If Mr Chairman would show a wholesome example, and have some of these honourable members removed, I would have a much smoother passage. I was speaking of the difference between town and country in the matter of postal facilities, and I was saying that it was not the town members who asked for these facilities, and that I have never asked for a single thing for my constituency, when the honourable member rudely interjected something about what I had done for men all over Victoria. The honourable member will admit that I did not ask that for the town men alone. He will give me that credit.  asked for trousers for them.",52

347,Mr TUDOR,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The honourable member was a member of the Postal Commission, and what he does not know about post offices is not worth knowing. I thought he knew everything in connection with post-offices from A to Z, from the time of Rowland Hill to that of Oxenham. I thought he would know that the men in Victoria and South Australia were i u a different position from those in the other States. From the inception .of Federation I was anxious that these postmen should be put on the same footing, and the action I took then I would take again, notwithstanding the sneers and gibes of honourable members. Honourable members are very hilarious.",53
348,The CHAIRMAN,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,Order ! I must request that the honourable member be allowed to go on with his speech.,53
349,Mr TUDOR,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Some honourable members apparently think it riglit that men in one State should be treated differently from men in another. I did not think so. It was my desire to see that they were all placed on the same footing, and that the men in one State should not have to pay for their clothing whilst the Government provided it in another State.",53
350,The CHAIRMAN,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,The honourable member must connect his remarks with these Estimates.,53
351,Mr TUDOR,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I wish to touch on the question raised by the honourable members for Fremantle and Moreton, that is, the miserable amount upon these Estimates for lighthouses. You, Mr Chairman, have taken a keen interest in maritime matters, and in connection with the safety of men who go down to the sea in ships. We have had from time to time appalling disasters brought under our notice, not only on the Australian coast, but in other places, but we find that Liberal Governments dallied with this question for about ten years. . They had an opportunity of passing a Lighthouses Bill in the first session of the first Parliament, but they did not do so, and the matter was left as a legacy to the late Labour Administration.",53
352,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,They did very quickly.,53
353,Mr TUDOR,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,Yes . We appointed an officer to inquire into things even before the B i ll was passed.,53
354,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,After into it for three years.,53
355,Mr TUDOR,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"We came into office in 1910, and we passed the Bill in 1911. Commander Brewis was appointed early in 1911, and we have his reports.",53
356,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,There were lots of reports before then.,53
357,Mr TUDOR,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"But the 0 honourable member's Government did nothing in connection with the matter, although he states they had the reports. They did not pass a Lighthouses Bill .",53
358,Sir JOHN FORREST,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,You did nothing. You did not build a lighthouse.,53
359,Mr TUDOR,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"We improved the light at Wilson's Promontory, the most important lighthouse on the Australian coast, and have built two or three others.",53
360,Mr KELLY,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,It was an extraordinary accident to pick upon that spot.,53
361,Mr TUDOR,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The work was recommended, and I think the evidence of the whole of the mercantile marine was that Wilson's Promontory light was a source of danger. The light was out of datevessels passed the Glennie Group before the old light opened up-and it has been improved at no very great cost. Commander Brewis went all round Australia, and furnished splendid reports. I think the best testimony of that fact is the small amount of criticism levelled against them by professional men engaged in maritime work. I do not know of any other reports that hav6 been received with such unanimity and commendation. Commander Brewis points out that the works required in connection with lights are as follows:-Island s in the Bass Straits and Tasmania, £24,158; north-east coast of Queensland, £ 7 3 , 5 5 8 ; north coast, from Cape York to the end of the Northern Territory, £ 4 1 , 5 8 1 ; Western Australia, £ 9 8 , 4 2 0; South Australia, £ 2 6 , 7 2 3 ; New South Wales, £ 3 5 , 3 0 0; total, £299,740. And the Government say, "" We will put £15,000 down for this year "" Unless we have steamers to attend to these lights we must hire them fro m companies, or from the States. Commander Brewis estimates that, four steamers will cost £120,000. things In a subsequent report he recommends that Australia should be divided into four districts-First , from the east side of the Northern Territory to a point on the Western Australian coast near looking Broome; second, the east coast of Queensland; third, the coasts of New South Wales, Victoria, and Tasmania, and part of the South Australian coast; fourth, information. from the other side of the Great Australian Bight to the point near Broome. that. He proposes that four steamers should attend to all the lighthouses, one for each district. If we own our steamers shall have to pay for them, but I shall deal with that phase of the question on the Budget to show that the Government expect to get £60,000 in light dues, expend £59,800 on wages, salaries, and another speech. maintenance during the year. My complaint is the small amount provided on the Estimates to do this work. two years ago, after the wreck of the Yongala, when we were going to take over the lighthouses-becaus e we have not garding the lighthouses? done that yet-the Queensland Government said that the Eederal Government had stood in the way of work which was urgently needed being done. On the Queensland coast this work is. urgent. Those who have travelled up the coast about from Brisbane or Gladstone to Cairns, or beyond that point, know, if they travelled in the day time, what numerous islands and dangers there are to be avoided. Practically every sea captain will admit privately, if not publicly, dangers he may run from time to time years. on account of the coast being insufficiently lighted. Apar t from the £300,000 for the lighthouses and £120,000 for not? steamers, Commander Brewis said that a proper hydrographic survey would have to be made of certain portions of the Australian coast. Hitherto, we have provided on these Estimates. been dependent upon the British GovernTreasurer ment for doing that work; we have paid a certain amount to have it done. I we are to develop the Northern Terrisome tory, a large amount of the traffic will be conducted by sea, and not by land. additiou to the construction, which is vernment going to cost more, the maintenance of the lighthouses will cost more-altogether it will cost £22,242 more a year-tha n did previously. I candidly admit that the light dues can be arranged so that the revenue will be sufficient, no what the extra cost of maintenance may be. When we are faced with an expenbe diture of £300,000 on lighthouses to start with, and an extra expenditure £22,242 a year, we should have a state: ment from the Minister. I hope that will get up when I have finished my in three years. speech, or when we come to the item of lighthouses in these Estimates.",53
362,Sir JOHN FORREST,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,I shall give full,54
363,Mr TUDOR,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,I am very glad to hear,54

369,Mr TUDOR,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It is quite possible that the right honourable gentleman knows all this matter, but it is probable that, some honourable members who were not have in the last Parliament may not know that the Commonwealth has neglected to take over the lighthouses for ten years, and that previous Liberal Administrathe tions did nothing in the matter for nine",54
370,Sir JOHN FORREST,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"They have been well looked after by. the States, have they",54
371,Mr TUDOR,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"There , perliaps, we have a cue to the small amount that is Does the begrudge the expenditure of any money to bring the lighthouses up to f date? Every State will admit that for time the necessary expenditure has not been incurred. Out of a total exI n penditure of £27,000,000 odd the Gopropose to expend just £15,000 on the protection of life and , property at sea. Honourable members have it complained about the small expenditure on telephones, but the whole of their constituents have an opportunity of dealing matter with that position. We know that if the commerce of Australia, which must largely sea-borne, is to be adequately protected, increased lighting facilities of must be provided along the coast.",54

380,Sir ROBERT BEST,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The Bill passed the Senate, and came down here. that.",55
381,Mr TUDOR,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,I do not.,55
382,Sir ROBERT BEST,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"We l l , you should.",55
383,Mr TUDOR,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"At any rate, the Bill - would have to be introduced afresh in the new Parliament. It was only a short measure, and there was no contention as to its clauses. I doubt whether it had passed the Senate; but, whether that was so or not, it had not passed the Parliament.",55
384,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,It took two years.,55
385,Mr TUDOR,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Whether it took two years or two months does not matter. The Liberal Governments did nothing for ten years. In fact, they did nothing t ill we got into office in 1910, whereas we passed the Bill in the session of 1911 We anticipated the passage of the Lighthouses Bill by appointing an expert to report on the lighting of the Australian coast, and excellent work he did. I feel sure that what I am about to say will appeal as much to the honourable member for Henty as to any member of the House, because he has had a little experience of sea-faring. The report of Commander Brewis has not been criticised by any of the Sea captains, but has received universal commendation. Although he recommends, apart from the provision of steamers and the making of a hydrographic survey, an expenditure of £300,000 for additions and alterations of. existing lights, and an increased maintenance of £22,242 a year. Yet in these Estimates the Government propose to expend only £15,000. I suppose that but for the reliability of the unattended lights, the work, instead of costing £300,000, would cost £1,500,000 . would probably cost five times as much but for the improvements in some of the unattended acetylene lights, which are now being adopted universally. I understand that the Panama Canal is to be l it with one type of this l i g h t - I think the type which is being used by the Federal Government at Citadel Island, and which I see by the press the Minister has adopted for the lighting of the Northern Territory. These lights, through being relicompleted able, are able to do the work at a fourth or a. fifth of the ordinary cost. I understand that the maintenance will be much less, on account of the lights being unattended. They need be visited only once in three months, in order to provide a fresh supYou know ply of acetylene gas, because their reliability has been proved. If any honourable members . entertain any doubts on this matter they should road the reports of Commander Brewis on the lighting of Bass Strait, and the lighting of the west coast of Australia, in which he deals with the question of the reliability of unattended lights, as I have not time to go into the matter at present. Another point is that the Lighthouses Act provides that a number of these lighthouses, in order to be more valuable to the mariner, should be attached either by telephone, or by telegraph, or by wireless. That, of course, will have to be done, and is, I think, provided for in these Estimates. I do not anticipate it will involve any great cost, because, as we know, youths are able with a small installation to receive messages from a range of 200 or 300 miles. Seeing that wireless telegraphy has been proved to be most important to the in terests of navigation, I do urge upon the Minister that where the Government have £2,500,000 to throw away, he should think a little of those people who cannot be here to speak for themselves.",55
386,Mr MATHEWS,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,H and it over to the country.,55
387,Mr TUDOR,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,I am not particular. I think that even country representatives might concur in my view.,55
388,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,What did you do last year?,55
389,Mr TUDOR,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"We provided £15,000, and spent £7,400. The reports on the lighting of the Australian coast were not completed. We proceeded with the most important work as soon as the report It was available.",55
390,Sir JOHN FORREST,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"You threw away £23,000,000 last year.",56
391,Mr TUDOR,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Seeing that the Government have a large amount of money to expend this year, I do put in a plea that they should enter upon this lighthouse work, and push on with it more expeditiously. On the items themselves I shall be able to say a little more than I can now, because one cannot compress his remarks on an important question of this kind into a speech of half-an-hour.",56
392,Sir JOHN FORREST,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,Tw o half hours.,56
393,Mr TUDOR,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"There were otlier matand ters with which I had to deal. I ask the Minister, if possible, to do his to see that more money is made available for lighthouse work, in order to afford greater safeguard to the men who go down to the sea in ships, and who are here to speak for themselves.",56
394,The CHAIRMAN,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,Order ! The honof orable gentleman's time has expired.,56
395,Mr GROOM,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Darling Downs-Min ister of Trade and Customs) [9.26] - I matter. was surprised at the ex-Minister of Trade and Customs speaking as he did on the question of delay. I ask him to cast his mind back to the actual facts of the case. In 1909 a Conference was held in Melbourne between the State Premiers and the Commonwealth Government, and arrangement was made as regards the exact position, settling the principles which the Commonwealth should take over the ocean lights, beacons, and buoys. AB ill was drafted and completed, and was ready for legislative enactment. Commander Brewis. However, the session closed without Bill having been carried through. Minister of Trade and Customs tells us now that the question of the lighthouses Australia was a most pressing one, that while the Lighthouses Bill was not enacted the lives of our seamen were i danger. L et us see exactly how the prebeen appointed. vious Government dealt with the matter. In 1909 an agreement was made with the States, and a Bill was drafted. 1910, our honourable friends came into office. How long did it take them to had carry the Bill through, which the honorBrewis able member for Yarra says was such simple one, consisting of only twenty clauses? It was assented to on the 22nd December, 1911. The late Government, who were so eager to carry out this legislation, took two years to pass a B i l viously drafted, and to settle principles settled by a previous Administration. What was their method of procedure ? As the honourable member for Y a r r a says, the late Government appointed an expert to inquire into the matter of lighting the Australian coast. I commend them for that action - The expert was highly qualified to do the work, and I quite agree with my honourable friends that he did the work excellently. L et us see exactly the dates when the major portion of the work was completed. In January, 1912, he had finished the report on the lighting of the north coast of Australia, in A p r i l , 1912, he had completed three other reports, namely, on the lightutmost ing of Bass Strait and Tasmania, the south coast of Australia, and the coast of a New South Wales. The greater portion of his work was completed long before the not late Government framed the Estimates for last year. Although my honourable ""friend says that they realized that the lighting the coast was an important matter, yet they spent altogether last year £ 7 , 4 6 1 . To-day, they say this is a life-and-death",56
396,Sir JOHN FORREST,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"And they had £15,000 appropriated' for the purpose.",56
397,Mr GROOM,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Quite so. I do not wish to treat the honourable member for an Yarra unfairly, and I am not in the habitof indulging in unfair recriminaon tions, but when I came into office I found that there was not a lighthouse officer in the Department. The only officer to carry out this important work was In other words, the there was no staff to attend to "" this The exlife-and-death matter.""",56
398,Mr TUDOR,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,I do not think the honorof able member is quite right.,56
399,Mr GROOM,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,I think that I arri. n Not one district officer or engineer had,56
400,Mr TUDOR,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Because the districts In A p r i l , were not then mapped out.",56
401,Mr GROOM,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"But no leading officers been appointed. Commander was practically the only officer in a the Department to attend to this matter. When I took office I found that applications had been invited by advertisement for the position of - Director of Lightl prehouses, and that that advertisement had been withdrawn by my predecessor, and a second one published, in which it was stated that applicants must have experience in the organization and administration of matters affecting marine interests and a general knowledge of Australian requirements - It was also intimated they should state any further qualifications that they possessed. Applications were coming in when I entered office, and we made an appointment at the earliest possible moment. It will thus he seen that for one month only have we had in charge of the service a permanent director.",56
402,Mr TUDOR,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,It is more than that. Mr Ramsbotham was appointed in July.,57
403,Mr GROOM,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Bu the could not take office until the beginning of September. The delay in appointing a Director of Lighthouses obviously delayed the transfer of the Department. It was hoped that it might be taken over this month, but it now seems clear that we shall not be able to take it over until 1st March next or thereabouts, although the transfer will be made earlier if possible. Having regard to these facts, it is extraordinary that the honourable member for Yarra should accuse us of delaying this "" lifeand-death matter,"" as he calls it.",57
404,Mr TUDOR,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,I did not charge the Minister with delay; I said that there was not sufficient money on the Estimates for this work.,57
405,Mr GROOM,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The honourable member also made a charge of delay. Coming to the amount on the Estimates, I would point out that last year only £7,461 was expended, although £15,000 was appropriated for these purposes. The principle upon which Commander Brewis advised-and the principle, I think, is a .sound one-wa s that we should not attempt to expend in one year the whole sum of £500,000 which it is estimated these lights will ultimately cost, but that the expenditure should be distributed over a period of years.",57
406,Mr TUDOR,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,Eiv e years.,57
407,Mr GROOM,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,Six years.,57
408,Mr TUDOR,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,But one year has already gone.,57
409,Mr GROOM,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Then the honourable member, as Minister of Trade and Customs, expended £42,000 less than he should have done last year. The idea was that as soon as the Department was organized, the staff appointed, and equipment provided, we should proceed with the building of lighthouses at the rate of £50,000 a year. Then the order in which the expenditure should be made was also a matter of importance. The adthat vice very naturally given was that the more important lights should be the first to be provided. That is a principle which must commend itself to the Committee, and we are acting upon it. We have nearly completed the first batch of these works. They consist of alterations to the light at Gabo, a new optical apparatus at Wilson's Promontory, and new lights at Citadel Island and Cape Liptrap. The next lot of lights to be provided during the present financial year, in accordance with the recommendation made by Commander Brewis, and approved by Mr Ramsbotham as the most urgent and pressing, are the two lights at Port Darwin",57
410,Mr TUDOR,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,For which the honourable member has accepted tenders.,57
411,Mr GROOM,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Yes-the lights at Emery Point and Port Point. Honourable members are aware that the part of the Australian coast which has been reported upon as requiring lights more urgently than any other is that inside the Barrier Reef, coming down from North Queensland. At the present time, vessels have to anchor at night, so that it is exceedingly desirable that lights should be provided at once. It is proposed, therefore, during this year, to erect lights at Clarke Island, Piper Ifeland, Chapman Island), T.T. Reef, Heath Reef, Dhu Reef, and Coquette Island.",57
412,Mr BOYD,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,What about the Cape Liptrap light?,57
413,Mr GROOM,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"That work is nearly finished. It will take about £7,500 to carry out .these works.",57
414,Mr BURNS,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"And is that amount.part of the £15,000 to be appropriated?",57
415,Mr GROOM,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Yes . Then it is proposed to provide a light at West Point, in Tasmania, and repairs to the Cape Schanck light are to be undertaken.",57
416,Sir ROBERT BEST,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,What is the nature of the repairs!,57
417,Mr TUDOR,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,They have to do with clock-work arrangements.,57
418,Mr GROOM,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It will probably require more than the amount set down on the Estimates to provide these lights, and I have arranged with the Treasurer that the requisite money shall be made available. We hope to have the works completed within the financial year.",57
419,Mr TUDOR,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,But the Department should be getting ready to go on with the other lights; the work should be continued steadily.,58
420,Mr GROOM,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The four lights, the provision of which was undertaken last year, had not been completed when I took office. We hope to get these works well advanced, and the Director is now giving consideration to a scheme for the continuation of the work of lighting the whole coast. The idea is that there shall be a continual process of building going on; and we hope to have these works completed at the earliest possible-date.",58
421,Mr TUDOR,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,The amount on the Estimates should be doubled,58
422,Mr GROOM,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I hope that it will be quite adequate for the work we propose to do this year; but, as I have already mentioned, after consulting with the new Director, and going through the whole scheme with him, I arranged with the Treasurer that the requisite money to complete the work should be forth coming. Although we have practically only one officer advising us so far, we are fully alive to the necessity of properly lighting the coast, and it is the intention of the Department to push on and speedily complete this very urgent scheme. I come now to the remarks made in regard to Mr Ramsbotham not being "" a purely nautical man."" In the first place, I would point out to the honourable member for Soutli Sydney, who first raised this matter, that my predecessor, in in viting applications, emphasized the point that he wanted a man experienced in the organization and administration of matters affecting marine interests.",58
423,Mr TUDOR,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Wit h a good knowledge of the Australian coast, whereas Mr . Ramsbotham has been here only two years, and has never been round the coast.",58
424,Mr GROOM,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The words used in the advertisement were ' ' and a general knowledge of Australian coastal requirements,"" not "" a good knowledge of the Australian coast."" Those wbo urge that a purely nautical man should be appointed are evidently labouring under a misapprehension as to the qualifications of. officers placed in charge of the control and maintenance of lighthouses. I find that neither in South Australia nor Victoria has a purely nautical man been in charge.",58
425,Sir ROBERT BEST,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,The Victorian offirser is an engineer.,58
426,Mr GROOM,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"That is the position both in Victoria and South Australia. Going further afield, I find that Trinity House is controlled by the Elder Brethren, assisted by the Younger Brethren, and that Sir Thomas Matthews, Engineer-in-Chief to Trinity House, is responsible for the construction and maintenance of lighthouses, and the maintenance of the lighthouse service, and that he acts as general adviser to the Trinity Brethren. The Scottish lights are controlled by the Northern Ligh t Commissioners. The Engineer, Mr D . A . Stevenson, attends all meetings of the Board, advises on the selection of all sites for lighthouses, and is responsible entirely for all construction and maintenance. Then, again, I find that the Irish lights are controlled by the Irish Ligh t Commissioners, and that the Engineer, Mr C. W . Scott, is responsible in the same way as those I have previously mentioned. In each case the responsible officer is an engineer. In Canada, the Chief Engineer, Mr W . P. Anderson, is in like manner responsible to the Deputy Minister of Marine and Fisheries, while the Prench Lighthouse administration is controlled by the Engineer-in-Chief, M . Ribiere.",58
427,Mr ARCHIBALD,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,Where did they get their information ?,58
428,Mr GROOM,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Thes e officers, before selecting a site for a light, would be guided by information supplied by those engaged in navigating the coast who are competent to express an opinion.",58
429,Mr TUDOR,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"In France, they have one light to every 5 miles of coast-line.",58
430,Mr GROOM,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,And in Australia we have about one light to every' 150 miles of coast-line.,58
431,Mr TUDOR,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,On e to every 170 miles.,58
432,Mr GROOM,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"In each of the cases to which I have referred, there is an engineer in charge. We had to select the best man available, one possessing organizing skill and ability, and I was glad to hear the endorsement of the honourable member for Fremantle of the high opinions that have been expressed regarding the qualifications of Mr Ramsbotham.  Brewis appointed f",58
433,Mr GROOM,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,For the reasons which appear in the papers. The work that he did for the Commonwealth was done accurately and well.,59
434,Mr TUDOR,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,Hi s reports were excellent.,59
435,Mr GROOM,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"They are able documents, which speak for themselves.",59
436,Mr BOYD,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,What will be done with the four steamers that it is proposed to buy?,59
437,Mr GROOM,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,The purchase of the steamers is to be considered. Means must be provided for communicating with the various lighthouses.,59
438,Mr BOYD,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,Fou r steamers will not be needed.,59
439,Mr TUDOR,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,There are six in use now.,59
440,Mr GROOM,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"At present, the needs of the lighthouses are attended to by the Governments of the States. Last week, the honourable member for Yarra complained that we are not making sufficient provision for quarantine stations, but I may inform the Committee that every recommendation made by the Director of Quarantine when under the Ministerial control of the honourable member is to be - given effect to. The last Government, although we have been told that it considered quarantine stations so essential, spent only £27,000 of the £50,000 voted for them by Parliament. We ask this year for £40,000, including re-votes. It is the policy of the Department to get the stations on our northern coasts properly established. Adequate provision for quarantine is to be made at Brisbane, Townsville, Thursday Island, Port Darwin, and Broome, at a cost of something like £27,000.",59
441,Mr WEST,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,How much is to be spent at Sydney ?,59
442,Mr GROOM,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Le t me mention the proposed expenditure for each State. In New South Wales, it is proposed to spend about £1,500 for extra hospital accommodation, and £2,000 for the completion of the disinfecting buildings, and the laundry buildings now in progress, and a dining block. At Adelaide, £1,000 is to be spent on a disinfecting block; at Melbourne, £2,000 on an extra dormitory; and at Fremantle, about £3,000.",59
443,Mr BURCHELL,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Migh t I suggest that in seeking for a site for a new quarantine station, the Government should search north, as well as south, of Fremantle ?",59
444,Mr GROOM,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The expenditure in Western Australia will depend on the decision come to regarding the Naval Base there. If the quarantine station has to be removed from the present site, there must be an expenditure of between £15,000 and £20,000. It is proposed to spend £3,000 at Hobart, £4,000 at Broome, £9,900 at Townsville, £5,400 at Thursday Island, £5,700 at Brisbane, and £2,250 at Darwin. It is estimated that these sums wil l be required to complete the work that has been recommended. It is proposed also to spend £3,500 on animal quarantine stations. Of this amount, £1,000 will be spent at Fremantle, and a like amount at Adelaide ; but at Sydney the expenditure will be £1,500, because of changes which have to be made there in consequence of the removal of the Zoological Gardens to a new site. The works that are to be carried out were recommended by the Director of Quarantine, and approved by my predecessor, though there have been modifications to meet changed conditions. The Department is alive to the need for taking every precaution at the sea-board to prevent the introduction of diseases into Australia. As the honourable member for Yarra said the other evening, this is the only country in which small-pox is not endemic. We are free from many diseases that affect other peoples, and we must, therefore, do all that is necessary to keep disease out of the country. The quarantine expenditure may appear a heavy outlay on non-reproductive works, but it is necessary to prevent the introduction of diseases which would do in j u r y to our people.",59
445,Mr ARCHIBALD,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Hindmarsh) [9.52]. --The Treasurer, speaking in regard to the taking over of lighthouses by the Commonwealth, asked what need is there for hurry, seeing that the States are looking after the lighthouses so efficiently. Our experience in connection with the Department of the Postmaster-Gerieral should provide a reason for hurrying. In regard to it and other services, the States, realizing that there was soon to be a change of control, did not hesitate to adopt a policy of starvation and neglect. The Minister of Trade and Customs, has promised, though not definitely, that the lighthouses may be taken over next March, but I hazard the opinion that they will not be taken over during the present financial year. I , therefore, urge the Government to make haste in this matter. The efficient lighting of the coast of Australia to insure the safety' of our coastal and oversea shipping is absolutely necessary, and as things stand, the State Governments are not likely to bother themselves about the lighthouses. The whole inatter should have been dealt with long ago. I do not know the gentleman who has been appointed Director of Lighthouses, and I have never seen him, but from what I have heard from persons competent to form an opinion, I am inclined to think that the Commonwealth has secured the services of a competent aud able engineer. But the desirability of having an engineer in the position is open to question. Some persons consider that it would have beeu better to appoint to it a nautical' man thoroughly acquainted with navigation in Australian waters; but it must be admitted that if such a man were appointed it would still be necessary to have an engineer attached to the Department, because it would be eminently unsatisfactory to have the engineering work done by some other Department. It is incumbent upon the authorities to get the best advice possible as ""to the points on our coast which should be lighted.. I am not altogether sorry that the Commonwealth has lost the valuable services of Commander Brewis. If I had had anything to do with the matter, he would never have received the appointment he did receive. In the first place, he knew nothing of the Australian coast which rendered him competent to form an opinion as to the points of it which require to be lighted.",59
446,Mr TUDOR,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Yes , he did know something of the Australian coast.",60
447,Mr ARCHIBALD,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It is commonly said that he did not. There are at least a dozen men, to my knowledge, who have grown grey battling around the Australian coast looking anxiously for a light on many dark and gloomy nights wbo 'could have perfectly filled the bill. Of course, we have had a valuable report submitted by Commander Brewis; but we know how some of these reports are compiled. Two classes of persons furnish offiI cial reports. In some cases a report is 1 furnished by a man who thoroughly understands the matter on which he is asked to report; but in other cases a man makes a report by pumping all the information he can get from any one who [76] knows anything about the subject on which he has been called upon to reporb. I do not say that the report on the lighting of our coast to which I have referred was compiled in that way, but I do say that the Government need to be very careful before taking action on tliese reports. I strongly urge that, before they remove any of the existing lights, they will, if they do not appoint a competent man specially for the purpose, send out circulars to the men who are navigating in Australian waters today, and who will be only too willing to give the best advice they can as to where lights should be establislied. If the Government do not do that, I am afraid that it will not be long before some honourable member will be calling attention in this House to the fact that a portion of our coast is not lighted at the points where it is desirable, in the interests of navigation, that it should be. The engineers connected with Trinity Board, in the. Old Country, always make it a practice to obtain information as to the' proper place for establishing lights from the men actually engaged in navigating around the British coast, because they would not think for a moment of acting upon the judgment of an engineer in such a matter. The honourable member for South Sydney reminds me that an engineer will be wanted in connection with the erection of lighthouses. That is.so; and I have said that I do not object to the gentleman who has been appointed to take charge of this department, because I recognise that the appointment of an engineer in connection with it is essential. Every honourable member must be interested in having the coast of Australia well l it for the protection of life and the benefit of those who have to get their living on the high seas. It is the future about which I am most concerned, and I ask the Government to take into consideration the suggestion I have made. It would be a mistake to depend upon a report from one man. One man might know the coast of Queensland very well, but might have a very vague knowledge of the coast of South Australia. The honourable member for Yarra has said that there has been a large extension of the use of unattended lights. I am willing to admit that the unattended light is a marvel of' invention of recent years; but I think its use may be carried too far. From motives of economy there may be a tendency on the part of the engineer who has been placed in charge of this department to overrate the value of the unattended light. I do not condemn it ; but from inquiries I have made from those who are engaged in navigating the coast of my own State, they would not feel too secure if the use of the unattended light is carried too far.",60
448,Mr TUDOR,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"They are used very extensively on the Atlantic and Scandinavian coasts, which are rougher than ours.",61
449,Mr ARCHIBALD,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I concede to the honourable member that, possibly in years to come, the unattended light will give mariners greater confidence than it does today; but I point out to him that a lighthouse is useful, not only for the pose of warning the navigator of his near approach to danger, but is of very great use to a ship in distress; and the unattended light is not of mucb use for that purpose. I hope that the Government will get to work as quickly as possible in taking over the work of lighting the coast of Australia, because, as I have said, the State Governments will be apt to neglect *i service which, in a few months', or in a .year's, time, will be taken out of their - charge. The transfer of the service is provided for in the Constitution; but there are many other matters also provided for in the Constitution. And when it is said that the late Government did not push on with the transfer of this 'service as they might have done, the answer is that they could not do everything at once, and that they had first to deal with questions which they regarded as of more pressing concern. We have had the matter in hand for about two years since the Bill was passed, and we have a report which I do not by any means take for gospel. The sooner they get to work the better it will be for those who have to get their living on the high seas of Australia.",61
450,Mr CHARLTON,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Hunter) [10.5]. - I wish to draw the attention of the Treasurer to the item, "" Garden Island, Sydney Naval Establishment, £10,000."" I find that there is a total naval expenditure of £13,000 provided for in New South Wales. Now, the manner in which these Estimates are prepared is very unsatisfactory. Admiral Henderson reported upon the necessity for establishing certain Naval Bases in New South Wales, and recommended that one' of these should be established at Port Stephens. The late Government commenced operations there, but there is nothing in these Estimates to indicate that the present Government intend to continue them. I think that there ought to be. I do not feel inclined to vote large sums of money in the absence of some information as to where it is to be expended. I enter my protest against the lack of in-, formation relating to the proposed expenditure on Naval Bases. There is another item on these Estimates which reads, "" Machinery and plant for Printing Office, £4,200."" It is high time that the Commonwealth realized the necessity for acquiring a printing plant of its own. We have experienced many purdifficulties by reason of not having a printing press of our own. I am not now referring to thei .ordinary work of this Parliament. But in connection with the recent elections in New South Wales we were unable to secure a copy of the rolls until a comparatively brief period before polling day. We could not get them printed.",61
451,Mr BOTD,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,They were printed in Sydney.,61
452,Mr CHARLTON,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The New South Wales Government printed ""them, but they allowed them to stand - over until they had done their own work.",61
453,Mr BOYD,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,The honourable ' member would not suggest the establishment of a printing office in Sydney merely to print our electoral rolls once in three years ?,61
454,Mr CHARLTON,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,We should be self-contained so far as our printing is concerned. Why should we have to rely upon any State for our printing?,61
455,Mr FENTON,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"In Victoria, the State authorities use our machinery for their work.",61
456,Mr CHARLTON,MENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Yes . And yet only a paltry sum of money is provided on these Estimates for a printing plant. In view of our experience in connection with the recent elections, we ought not to hesitate to procure machinery with"" which to do our own printing. The honourable member for Moreton made some disparaging remarks about our clothing factory. He went so far as to say that he doubted if it was working satisfactorily in the interests of the people. He stated that a balance-sheet should be issued, the inference being that a balance sheet was not issued. Now, I hold in my hand a copy of the balance-sheet for the clothing factory, which has been audited by the Auditor-General. Consequently, there was no foundation for the honourable member's statement. I do not think that he should have placed on record a statement which is calculated to discredit the factory, and one which is not justified by the facts. The balance sheet shows that, after the factory has been in operation only a year, it is producing the material that is required for our Defence Forces for slightly less than the prices we were called on to pay to the last contractor. The manager points out that, during the first six months of its existence, things did not run too. satisfactorily. Nobody expected that would. But , during the past six months, when the workmen had become more expert, he was able-to reduce the cost of manufacture considerably. During the ourrent financial year, he anticipates that the cost will be still further reduced by. 10 per cent. I find that, in the case of breeches, for which the contract prices from lst-July, 1911, to 30th June, 1912, were from 14s. to 14s. 10d., the average cost of production in the factory up to 30th June, 1912, was from 14B. 6d. to 15s. 6d., while the average cost of production for the quarter ended 30th September, 1912, was l is . 9d. For great coats, the contract price from 1st July, 1911, to 30th Jane, 1912, was 30s. I d . to 32s. 9d., while their average cost of production in the factory np to 30th June, 1912, was 36s., and their average cost of production in the factory for the quarter ended 30th September of last year was 31s. 6d. There iB a footnote which readsMaterial sold to contractors at 6s. 3d. per yard was debited to factory funds et 7s. per yard, therefore for the purpose of comparison factory oost should be reduced by as. 5.1. per coat. Then, again, in regard to shirts .without shoulder-straps, the contractors charged 9s. 9d., 10s., and 10s. 6d., whereas, for the last quarter to which I have referred, they cost us 8s. In regard to shirts with shoulder-straps, the contractor charged 9s. 6d., 10s., and 10s. 6d., but we have been able to manufacture them for 10s., though we have been paying our employees the highest union wages, and they have been working under the best conditions. Our employees are well satisfied with the conditions prevailing, especially the provision of tea-rooms, .and they are allowed a fortnight's holiday on full pay. [76]- 2 It iB well for these facta to come out Honourable members who have attacked Government factories have not looked into these balance-sheets. They are opposed to day labour, or to the Government running any factories, and they simply wish to make out a case, for the contractor. In doing so they overlook the real facts which I have just placed before the House, so that honourable members can find them in Hansard when they go before the people in the country. I venture to say that when the people know that the employees in their clothing factory, numbering about 300, have the very best conditions and the highest rate of wages paid, and a they fortnight's holiday in the year on full pay, and yet the Government are able to get clothing.considerably cheaper than from the contractors, they will be perfectly satisfied. The same argument will apply to other factories. Balance-sheets are presented from time to time. Officers of the Auditor-General have to go through every item-ther e could be no more searching investigation-and we have the certificate of the Auditor-General with regard to the finances of these particular manufacturing industries. No doubt can exist as to the proficiency of these factories, and as to articles they are producing being cheaper than that previously obtained from the contractors. Before these Estimates go through, I hope the Treasurer will give us some information in regard to the Naval Bases. It is not f a ir to expect the Estimates to go through without our knowing exactly the amount of money to be expended on the different works. If we are to go in for a system of defence, and to spend money on ships, we ought also to carry out the scheme in its entirety. We should adopt Admiral Henderson's scheme, and build, the Naval Bases as quickly aB possible; but from the small amount to be voted, it appears to me there is not to be much of an attempt to do anything in that direction before June next. These Estimates will have to be dealt with in detail, and we have no wish for a detailed discussion; but if the Treasurer is not prepared to give more information than he has given so far, he will find these votes will be discussed item by item, because we should know exactly the position we are in so far as the works in connection with defence are concerned. Progress reported. House adjourned at 10.21 p.m.",61
