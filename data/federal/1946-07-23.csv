2,Dr GAHA,Unknown,"Can the Minister for the ' Army state how many medical officers, nurses and other medical personnel are still in the Australian, military forces, and how many were in those categories at. the commencement of demobilization ?'",12
3,Mr FORDE,Unknown,"As the honourable member well knows, this matter has given the Government a good deal of trouble, because of the competing demands of the civilian community and the services.. Committees were constituted for the purpose of'investigating every aspect of it. The honourable gentleman served, withdistinction - on one of those committees some time ago. The demobilization of the forces was commenced on the 1st October, 1945. The number of doctors in the Army was reduced from 1,400 on that date to 360 at the 30'.h June, 1946. In the same period, the number of nurseswas reduced from 2,400 to 1,000, and the-' number of other medical personnel, such as medical orderlies and members of the Australian - Medical Women's Auxiliary Service, .from 4,600 to2,450. I assure the honourable gentleman that the matter is being constantly reviewed, with the object of effecting further discharges whenever it is practicable to do so. I point out, however, that hospital establishments have to be maintained in order to deal with recurring cases of sickness due to war service.",12
4,Mr HAEEISON,Unknown,"I ask the Minister for the Army whether servicemen sufferthe ing from war neurosis have thrown or attempted to throw themselves from balconies at 113ih Australian General Hospital, Yaralla? When was the first attempt made ? How many attempts succeeded ? What precautionary measures have been taken to ensure that these unfortunate sufferers shall be unable do themselves physical harm?",13
5,Mr FORDE,Unknown,"The honourable member raised this matter in conversation with me, because he was concerned at jurisdiction the attempts by' servicemen who are very ill or are suffering from war neurosis to commit suicide or to do selves harm. Inquiries have elicited information that for some months there has not been an attempt by a serviceman, to jump from a balcony at 113th Auslevelled tralian General Hospital. These nerve cases, which require restraint, are already housed in an enclosed ward in the pavilion. Special provision has been made to accommodate safely such cases in wards on the ground floor. I have ceived this advice from the comDepartment, manding officer of the hospital. I assured that the man who jumped over balcony some months ago was not a nerve case. He had been operated upon for appendicitis, and there were other complications which I need not discuss now. I can assure the honourable member that all precautions are now being taken to make it impossible for delirious persons and nerve cases to jump over balconies.",13
6,Mr HADLEY,Unknown,"On the date on which hostilities ceased how many Army perand sonnel were in Army detention camps and in civil gaols, and what staff was engaged on detention and guard duties in Australia? How many Army personnel are at present in Army detention camps and incivil gaols in Australia, and what staff is now engaged on detention ""and guard duties? How many detention camps have been declared redundant and closed since the cessation of hostilities?",13
7,Mr FORDE,Unknown,"The preparation of detailed replies to the honourable member's question will involve a good deal of research. I shall, however, obtain the necessary information and supply it to the honourable member as soon as possible. In general terms I inform him that at 1st September, 1945, there were 2,494 Army personnel in Army detention camps, in Australia. As at the 6th July, 1946, that number had been reduced to 755 and 14 detention camps had been have declared redundant. The number of personnel comprising the staff administo tering detention camps has been reduced during the same period from 1,235 to 496. Mr MCEWEN"" - I ask the Minister for the Army whether it is a fact that the of a State court in the matter of an indictment against Major Cousens has been challenged on the ground that themthe same charges are pending against the Major Cousens in a court martial? If that be so, how does it happen that the Commonwealth has, at the same time, v two charges on the same issue against the same man in a civil jurisdiction and also in a military jurisdiction?",13
8,Mr FORDE,Unknown,Some months ago the Army authorities referred this case to rethe Commonwealth Attorney-General's and the Solicitor-General am sought the opinion of three eminent a King's Counsel in Sydney regarding the best procedure to adopt to bring Major Cousens to trial. The matter rests no longer with the Department of the Army.,13
9,Mr MCEWEN,Unknown,Are there any court martial proceedings?,13
10,Mr FORDE,Unknown,"I heard over the radio that Major Cousens had appeared before the court in Sydney today. As the case is now sub judice, I shall not make any comments which might prejudice a fair impartial hearing, which is all that the Government desires to obtain - ",13
11,Mr HADLEY,Unknown,"As newspapers have reported that approximately 1,000 members of the Australian Military Forces are scattered through the islands to the north of Australia and have been forgotten, is the Minister for the Army in a position to state the number and disposition of our troops in that area?",13
12,Mr FORDE,Unknown,"There are 2,570 Australian troops in the islands to the north of Australia, exclusive of 9,968 in Japan. I assure the honourable member that those men have not been forgotten. Details of the disposition of personnel are-1 7 at Weewak; 1,500 in New Britain, principally at Rabaul; 600 at Moraiai; 29 in other parts of New Guinea; 36 at Macassar; and 388 elsewhere, including the Victory Contingent, which will return to Australia next month. All these men will be brought back to Australia as soon as possible. In many instances, the Government is waiting to secure suitable ships to load valuable equipment that - is being maintained by the men. I assure the honourable gentleman that his representations on behalf of their speedy return will not be overlooked. BROADCASTING. NA BROADCASTING COMMISSION.",14
13,Mr FRASER,CORRECTIONS BY AUSTRALIAN,"In view of the statement by the chairman ""of the Australian Broadcasting Commission that it will publish corrections of all errors made by itself, I direct the attention of the Minister representing the Postmaster General jfco the script of a news commentary broadcast over station 2FC, Sydney, on Saturday, the 13th April, which the commission has already been asked to correct? Will the Minister examine this commentary, with a view to deciding whether it .contains, not only serious errors of fact misleading people as to their rights under the pensions system, but also a gross and unwarranted reflection on the pensioners of Australia ? Will the Minister take the matter up again with the commission, in view of the chairman's assurance that it will correct its own errors ?",14
14,Mr CALWELL,CORRECTIONS BY AUSTRALIAN,"I shall examine the ' script of the talk about which the honourable member complains, and shall also discuss with the Postmaster-General the desirability of interrogating the Commission as to why talks of that sort are permitted over the air. Further, I shall request the Postmaster-General .to ask the commission to make the correction which the chairman says it is always anxious to make when its mistakes are pointed out to it. Judging by some of the talks broadcast during the last twelve months, the commission will have a full-time job in correcting misrepresentations. The protest of the honourable member for Eden Monaro is similar to that made in this chamber some time ago by the honourable member for Fawkner about precisely the same sort of thing. CIVILAVIATIO N. WESTERN JUNCTION AERODROME NATIONAL SERVICE TO DENILIQUINSYDNEY-HOBART SERVICE.",14
15,Mr GUY,CORRECTIONS BY AUSTRALIAN,"In view of the fact that the Western Junction Aerodrome is at present unusable and has frequently been closed for varying periods, causing great disorganization of air traffic, will the Minister for Air cause the promised investigation regarding the proposed new aerodrome site at Prospect, northern Tasmania, to be expedited?",14
16,Mr DRAKEFORD,CORRECTIONS BY AUSTRALIAN,"Severa l interruptions have occurred to the services which use Western Junction, because of the unserviceable condition of the aerodrome, but it has been in use since the honourable member first drew attention to this matter some time ago. Because of unfavorable weather, difficulty is being experienced at present in operating air services. I have already taken up with the Civil Aviation"" Department the matter of an examination of the proposed new aerodrome site at Prospect, but it is difficult to secure competent surveyors and engineers to make' the necessary technical inspections. I have asked the department to make available a man experienced in dealing with aerodrome sites to examine the Prospect site as soon"" as possible. When that has been done, I shall be able to supply the honourable member for Wilmot and other honourable member with information as to the suitability of the site.",14
17,Mr BARNARD,CORRECTIONS BY AUSTRALIAN,"Has the Minister for Air yet been able to arrange for an inspection of the suggested site at Prospect for a permanent aerodrome for Launceston? Is he yet. able to say whether any appropriation has been made for providing runways at ""Western Junction? If money is allocated, will be undertake to see that the Prospect proposal is examined early, and if it is found suitable, will.he have the money which ,it is proposed to spend on Western Junction spent at Prospect? In any case, can he give an assurance that facilities for' landing the latest types of aircraft on an aerodrome to service Launceston will be provided in the near future ?",14
18,Mr DRAKEFORD,CORRECTIONS BY AUSTRALIAN,"As I stated in reply to the previous question, I have asked that a qualified officer be sent to examine the proposed site at Prospect. - Provision has been made in the Estimates for 1946-47 for the building of suitable runways at Western Junction. The honourable member may rest assured that an aerodrome will be provided near Launceston suitable for aircraft of the latest types, and the runways will be usable in all weathers.",15
19,Mr LANGTEY,CORRECTIONS BY AUSTRALIAN,"Will the Minister for Air consider the claims of Deniliquin as a regular stopping place for the setting down and picking up of passengers on the"" routes from Sydney to Adelaide and Melbourne to Sydney when the National Airlines begin operation, seeing that Deniliquin is an important centre, which serves a wide area in the Eiverina?",15
20,Mr DRAKEFORD,CORRECTIONS BY AUSTRALIAN,"I appreciate the importance of Deniliquin and other centres in that area, and I undertake that - the honourable member's suggestion will be examined with a view to seeing whether it is possible to 'provide a suitable service to meet the needs of"" his constituents.",15
21,Dr GAHA,CORRECTIONS BY AUSTRALIAN,"I noticed in the newspapers recently that certain private airlines had under consideration a service between Sydney and Hobart. In reply to a question which I asked some .time ago, the Minister for Air informed me that the National Airlines Commission would not operate that route at present because certain safety equipment, such as the radio-heam, had not been installed. I ask the Minister whether private airlines - have advantages, such as safety devices, which the National Airlines will not have? Will the honourable gentleman .indicate when the commission is likelv to operate a service between Sydney and Hobart?",15
22,Mr DRAKEFORD,CORRECTIONS BY AUSTRALIAN,"The private airlines will not be granted any privileges of which the government-owned airlines will not be able to avail themselves, and the National Airlines will not be granted any privileges which the private airlines may not utilize. If the honourable member referred to the projected service between Sydney and Hobart, I inform him that all safety appliances must be functioning before either government or private airlines will be allowed to operate that route. GEASSHOPPE'ES.",15
23,Mr TURNBULL,CORRECTIONS BY AUSTRALIAN,"Has the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture been advised of the possibility of a grasshopper plague developing in north-western Victoria, and spreading to adjacent areas in New South Wales and South Australia? Is he aware that State governments are already making inquiries with a view to meeting the danger? Has his department done anything to co-operate with the State governments in protective measures, and, if not, will he investigate the matter?",15
24,Mr SCULLY,CORRECTIONS BY AUSTRALIAN,I shall have inquiries made as the honourable member suggests. COST OF LIVING .,15
25,Mr FRANCIS,CORRECTIONS BY AUSTRALIAN,"Has the Prime Minister seen a statement by the Direcr tor of the Government Bureau of Industry in Queensland, Mr Colin Clark, that the weak spot in the Commonwealth cost of living index figures was that an insufficient number of rents for new houses was included, seeing that houses coming on to the market for the first time are, as a rule, let at much higher . rents than those asked for older houses? Has anything been done to bring up to date the figures for rent, food, clothing, &c, which are used in computing the federal basic wage? Will the Prime Minister arrancre for a review of the method of arriving at the Commonwealth index figures used in computing the basic wage ?",15
26,Mr CHIFLEY,CORRECTIONS BY AUSTRALIAN,"I have not seen the statement reported to have been made by Mr Colin Clark. The question of an inauiry into the basic wage has been under consideration for some time. At ""present the Arbitration Court is engaged on the 40-hour week case. At one stage the Government suggested to parties concerned in that case that they might ?make an application covering both .the basic wage and a 40-hour week so that the court might deal with these matters in the one inquiry. A review, of the items in the "" C "" index has been discussed from time to time, and at"" present, the setting up of an authority to conduct an inquiry into this matter is under consideration. BANKING. EXCHANGE ON CHEQUES-INTERES T RATE ON OVERDRAFTS.",15
27,Mr RUSSELL,CORRECTIONS BY AUSTRALIAN,"Will .the Prime Minister request that a conference take place between the Commonwealth Bank and the Associated Banks in South Australia with a view .to having the rate of exchange on cheques between Eyre Peninsula and the mainland of South Australia brought into line with the rate applicable on the mainland? The rate on the mainland is Is. per £100, and between the mainland and Eyre Peninsula, i per cent., or 2s. 6d. per £100. Quick means of transport enables clearances to be made rapidly. According to the chairman of the Associated Banks, in South Australia,' 0. L. Isaachsen, the cost to the . banks of the alteration would be approximately £300 a year. Will the Prime Minister also ask the Commonwealth Bank and the Associated Banks to confer with a view to having all orders payable to Government departments, Commonwealth and State, in respect of income tax, land tax, motor registrations, &c, made free, of exchange?",16
28,Mr CHIFLEY,CORRECTIONS BY AUSTRALIAN,"I shall ask the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank to eonsult with the Associated Banks in regard' to the exchange rate on cheques. Honourable members will recall that in the report of the banking commission some reference was made to the general subject of the exchange rate on cheques. I am not quite sure that all the items mentioned in the second portion of the honourable member's question are matters for discussion between the Commonwealth Bank and the Associated Banks,' but I shall have the matter' examined, and ask the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank to carry out the consultation suggested by the honourable 'member should such a course appear to be desirable.",16
29,Mr FULLER,CORRECTIONS BY AUSTRALIAN,"Will the Treasurer give consideration to compelling the trading banks to reduce the overdraft interest rate from 4f per cent, to a rate not higher than 2 per cent, above the fixed deposit rate? Mr Chifley,-The interest rate on overdraft has been the subject of discussions between the Commonwealth - Bank, the trading banks and myself since I have been Treasurer, and from time to time reductions have - been made in the light of the fixed deposit rate at the particular time. The maximum rate that may be charged on overdraft at present is 4f per cent. It must be remembered that when the fixed deposit rate is reduced a considerable time elapses before a bank is able to derive any financial benefit therefrom, because contractual obligations in respect of fixed deposits are not broken. Therefore, when the interest rate on fixed deposits is' reduced, the new rate applies only to new deposits and very little benefit accrues to any bank until the deposits at the pre-existing rates come up for review. For at least twelve months, the benefit thus derived would not warrant a reduction of the interest rate on overdrafts. I assure the honourable member that this subject is watched constantly. PEACE CONFERENCE.",16
30,Mr MENZIES,CORRECTIONS BY AUSTRALIAN,"Is the Prime Minister in a position to say what matters will be dealt with at the forthcoming Peace Conference? I put my inquiry in that way because although certain matters may not arise, others will, and it would be useful if the House had before it some information in regard to the matters to be discussed. Secondly, I ask the Prime Minister what particular principles will be contended for by the Australian representatives at the conference. If the Prime Minister believes that there is a limit to public discussion of such questions. with the conference pending, will he give consideration to the possibility of having a debate on the matter at a private meeting of this House? I do not suggest a private meeting for preference, but I realise that some problems may not lend themselves to public discussion. In brief, to what degree will the House be given an opportunity to consider the principles to be advanced on behalf of Australia in relation to,matters that will arise at the conference ?",16
31,Mr CHIFLEY,CORRECTIONS BY AUSTRALIAN,"As is generally known, some matters associated-with the peace will not be discussed at the forthcoming Peace Conference. It is doubtful, for instance, whether questions relating to the final peace with Germany and with Japan will be discussed. I confess to some difficulty regarding the second part of the right honourable gentleman's question, in which he asked me to indicate the broad views of the Commonwealth Government on the matters that will come before the conference, because nearly all the subjects that will be dealt with were discussed at a conference of Prime Ministers in London recently. The broad outlines of Empire policy are known to the' Minister for External Affairs, who will represent Australia at the conference, and also to the Eesident Minister in London, Mr Beasley. Of course, they are known also to Mr Bevin, who will represent, the United Kingdom Government at the conference, and to other Empire representatives. The matters to be brought forward at . the Peace Conference were discussed by Empire Prime Ministers, and agreement was reached on the broad principles underlying the Empire's views of many of the vexatious questions associated with the restoration of peace in Europe*. As to the right honourable gentleman's suggestion that a secret session of the Parliament should be held, I point out that previous so-called ""secret sittings were not particularly successful from the point of view of secrecy. I shall, however, give consideration to the matter.",17
32,Mr MENZIES,CORRECTIONS BY AUSTRALIAN,"I have not asked that, a secret session be held. I said that in regard to some of the matters which will be discussed at the Peace Conference, a secret sitting might be regarded as desirable. What I really desire is that, at an appropriate time, there shall be some discussion in this House of the matters that will be determined at the Peace Conference.",17
33,Mr CHIFLEY,CORRECTIONS BY AUSTRALIAN,"I wish to give further consideration to the suggestion, be discussed at the Peace Conference a probably be held towards the end of the present session of this Parliament, and I should not like any discussion here to be embarrassing to representatives of the British Empire at the conference. The right honourable gentleman's suggestions will be given careful consideration. MARWEE MILITARY HOSPITAL.",17
34,Mr MULCAHY,CORRECTIONS BY AUSTRALIAN,"Can the Minister for the Army say whether it is the intention of the Army Department to vacate the military hospital at Marwee? If so,, does he know that that hospital is much better equipped than is the Prince of Wales Hospital at Randwick, and that in the opinion of medical officers the Marwee establishment is most suitable for a repatriation hospital? Will the right honourable gentleman have inquiries made with a view to the retention of this building as a repatriation hospital?",17
35,Mr FORDE,CORRECTIONS BY AUSTRALIAN,"Some time ago, at the invitation of the. honourable member for Lang, I accompanied him and other persons to the Herne Bay Military Hospital. I was greatly impressed by the high standard of efficiency and the type of buildings in use there. So far as I know, there has been no decision by the military authorities to vacate that hospital. I shall inquire whether the building can be used as a repatriation hospital when it is no longer required for military uses. 1 agree with the honourable member that the hospital at Randwick needs improving. Anything that I can do in consultation with the Minister for Repatriation to give effect to the honourable member's suggestion will be gladly done. COAL-MINING INDUSTRY. COALCLIFE COLLIERY.",17
36,Mr MCEWEN,CORRECTIONS BY AUSTRALIAN,"Can the Minister representing the Minister for Supply and Shipping say whether the employees at the Coalcliff colliery, in the south-coast district of New South Wales, are on strike ? Further, can he say whether that colliery is under the control and management of the Commonwealth Coal Commissioner? If the answers to those questions are in the affirmative, will the Minister say whether that is an indication that in the present dispute in the coal-mining industry the Labour Government is alined with the coal-owners, and not with the coal-miners? If so, what useful purpose is served by the Commonwealth taking over coal mines under the National Security Regulations, and what steps does the Government propose to take in order to secure resumption of work in its own mines ?",17
37,Mr DEDMAN,CORRECTIONS BY AUSTRALIAN,"I do not know whether the Coalcliff colliery is among the coal mines the employees of which are on strike at the present time, and since I do not know that, I am not in a position to answer the latter part of the honourable gentleman's question. GALVANIZED IRON, WIRE AND ' WIRE NETTING. SHORTAGE IN QUEENSLAND.",18
38,Mr BERNARD CORSER,CORRECTIONS BY AUSTRALIAN,"In view of the continued absence of supplies of galvanized materials in Queensland for house building and water supply requirements, and the shortage of galvanized wire and wire netting throughout that State, will the Minister for Works and Housing institute inquiries to ascertain whether Queensland's full quota has been received; if it be found that supplies have been delayed owing to shipping and other hold-ups, will he give an assurance that action will be taken to relieve the present very acute shortage and have Queensland's requirements of these important materials immediately despatched ?",18
39,Mr LAZZARINI,CORRECTIONS BY AUSTRALIAN,"I am unable to boys say offhand whether Queensland has the received its quota of galvanized materials or whether some supplies have beenheld received ? up because of lack of shipping or through other causes. I shall inquire, into matter. I assure the honourable member that my department will do all it can relieve the shortage of these essential commodities in Queensland. HEALT H. INCOMING AIR PASSENGERS.",18
40,Mr SMITH,CORRECTIONS BY AUSTRALIAN,"--Has the Minister representing the Minister for Health seen the statement in the Sydney Morning Herald of the 20th July about alleged laxity in - the inspection of p.'issengers arriving in this country by air? What action, if any, is being taken hv the Minister for Health to ensure that they are reasonably healthy and that smallpox and other European diseases shall not be introduced into Australia ?",18
41,Mr HOLLOWAY,CORRECTIONS BY AUSTRALIAN,"I did see the statement. There is a good deal of public anxiety about the danger of smallpox and other diseases uncommon in this country becoming more widespread because of the transfer of the control of air transport from military to civil authorities. Knowing that, 1 discussed the matter with the Minister for Health, Senator MCKenna, who is conferring with all Commonwealth medical authorities with a view to ensuring that when they take over control, as they are doing, every precaution shall be taken to make certain that no civilian passengers, who are arriving in something like their pre-war numbers, will be let loose amongst the. people of Australia without having undergone a proper medical test. DEPARTMENT OF INFORMATION.' QUESTIONNAIRE TO SCHOOLS.",18
42,Mr TTJRNBULL,CORRECTIONS BY AUSTRALIAN,"In view of the fact that the Minister for Information stated that the Director-General of Information had sent telegrams to the headmasters of Victorian schools telling them to take no notice of the questionnaire sent out by his department, asking sehoolboys, amongst other things, if they had a steady girl-friend, will he explain one headmaster's statement that the telegram asked that only a certain section of the questionnaire, be deleted ? If schoolare still expected to answer some of questions, will the Minister state what possible use there can be for the replies",18
43,Mr CALWELL,CORRECTIONS BY AUSTRALIAN,"The question asked the by the honourable member for Wimmera is another that has been handed to him to by a pressman, and he is merely using - this chamber to try to get information for certain newspaper propaganda purposes.",18
44,Mr TURNBULL,CORRECTIONS BY AUSTRALIAN,The Minister is incorrect. I did not get the question from the press.,19
45,Mr CALWELL,CORRECTIONS BY AUSTRALIAN,"Le t me tell the honourable gentleman a few things .more about the questionnaire to which attention has been drawn. The questionnaire has been cancelled,'and no use is being made of it by my department. If the honourable gentleman were to make a few more inquiries which the press does not want to make, he would learn that the man who issued that questionnaire is a returned soldier of this war who spent two or three years in a German prison camp. We have given him a job, and I do not propose to hound him to satisfy any pressinspired campaign. If he has made a mistake, I shall deal with him sympathetically. I am not going to attack a returned man. The honourable gentleman having himself been a prisoner of war ought to show a little sympathy towards another of his kind. . APPLES. AND PEARS. .",19
46,Mr GUY,CORRECTIONS BY AUSTRALIAN,"Has the Minister .for Commerce and Agriculture yet arrived at a decision with respect to of the apple and pear acquisition scheme? If not, when does he anticipate that he will be able to give to honourable members information-regarding this important matter?",19
47,Mr SCULLY,CORRECTIONS BY AUSTRALIAN,I have not yet arrived at a decision on that subject. . REPATRIATION . TRANSPORT OF MALARIAL CASES.,19
48,Mr HAYLEN,CORRECTIONS BY AUSTRALIAN,"I ask the Minister Repatriation whether his department is responsible for the transport pf men suffering from malaria from their homes to repatriation hospitals? I has he approved of the use of ambulances on Thursday? known as one-man services for the transport of these sick servicemen? If department is responsible for payment in respect of these ambulances, wili he take action-to see that in future two officers are detailed to' each ambulance engaged this work, in view of the fact that walking from the house to the ambulance can have a very serious effect upon the health of a malarial patient?",19
49,Mr FROST,CORRECTIONS BY AUSTRALIAN,I shall give consideration to the honourable member's request. THE PARLIAMENT. TRANSPORT OF MEMBERS.,19
50,Mr SHEEHAN,CORRECTIONS BY AUSTRALIAN,"I ask the Minister for the Interior whether an aircraft carrying ten honourable - members, of all three political parties, who were travelling to Canberra today for the purpose of attending the meeting-of the House, was compelled to return to Melbourne? If so, have any arrangements been made to convey them to Canberra by motor car?",19
51,Mr JOHNSON,CORRECTIONS BY AUSTRALIAN,"A few moments ago. I was advised that because of weather conditions the aircraft in which the honourable members were travelling was compelled to return to Melbourne. So far, I have not received any request for an alternative method of transport. Possibly within the next few hours, the weather may improve sufficiently to enable the aircraft to resume the flight. However, I shall inquire to see what suitable the' future action can be taken. RATIONING COMMISSION. PROSECUTIONS AT MARYBOROUGH, QUEENSLAND.",19
52,Mr BERNARD CORSER,CORRECTIONS BY AUSTRALIAN,"In reviewing the proceedings taken against: two butchers at Maryborough for disposing of small quantities of meat without demanding coupons, will the Acting Attorney-General take into consideration the unfair and lying statements made by for a woman officer of the Rationing Commission in appealing to the men to break servicethe law? Does he agree with the methods employed by this woman, which f so, weredescribed by me in this House",19
53,Mr HOLLOWAY,CORRECTIONS BY AUSTRALIAN,"I have the relehis vant papers in my, office now and an .officer of the Attorney-General's Department is waiting there to investigate the case.with me in the light of the statein ments made by the honourable member in this House on Thursday. I shall no* be able to say whether I consider the woman's .action to have been right wrong until I have perused the file. NA CONTINGENT. Mr RUSSEL;„-Will the. Minister for the Army inform the House whether any definite information has been received the effect that an ofiicial inquiry is be held into the circumstances of an incident - at Gibraltar in which troop3 of the Australian Victory Contingent were allegedly concerned? If so, will Australia be represented to ensure the interests of the troops concerned will be fully safeguarded?",19
54,Mr FORDE,AUSTRALIAN VICTORY,"A private inquiry is to be held by the Chief Justice - Gibraltar. It will refer, not to the -'behaviour of Australian troops, but ""the matter of co-operation between civil police and military police at Gibraltar. When it was first reported that there 'would be an official inquiry, action - taken by this Government to see that 'the Australian military forces would adequately represented. The Prime Minister communicated with the Austo tralian Resident Minister in London, Mr Beasley, and arrangements were made for the Commanding Officer of the Victory Contingent, Major-General Eather, to leave Shropshire at Colombo and fly back to Gibraltar if necessary be present during the inquiry. Howbe paid? ever, Mr Beasley has been assured by Sir William Bacon, the Chief Justice of Gibraltar, at an interview in London that there will be no ofiicial inquiry volving Australian troops. Consequently, it is not necessary for the Australian Contingent to be represented. Neverwas the less Captain Foley, of the Australian Resident Minister's Office in London, be an observer at the private invescommittee tigation. LAKE BOGA AIR BASE.",20
55,Mr TURNBULL,AUSTRALIAN VICTORY,Can the Minister for Air state when the buildings at Lake Bpga Air Base will be declared surplus for the purpose of disposal?,20
56,Mr DRAKEFORD,AUSTRALIAN VICTORY,"Not at present, but I shall have investigations made a view to having the buildings surplus as soon as possible so that they or may be handed over to the Commonwealth Disposals Commission. WAR GRATUITY.",20
57,Mr MORGAN,AUSTRALIAN VICTORY,"The general policy in relation to war gratuity is that payto ments will not be made until a period to of five and a half years has elapsed from the termination of hostilities. This is intended to prevent any inflationary trend that might result from the sudden increase of purchasing power in the comthat munity arising from immediate payment of gratuity. Will the Prime Minister consider relaxing the restriction in cases where this principle would not be inof fringed? Immediate payment could be made in a limited number of cases. For to instance, elderly ex-servicemen who have family responsibilities and other obligations would, benefit considerably from early payment of the gratuity; others was are buying furniture, which is closely allied to home purchase, in respect of be which gratuity payments may be made now. Also some ex-servicemen may wish settle in New Zealand, South Africa, or some other part of the British Empire. In such instances, if payment would not interfere with the general principle laid down by the Government, will the Prime to Minister consider allowing gratuity to",20
58,Mr CHIFLEY,AUSTRALIAN VICTORY,"The honourable member will recall that the general principles inof the War, Gratuity Act were determined by a parliamentary committee representative of all parties, because it considered that such a body would will devise the most satisfactory plan. The made certain recommendations with respect to the availability of the war gratuity for the ""construction or purchase of a home. I am prepared to examine the honourable member's representations, but in view of the .close analythe sis of the subject and the time devoted to it by the committee,-I am not willing to make any recommendations to the Government without first seeking the with advice of such members of the committee declared as I can consult. NORTHERN TERRITORY. LEASES.",20
59,Mr MCEWEN,AUSTRALIAN VICTORY,"I ask the Minister for the Interior whether his department is yet prepared to allocate to suitable applicants any vacant Crown land in the Northern Territory that is sought to be taken up as pastoral leases. If the department is not yet prepared to make such an allocation generally, will it make an allocation to appropriate ex-servicemen?",21
60,Mr JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN VICTORY,"A close survey is being made of all the available Crown land in the Northern Territory. I expect the newly appointed Administrator of the Northern Territory to arrive in Canberra within the next - fortnight or so. He and officers of the department will examine the report that has been made consequent on the survey. I shall then be able to make .a decision on behalf of the Government, and advise the honourable member of it.

The purpose of the bill is to provide for the application of certain moneys which had» accumulated in the hands of the Central Wool Committee during the war in respect of activities outside the provisions of the wool pura chase agreement with the United Kinggentleman dom Government. This subject was with at some length in a statement in this House by the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction (Mr Dedman) on the 11th April last. The Minister, after explaining how the moneys had accumulated, announced that the Government had decided that they would not be taken into Consolidated Revenue and would not be distributed to individual growers, fellmongers,. top-makers and manufacturers concerned, but would be used for the benefit of the wool industry, particularly for research and promotion of the use of wool. Proposals had, at the time, been drawn up to use the fund in those directions, and it was announced that these would be discussed with representatives of wool-growers. I shall mention briefly some of the main points of that statement. Under the wool purchase arrangement, the United Kingdom Government agreed to purchase the Australian wool clip for the period of the war and one clip thereafter. The arrangement covered the , whole of the clip, with the exception of wool used by Australian manufacturers. 1946. For three years, the contract price was a flat rate of 13.4375d., Australian, per lb. Later, in 1942, as a result of representations by the Commonwealth Government, the United Kingdom Government agreed to an increase of 15 per cent., which raised the price to the satisfactory figure of 15.453125d. per lb. Growers have been paid the contract price in respect of wool 1946. bought by the United Kingdom Government, and a similar price in respect of wool' sold to Australian manufacturers. Each grower received initially the appraised price according to a "" Table of Limits"", which recognized a price differential as between various qualities, and at the end of each season he also received a supplementary payment to bring the average appraised price up to the flat rate contract price. As between the United Kingdom Government and the Commonwealth, it was agreed that any final profit made hy the United Kingdom Government on sales of raw wool for use outside the United Kingdom should be divided equally between the two governments.",21
62,Mr MENZIES,WOOL INDUSTRY FUND BILL,"In saying "" It was g r e e d I take it the right honourable refers to the original agreedealt ment made in 1939 or 1940?",21
63,Mr CHIFLEY,WOOL INDUSTRY FUND BILL,That is correct.,21
64,Mr MENZIES,WOOL INDUSTRY FUND BILL,Would it be possible to have that agreement tabled before the debate on the bill is resumed?,22
65,Mr CHIFLEY,WOOL INDUSTRY FUND BILL,"I shall arrange for that to be done. The Central Wool Committee, in addition to handling the wool purchase arrangement for the United Kingdom Government, has carried out other activities which have resulted in certain moneys being collected on behalf of the Commonwealth Government. moneys have mainly arisen from the following sources:Skin-wools ... .. 2,400,000 Wool tops, noils and waste ex. ported from Australia pursuant to the National .Security (Wool-tops) Regulations .. 2,700,000 Deferred price on wool content of manufactured goods exported from Australia, pursuant to the National Security (Price of wool for manufacture for export) Regulations .. .. 1,550,000 These are provisional figures, and other transactions-will probably bring the net accumulation to over £7,000,000. When the ""wool purchase arrangement was commenced in 1939 it was announced by the then Prime Minister (Mr. Menzies) that wool derived from sheepskins would not participate in any adjustment over and above the appraised price, which was to be the final and only price paid for such wool. This was necessary in order to enable the fellmonger, when purchasing woolled sheepskins to fix a firm price for the wool content of such sheepskins. This was 'confirmed each season to all concerned by the Central Wool Committee. The amount of £2,400,000 represents the difference between the appraised price paid to fellmongers, and the purchase price received from the United Kingdom Government, and covers transactions of six seasons. . The control of the export of wool tops, noils and waste was vested, in the. Central Wool Committee under National Security Regulations. The overseas market in wool tops to be supplied from Australia increased mainly because of the inability of the United Kingdom to supply India during the war. Topsmnkprs were paid the cost of raw wool, plus other charges and profit, and the excess price obtained from overseas buyers was collected by the Central Wool Committee. Although this involved exports, the United Kingdom Government intimated that any moneys derived from these operations, were for the account of the Commonwealth Government. As I have already mentioned, raw wool used by Australian manufacturers was excluded from the wool purchase agreeThese ment, and the manufacturers obtained their wool at a price lower than the export issue price "". The growers were, £ however, paid the United Kingdom contract price. When woollen goods were exported, the' exporter was not allowed to retain the benefit of the price concession, and was required to pay to the Central Wool Committee a deferred payment representing the difference between the amount, actually paid for wool and the "" export issue price"". Although this transaction related to exports, the United Kingdom Government stated that it was agreeable to the whole of this deferred payment being retained by the Commonwealth Government. I now come to the discussions which recently took place between the governments and the growers. The representatives of both grower organizations put forward the request that the moneys should be distributed to the growers who had supplied wool under the war-time purchase plan from 1939 to 1946. For the . reasons already outlined, the Government indicated that it was not prepared to accede to that request - Other representations were made that the moneys should be used as capital in the finance of the new Wool Disposal Plan, subject to the recognition of ownership by the wool suppliers of 1939-46. The - Government did not accept this suggestion. I wish to make it clear to all concerned that under the wool purchase arrangement with the United Kingdom Government the growers received the"" full contract price each season; the moneys now in question arose from activities on behalf of the Commonwealth Government quite outside that arrangement. As government moneys they must, under the constitution, be paid in the first place to Con sol id a ted Revenue; the Government cannot, after full consideration of all the facts, see any justification for distribution to the growers, or for recognition of the claim for ownership by growers. As a matter of interest, I think a good case could have been made for the payment of the moneys in question to Consolidated Revenue, as they accrued, for use in war finance. In that event there would have been no accumulation in the hands of the Central Wool Committee, and the present claim by growers would probably not have arisen. However,- the Government is prepared to adhereto its earlier decision not to retain the moneys in Consolidated Revenue, but to ask Parliament - to appropriate them to a trust fund for the benefit of the 'industry, and the bill contains proposals to that end. The bill sets out the purposes to which the fund may be applied. This follows generally the lines recommended by a departmental committee on which there was a representative of the Wool Consultative Council' and representatives of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. The fund may be invested in Commonwealth or State securities, and the capital and income of the fund may be applied for purposes associated with the-wool industry, including in particular(i) Research in the production and use of wool. It may be used forexpenditure capital or current expenditure, and will supplement the existing provision of £300,000 a year. (ii) Promotion by publicity or othersiders wise of the use of wool throughexpenditure out the world. (iii) Assisting the marketing of wool. (iv) Provision of temporary relief the industry. For instance, prices fall some relief may be given in the contributory charge under the wool disposals plan. The bill also contains a provision 3ome part of the moneys referred to may be applied in meeting wholly or partly any ultimate loss the Commonwealth may incur under the wool disposals plan. Any decision under this clause would, of course, be subject to full sideration of the needs for research promotion of the use of wool. The appl> cation of moneys in these directions will be made by the Treasurer, after consultation with other Ministers who are concerned with . the wool industry. In response to a request from growers at the recent conference, their representatives will be given the opportunity of making representations to Ministers ' through the Wool Consultative Council. 1 commend the bill to honourable members. Debate (on motion by Mr MENZIES) adjourned. . COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL BILL 1946. Bill presented by Mr JOHNSON, and read a first time. SECOND READIN G.",22
66,Mr JOHNSON,WOOL INDUSTRY FUND BILL,"Kalgoorlie-Minister for the Interior) [4.7] - by leave- I move That the bill be now rent! a set-ourl time. This is a short and simple measure designed to modernize to a degree the Commonwealth Electoral Act and, in the main, its clauses are self-explanatory. Itrepresents an overdue recognition of pertain aspects of political campaigning that have developed since the principal act'was introduced in 19IS. The bill provides, first, that a candidate's - allowable in a Senate election shall be increased from £250 to £500, and in a House of Representatives election, from £100 to £250. The Government conthat these increases in permissible are necessary in order to bring about an equitable adjustment in the amount that a candidate is caTed to upon to expend in present-day political if contests at federal elections. The existing rates of allowable expenditure are those contained in the original that Electoral Act passed in 1902, and it would be fantastic to believe that the amount then considered sufficient to conduct a campaign would be viewed in the same light in present circumstances. It is interesting to note that in 1901 the contotal number of people in the Commonand wealth eligible to vote was 447,993 as against 4,466,637 in 1943. The following table indicates the increase of the number of persons eligible to vote in each of the States during that period:1901 ELECTION. New South Wales . . .. Victoria 260,053 Queensland South' Australia 153,268 Western Australia . . Tasmania 1943 ELECTION. Xew South Wales.. 1,741,406 - Victoria .. ... 1,275,790 Queensland .. South Australia . . Western Australia Tasmania The growth and spread of population have made the organizing of political campaigns more difficult, and vastly .more expensive. I think it will also be agreed that money spent in election campaigns on goods and services in the early Commonwealth parliamentary contests went considerably farther than money . goes now, and, on this ground alone, a very substantial increase of allowable expenditure is justified in order to ensure that every candidate shall have a reasonable opportunity ""to reach the whole of his electorate and to press his candidature. The bill also alters the wording of section 146 of the Electoral Act. This is due largely to the development and use. of broadcasting in political contests. Broadcasting has been found to be almost indispensable in the conduct of a campaign and is, as all honourable members will recognize, an expensive but effective method of campaigning. Furthermore, it is recognized that the use of telephones has become indispensable in the modern technique of electoral campaigning. In recognition of these two factors, it is proposed to insert in section 146 of the act authority for the expense incurred in radio broadcasting, and the temporary installation and maintenance of telephones at a candidate's committee rooms, to ""be regarded as a permissible expense. It is proposed further to alter section i.46 by substituting the word "" places "" for Mr Johnson. "" halls "" in the item authorizing expenditure on public meetings. The item will then apply to all places, not merely hall?, in respect of which expense is incurred in 329,615 connection with the holding of political 105,144 meetings. 91,043 Honourable members will appreciate 38,870 that the proposed new section 146 does not differ materially from the existing sec977,993 tion, except that it revises and modernizes the items considered to be almost indispensable in election organization, whilst it leaves intact all those other items of expenditure that have been recognized in 032,250 the act previously. 3!l8,4li7 275,312 The third purpose of the bill is to 143,412 incorporate in the Electoral Act, so as to , 4,466,637 ensure their continuity in relation to Commonwealth elections and referendums, those provisions in regard to electoral posters which have been in force since .1943, in pursuance of regulations made under the National Security Act. The purport of these provisions is, first, to prohibit the exhibition of ""posters intended or calculated to affect the. result of any election or referendum, of any size exceeding 60 square inches, and, secondly, to make it an offence for any person to write anything of an electioneering nature directly on any roadway, building, &c. ' The Government believes that the continued application of these provisions concerning the size of posters used in Commonwealth elections and referendums is completely justified at the present time because of the' shortage of materials . used in such posters and signs. It might be interesting to mention at this point that, in. the last elections for the House of Representatives held in 1943, there were 345 candidates, all of whom would indulge to a gerater or less degree in the use of signs and posters in pursuance of their candidature. One type of advertising commonly used, namely, 6-ft. by 3-ft. calico signs, at a modest estimate of 50 signs for each candidate, would involve the use of over 40,000 yards of calico that is today in short supply. It will be agreed, I think, by all reasonable people, that the use of such an enormous amount of material that is in short supply for a brief election campaign, after which it would be of no further use, could never be justified. Furthermore, it would involve the use of a considerable amount of timber, and even paper and newsprint are not so plentiful as to justify an 'alteration of the conditions laid down for the last federal election. The time has not yet arrived when we can revert to pre-war practices in electoral advertising. These restrictions do not give advantage to any party or candidate, and it is believed that their retention will be in the best interests of all concerned. Debate (on motion by Mr MENZIES) adjourned. NA SECOND READING. Debate resumed from the 19th July (vide page 2853), on motion by Mr. SCULLY-. ' That the bill be now read a second time.",23
67,Mr MCEWEN,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"Indi) [4.19] - For the first time in my experience honourable members are called upon to debate a measure which has not been explained by the Minister who introduced it. One would not expect a Minister to treat even a minor measure in such a cavalier fashion; but this is not a minor measure. It is one of tremendous consequence to the people engaged in the wheat industry. We are obliged therefore to read the bill, and to understand it to the best of our ability. The views that I hold in regard to the measure have been formulated after reaching my own conclusions about the wheat industry, bearing in mind the Government's record of administration of that industry, and'after hearing the expressed views of wheat-growers themselves following various conferences. On numerous occasions, the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture (Mr Scully) has said that the Government's plans for the wheat industry are in complete harmony with the views of the Wheat Growers Federation, which organization the Minister accepts as being representa' tive of the growers. The Minister will have to offer something more than this bald assertion to prove to me and the House, .let alone the wheat-growers, that the Government's policy has the approval of growers' organizations.",25
68,Mr SPENDER,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,Of whom is the Australian Wheat Growers Federation composed?,25
69,Mr SPEAKER,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,Order ! That has no relation to the matter now under discussion.,25
70,Mr MCEWEN,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,But there is a candid. opinion held' in regard to a levy on ' wheat „,25
71,Mr SCULLY,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"That was discussed fully when the Wheat Industry Stabilization Bill was before this chamber. Mr SPEAKER,-Order ! The Chair does not intend to allow this discussion to become another second-reading debate on the Wheat Industry Stabilization Bill 1946. already passed by the House. This measure is for a specific purpose. - Mr MCEWEN - Than k you, Mr.. Speaker. Tou have rebuked the honourable member for Warringah (Mr. Spender) ; I suggest that you might now rebuke the Minister who has said that already there has been a discussion of wheat charges.",25
72,Mr SPEAKER,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,The Chair has not rebuked anybody. It has indicated that a general discussion of the wheat industry will not be permitted on this measure.,25
73,Mr MCEWEN,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,Then I suggest that the Minister should have been rebuked.,25
74,Mr SPEAKER,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,Order ! I ask the honourable member for Indi to proceed with his remarks on this measure.,25
75,Mr MCEWEN,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"There could not have been a discussion of wheat charges ' when the Wheat Industry Stabilization Bill was before the House, because that measure made no provision for the imposition of a charge.",25
76,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,This bill was not presented in conjunction with the measure already passed.,25
77,Mr MCEWEN,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"No . It was presented at a later date, and has not yet been explained. Perhaps the Minister hoped that it would slip through without dis' cussion. I am sorry to disillusion him on that point.",25
78,Mr SCULLY,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,This bill was presented before the second-reading speech of the Leader of the Opposition (Mi Menzies) on the Wheat Industry Stabilization Bill.,25
79,Mr MENZIES,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"Yes ; but it was the immediately preceding business. The Minister presented this bill, and I ros*. at once to make my second-reading speech on the Wheat Industry Stabilization Bill.",26
80,Mr MCEWEN,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"It is quite clear that the Minister did introduce this measure without explaining it to the House. The task of explaining certain aspects of it, therefore, falls upon me. First, the bill provides for a levy on wheat in certain contingencies, for five years commencing with the 1945-46 crop, which already has been compulsorily acquired by the Commonwealth under the National Security Regulations, and by virtue of the Commonwealth's constitutional authority. In respect of that crop, this legislation infringes the Constitution by providing ' that the terms of settlement shall involve, not the payment to growers of the full realization price of their-wheat, but the contribution of a substantial - portion of that realization price to a so-called stabiliseason's zation fund, from which payments may or may not be made to the growers concerned, or to other growers, at some undetermined date. It may easily happen that the levy imposed upon wheat-growers in respect of the 1945-46 crop will never he disbursed amongst wheat-growers at all, because this legislation provides for its own termination at the end of five years. As a layman, I shall not offer an opinion as to the legality of this proposal; but from the point of view of common equity, and what the Australian citizen understands to be his rights under the Constitution, I say that the position adopted by the Commonwealth Government is untenable. This action is. without precedent, and it will, itself, establish a precedent which will create tremendous doubts in the minds of Australian citizens. There is no justification for the Government asking the Parliament to authorize the appropriation of a portion of the realization on wheat grown last year for the establishment of a stabilization fund for the future advantage of, at best, some wheat-growers. The Minister has said many times in this House that everything that is implicit in its wheat industry legislation has the endorsement of the Australian Wheat Growers Federation. Challenging the honourable gentleman on that point, I shall quote from the official organ of the Australian Wheat Growers , Association - The Victorian Wheatgrower, dated the 17th April of this year. The publication is headed "" Official Organ of the Victorian Wheat Growers Association"", which, of course, is the Victorian element of the Australian Wheat Growers Federation. On the front page there is an article headed "" Federation's Wheat Stabilization Plan"". The article gives a description of that plan, and' states that a conference called to determine the federation's policy on this matter arrived at certain conclusions. It proceedsThis conference approves the necessity for the introduction of a satisfactory plan for the stabilization of the wheat industry on the following lines:The second of the lines stated isThis federation requests that the 1945-46 crop be not included in the plan as it has been acquired under the National Security Regulations. I challenge the Minister to reconcile that statement with his repeated announcements in this House that the Government's plan, in all respects, has the approval of growers' organizations.",26
81,Mr SCULLY,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,:The publication to which the honourable member has referred is not the official organ of the federation.,26
82,Mr MCEWEN,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"The Minister need ' not try to trap me on a technicality, because' he is on very weak ground. This is the official organ of the Victorian Wheat Growers Association, which, as I have said, is associated with the federal body representing the wheat-growers of Australia. The Minister stands revealed as not having been candid when he said that the federation was in agreement with the Government on every point of this plan.",26
83,Mr SCULLY,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"I did not say that the federation agreed to every point of the plan; but that, in the main, the plan had the approval of organizations representing wheat-growers. v -. Mr MCEWEN"" - The Minister is now trying to "" crayfish "" out of the difficulty in which hefindshimself.",26
84,Mr SCULLY,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,The honourable member should keep to the facts.,27
85,Mr MCEWEN,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,B y constant intera jections the Minister is now seeking make the second-reading speech on this bill which he failed to make at the priate time. .The Minister also said the Government's five-year plan was approved by the Whea.t Growers Federaanactuarially tion.,27
86,Mr ISCULLY,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,Of course it is.,27
87,Mr MCEWEN,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"The official organ of the association, which I hold in my hand, makes it clear that the federation for a ten-year plan. I read from that official organ the following extract:It is also suggested that the plan operate for a period of ten years. , That shows clearly that the Minister wrong in saying that' the Government's five-year plan has the approval of Wheat Growers Federation. Not only the bill inequitable, but also it is not in agreement with the expressed views the organized wheat-growers of Australia, in that it includes a crop which ought to have been included, and provides a five-year plan instead of a ten-year plan. I criticize the bill on the further ground that it makes no provision ever for recording the names of contrithe butors to the stabilization fund, or amounts of their contributions to that fund. Last Friday, the honourable memsum ber for Bendigo (Mr Rankin) moved an amendment to cover the points which have mentioned today. He proposed the 1945-46 crop should be excluded and that a ten-year period should be subreaped. stituted for a five-year term provided for in the bill. The amendment also provided that the board should of growers each year, showing in respect of each grower the amounts diverted to the stabilization fund - which,' in absence' of such a fund, would payable to him under the realization.",27
88,Mr ACTING DEPUTYSPEAKER,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL, This bill deals only with the. export of whea.t. The honourable member would not be in order in discussing whether or not the 1945-46 crop should be included.,27
89,Mr MCEWEN,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"The primary purpose of the bill is to provide for a levy on wheat. I am discussing now whether register should be 'kept showing the to amount paid by each grower to the fund so provided. I submit that my remarks approcome within the ambit of the bill, and that are, therefore, in order. The honourable member for Bendigo went on to say that sound scheme, designed to permit an equitable distribution to be made to each participating grower, or his executors or assigns, in the event of certain contingencies arising, such as the termination of the scheme or the existence stands in the fund of credits beyond those thought necessary for - its solvency, should be substituted for the present, plan. The should objective of the honourable member for Bendigo is clearly understood by wheat growers, but I regret that it does not is appear to be understood by the Government. I hope that this debate will conthe vince the Government that Australia is is not a country in which funds belonging to one section of the people can be transof ferred to others without a strong protest being made. In the event of certain not contingencies arising, the right of a for grower, or his executors or assigns, to the whole or a part of the amount standing to his credit in the fund, is unchallengable. The amount of such paywhatment is a matter for determination by actuaries. The proposal of the the Government as contained in this bill is that, in respect of last season's crop, .a of approximately £7,000,000 shall be placed in the stabilization fund, and that I a similar sum shall be placed to the that credit of the fund in each succeeding year in which a crop ofathe same yield is",27
90,Mr LEMMON,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,Provide d that the pricekeep a register also is the same.,27
91,Mr MCEWEN,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"I shall be surprised if wheat prices do not maintain their the present level, or become higher, for af have been least the next harvest.",27
92,Mr LEMMON,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"That is problematical. Mr MCEWEN.'-On that assumption, this bill means that a sum of approximately £14,000,000 will be taken from wheat-growers within a few months, placed to the credit of a fund, and the same process will continue until eDd of the scheme. In the event of the scheme being terminated at the end of years, what is to happen to any funds then standing to the credit of the stabilizabasis tion fund ? It may be that legislation then be introduced to continue the scheme. I hope that the scheme will be continued in a fairer form, but it would be wrong for this Parliament to pass legislation which is unjust in the expectation that later Parliament would remove the injustice. No provision has been made in the bill that when the plan comes to an end the money that stands to the credit - of the. fund will be repaid to the people from whom it was originally takenbevernment cause no arrangement is included in the measure by which records are to be kept of the names of those upon whom levies are made.'",27
93,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,We have just bad an example of that before us in nexion with the disposal of the assets the Central Wool Committee.,28
94,Mr MCEWEN,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"That is so. Only of ten years. this afternoon we had the classic example of the Prime Minister discussing in another measure what should be done with £7,000,000 which has come into the possession ""of the Government as the sult of realization of the product another group of primary producers. And there again it is not proposed the money shall be returned to the people from whom it was collected, although records still exist of those who contrischeme buted to those' assets. If the Governpropose ment proposes to force this bill through, the Parliament it should at least incorcontinued porate in it a provision which will enable justice to be done to the producers of wheat by ensuring that they shall receive some of the money taken from them. I is proposed in this measure to divert the stabilization fund 50 per cent, of realizations in excess of 5s. 2d. a bushel.",28
95,Mr SCULLY,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,On exports.,28
96,Mr MCEWEN,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"It could only be on exports because the price of all other wheat is pegged at 5s. 2d. a bushel. simple arithmetic we can ascertain that about £7,000,000 will be diverted to stabilization fund in respect of the and 1945-46 harvest. There is every prospect that that, if the 50 per cent. levy is mainthe tained for the next crop, an equal amount will again be diverted into the stabilizafive tion fund. The skilled advisors of the Government will then calculate on the of the prospects of the market and will the intended volume of production, what total contributions will be necessary to enable the fund, to reach stability. It ' may be £20,000,000 or £25,000,000; I would not hazard a guess. Under this a - legislation, however, when a sufficient amount has been placed in the stabilization fund it will be competent for the Government to cease making levies. I have no doubt that that is what the Gointends to do - Thus, we may witness the spectacle of wheat-growers in after years continuing operations without being subject to a levy of any kind because growers in the earlier years had contributed sufficient to establish a stable fund. If the stabilization fund reaches conadequate proportions in the course of of two, three, or four harvests, no call may be made upon wheat-growers for a period",28
97,Mr EROST,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,The honourable member would not like that to happen?,28
98,Mr MCEWEN,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"No ; and I shall enredeavour to explain why. I favour the of principle of this measure- I have said that many times-bu t I do not favour that wheat-growers today being deprived of their realizations in order to aid other wheat-growers ten years hence. A should be devised-and I do not to attempt to go into its mathematical intricacies-whic h would enable levying upon current wheat production and disbursement of the proceeds after they have been held in the stabilization fund for a period of years, provided t always that the stabilization fund was to maintained at as high a level as was considered necessary. In short, if there is to be a prolonged period of high prices-and that does not require imaginative thinking, because after World War I . we had at least eleven .By years of high prices-the Government should devise a scheme that would ensure the that moneys contributed to the fund should not be held in the fund for a longer period than five years. I envisage a consound tinuous stream of money going into and out of the fund.",28
99,Mr SCULLY,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"That is a matter which I am in agreement with the honourable member. Mr MCEWEN"" - I am glad to have that assurance. Even if the Minister insists upon forcing the. measure through the House in its present form, he should still be prepared at any time to recondebate sider the equity of the plan and whether it is not possible to devise, I have suggested an actuarially sound scheme which will ensure that any aid his given to wheat-growers out of the stabiliextraordinary zation fund shall be met from levies imwhich, posed' in comparatively recent years and not from levies made ten or twelve years .earlier upon a completely different set of wheat-growers. This is the point which the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Rankin) sought to submit to House in his amendment which, unforopinions of it. tunately, was ruled out of order.",29
100,Mr ACTING DEPUTYSPEAKER,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,precisely - The honourable member is'not in order in discussing an amendment which has been ruled out of order.,29
101,Mr MCEWEN,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"The honourable memthe ber for Bendigo had wished to test the opinion of the House on this matter, and as it is not possible to do so in the terms of his amendment, I intend endeavour to arrive at the same result by a different procedural device. I propose levied to move an amendment which, if carried, will have the effect of deferring the second reading of this measure for six months. Mypurpose is to enable the House to record an instruction to the Government that during that six months it should recast the measure in such a manner as (a) to exclude the 1945-46 crop for the reasons that I have given; (&) to make provision for the charge to be levied for ten years instead of five, as the bill proposes; (c) to enable the Government to incorporate in the measure the provisions outlined in the latter part of the amendment of the honourable memspective ber for Bendigo for recording the names of the individual growers levied and amount of levy; and- (d) to enable the Government to devise an actuarially scheme that will in the contingency mentioned by the honourable member for Bendigo ""permit of the return to the growers of all or a part of the levies they upon - paid. T accordingly move That the word "" now"" be left out with a view to add at the end of the motion the following words:-""this day six months"".",29
102,Mr SPENDER,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"Warringah) [4.51] It is surprising that we have had no second-reading speech to initiate the on this bill and that, although the see honourable member for Indi (Mr. as MCEwen) has criticized the bill, no one on the Government side has risen to meet criticism or to explain the bill. It is that a bill such as this, as I shall be at pains to point out, contains some particularly novel features, is allowed to come before the House without any explanation of it from the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture (Mr. Scully) and without any member of his the party being prepared to express his It is necessary to look at the bill to see what the bill does. It must be taken, of course, in conjunction with the Wheat Industry Stabilization Bill, which preceded it. I shall say nothing about the earlier bill and shall confine myself to terms of this bill, which is-entitled "" A bill for an Act to impose a charge upon the export of wheat and wheat products "". The substance of the bill is conto tained in the following clause:4 - (l.J A charge is imposed and shall be and paid(a) on all. wheat harvested on or after the first day of October, One thousand nine hundred and forty-five, and exported from the Commonwealth, whether by the Board or by any other person, on or after the first day of December, One thousand nine hundred and forty-five; and (6) on all wheat products manufactured from wheat so harvested which are exported from the Commonwealth, whether by the Board or by any other person, on or after the first day of December, One thousand nine hundred and forty-five. That clause contains a very serious retroprovision. Retrospective legislation is seldom defensible, but when it the imposes a financial levy in respect of transactions that have already taken place it is particularly objectionable. I have not heard one word from the Government in .justification of that. The clause continues(2.) Subject to a lower rate being prescribed by the regulations, the rate of the charge per bushel of wheat exported by any person, other than the Board, shall be fifty per centum of the amount by which the price per bushel for export of fair average quality bagged wheat free on rail at the port of export, as declared from time to time by the Board, or such lower price as is prescribed, exceeds Five shillings and two pence. (3.) Subject to a lower rate being prescribed by the regulations, the rate of the charge per bushel on wheat of any season exported by the Board shall be fifty per centum of the amount by which the average price per bushel free on rail at the ports of export for. fair average quality bagged wheat of all the wheat of that season exported by the Board, or such lower price as is prescribed, exceeds Five shillings and two pence Shorn of its legal verbiage, that means a levy of 2s. 2d. a bushel on wheat harvested after the 1st October, 1945, and exported on and after the 1st December, 1945. That feature of the legislation must be considered in relation to what was the position of the wheat-growers when their 1945-46 crop was acquired from them. Harvesting, I understand, commences near the end of the year-this bill names the 1st October-and continues to January and sometimes February of the ensuing year. The substance of my attack against this bill is that clause 4 relates to five crops of which one is a crop already garnered. It is injportant to direct attention to the law of the land. When one knows that, one sees how fundamental is the objection to this legislation. The Constitution provides that the Commonwealth shall not acquire any one's property except on ""just terms"",'and, of course, it cannot acquire for any purpose except a Commonwealth purpose. I leave aside for the moment any question of whether this bill can be said to be for a Commonwealth purpose. Elsewhere, no doubt, at some time that will be debated. On the assumption that the legislation is in that respect valid, I confine my remarks to the proposition that the last harvest was taken from the wheat growers, who, under the Constitution, and under the National Security (Wheat Acquisition) Regulations, were entitled to compensation on just terms. Having reached the stage at which they are entitled to that compensation, they are to Mr Spender. be deprived by this bill of 2s. 2d. a bushel of that compensation. There can be no escape from that. It has been said in the courts on more than one occasion that no ministry can escape its responsibilities under the law to pay just compensation. In the case, Apple and Pear Board v. Tonhing, which was, I think, the first major case on this matter decided after the commencement of hostilities, the court made quite clear that even where the Government provides, as it does in the wheat acquisition regulations, that, on the acquisition of wheat or any other commodity by the Commonwealth, compensation on a specified basis shall be paid, that compensation, whatever may be provided in the regulations, shall be just compensation, in accordance with the law of the land. This provision of our Constitution was modelled largely on the Fifth Amendment of the American Constitution, which says, in substance, that no person's private property shall be expropriated except on the basis of proper compensation judicially determined. It is important tolook at the provisions of the National Security (Wheat Acquisition) Regulations - under which this last crop was acquired; and I propose to show that despite those regulations, giving to the wheat-growers a specific basis of compensation, the Crown, in a most reprehensible manner I contend,"" now proposes to say to the growers, "" True, you are entitled to certain compensation on a basis, laid down.in the regulations, but do not intend to pay it to you, because simultaneously we propose to impose a levy of 2s. 2d. a bushel"". In respect of the last crop- I am directing my attention to the last crop-regulatio n 19 providesThe .basis of the compensation to be recommended by the board shall be the rate or rates per bushel arrived at by reference to the surplus proceeds from the disposal of the wheat, but from the compensation determined by the Minister, the board may make deductions on account of any or all of the following . .' _ I now summarize-first , the price-or value of cornsacks; secondly, transport charges; and, thirdly, dockages. It is quite plain, therefore, that what the regulations entitled the wheat-grower to when the last crop was acquired was the full realized value of the crop less those spprifir deduction?. Th.it W*J= a contract made by the Crown in respect of that erop. The Crown now proposes by the - objectionable manoeuvre contained in this bill to escape from that responsibility. Most of this crop has been realized. We know that the export price at present is approximately 10s. a bushel. Therefore, it is relevant to quote what the learned Chief Justice, said in respect of the Australian Apple and Pear Marketing Board when the case which I have mentioned came before the High Court. He was dealing with the argument that had it not been for the fact that some board had the responsibility of marketing apples and pears, the grower, perhaps, would not have been able to market his crop at all, and, consequently, that fact had to be considered when determining fair and just compensation. That argument was rejected by the High Court which said, in effect, that it had not to deal with a hypothetical position, that it knew what this particular quantity of frui t brought in the market, and that was the amonnt of money which the Commonwealth, by law, was compelled to pay. The Chief Justice said It has been argued that the value of the fruit should be determined by taking opinions as to what, in the circumstances of (1) glut in the market (2) the fact that the board might not -""ell the plaintiff's fruit at all, a purchaser - of the fruit would have been prepared to pay for it. In my opinion the court is not remitted to any such speculation in. this case. The defendants cannot say that the fruit is worth less than the amount for which the defendant board actually succeeded in selling it. When there is evidence of the price which goods have actually brought when marketed in an ordinary course it would be contrary to common sense, when determining their value, to ignore this direct evidence and to seek evidence consisting of opinions as to what the goods would, «pon certain hypotheses, be likely to bring when so marketed. What is the result in respect of the 1945-4.6 crop? The result is that under the Wheat Acquisition Regulations, which cannot in any event override the expre-s law of the Constitution, there was an obligation upon the Wheat Board, having acquired this 'wheat, to pay its realized value. In a way which I can only say is morally wrong, if not legally indefensible, the Government proposes now to do indirectly what it 'could not do directly. No honourable member could contend that the Commonwealth is not obliged under the terms of the law as it now stands to pay to the wheat-grower the full realized value of his wheat, less the expenses of marketing. By this bill the Government proposes to escape from that responsibility, and to do indirectly what it could not do directly. It proposes to pay 2s. 2d. a bushel less than the realization value of the wheat after the deduction of marketing expenses has been made. Upon what ground can that be defended ? This is, of course, part and parcel of the' stabilization scheme. But does that fact justify this action? If a levy were made divorced from the stabilization scheme, and it was made retrospective, I venture to say that every honourable member conscious of his responsibility would want to know why it was being made retrospective. And' that question has still to be answered, notwithstanding the fact that it is a part of the total scheme. From this bill one can only draw the inference that a similar contention will be raised as was raised in respect ""of the Wheat Industry Stabilization Bill, namely, that the justification for this extraordinary, and I say, advisedly, reprehensible, action of the Government in expropriating from the wheat-farmer what was his real compensation, is that this proposal was a subject of contract, or .arrangement, between some body who purported to represent all the wheat-growers and the Government. A brief analysis will show how utterly ridiculous is such a suggestion. In the first' place, no one can contract my rights away. Whatever rights I have under the law, no one can contract them away. Even if I am the only one who remains out of a scheme I am entitled to the.?e rights. And in this particular case, unless I am wrongly advised, the body which claimed to represent the wheat-growers",29
103,Mr SCULLY,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,Unde r the honourable member's contention we cannot have a stabilization scheme.,31
104,Mr SPENDER,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"Apparently, the Minister did not listen to my comment upon the Wheat Industry Stabilization Bill. If he did, he' certainly did not answer it. The stabilization scheme should be based on crops prospective, not retrospective. The Government may as well seek to justify going back to the 1941 crop as the 1945 crop, for it cannot in principle justify applying the scheme retrospectively to the one any more than to the other. In principle, they stand upon the same basis. I return now to the only argument that I have heard to justify this proposition. If any other argument can be adduced, I hope that the Minister not hesitate to tell the Parliament and the country. But the only argument which I have heard is that an organizabecause tion representing, it is said, all the growers agreed to this plan on their new scheme. behalf. Must it not be plain that it could not have agreed on behalf of all the wheat-growers, because the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Turnbull) said that the wheat-growers in his elecamount torate have never supported the scheme? Even if the organization did represent the majority of the wheat-growers, could not bind . the minority. But, in any event, this body represents minority - of Australian growers. Therefore, on there can be no justification for the scheme on that ground. When that argument has been disposed of, where does the plan rest? What justification does the Minister say for a retrospective provision enable the Government tract from the pocket of the wheatduced farmer what is in reality his money? The regulations prescribe that when wheat is expropriated or acquired, the grower loses his property completely in much debate. it upon the publication of the notification in the Gazette. That took place in retrick. spect of the 1945-46 crop. His only recourse is a claim for compensation, and that is measurable in a finite financial amount, but it will not be paid to him. Government, for the purpose of "" stabilizthis ing"" the industry-I use the Minister's word, although I do not consider that is stabilization at all-says to the farmer rights. who harvested the last crop, ""You must pay into a fund an amount of 2s. 2d. a bushel on all wheat exported in order stabilize the industry in future"". spective of whether or not the grower remains in the industry during the next five years, he must make that payment. Mr Spender. When we are dealing with matters of principle, we must not disregard the interests of a few people in the community. If a wheat-grower dies this week and his family is compelled to sell the property, what will be the result? An amount of 2s. 2d. a bushel will be taken from that wheat-grower's returns to "" stabilize "" an industry in which he and his heirs no longer have any interest. will That procedure cannot be justified.",31

111,Mr SPENDER,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"Is any honourable to member opposite prepared to defend this Irrebill, oreven attempt to reply to the argument which I have directed to it? The bill is not justified by general phrases about the "" necessity to stabilize the wheat industry "". Every honourable member on this side of the chamber contends that there should be a wheat stabilization scheme, but the gravamen of our criticism of this bill is that it deprives the wheat-farmer of his constitutional rights in respect of his last crop. Of course, the argument can be advanced, "" To have a stabilization scheme, we must start somewhere, so we shall begin when prices are high"". Appparently,-the next.argument is, "" It does not matter, whether you - decide to start from the end of last year - or the year before, or you are breaking the spirit of the law, or whether you are, in reality, extracting money from the wheat-grower's pocket"". I notice that the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Langtry) is in the chamber. I have for the honourable, gentleman almost an affection when he sings those pleasant ballads with which he sometimes regales my ear. But I require from him something more than ballad-singing. I invite honourable members opposite, who represent wheat-growers, to attempt to .justify ibis expropriation. I do not want them to avoid the issue by using general .phrases about stabilization. I do not want them to tell me that some organization contracted on behalf of the-wheat grower when obviously it had no legal right to do so. The ACTING DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Barnard) - Order! Honourable members.will not be permitted to discuss, under this bill, the general principles of stabilization.",32
112,Mr SPENDER,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"I hope not, and I hope that you, sir, are still in the chair when honourable members opposite attempt to justify the bill on those grounds. I invite any honourable member opposite, whorepresents a wheat-growing constituency, to attempt to justify this expror priation of the wheat-grower to the amount of 2s. 2d. a bushel.",33
113,Mr BURKE,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,Does the honourable member say that individual contracts should be made with the growers?,33
114,Mr SPENDER,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"No ; I contend that no organization representing the wheat growers can deprive a-wheat-growe r ofhis legal right. That is my proposition. If the honourable member for Perth (Mr. Burke) believes in the justice of this particular scheme, he can justify the antedating of this bill so as to cover the last three or four harvests. On what ground ? Because, he will say, some organization which pretends to represent all the wheat-growers spoke on their behalf. Let us have no more of the suggestion that any body can speak on behalf of any individual unless that person gives to it the right to do so! I am satisfied that the majority of wheat-growers did not speak through that organization. Even assuming that they did, what right has anyone to deny to the minority, ho matter how small, its legal rights under the Constitution? I rest my. argument, not upon legal grounds only, but also upon high ethical grounds. The ethical grounds are that when a man's property has been taken from him by the Crown, he shall be paid the full measure of its value. The Crown should not, by any manoeuvre^ strategem, seek to avoid that liability. If that proposition is incorrect, then, in the words of the honourable member for Indi (Mr MCEwen), there are no limits to which this vicious procedure can be extended. It could be said that, for the purpose of stabilizing the funds of the Commonwealth to meet claims for compensation made by persons whose property is resumed, there shall be imposed upon all property which is resumed a levy of so much in the £1. There is no difference between one proposition and the other. Therefore, I record my objection to this bill upon the following grounds:-First , it is retrospective; secondly, by its retrospectivity, it extracts from the wheat-grower what was his money, if not at law, then certainly in the intendment of the Constitution; and, thirdly, it cannot'be justified, ;in respect of this crop, as being necessary for the stabilization of the wheat industry.",33
115,Sir EARLE PAGE,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"Cowper) [5.20] This bill provides the machinery by. which the wheat industry stabilization scheme will be implemented. Therefore it is necessary to test the measure in three, specific ways in order to determine whether or not it will meet the requirements of the industry. The first question that should be asked is: "" Will this legislation be retrospective in its action; will it apply to a crop which had been' sown prior to the initiation of the scheme ?"" It is imperative, in fairness to the growers, that the bill should apply only to crops planted after the introduction of the Wheat Industry Stabilization Bill in this Parliament. The second question to be determined is: "" Will that portion of the price which will be allowed to remain in the hands of the farmers, be sufficient to cover the actual costs of production?""",33
116,Mr SPEAK ER,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"Hon. J. S. Rosevear). - That is not in order. I hope that, the right honourable member will not attempt to debate the amount of the price remaining in the hands of the farmers. That is not related to the bill. The only amount dealt with in the bill is the excess price.",34
117,Sir EARLE PAGE,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"I am merely putting the question in an inverse way. Sub-clause 3 of clause 4 expressly states that the amount to remain in the hands of the grower will be 5s. 2d. a ""bushel. It statesSubject to a lower rate being prescribed the regulations, the rate of the charge per bushel on wheat for any season exported by the Board shall be fifty per centum of the amount by which the average price per bushel free on rail at the ports of export for fair average quality bagged wheat of all the wheat of that season exported by the Board, or such lower price as is prescribed, exceeds Five shillings and two pence.",34
118,Mr SPEAKER,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,Order ! That reference to the amount that will remain in the hands of the farmers is only for the purpose of determining what the balance shall be.,34
119,Sir EARLE PAGE,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"That is so. The point I wish to make is that the balance left in the hands of the farmer should be equitable, having regard to the full price.",34
120,Mr SPEAKER,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,I think that the right honourable gentleman misunderstands me. I said that the amount of 5s. 2d. a bushel referred to is merely the amount above which a levy will be struck. The right honourable member may refer only to the levy.,34
121,Sir EARLE PAGE,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"Ver y well, Mr. Speaker. My third question is: ""For what length of time will this charge operate?"" These three questions apply the test that will determine the fairness and, ultimately, the practicability of the scheme. The answers will show whether or not the scheme, will have the desired effects of increasing production and of stabilizing the position of the farmers. Dealing .first with the retrospective effect, I point out that similar legislation introduced by me in this House in 1940 expressly provided that the crop being harvested at that time should not be subject to any stabilization charge. The first crop to be included in that scheme was to be the 1941-42 crop. Sow- ing for that crop started in March or April, .1941, some months after the bill - had been passed by Parliament. By this means, the farmers were given a fair deal. Those who wished to participate in the scheme were able to do so, and those who did not wish to participate were able to refrain from planting wheat. They were given the opportunity to decide the matter for themselves. But this bill is retrospective, and we should consider first the effect that it will have on the farmers themselves. If we are to have successful stabilization of the industry, the farby mers must be able to show a definite profit in the first year of the operations of the scheme. Otherwise they will not continue to participate in it. Let me com-' pare the position of the wheat industry today with its position during World War II . , and even during World War I . In 1914-15, the total value of the wheat crop was over £7,000,000. In 1918-19, the value of the crop was £20,000,000, nearly three times as great as in the first year of that war. In the first year of World War II . , the total amount received by the wheat-farmers was over £31.000,000. In 1944-45, the total was £7,583,000, representing about one-fourth of the value of the crop in the first year of the war. In fact, the returns from wheat in the last three years of World War II . totalled £11,000,000 less than returns in the first three years. Furthermore, costs were rising during the war.",34

The injustice is particularly irksome in view of the fact that the total bill. amount involved is well over £20,000,000. The second point I wish to discuss is whether the amount of 'the total price to be placed in the stabilization sents a fair charge. That is a reasonable question' to ask.

Surely if the wheatis to derive any benefit from the - stabilization scheme the period of its operation must be longer than five years. On that point, this measure completely breaks down.

If the amount to be retained the Commonwealth from the proceeds the sales of wheat is to be considerably greater than we consider should be withdiscuss held, means for disbursing it should be vided.

We have had two wheat bills before us. The first dealt priwith the constitution of the AusI tralian Wheat Board and the acquisition of wheat by it. That bill has been passed. The measure now before us relates to the financial aspects of the scheme, as they involve the imposition of a charge upon wheat for the purpose of constituting the stabilization fund - I comwant to make it clear that I , for one, have no desire to discuss the matter which by was before the House last week. 1 of expressed myself at some length on that bill, and I have no desire to raise or problems on validity which may proarise in connection with that legislation. I . have assumed throughout, as have other honourable 'members, and as the Government apparently has, that the main proposals of .the scheme are legally competent; but certain other questions arise with regard to the measure now before us, and I shall say something fairly carefully about two of them. The first point I shall discuss relates to clause 6, which provides that the act shall continue in operation until a date, not being earlier than the 30th September, 1950, to be fixed by proclamation as the date upon which the act shall cease to be in operation. The honourable member for Indi (Mr MCEwen) referred to this as a provision for a five-year plan, and, no doubt, in substance that is true, but it may be-a plan for more than five years. The bill is designed to enable the act to terminate by proclamation, which, after all, may be issued at any time after the expiration of five years. That seems to me to increase the confusion, because it means that the plan is certainly for five years, and that its duration thereafter will be outside the control of the Parliament, and will depend upon the executive decision of the Government as to whether a proclamation should be issued. So I make that simple qualification upon what the honourable member for Indi said; but in substance he is no doubt right in saying that, insofar as this is a plan for a certain period, it is a plan for five years. What does that involve? As far as we can judge, there is a strong probability that at the end of five years the stabilization fund, which is to be established out of the charge to be made under this bill, will be in credit. It may be very substantially in credit.",36
139,Mr SCULLY,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,It may not be.,37
140,Mr MENZIES,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"Quite so. If prices have a disastrous downward move in the next fewyears, the fund may need to be replenished from Consolidated Revenue; but, so far as we can judge from probabilities, it seems that at the end of five years the fund will be in credit, and that the credit will consist of a charge levied upon the growers in respect of wheat. What is to happen at the end of that time? Let us assume for this purpose, as the honourable member for Indi wisely did, that at the end of that time there will be a large credit balance in the stabilization fund. What is to be done with it is not being settled.",37
141,Mr SCULLY,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,Why .should there be a large credit balance?,37
142,Mr MENZIES,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,I did not say there should' be; I said there well might be. The Minister will agree with me thatj if the world parity price of wheat remained high for the next few years,37
143,Mr SCULLY,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,That would be all the more reason why there should not be a large credit balance.,37
144,Mr MENZIES,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"That would be a very good reason why there should be. If the world price remained high, the levy made upon the growers would have built up the stabilization fund to the amount, maybe, of a good many millions of pounds.",37
145,Mr SCULLY,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"Why apply the levy, if the price remains high ?",37
146,Mr MENZIES,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"I , speak subject to correction, but I thought that the whole essence of the idea was that when the world price was good there was to be a levy, so that the fund might be put in credit, and when the world price-was low those credits might be used to stabilize the.price at its guaranteed level.",37
147,Mr MCEWEN,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,If that is not intended;what is ?,37
148,Mr MENZIES,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"If the Government does not intend that, I give the matter up. I ask the Minister to assume-and I am surprised that he is not willing to assume it-that over the period of five years the credits will exceed the disbursements from this fund. What is to be done with the credits at the end of five years? That is a point upon which the House would have appreciated some information, but there is nothing in the bill to enlighten us upon it. There will simply be a fund which can be dealt with at the end of five years by the Parliament, according to the then constitution of the Parliament, and according to the views of the then majority of the Parliament as to how such funds should be treated. That seems to me, as it seemed to the honourable member for Indi, a most powerful argument for extending the term of this scheme to ten years. Over that period we are much more likely to have those fluctuations of world prices that will give effect to this fund as a stabilization fund, so that there will be payments out as well as payments in : The honourable member for Hume (Mr. Puller) makes some remark not entirely audible to me. I wonder whether, in his heart, he would prefer a ten-year scheme. I think he would.",37
149,Mr SCULLY,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,This is a continuous scheme.,38
150,Mr MENZIES,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"Yes , but how long is it to continue? Will-it continue for five years, and then exist on sufferance, as under this bill? No remark has been made even by interjection, which would afford the slightest justification for this limitation to five years. I admit that - everything one says on the bill must said subject to correction.",38
151,Mr SCULLY,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,It is a guarantee of definite price for five years.,38
152,Mr MENZIES,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"My genial friend, the Minister, unfortunately, was in uncommonly taciturn mood on the day that he brought down this bill. He producedit. There was a slight pause, and I was waiting for his speech, but the speech did not come. Therefore, had to rise and move that the debate be adjourned-whic h was one of the few humorous touches. of the day, because how it was possible to adjourn a debate that had not begun I do not know. ever, the Minister will, no doubt, enfuture lighten us when he replies. The second point is in relation to inclusion'of the 1945-46 harvest, and this arises in the express terms of clause of the bill, which providesA charge is imposed and shall be levied and paid on all wheat harvested on or the first day of October, 1945, and exported from the Commonwealth . . . Thus, the bill itself expressly provides that the chai'ge is to be levied in the first instance on the wheat of the last harvest. E have already had an opportunity, when addressing myself to the Wheat Stabilizato tion Bill, to offer my general observations on that point, and I do not want engage in tedious repetition.",38
153,Mr SCULLY,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,I wish the right honour the able gentleman's colleagues were equally as considerate!,38
154,Mr MENZIES,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"At any rate, so far as this bill is concerned, my friend the Minister cannot be accused of engaging in repetition. So far, he has said practically nothing at all. There are some matters which deserve to be made particularly clear regarding the 1945-46 harvest. Reference has been made to the problem of .acquiring property on general terms. The honourable member for Warringah. (Mr Spender) dealt with a point similar to the one which I discussed in my second-reading speech on the other bill. Under the Wheat Acquisition Regulations, the 1945-46 harvest has already been acquired, and rights have already come into existence in relation to it . If ""-those rights came into existence merely because of the .Wheat Acquisition Regube lations, the position might have been different, but they came into existence a under the Constitution. They were, in fact, created by the Constitution, and are not to be taken away by the Parliament. The Parliament is the servant of the an people, and the creation of the Constitution. The Constitution gives power merely to this Parliament to make laws for the acquisition of property, on just terms, from any State or person, I for any purpose in respect to which the Parliament has power to make laws. It must be made clear that, when we discuss the rights of the wheat-farmer in relation to the 1945-46 harvest, it is. Hownot a matter of how he fits into some legislative scheme, but of whether it is right for the Parliament, in July of the 1946, to seek to take away from the farmer rights ih respect of the past which 4 were given him by the Constitution itself. If there is an answer to that point-as there may be for all I knowafter then it is an answer that we have not yet heard. The charge imposed by the bill is a charge in relation to the wheat harvest, and, therefore, in practical effect, it is a charge on the grower. If the calculation that has been made is correct, and the charge this year will amount 2s. 2d. a bushel, then the effect of what will be done is to take away from the to grower of the 1945-46 crop 2s. 2d. a bushel of the amount which would represent just terms under the Constitution for acquisition of his wheat. If we assume a price of x shillings as the price that could have been realized for the wheat, then x shillings represents just terms of acquisition, and x shillings, minus 2s. 2d., cannot be a just price.",38
155,Mr SCULLY,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,Would that not also apply to subsequent crops?,39
156,Mr MENZIES,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"The Minister has accepted on behalf of the Government responsibility for the view that this scheme will be legally valid. I have no doubt that if I could see into the minds of his legal advisers I should find them arguing that whatever may be the position regarding the acquisition of property, taken by itself, there is a power to establish some kind of pooling system for .the future, and that if this power is exercised to provide for the stabilization of prices, then you may escape from the terms of section 31 of the Constitution. I do not want to go into that, because it would lead to an extraordinarily complex, difficult and recondite legal argument.",39
157,Mr SCULLY,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,I was hoping that the right honourable gentleman would eluciThe date the point.,39
158,Mr MENZIES,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"I am merely making. a guess at what has probably been going on in the minds of the Government's legal advisers. I point out, however, that there is a world of difference between legislating in respect of future crops, attempting to say to a man, whose rights are not in the future but have already accrued-right s given to him by the stitution-that you propose retrospecgrowers, tively to modify his rights.",39
159,Mr LAZZARINI,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,The right honourable gentleman will get a brief for the case all right.,39
160,Mr MENZIES,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"For years past I have been so busy watching this Governin Sydney:ment that I have almost forgotten what a brief looks like, but I am happy to 3ay that I retain a few general notions reto garding the subject with which I once Had a fairly close acquaintance. Thus I question the Government's growers' scheme on two grounds: first, the durapresent tion of the scheme; and, secondly, the proposal to go back on the past and taku away rights which the supreme organic law has given. Both proposals are defensible, and certainly have not been defended at any stage of the debate.",39
161,Unknown,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m.,39
162,Mr TURNBULL,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"Wimmera) [8.0] I support the amendment, because I believe that the Government has not taken into account fully the wishes of the wheat growers. Statements that have been made in support of what the Government alleges to be the desires of the growers are unsound. A postponement of this measure for six months would give to the Government, and particularly to the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture (Mr Scully), time to re-examine the matter thoroughly, and would facilitate the automatic exclusion of the 1945-46 wheat crop from .the provisions of this legislation. That action would be hailed with pleasure by the wheat-growers generally. At a meeting held in Perth in April of this year, the Australian Wheat Growers Federation carried a resolution including the following:That the federation request that the 1945-46 harvest be not included in the plan as it had been acquired under National Security (Wartime) Regulations. Minister for Commerce and Agriculture has said that at a later date he met representatives of the wheat industry in Sydney, and that they informed him that growers had changed their minds about this matter. The honourable gentleman said, in effect, that the growers were and quite happy about the Government's proposal to include the 1945-46 crop. I am sure that the Minister has not gauged Conaccurately the opinion of most wheatand for that reason, I suggest a postponement of this measure in order that the Government may devote more time to a consideration of the views of those engaged in the industry. A publication that I have before me contains the following report relative to the meeting The federation reached its decision in regard stabilization in Perth.last April. It was not proposed to alter that in any way. It was never even suggested. The meeting was convened by the chairman of the federation, Mr E. Walker, of the Western Australian WheatUnion, to meet the Minister and the Perth decisions on wheat stabilization to the Minister in person. That was-the intention, and there was no other intention. It was realized that, although the Minisinter was an energetic man and had travelled extensively, he could not be everywhere. He had not attended the important meeting of wheat-growers in Perth in April, and as he continued to press for the inclusion of the 1945-46 harvest in the Government's plans, representatives of the industry naturally thought the best thing to do was to meet the Minister and draw his attention to the resolution carried at the Perth conference.",39
163,Mr SCULLY,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,Fro m what publication was the honourable member quoting?,40
164,Mr TURNBULL,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"Fro m the Land, dated the 12th July of this year. The report also statesThe policy of the federation has not changed. Let that sink in! The report continues The federation stands where it stood before we met the Minister. There has been no alteration and there can be no - retreat. When you hear that the Australian Wheat Growers Federation has approved of the Government's proposals-and you will hear that-smil e a sad and forgiving smile. It is untrue. My regard for the Minister is of the very highest order, but my opinion of his wheat stabilization plan is not so flattering.",40
165,Mr SCULLY,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"In fact, it is just the reverse.",40
166,Mr TURNBULL,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"Exactly. ""We must have an opportunity to look further into this matter. It is of paramount importance, not only to wheat-growers, but' also to .the whole of Australia that the 1945-46 wheat crop be excluded from the scheme. It has heen'said-and I know it to be true-that never before has such a small sum of money meant so much to the wheat-growers of this country. After years of drought Mr SPEAKER,-Order ! The honourable member' may only advance reasons for the postponement of the bill.",40
167,Mr TURNBULL,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,I submit that a postponement is desirable in order that the Government may have time to reconsider its decision to include the 1945-46 crop in this scheme. The exclusion of that crop is of vital importance to the continuance of wheat-growing as Australia's No. 2 primary industry.,40
168,Mr SPEAKER,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"Order ! That may have been a very fine argument on the motion for the second reading of the bill, but it cannot be used when speaking to the amendment ",40
169,Mr SPENDER,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,I rise to order.,40
170,Mr SPEAKER,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,Order ! The honourable member cannot take a point of order on this matter. I have ruled that it is not admissible.,40
171,Mr SPENDER,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"May I seek your ruling ' upon another matter ? This measure seeks to impose a charge upon all wheat exported from Australia harvested on or after the 1st October, 1945. Is it not pertinent to argue that there are reasons why that particular harvest should not be included in the plan?",40
172,Mr SPEAKER,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"That is not the question upon which I ruled. I regret that the honourable member has not taken a closer interest in the proceedings. The question of the inclusion of 1945-46 crop could be debated upon the motion for the. second reading of the bill. The honourable member for Wimmera is now speaking for the second time. He has already spoken to the motion and, therefore, he may now speak only to the amendment, which is that the bill be postponed for six months. He may give reasons in support of the amendment, but may not discuss the original motion.",40
173,Mr TURNBULL,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"I thank you for your ruling, Mr Speaker. I am most anxious to give my reasons why the bill should be postponed for six months. One reason is that many wheat-growers have incurred liabilities with country storekeepers and others and have given undertakings that they would meet their obligations out of the proceeds of the 194546 crop. They entered into commitments believing that they would - receive payment in full for that crop. If the amendment be agreed to, the Minister will have time to reflect, in which event he may decide to exclude the 1945-46 crop from the scheme. He will ' agree, I am sure, that persons who' enter into financial obligations, honestly believing that funds will be available to enable them to meet their commitments, should not he denied access to those funds by retrospective - legislation. Wheat growers are men of vision, and, even before they fallowed the land to be sown for the 1945-46 harvest, they realized that they must finance their activities. The postponement of this measure will provide an opportunity for the Government to consider the reasonableness of the wheat-growers' content-ion that the money that they so badly need to meet their obligations should not be taken from them and also the necessity to maintain the economic structure of Australia on a sound basis. The money that will be available to wheat-growers from the 194546 crop will be inadequate to meet their needs.",40
174,Mr SPEAKER,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,Order ! That is an indifferent argument.,41
175,Mr TURNBULL,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"Anothe r reason why a postponement is desirable is that some wheat-growers who hold temporary permits to grow wheat may be placed in an awkward position unless the Government reconsiders its policy. ""What is to become of the money which a wheat grower who has a temporary permit to grow wheat for, say, two or three years will have contributed to the fund if his licence is revoked.",41
176,Mr SPEAKER,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"Order ! The honourable member knows the limits within which he must confine his remarks. He may not .make another second-reading speech, but he may advance arguments to show why the bill should be postponed for six. months.",41
177,Mr TURNBULL,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"I am strongly of the opinion that the bill should be postponed for that period to enable the Government to review the situation. The Minister, may have seen in the Sydney Morning Herald a report of threatened legal action by wheat-growers. I do not think that the Government desires litigation and therefore a further opportunity to consider the implications of this legislation is most desirable. In the Sydney Morning Herald of - the 20th July last, under the heading "" Wheat Men take Legal Action; Forbes move against Stabilization Plan"", the following appeared:The Forbes Wheat Defence Committee has decided to take legal action to restrain the Federal Government from including the 19454G wheat crop in its stabilization plan. The committee announced its decision meeting at Forbes yesterday. Its action followed the announcement on Thursday by the general president of the Farmers and Settlers Association, Mr Hugh S. Robertson, that the association had decided to seek legal opinion on the validity of the Government's plan for the 1945-46 crop. v."", C104] In order to prevent a legal battle between wheat-growers and the Government, a postponement of this bill is desirable, particularly as the Government claims that its purpose in introducing the measure is to confer a benefit on wheat growers. On this occasion I would vary the old adage, "" Hope deferred maketh the heart sick "", and say that "" The bill deferred will - make the wheat-grower's heart glad "".",41
178,Mr ANTHONY,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"Richmond) [8.16] I support the amendment that consideration of this measure be postponed for a sufficient period to enable the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture (Mr. Scully) „to give further consideration to his proposal. During the debate on this bill arguments which we have heard on many occasions recently have been emphasized, - but, unfortunately, they seem to have made little impression on the Minister. He seems determined to get his hands on the proceeds of the 1945-46 wheat crop. In other words, the Minister seems determined to take from the wheat growers who harvested wheat in the 194546 season at least. £7,000,000, which should go into their banking accounts. The bill before us purports to be one for the stabilization of the wheat industry, but it is rather a measure providing for acquisition under a scheme which requires wheat-growers to contribute, from their own pockets, money to protect themselves. That could be done without any aid from the Government. Nothing has been said by the Minister, or any supporter of the bill, to justify the proposal that 50 per cent, of the amount received for wheat in excess of 5s. 2d. a bushel shall be paid into a stabilization fund. The only justification for the Government's proposal which the Minister has advanced is that as the price of wheat is now high this is a good time to establish such a fund. The Minister seems to have forgotten the difficult times which wheat growers have experienced during recent years. Every person who has any knowat a ledge of primary production knows that life on the land, whether as a wheat grower, a dairy-farmer, or a grower of sugar-cane or bananas, means that losses and profits over a number of years must be averaged in order to arrive at the true . position. For several years wheat-growers have had poor results; the 1945-46 crop was the first chance they had to recoup losses made during previous years. The Government would have the wheat- , ducers. growers believe that it has brought down this measure in the generosity of its heart to assist them. The bill, however, seeks to take from their pockets moneys parison. which some of them will never sec again, and thus it constitutes the gravest injustice that could be inflicted upon them. I regret that the Minister Commerce and Agriculture had the wheat. temerity to place such a proposition before this Parliament without first giving consideration to the criticisms levelled against it during the discussion of the about £7,000,000. parent bill. Not one defence has been raised by the Minister against the charge levelled by honourable members on this side of the House that the Government proposes by this measure to perpetrate ""steal"" of £7,000,000 from the pockets other industries. of the wheat-growersin respect of the 1945-46 harvest. This proposal will take away from a wheat-grower of 3,000 the bill. bushels of wheat an amount pf approximately £300 which otherwise would have gone into his banking account this year. used as a guide. Offhand that.may not seem a very large sum, but it means a lot to the grower who has experienced bad seasons. Honourable members will recall that during the not be discussed. 1944-45 harvest many Victorian farmers were not able to recover the cost of seed used in the planting of their crops. those unfortunate people a levy of from £100 to £300 would represent a substanjustice tial loss. The sec'cnd main objection to the bill is that it makes no provision for the wheat-grower - who leaves the industry before the termination of the scheme.",41
179,Mr MCEWEN,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,Such a farmer has. been given no thought in this measure..,42
180,Mr ANTHONY,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"I agree. The plan submitted by the Minister is based on mistaken belief that a wheat-grower will always remain in the industry. If howindustry ever through sickness, accident or death, or for some other cause a wheat-farmer abandons wheat-growing, he will be deprived of all moneys which he to had contributed to the pool. How can the Minister defend such an injustice this? I have in mind other schemes primary producers",42

183,Mr ANTHONY,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,I understand that the purpose of the bill is to filch from the wheat-growers of Australia this year The wheat-growers themselves clearly understand its effect. I was merely endeavouring to draw a parallel between what is proposed in this a bill and what has been done in respect of,42

185,Mr ANTHONY,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,I submit that the experience of other industries may be,42
186,Mr SPEAKER,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,The honourable member is aware that that subject may,42
187,Mr ANTHONY,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"I bow to your ruling, Mr Speaker, even though it deprives To me of the opportunity to put my case properly. The Minister could still do to those who will contribute to the wheat stabilization fund by constituting that fund on what I might describe as a revolving basis, whereby those who pay into it but who, subsequently, for some reason or other, leave the industry, will be given an opportunity to withdraw their equity from the fund. Provision should be made for their names to be registered and the amounts of money the credited to the fund on their behalf to be recorded so that when they leave the they may be paid what is their just due. I could name industries in which that has been done very successfully. The Minister should be prepared agree to the temporary postponement of the bill in order that schemes such as as that may be examined. Probably, howfor ever, the honourable genfeman has not even heard of such proposals. I remind him that in a period of five years there may be a great drift from the wheat industry, as there may be from other industries and occupations. Every honourable member knows that during the period of three years that elapses between the holding of general elections for this Parliament there are great changes in the number and occupations of the people on the electoral rolls. In some electorates these changes represent 30 per cent, of the number of people on the roll. It may be said that within a period of three years the changes in the number and occupations of persons on the electoral rolls would average 20 per cent. That represents the normal turnover of people changing from one town to another, fro'm one electorate to another, or from one occupation to another. I agree that in the wheat industry the movement may be lower than the average in other industries because a wheat-grower, having his own home on his property, is more stabilized in his occupation than are most members of the community. Nevertheless, there is a constant turnover in the wheat industry itself, and it is in respect of those wheat-growers who will not remain in the industry that the Opposition is most concerned. I support my colleagues in their efforts to safeguard the interests of such people.",42
188,Mr SPENDER,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"The honourable member may include me among, his colleagues on this matter.",43
189,Mr ANTHONY,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"I include the honourable member, as-1 also do the honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie 1 Cameron) and, of course, the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr. Hughes) who also has given us his counsel and advice in this important matter.",43
190,Mr MCEWEN,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"Apar t from the Minister, not a single Labour supporter has spoken in favour of the bill.",43
191,Mr ANTHONY,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"That is so. Even the honourable member for Hume (Mr Fuller) who is usually most vociferous in his advocacy of the Government's proposals has remained strangely silent. The honourable gentleman is apparently afraid to commit himself. Thus we have the spectacle of the Government' benches being packed with silent supporters of the Government, not one of whom has been courageous enough to attempt to justify this "" filch "" of £7.000,000 of the wheat-growers' money this year. However, honourable members on this side of the House, though they lack numerical strength, refuse to remain silent in face of the injustice which the Government proposes to perpetrate on the wheat growers.",43
192,Mr BREEN,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"Calare) [8.30] - I knew thati f the members of the Australian Country party were given enough rope they would hang themselves. The honourable member for Richmond (Mr. Anthony) expressed concern as towhat would happen to money in the Wheat Industry Stabilization Fund in the event of the winding up of the stabilization scheme. I remind him and his colleagues that section 6 of the Wheat Industry Assistance Act 1938 providedThere shall he kept in the fund an account to be known as the Wheat Tax Account to which shall be credited out of the receipts of the fund all moneys collected under the Flour Tax (Wheat Industry Assistance! Assessment Act 1938, on wheat exported from Australia or upon wheat produced and sold in Australia. That tax is similar to the tax provided for in this legislation.",43
193,Mr SPEAKER,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,Order ! The honourable member had better deal with this tax.,43
194,Mr BREEN,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"The protestations of the honourable member for Richmond about a "" steal"" by this Government in imposing a charge on wheat exported from Australia and then allocating the proceeds for certain purposes are baseless, becaure the proposal in this legislation is on all-fours with the-legislation of 1938, which was passed when the honourable gentleman was a Minister. This bill provides that excess money in the fund shall finally be refunded to the wheat-growers who provide - it. This legislation is more ethical than was the 1938 legislation,- because the money raised under it was distributed to distressed wheat-farmers, who may not have paid one penny into the fund. What honourable gentlemen opposite do when in power is frowned upon by them when in opposition.",43

199,Mr SCULLY,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"Gwydir-Minister for Commerce and Agriculture) [8.35] - in reply- I intend to be brief. I may not have spoken at all but for the tedious repetition and misrepresentation of honourable gentlemen opposite. Only the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies) and the honourable member for Barker (Mr. Archie Cameron) debated the bill fairly. As a layman, I am not prepared to enter a legal argument with such a renowned, lawyer as is the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Spender), the great wheat-grower who is so. interested in this bill, but when I asked a question of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies), who is as competent as is the honourable member for Warringah ,to give legal advice, he failed to verify the contentions "" of the honourable member for Warringah. Honourable members opposite would have the people believe that this legislation applies only to the 1945-46 pool and not to any subsequent pool. That is not so. National security regulations identical with this legislation were made by the Menzies Government, of which honourable members opposite were all members or supporters.",44
200,Mr TTIRNBULL,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,Not all.,44
201,Mr SCULLY,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"I except the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Turnbull), whom I congratulate on not having been associated with the Australian Country party in this Parliament at that time. Later those regulations werereplaced by legislation. A 50 per cent, levy was imposed. There was no question then of just compensation to the persons from whom the wheat was acquired. The argument about just'terms has been raised now merely to delay the passage of the bill. The tedious repetition that has characterized the stone-walling of honourable gentlemen opposite shows that the aim of the Opposition is, at. all costs, to prevent this bill from becoming law. Opposition supporters have harped on the fact that. I did not deliver a second reading speech on this bill, but they know, as the general community knows, that my second-reading speech on the Wheat Industry Stabilization Bill covered this bill, too. Moreover,, the Leader of the Opposition acquiesced in leave being given - to introduce this bill before the debate on the second reading of the other bill was resumed after I had made my second reading speech. Over and over again,, honourable members opposite have referred to the equity in the"" wheat industry stabilization fund that might be created by the individual contributions of farmers. Both this measure and the Wheat Industry Stabilization Bill were discussed at the last meeting of the Australian Agricultural Council. At that' meeting the measure was debated clause by clause and accepted as drafted. Unless the States pass the complementary legislation we shall not be able to implement this stabilization scheme.",44
202,Mr SPENDER,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"I rise to order. The Minister has referred to the necessity of the States passing complementary legislation. In view of the ruling you gave earlier, Mr Speaker, that honourable members could not discuss the Wheat Industry Stabilization Bill, I ask whether the Minister is in order in debating that bill.",44
203,Mr SPEAKER,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"It is competent for the Minister to refer to what took place and to show the necessity for the States to pass complementary, legislation. He is in order, in replying to speeches made during this debate, in showing that, despite the fact that some honourable members have mentioned the names of people opposed to the scheme, the Australian Agricultural Council agreed to this legislation. The Minister would be doing leas than justice to this legislation if he failed to do that.",44
204,Mr SCULLY,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"Honourable members opposite contend that the scheme should operate for a period of ten years. The Australian Agricultural Council agreed that the plan should be a continuingplan, but the council specifically fixed a period of five years as a first period in respect of which the guaranteed price of 5s. 2d. a bushel should apply. However, I gave a definite undertaking to the council that the States would be called together three years hence in order to discuss the continuance of the plan. That aspect is fully covered in the agreement with the States. Honourable members opposite have contended that the equity of individual growers in the pool is not safeguarded. Any grower who is subjected to a levy will have some equity for a time at least, but his equity will be determined by the price at which wheat is sold subsequently. For instance, the price of wheat might decline in the second year,' rendering it necessary to absorb the surplus at the end of the first year in order to build up. the price to the guaranteed price of 5s. 2d. a busheL"" Then, in subsequent years the Commonwealth would guarantee that price. That is a specific provision in the agreement between the Commonwealth, the States and the growers. I stated definitely at the last meeting of the Australian Agricultural Council that all individual growers who had paid the levy would have an equity in any surplus that might exist at the end of the first five-year period; and I declared without hesitation that at the end of that period any surplus should be distributed amongst growers who had an equity in the pool.",44
205,Mr ANTHONY,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,How can such a distribution be effected if a record of the names of growers is not kept ?,45
206,Mr SCULLY,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"The honourable member knows that it has been the practice to keep a record of the names of growers in respect of pools. But I remind him that governments which he supported did not make such provision under legislation which they enacted dealing with the wheat industry. The attitude of honourable members opposite shows clearly to the wheat-growers that the Opposition is, doing its best to destroy this scheme. Honourable members opposite are making every effort to persuade the wheat growers to bring pressure upon the States to refuse to pass the complementary legislation without which no Commonwealth-wide wheat stabilization plan can be implemented. The arrant humbug of the members of the Australian Country party in this matter has been clearly demonstrated in this debate; but I believe that wheat-growers from one end of the Commonwealth to the other realise that fact and will deal with the members of that party in no uncertain manner at their first opportunity. Amendment negatived. .Original question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In committee: Clause 1 agreed to. Clause 2This Act shall come into operation on the day on which it receives the Royal Assent; Dir. ARCHIE CAMERON (Barker) [8.48] - I m o v e That the following new sub-clause be added:"" (2.) This Act shall not he submitted for the Royal Assen until it has been approved by a majority of registered wheat-growers at a postal ballot."" I move the amendment for various reasons. We have been told that this legislation is the outcome of an agreement between the Commonwealth and the States. The Australian Agricultural Council cannot bind either the Commonwealth or State parliaments. All that the members of the council can do is to bind their respective governments. Each of those governments must submit complementary legislation to their respective parliaments, and in due course those parliaments will pass, or amend, the legislation drafted by the council. It would be much easier for us to debate the measure if we were favoured by the Government with a sight of the proposed State legislation because we could then see the scheme in its entirety. Thus, we now have: First, the Wheat Industry Stabilization Bill which we passed under great difficulty; secondly, this measure which is experiencing a stormy passage; and, thirdly, legislation which is still in the realm of darkness. The second point I make is that the Minister has stressed time and again that this legislation is the result of an agreement between himself as Minister for Commerce and ' Agriculture and the Australia Wheat Growers Federation. With very great respect to that .body, I do not think that it can commit all of the wheat-growers of Australia to this scheme. excellent reasons for believing that it does not speak, and never has spoken, for a majority of the wheat-growers. As proof of my contention, I desire to read extracts from a publication entitled Wheat Farms of Victoria. This is a sociological survey made in 1946 at the Melbourne University by Alan J. Holt, partly at the expense of the Commonwealth Government.' A fte r Having made a survey of the Wimmera and Bendigo districts and the north-west of Victoria, Mr Holt wrote- . Victorian Wheat and Wool Growers Association - Forty-si x per cent, of wheat farmers were financial members of this organization. For 4 per cent, members it was their only social organization. Several of the interviewees held' executive positions; one was president of the local branch and three others secretaries of local branches. In addition there were four at least who had been members but were unfinancial at the time of visit. Members were ""all confined to groups of medium and low production rating, and comprised a higher proportion of Mallee than Wimmera farmers. Tenants and sharefarmers were members as well as owners, but managers were not. It is said that the association owes its origin to the Country party organization when in 1028-29 during an internal disruption, a group attempted to form a wheat-growers' wing as distinct from rural township members. A committee was formed, but after a brief existence recommended that the wheat growers' section be formed outside the political movement as an "" industrial "" or "" economic "" organization. Small wool-growers were brought in during the last few years: in any case, many wheat-farmers are small wool growers as well. While it is still a separate organization, it has a similar membership. All interviewees who were Country party members are also members of the Victorian Wheat and Wool Growers Association. Many interviewees of other political opinions than Country party exp'ressed the opinion that they would be niembers of the association had it not been for the apparent close' connection between the Country party and the association. The association is stronger in the Mallee, where many rural branches have been formed. Wimmera branches are almost all confined to country towns. This may be in name only, however, and may be due also to the fact that the towns are closer together in the Wimmera than in the Mallee. Dealing with the political set-up, because that must be taken into consideration, Mr Holt statedUnited Country Party - This political party plays a very important part in the life of the Mr Archie Cameron. wheat areas. At least 23 per cent, of the I have farmers interviewed are active members of the party. Only 4 per cent, are recorded as members of the Labour party and 0 per cent, of the United Australia party (commonly regarded as the conservative party, and since reconstituted as the Liberal party). 1 he balance did not belong to any political organization. I submitted my amendment because I desire very clearly to 'convey to the Minister my firm belief that no organization in Australia speaks for the whole of the wheat-growers. The Australian Wheat Growers Federation speaks for some farmers, but in South Australia, there ""is .in addition to that organization the Grain Growers Association and the two organizations have certain differences of opinion. I firmly believe that the only way in which to obtain the views of the farmers regarding this stabilization scheme is to conduct a postal ballot ,and allow the wheat-growers who are interested enough to return their papers, to decide whether they desire this legislation. That is the democratic approach. The situation now is entirely different from what it was at the outbreak of the war. At that time, I would never have advocated the course that I am recommending now, because, quite clearly, the Government then was seizing or commandeering all the wheat and other primary products for war purposes. What the growers thought of that act did not enter into consideration, just as the views of workmen were not considered when the Labour Government decided to conscript them for war service.. Conditions now are entirely different from what they were in 1939. Now, we are endeavouring to legislate for peace-time conditions, and, therefore, we are under an obligation to ensure that the people who have most to lose and most to gain from this scheme shall be properly protected. It is without precedent that a government should levy a charge on wheat under the conditions which the Minister' proposes, although the principle is the same as that which the righ t honourable member for Cowper (Sir Earle Page) incorporated in legislation in 1941. Wheat prices then were so low compared with prices ruling today that the two situations cannot otherwise be compared. The contribution which wheat-growers will be required to make under this bill will be more than one-half of the total value of.the wheat at the time the right honourable member for Cowper introduced the bill in 1941. In my judgment, the only satisfactory approach is to allow the wheat-growers to express their opinion regarding the proposal. If a majority of them favour the scheme, I shall have nothing further to say about it. But until the growers have expressed their views, I cannot accept the decision of a meeting of two or three men from each State who claimed, for example, that the whole of the wheat-growers of South Australia are in favour of this scheme. I do not believe, at this stage, that such aclaim was correct.",45
207,Mr BREEN,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"Calare) [8.55] - The honourable member for Barker (Mr. Archie Cameron) made a point which is overlooked by the contending factions in this game of "" political wheat football"". Whilst the wheat-growers of' Australia, and the farming community generally, aim at organization on the lines o:f the trade union .movement they have not yet advanced to the position that the trade union movement reached at the - beginning of this century. The group of farmers' organizations, such as the Farmers and Settlers Association of New South Wales, the Australian Wheat Growers Federation, the Wheat Growers Union and the Settlers Association of Queensland make extravagant claims that they speak on behalf of all the growers of a particular product. The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture (Mr. Scully) is then placed in a very invidious position in trying to obtain agreement among all the growers' organizations. As the honourable member for Barker pointed out, some of those organizations have political affiliations, either written or unwritten. On a contentious subject like the stabilization of wheat, particularly on the eve of an election, politics are introduced and the welfare of the producer 1 tends to be overlooked. In my electorate, a clear division is approaching between farmers, not on the value of the stabilization scheme, but on whether the Australian Labour party is serving the best interests of the growers. That conditionof affairs is unfortunate because the growers are not sufficiently organized industrially to be able to risk a failure of their scheme of industrial organization by throwing it into the ring in'a political brawl. The farmers will come off worse. Throughout history, the food producers have been at the mercy of speculators who, recognizing that people must have food, used great pressure to corner food, and then demand a price which they fix instead of allowing the law of supply and demand or the needs of the situation to determine it. In my opinion, the Minister acted wisely in requesting the Australian Agricultural Council to discuss wheat stabilization. The State Ministers for Agriculture and their staffs have a profound knowledge of our agricultural economy. They appre-. ciate just how far the scheme is practicable and the extent to which the finances of the Commonwealth and the States are able to support a scheme that depends for its revenue upon export values. When the Labour party was in opposition, we criticized the government of the day for not paying what we considered to be adequate prices for wheat or wool. Now, honourable members opposite are in the role of critics of the Government. According to reliable estimates, 20,000,000 people ih the world will die of starvation. In other countries, there is sufficient food to feed them. The problem is lack of means of distribution. Those facts should make honourable members think deeply about the subject of food, instead of introducing politics into a subject that means life or death to so many people.",47
208,Sir EARLE PAGE,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"Cowper) [8.59] The honourable member for Calare (Mr. Breen) has driven home the point which honourable members on this side of the chamber have been impressing upon the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture (Mr Scully). The honourable member stated that we should disregard politics and discuss the means to stimulate wheat growing. What is more likely to stimulate the production of wheat-the payment to growers of the export price of 9s. 7£d. a bushel, or the payment of the stabilized price of 5s. 2d. a bushel? .The question answers itself. Therefore, I cannot understand the inability of honourable members who speak in that fashion to compel the Minister to use common sense. The additional income which the growers of the 1945-46 crop would receive - if that crop were excluded from the sta1 bilization scheme .would enable them to recover much of what they had lost during - the last three years of drought. Under ^the taxation law, any losses incurred can be offset against subsequent profitsi; sequently, they would not have to pay tax on a good deal of this additional income, because, undeniably, they have had severe"" losses. They could utilize the money in the improvement of their properties and the repair of their machinery. Therefore, the proposition of the honourable member for Barker that they shall be given an opportunity to express their opinion is a sound one. If the Minister will not submit the whole matter to them, he should at least ask them whether or not they are willing that the 1945-46. harvest shall be included in the stabilization scheme. I am wholly in favour of stabilization. The present scheme, in general outline, follows the scheme that I submitted to the Parliament in 1940; but my proposal differed from this in that it deliberately excluded the wheat harvest which, at the time, was being delivered by the growers, and provided that only future harvests should be embraced in it. Any grower who did not wish to be bound by the scheme could refuse to grow wheat. I beg the Government to treat this matter on a non-party basis. Surely, if the farmers themselves were asked to decide whether or not the 1945-46 crop should be included in the scheme political considerations would be excluded! Who is introducing such considerations? Surely the Government is, by resisting all attempts to enable the growers, who own. the wheat and are entitled to the proceeds from the sale of it, to decide what procedure shall be followed.",47
209,Mr MCEWEN,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"Indi) [9.3] - I join with the right honourable member for Cowper (Sir Earle Page) in congratulating the honourable member for Calare (Mr Breen). That he is the only Labour representative of a wheat-growing electorate who has chosen to speak, makes his contribution to the debate the more notable.",48
210,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,'Order ! What is don« by honourable members on the - Government side of the chamber has nothing to do with the amendment.,48
211,Mr MCEWEN,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"Thei r vote will havu a great deal of bearing on it. I should have thought that on such an issue the representative of Hume (Mr Fuller) would hold an opinion, because it will conaffect many of the growers in his electorate.",48
212,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,Order! The Chair has ruled that the honourable member. must discuss the amendment.,48
213,Mr MCEWEN,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"The amendment is concerned with the question whether all wheat-growers are to be deprived of what they reasonably anticipated would be their complete returns from the last harvest. There are wheat-growers in the electorates of Riverina and Wannon who might have expected their representatives to have an opinion on the matter. The honourable member for Calare has pointed out that the farming community as a whole is not so well organized industrially as are trade unionists. It appeared to me that he is moving towards the conclusion that their organizations are not yet competent to be consulted by the Government - That, of course, is beyond doubt. The honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) has mentioned a book recently produced by the University of Melbourne, with the assistance of the Department of Post-war Reconstruction, in which it is stated that in Victoria, one of the highly organized wheat-growing States, fewer than 50 per cent, of the wheat-growers are members of a wheat-growing organization. What the percentage is in the electorates of the honourable members for Forrest (Mr. Lemmon) and Swan (Mr Mountjoy), who have not spoken on this measure) I do not know, but probably it is less than in the electorates that I have mentioned in New South Wales and Victoria. If the Minister is to be guided by the speech of the honourable member for Calare, who argued that the. wheat-growers' organizations are not so fully representative of the industry as to justify their views being regarded as decisive, the only sensible and fair thing is for him to consult all the wheat-growers. As the result of war-time pools, all of them are registered. It would, be the simplest thing to abstract from the records of the Australian Wheat Board the names of all the registered. wheat-growers, and to take a poll of them at short notice. Mention is frequently made of democracy in this country. The Labour party poses as . its champion. Surely the essence of democracy is that the mass of the people concerned shall be consulted, and that their decision shall be the determining factor!",48
214,Mr DRAXEEORD,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"Hav e a referendum ,on everything.",49
215,Mr MCEWEN,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"The honourable member for Barker has proposed that there shall be a referendum of the wheat growers on a subject which touches their own industry. The Ministry regards a referendum of the people of Australia as a good thing when it wishes to obtain a decision to its own political advantage. This matter is not touched by politics. If it were put to the growers they could decide, free from all party affiliations, whether they want their assets to be "" grabbed"", virtually stolen; to be possessed retrospectively. What could be fairer than the proposal that they, shall be allowed to decide the matter? What is the use of the Minister saying,-"" I have conferred with the members of the Australian Wheat Growers. Federation ""having in the room with him half a dozen . men, some of whom were simultaneously executive members of the federation and on his own pay-roll, and would give advice calculated to favour the view that he holds? What is the use of his claiming that to be a democratic way of ascertaining the wishes of the wheat industry? The Opposition submitted the much fairer proposal that the whole stabilization scheme shall besubmitted to a poll of the growers. There is no urgency in the matter. It is not as though the proposal had implicit in payment by the Treasury to the wheatmember growers at short notice. All that is posed is that something shall not be from the wheat-growers. What could fairer than that? Mr SOUI.LT - Whea t merchants would defeat the poll.",49
216,Mr MCEWEN,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"That is a typical Labour party statement. The wheat merchants could almost be numbered one's fingers. Does the Minister that a dozen or twenty of them would be able to persuade 60,000 or 70,000 wheat-growers to vote against, their own interests? I have never heard a more puerile argument advanced than that. It shows that the Minister has no good argument at all in favour of his proposal.",49
217,Mr LAZZARINI,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,He said the merchants w.ould furnish funds with which to finance the Australian Country party.,49
218,Mr MCEWEN,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"He did not Say that. I have not seen the Australian Country party soliciting funds, but I have noticed great advertisements inserted on behalf of the Labour party asking that donations be sent to Ministers of the Crown at their public offices. I should have thought that Labour members would have had* little to say about party funds on this occasion. Had they any sense of fairness,.. they would blush with shame; but anyred herring is good enough for the Mmis""ter to draw across the track of this measure. If there was ever a simple and clear-cut proposal which should be accepted by the Government, this is it. If there was ever a plan on which members of the wheat-growing constituencies such as the honourable member for Forrest, the honourable member for Swan, the honourable member for Grey (Mr Russell) and the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr. Smith) should be heard, it is that now before the committee. Not one of those honourable members has risen to say whether he is in favour of, or against,, it. How can they explain to their supporters among the wheat-growers why they have expressed no opinion at all on this matter? 1",49

This should be done in the interests of the wheat-growers and of .many others whose interests are dependent - on the well-being of the industry. It is - essential that Australia should produce a.? much food as possible for the starving peoples overseas, to whom the honourable member for Calare (Mr Breen) has feelingly referred. The Minister (Mr. - Scully) and other honourable members - opposite have stressed the fact that it is highly necessary that legislation similar to that passed by this Parliament with regard to the wheat industry should be enacted by the parliaments of the States. Of course, that is necessary if this legislation is to operate as desired, but there would » be a far better chance of its acceptance by the State parliaments if this clause were eliminated. The wheat-growers generally are opposed to the plan, and that is due Repremore to the inclusion of the 1945-46 crop both than to any other feature of the bill. The of growers have financial obligations which for must be met to prevent them from becomhaving ing bankrupt. I am well acquainted with the position of the industry. The growers pre now in a far worse economic position than other primary producers. On occasions, Ministers have said in this Chamber primary producers have been able to reduce their overdrafts by' millions of - pounds, but the wheat-growers were not by included. Ministers may have had in mind those engaged in the production of milk and butter, and in the stock-fattenI ing industry, but for many years the law, wheat-growers' have been in financial difficulties. Nobody knows that better than the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture. It is more necessary now an than ever before that the growers should has get. the full benefit of improved prices, and therefore it is essential that the price obtained._, for the 1945-46 harvest should be made available to the indu?try. Overseas experts have said that probably four or five years will elapse before the food position in Great Britain will become favourable.",50

226,Mr TURNBULL,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"I do not wish to charge. go wide of the mark,, but I think even you, Mr Chairman, will admit that when the Minister .for Repatriation (Mr. Frost) interjected, "" Rot! "", he was himself a long way off the mark. Even school children know how scarce food is in Great Britain. People here who re=ceive letters from Great Britain know that never before in the history of that country have the people been so short of food. So great is the scarcity that it will take a long time to accumulate stocks again.",50

228,Mr TURNBULL,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"Wit h Great Britain it is not a matter of. money, hut of getting the food there. If the growers received the full export price for the 1945-46 crop, the.y could, with the e^tra money, produce still more wheat. With it they could buy new machinery, or put into order machinery which has become Wheat Export unserviceable by many years of use. They would also be able to repair their fences. Perhaps not many honourable members here have travelled through the wheat lands, but I have travelled through them extensively and, as one who had not seen the country for years, I was amazed to note how the fences and other farm equipment had fallen'into disrepair.",50
229,The CHAIRMAN,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"The clause deals with the export of wheat, not with farm implements.",51

232,Mr TURNBULL,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"If you have not been able to grasp my meaning, allow me to continue, and I may be able to enlighten you.

238,Mr SPENDER,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"I rise to order. This clause imposes on wheat-farmers, in respect of past and future crops, a heavy burden of 2s. 2d. a bushel. Therefore, in arguing that the clause be postponed, surely an honourable member may refer to the effects of drought on the position of the farmers. We must have regard to the pej-sons whom this clause will affect, and to understand how it will affect them we must understand also how Charge Bill 1946. 2897 [23 JULY, 1946.] they have been affected by drought.

240,Mr TURNBULL,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"You , Mr Chairman, incorrectly anticipated my argument. I was about to say that, owing to the drought, many farmers would not contribute to the fund from the proceeds of the 1945-46 crop. It is .highly desirable that the contributions of wheat growers to the fund should be as even as possible. Therefore, there seems to be a sound reason for omitting the 1945-46 crop. Another, consideration is that north-western Victoria, and parts of South Australia and New South Wales are now faced with the danger of a serious grasshopper plague.",51

Honourable members may laugh, but if they understood how necessary it was for farmers to get a good crop next year they would not laugh. It is a very serious matter. The growers are certainly opposed to the inclusion of the 1945-46 crop, and I now voice my opposition to it also.",51
243,Mr BREEN,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"Calare) [9.30] - The honourable member for Wimmera (Mr. Turnbull) has advanced reasons which, he claims, should induce the Minister-for Commerce and Agriculture (Mr Scully) to exclude the 1945-46 crop from the provisions of this measure. One reason was that when wheat-farmers fallowed for the 1945-46 crop, they undertook' commitments to business people, storekeepers, &c, and that as a consequence, they are in dire need of the full price realized for that wheat twelve months after it was harvested. But the export parity price ruling when fallowing for the 1944-4'S wheat crop was carried out was 6s. 5d. a bushel-it had risen sharply from January, 1944, when it was less than 5s so 63. 5d. should be acceptable. However, that is not the reason why honourable members opposite are protesting against the inclusion of the 1945-46 wheat crop in this scheme. Their object is to prevent the inauguration of any stabilization scheme that will give to the grower, over the years, all that his labour produces - as follows:They want to make the product of the wheat-farmer something on which they can gamble. I have listened to honourable members opposite criticizing certain individuals who have been accepted by the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture - as advisers, for which service they have been paid out-of-pocket expenses. Questions such as "" Is he on the pay-roll ?"", have been asked. I am sure that not many honourable members opposite can live on their parliamentary allowances of £1,000 a year. ""Most of them have other interests, and I do not say that disparagingly. The point I wish to make is that the real reason for the opposition to this scheme and the criticism of this particular phase of it, is a desire to torpedoe the stabilizaiion plan altogether. However, the wheat""farmers are awake to that danger. The - following letter was sent to me by a wheat-farmer in my electorate, and has been publishedAs a returned soldier from two world wars I have some knowledge of what we owe to Britain and the British. When I find that we are selling wheat to .'Britain at 10s. 4d. per bushel, and when we ""know that the British are literally starving ""* themselves to feed the rest of the world, I i-wonder if we"" realise just how much we owe to - the people of that country? We are selling wheat for milling at 5s. 2d. per bushel, and we are selling wheat for stock feed at 4s 6d. per bushel, but we demand the full export price when we sell wheat to the people in the United Kingdom I am a wheat-grower and I can find plenty to do with all the money I get, but I - would be glad to take less for my crop' if the' British people were to get cheaper food. A lower price to Britain could be partly balanced by a home-consumption price of 10s. 6d. per bushel. I can visualize honourable members opposite saying to the people of this country, "" ""We intend to charge 10s. 6d. a bushel for wheat consumed in Australia so that we can sell wheat to Great Britain at 5s. 2d., a bushel"". It is not hard to imagine what the reply would be. The letter continuesAs things are going now, it looks as if we should remove the kangaroo and the emu from our coat-of-arms and replace them with Ned Kelly and Shy lock, the notorious Jew. That letter, written by Mr K. T. Allen of Rob Roy, New South Wales, is commented upon by ""Peter Snodgrass"" in J/r. Breen. the New South Wales Journal the Land People generally are not conscious of any responsibility in this matter. It is none of our business if the people in other parts of the world are starving, it is their business. That is the attitude of honourable members opposite. They are concerned with only two things: First, they seek to make political capital out of the starvation of unfortunate people - overseas; and secondly, they want to torpedo a scheme which_ in the long run will mean the salvation of the wheat-grower.",51
244,Mr SPENDER,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"Warringah) [9.36] It is most significant that in the course of this debate we have not heard from the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture (Mr Scully) any attempt to justify"" this clause. The honourable member forCalare (Mr Breen) has made a valiant endeavour to stop the. drift, but with little success. He has sought to establishtwo things: First, both in his speech and by interjection, he has alleged that the Opposition's amendment is opposed to letting the British people have wheat at a low price. We on this side of the chamber all favour Great Britain having wheat at a low price, if that 3s necessary; but-and this is the vital difference-w e do not believe that the burden of such a concession should be carried entirely by the Australian wheat-growers, of whom there are only approximately 60,000. If Great Britain needs wheat at a price less than the world parity price we should meet that need; but let the burden be carried by the whole community. The honourable member's second contention was that the Opposition's amendment was intended to torpedo the stabilization - scheme'. The honourable member has not proved that statement merely by making it. He was driven to that extremity in order to find some explanation for this unjust clause which makes provision of the inclusion of the 1945-46 wheat harvest: So that there will not be any misapprehension about this matter, I .foreshadow an amendment following upon that of the honourable member for Wimmera. Clause 4 (1) (it) provides that a charge shall be levied on all wheat harvested on or after the first day of October, 1945, and exported from the Commonwealth, whether by the board or by any other person, on or after the first day of December, 1945. With the object of excluding the 1945-46 harvest I propose to move that the words "" on or after the first day of October, one thousand nine hundred and forty-five "" and "" on or after the first day of December, one thousand nine hundred and forty-five "" be left out with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" on and after the commencement of this act"" in each case. It is, I hope, competent for me to move the amendment which I have foreshadowed. Sub-clause (1.) (a) would then readA charge .is imposed and shall be levied and paid(a) On all wheat harvested on or after the commencement of this act, and exported from the Commonwealth, whether by the board or by any other person, on or after mencement of this act. The proposed amendment, if agreed to, .would exclude the 1945-46. harvest. It would place the issue clearly before the committee, and would enable us to decide whether or not the 1945-46 harvest is to be included.",52
245,Mr EOSEVEAB,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,I rise to order. I submit that it is not competent for the committee to agree to an amendment such as has been foreshadowed by the honourable member for Warringah (Mr; Spender). I think that he knows that that is so. This bill is the result of a resolution carried in Committee of Ways and Means. That committee instructed the Minister to bring in a bill to give effect to that resolution. The amendment would alter that resolution.,53
246,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL, Order ! The honourable member for Warringah has only foreshadowed his amendment.,53
247,Mr ROSEVEAR,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,I thought that - the time of the committee would be saved if I made that point clear.,53
248,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,The Chair will determine that point when it arises.,53
249,Mr SPENDER,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"Whenever honourable member for Dalley (Mr. Rosevear) participates in a debate in committee, he seems to get lost. The Minister in charge of the bill said that there was no distinction between making a levy in respect of a past crop and imposing a levy in respect of a future crop. I do not know what the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies) thinks about-that; he is of age and can speak for himself. I am sure, however, that he would not controvert that there is a vital distinction between a levy made retrospectively and one made prospectively. This is a levy made retrospectively, and I repeat what I have said before, namely, that a levy made retrospectively is a vicious thing unless the most overriding reasons of public policy justify it. I have heard nothing so far to justify this retrospective levy excepting a reason which the .Government is not prepared to admit, namely that it is another way of stealing something from wheat-growers. When the 1945-46 crop was acquired by the the com- Australian Wheat. Board under the Wheat Acquisition Regulations there was vested in the wheat-grower a right to compensation. That compensation must be full and adequate. Where the wheat has been realized-wher e there has been a market to show its realizationfigure--it has been made clear that the realizable value is the amount of the fair and adequate compensation. The second point is that when the wheat was acquired the wheat grower was entitled, as a matter of right under the then existing law introduced by the present Government- I refer to the Wheat Acquisition Regulations-to full and adequate compensation determined in accordance with the realizable value of his wheat. Australian wheat is being sold in New Zealand at a fraction over 9s. 7d. a bushel; in other overseas countries it is being sold at 10s. a bushel. The effect of this legislation is that the wheat grower is to be deprived retrospectively of his right to that money by the imposition, of a charge of 2s. 2d. a bushel on wheat already taken from him and vested in the board. Sub-clause 4 of clause 4 readsWhere wheat products are exported, the charge shall be imposed on the wheat equithe valent of those products. That is to say, the charge will operate in respect of all wheat in the possession of a wheat-grower. During this debate I have not heard one word to justify that provision. I do not raise my argument on any legal or narrow approach. I raise it upon the rights of between 60,000 and 70,000 wheat-growers under the Wheat Acquisition Regulations of 1942-43. So that the matter may be debated, I desire to make further reference to those regulations. They provide that upon a proclamation being published in the Gazette the crops became vested in the board. Thereupon, all property in the wheat crop passed to the board. The wheat-grower's right was then converted into a claim for full and adequate compensation, because regulations provided that compensation should be equal to the realized value of the wheat, less certain specific charges incidental to realization. No honourable member can say that on the faith of those regulations a wheat - farmer would not have been entitled to. the equivalent of export parity for his wheat, less certain charges incidental to realization. The Government's proposal is to take from the wheat-grower, under the guise of a retrospective levy, the compensation to which he clearly was entitled.",53
250,Mr ROSEVEAR,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,Rubbish ! The honourable member does not understand the position. x,54
251,Mr SPENDER,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"The honourable member for Dalley is not now presiding-over our deliberations, and it is competent for honourable members to dispute with him. The honourable member thinks that he is the only - member who knows anything.",54
252,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,Order!,54
253,Mr SPENDER,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,I am confining my remarks to the subject before the Chair. I hope that the honourable member for Da'ley will do the same.,54
254,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"The Chair will take care of that matter, should it arise.",54
255,Mr SPENDER,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"No honourable member can say that, both legally"" and morally, the wheat-grower is not entitled to the full realization of his 1945-46 cron, less the charges incidental to realization. That is his right under the regulations, and - also in commercial morality and decency. By manoeuvre the Government seeks to take from the wheat-growers of Australia large sums of money which will have the effect of relieving the Government from the necessity to meet the costs of its stabilization scheme. If the Minister cannot see any distinction between taking away a vested right and taxing - the wheat-grower in the future I am afraid that I cannot help him to see the inequity of his proposal. The Government can defend its action only on the ground that it was agreed to by somebody who did not represent all the wheat-growers. In respect of the future the wheat-grower knows where he stands; he can plan his budget and knows the incidental effects of the bill on his operations. In respect of the past he had every right to assume that the price of realization was his but that is now to be taken away from him. ^ The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN - The honourable member's time has expired.",54
256,Mr ANTHONY,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"Richmond) [9.51] Sub-clause 1 of clause 4 reads as follows:A charge is imposed and shall be levied and paid(«)' on all wheat harvested on or after ' the first day of October, One thousand nine hundred and forty-five . . . . I emphasizethe year 1945. This is the 23rd.day of July, 1946, and we are now considering imposing a levy on wheat harvested on and after the 1st October, 1945, almost ten months ago. That wheat was probably sown in May and June, 1945, thirteen or. fourteen months ago. - When the facts are stated in this manner it becomes obvious that this levy constitutes a retrospective tax on the wheat grower. The honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Turnbull) expressed the optimistic view that the Minister might accept his amendment and exclude, the 1945-46 harvest from the provisions of the bill. The honourable member is indeed an optimist because, if his amendment were accepted it would mean that the Minister would have to drop about £7,000,000 of "" loot "" which he proposes to take from the wheat-growers in order to initiate this so-called stabilization this scheme. It is apparent that the scheme is to be financed initially not by the Government placing a sum of money to the credit of the fund to be drawn upon in case of necessity, but by a tax on the wheat farmers of Australia amounting to no less than £7,000,000 in respect of the 1945-46 harvest. It is evident indeed that the Opposition is fighting a forlorn battle; the numbers are against it and the Government will have its way. Whilst honourable members opposite who are supposed to represent wheat-growing electorates should be willing to range themselves alongside the Opposition in its attempts to exclude the 1945-46 harvest from the provisions of the bill they are strangely silent. The honourable member for Calare (Mr Breen) read a letter from a constituent who would be very generous with the wheat-grower's money. The writer was prepared to sell to the under-nourished people of Great Britain wheat at lower than world-market prices.' He said that if we did otherwise we would be guilty of exploiting the straits in which the people of Great Britain were placed. Whilst 10s. 4d. a bushel might be considered a high price by comparison with the price that prevailed over the last few years, I agree with the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Spender) that if generosity is to be shown to the people of any country the cost of that generosity should be borne by the whole of the community and not by one section whose product is required by them. The support of the honourable gentleman for such a proposal is to say the least of it extraordinary.",54
257,Mr BKEEN,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,That is a wrong deduction to make from my remarks.,55
258,Mr ANTHONY,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"It is the only de-duction-I am able to make. We realise that all our efforts on behalf of the wheat-growers will be fruitless because we have not the numbers to prevent the Government having its way; nevertheless., we shall not be prevented from objecting to this proposal with all the vigour we can command.",55
259,Mr SCULLY,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,It obviously does not prevent the honourable member from stone-walling the bill.,55
260,Mr ANTHONY,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"We are prepared to fight against a principle which we believe to be wrong, whether applied to the wheat industry or any other industry. What would the Minister say if honourable members in Opposition suggested that the wages of workers should be subjected to a tax having a retrospective effect over the last twelve months? However, because the wheat growers represent only - a small body of approximately 60,000 individuals the Government believes that they will stand for anything. It has been suggested that the issue should be determined by a i><il!ot. We know that the holding, of a ballot is the last thing the Minister desires to do. ' The TEMPORARY CHAIR-MAX The holding of a ballot is not involved in the clause.",55
261,Mr ANTHONY,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"The amendment moved by the honourable member for Wimmera was that the clau.=e be postponed as an instruction to the Government to exclude the 1945-46 crop. I consider, that I am in order in giving reasons why a ballot should be held.",55
262,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,The Chair will determine whether or not the honourable member is in order.,55
263,Mr ANTHONY,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,Reason s must be. given otherwise there would be no substance in the claim that the clause should be postponed.,55

267,Mr ANTHONY,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"It is obviously futile to attempt to move the Government in this matter. In raising their voices against this iniquity honourable members on this side of the committee are apparently only beating the air. However, a poll of a different character will shortly be held and this iniquity will rapidly be removed.",55
268,Mr BREEN,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,Calare) [9.58] - Mr . Chairman Mr SrENDEs - I rise to order. Has not the honourable member already addressed the committee on this clause?,55
269,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,The honourable member for Calare has done so once; .lie is entitled to speak on the clause for two periods each of fifteen minutes.,55
270,Mr BREEN,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"Bot h the honourable members for Warringah (Mr Spender) and Richmond (Mr Anthony) have canvassed what they claimed was the injustice of a retrospective tax. The honourable member for Warringah said that in imposing a retrospective tax in respect of the 1945-46 harvest, for which realiza- opposed to it. tions were high on a bushel basis, the Government desired to avoid making contributions from public funds to initiate a scheme that might subsequently not prove self-supporting. Do they suggest that public money should be used to finance such schemes at times when annual or periodical realizations were low and that there should be no producer contribution at times when realizations were high? If the honourable member for Warringah and the honourable member for Richmond assume that that is the idea of the wheat-farmers, they are deluding themselves. The Robertson scheme provides for a levy on wheat when prices are high to create a fund from which equalization payments shall be made when prices are low. That is the scheme in this bill, which provides for a guaranteed minimum price of 5s. 2d. a bushel. The Opposition is protesting against the inclusion in the scheme of a crop harvested when uncontrolled inflation was rampant in some countries overseas and Unrra was demanding food for the starving people of Europe regardless of the cost. That is why the price for that harvest was so high.",56
271,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,Order! The honourable member must confine his remarks to the clause ,56
272,Mr BREEN,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"If the honourable ber for Warringah and the honourable member for Richmond think the returns from that harvest should not be used to supplement the pool against the day when prices may be low, I think they the only people in Australia who hold that view.",56

It is the issue on which we intend to divide the committee in order to see who stands for stealing from the wheat-growers and who is",56

282,Mr MCEWEN,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,It appears that I memmight have chosen my language more discreetly and said that we would diyide the committee to discover those in favour of taking money from the wheat-growers in a manner which I am sure the wheatare growers believe to be both illegal and improper. The issue is simple. It is whether the levy is to apply retrospectively or not. The wheat-growing industry is subject to periodic vicissitudes and is committed to the disadvantage of,56
283,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,Order! The Chair will not permit a discussion along those lines. The honourable member will not be permitted to make a second-reading speech at this stage of the bill.,57
284,Mr MCEWEN,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"Havin g passed that point, I was about to mention that the product of this industry has both high and low overseas prices. Those who are engaged in it can maintain themselves in it only by averaging their income. When the bulk of the wheat-growers planted the 1945-46 crop they had been through a series of adverse seasons and prices, but a year ago they had moved into a period when they knew from answers to questions given by the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture that the export value of their wheat had reached 9s. a bushel. They were sustained by the knowledge that they could recoup some of. their losses from the high overseas prices. Upon that assumption, which was founded upon the whole of their experience and their conviction of their rights under the Australian Constitution, they budgeted for the next year, as every one engaged in rural industries is bound to budget in advance. They now are to be obliged, as the result of this legislation, to re-assess their incomes from a crop that they have harvested. Here is what they find in simple figures. If the amendment be rejected and the bill be passed in its present form, every farmer who delivered 1,000 bushels of wheat will receive £54 less than he expected. But, of course, 1,000 bushels'is not a normal delivery. The honourable member for Forrest (Mr Lemmon) said that in twelve days he had sown 500 acres of wheat.",57
285,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,Order! The honourable member will not be permitted to indulge in a wide discussion of the industry on this clause.,57
286,Mr MCEWEN,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"It is clear that a man who sowed 500 acres of wheat would expect, on an average yield, to harvest from 7,000 to 8,000 bushels. A man who harvested 7,000 bushels will have his income reduced by £379 if this bill be - passed in its present form. If he delivers 8,000 bushels his income, under this pernicious measure, will be decreased by £433. There has not been an occasion previously in the history of this country when men have produced a product and have had it compulsorily acquired by the Government under terms which were explicit at the time of the acquisition, but which has been subjectlater to a decision by caucus to introduce legislation the effect of which will be to take from £300 to £500 from individual growers. The industry cannot bear such an impost upon the incomes of those engaged in it. This is not an abstract argument; every wheat-grower, with pencil and paper, will work out how much he is having stolen, or improperly taken, from him. With the permission of the committee I incorporate the following table in Hansard:Amount proposed to be withheld for stabilization fund 2s. 2d. per bushel, being 50 per cent, of difference between 5s. 2d. and 9s. 6d. (calculations on basis of 50 per cent, of poo) being exported) Growers who delivered- £ 1,000 bushels 54 2,000 bushels .. 108 3,000 bushels .. 162 4,000 bushels . . . 217 5.000 bushels . . 271 6.000 bushels .. 325 7,000 bushels .. 379 8,000 bushels .. 433 9,000 bushels .. 487 10,000 bushels .. 542 My final point is that the legality of the inclusion of the 1945-46 harvest in this scheme has been challenged by two eminent King's Counsel in this chamber, namely, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies) and the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Spender).",57
287,Mr SCULLY,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,The Leader of the Opposition did not challenge its legality.,57
288,Mr MCEWEN,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"Apparently the Minister has some difficulty in interpreting the language of the Leader of the Opposition. I listened carefully to the right honourable gentleman, and' I have no doubt on that point. The Minister knows that the legality of this measure has been challenged, not only in this chamber, but also in Victoria, New South Wales and Western Australia, wKere wheat-farmers are banding together and voluntarily subscribing funds with which to fight the Government in the courts.",57
289,Mr SCULLY,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,The honourable member knows that the Australian Country party is responsible for that agitation.,58
290,Mr MCEWEN,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"The Minister cannot shout me down. He cannot shout down the High Court. The point I make is that if an appeal to the High Court be successful, and this provision is proved to be ultra vires the Constitution the measure as a whole will be invalidated. The Government is jeopardizing the whole scheme by obstinately proceeding with this pernicious proposal. Every grower has - raised his voice in protest against- I nearly said "" steal ""-this expropriation. I appeal to the Government on the ground of equity and fair play. If it has any regard for our customary system of fair play it may still see the light and exclude the 1945-46 crop from the scheme. Secondly, I put the very powerful view to the Government that if its persistence with its proposal results in an adverse decision by the High Court, the - cheme as.a whole will be invalidated, and everything the Minister is trying to achieve will be lost.",58
291,Sir EARLE PAGE,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"Cowper) [10.15]. - I - cannot understand why the Government refuses - to accept the suggestion that it postpone the commencement of the scheme until next year. Many attempts have been made to stabilize the wheat industry along these lines. We had an extraordinary opportunity during the war to obtain details with regard to all wheat farmers in Australia, including their names, acreages and production. I am loath to believe that the Government would"" wantonly throw away the opportunity now presented to it to capitalize what has been done in respect of the industry during the war. The Government, by persisting with its proposal to include the 1945-46 crop in the scheme, will seriously jeopardize the whole plan, because our experience has been that when the various States as well as the Commonwealth must enact legislation in order to make a pooling system possible, a small number of men are able to cause trouble, as was caused in respect of dried fruits and wheat. Therefore, we should try to - establish the greatest possible goodwill towards the scheme generally. I estimate that the levy to be imposed on Uie wheat-growers will average 2.s. 6d. a bushel in respect of the total Australian crop. That levy will antagonize the wheat-farmers, particularly as it will follow the worse financial result in Australia for many years in the marketing of wheat.",58
292,Mr ROSEVEAR,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,The average would not be 2s. 6d. a bushel on the total Australian crop.,58
293,Sir EARLE PAGE,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"It will be 2s. 6d. a bushel on all wheat exported,",58
294,Mr ROSEVEAR,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,That is not on the whole crop.,58
295,Sir EARLE PAGE,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"Usually from one-third to one-half of the crop is disposed of in Australia, but frequently from one-half to two-thirds is exported, whilst in some years as much as three-quarters of the total crop has been exported. The question arises as to why the Government persists with this proposal. It is obvious that it cannot help the farmers financially in the ensuing year if they are to pay a levy of 2s. 6d. a bushel. The effect must be to cause the farmer a certain amount of harm. The Government cannot need this money as a special loan because it is well known that arrears of income tax amounting to many millions of pounds have not been collected. Is the object of the proposal to bring in money to the Government's coffers by way of a loan which does not carry interest? Judging by our experience after thewar of 1914-18,- substantial amounts will be paid into the pool during the next few years. Why does the Government persist with this proposal? Does it wish to antagonize the farmers, or does it hope that the bill will be invalidated? Despite the interjection by the Minister when the honourable member for Indi (Mr MCEwen) was speaking, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies) supported the point made by the honourable member for Warringah (Mr. Spender) that the wheat acquired up to the present must be acquired on just terms. Apart from the 1945-46 crop, an agreement must be made with respect to the acquisition of future crops. If that be done, growers will know the conditions under which they are to plant and deliver wheat in the future. They can then determine whether the conditions are just. They grow the wheat, they own the wheat, they need the money. The growers take the responsibility of accepting the conditions laid down by the Commonwealth; but obviously, the proposal to include the 1945-46 crop is expropriation. In those circumstances, the Government is not acquiring the wheat on fair and just terms. The only effect of this proposal will be to antagonize a large majority of wheat-growers, and arouse opposition to the stabilization of the wheat industry. That is the last thing that the Government should do. In the final analysis, this opposition will lead to an appeal to the High Court or the Privy Council, and the destruction of the stabilization scheme. That fate befell other marketing schemes, because a few growers were antagonistic to the proposals of the government of the day.",58
296,Mr ROSEVEAR,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"If the 1945-46 crop were excluded, members of the Opposition would still raise objections to the scheme.",59
297,Sir EARLE PAGE,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"In ' 1940, I introduced a wheat stabilization scheme. Before doing so, I discussed the proposal with the representatives of the wheat growers of Australia, and with the Australian Agricultural Council. Between 100 and 130 representatives of the Commonwealth, States and wheat-growers' organizations assembled in the Senate chamber, and after a full discussion, agreed to exclude the 1940-41 wheat crop which had been planted. The scheme commenced with the new season's crop, namely, the 1941-42 - crop, although the bill had been passed in December, 1940. We realized that by excluding the 1940-41 crop, we would remove one of the causes of possible antagonism to the scheme. Recognizing that a stabilization scheme is necessary now, I urge the Government not to antagonize wheat-growers unnecessarily because any opposition to this plan may lead to the legislation being declared unconstitutional.",59
298,Mr ROSEVEAR,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"Dalley) [10.22] During this discussion, I have heard honourable members opposite threaten to submit amendments, although they knew that those amendments would not be in order. The amendment which is in order is that which proposes to postpone the operation of this clause. We should examine the clause for the purpose of determining whether there will be an expropriation or robbery which honourable gentlemen opposite have mentioned. The essence of the clause is that there shall be deducted from the proceeds of the sale overseas of all wheat including the 1945-46 crop, the amount in excess of 5s. 2d. a bushel. Onehalf of that excess will be paid immediately into the pool for distribution, and the other half will be retained for the purpose of stabilizing the wheat-growing industry for the next five years. If , at any time, the price of wheat should fall calamitously as it has in the past, the money which is retained for stabilization purposes will be paid to the farmers to guarantee that the fixed price will be maintained. Therefore, it is obvious that all this talk about robbery is so much pOlitica] "" eye-wash "". The only money that the farmers of Australia will lose will be the cost of administration by the board. That will be a charge against the accumulated funds of the wheat pool. As the farmer will have returned to him everything that was taken from him, how canthere be any robbery or expropriation. It is all very well for the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Spender) to ""throw his weight about"" as a legal man, but he knows as well as I do that my analysis of the position is correct.",59
299,Mr SPENDER,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,I do not.,59
300,Mr ROSEVEAR,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"Honourable members opposite assert that the Government's proposal is wrong, and that before this scheme is introduced, the farmers should be invited, by ballot, to express their opinion regarding it. I ask: What will become of the minority of wheat growers who would be opposed to the scheme ?",59
301,Mr TURNBULL,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"We have discussed that. ' Mr Rosevear - If the Government's legislative proposal will result in robbei-y and expropriation, will it not be robbery, through a referendum",59

304,Mr ANTHONY,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"I rise to order. When I made a passing reference to this matter, the Chair ruled that my remarks were out of order, and refused me permission to proceed. Therefore, I submit that the Chair should not allow the honourable member for Dalley to proceed on similar lines* ' The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN - Order! The Chair is not prepared to have its ruling canvassed.",60
305,Mr ROSEVEAR,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"After those two interruptions, I shall discuss the questions of robbery and sanctity of private property, about which the honourable member for Warringah spoke at length. If his argument about the sanctity of private property and. the property rights of growers in their crops is valid, the position will not be altered by the fact that a majority of wheat-growers are in favour of ' the stabilization scheme. If the stabilization of an industry by legislation is wrong, its stabilization by a majority vote of the producers is equally wrong; The minority, in such circumstances, will still retain their rights to their property. It is true that, at present, high prices are ruling overseas for wheat. The people of Great Britain, we are told, are underfed. They need wheat and,"" like Shylock, we are extracting the last drop of blood from them by charging them 10s. 2d. a bushel. Mr MCEWEN,-The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture fixed that price.",60

309,Mr ROSEVEAR,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,Le t us face the position honestly.' The fact that honourable members opposite are so anxious to exclude the 1945-46 crop from this scheme is the clearest indication that they have no faith in the future of wheat prices throughout the world.,60

311,Mr ROSEVEAR,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"Le t us examine the position to see whether my statement is nonsense. If the honourable member for Indi has faith in the continuance of the high prices' ruling overseas, it does not matter whether the Government commences the stabilization scheme this year or next year. If the scheme were postponed until next year, the Opposition would still raise the same bogy about robbing the wheat-farmers.",60
312,Mr MCEWEN,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"That is nonsense, too.",60
313,Mr ROSEVEAR,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"The honourable member for Indi, like a greedy kid, wants all the toys and a big doll, too. He wants the people of Australia, through the Commonwealth Government, to guarantee for five years- I heard him advocate even a period of ten years-the price of 5s. 2d. a bushel, and allow farmers, on - the 1945-46 crop, the full benefit of the high prices ruling. overseas. Such things ought to work both ways. I believe that the success of a scheme can best be assured by starting it in a year when prices are high. A scheme could not prove successful if it were begun, after there had been a calamitous collapse of world prices. There must be that "" nestegg"" of a successful crop at the beginning. As we proceed, if existing prices overseas be maintained, and 'year after year the excess be applied, one-half to the pool and one-half to the stabilization of the price, at the end of the scheme all of those whose wheat had been included in it will share in the distribution of the excess amount.",60
314,Mr BOWDEN,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,The Minister will not admit that.,60
315,Mr ROSEVEAR,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,The Minister has said so throughout.,60
316,Mr BOWDEN,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,He has not said so _ once.,60
317,Mr SCULLY,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,Of course I have.,60
318,Mr ROSEVEAR,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"If , subsequently, the scheme proved successful, it could be a continuing scheme. The equity of the farmer in his wheat will not destroyed by the excess being withheld from him, one-half of it being placed in. clause. the pool and distributed, and the mainder being used to guarantee a'price of 5s. 2d. a bushel for a period of five years. It . is purely humbug hypocrisy to talk about expropriation, and robbing the farmer, when we know that the only portion of the money colThey lected by the Australian Wheat Board, whether in Australia or overseas, which the farmer will lose, will be the cost of administration of the scheme. The proposal to postpone the scheme is merely an attempt to defeat the prices. objective of stabilizing the wheat industry. The right honourable member for Cowper (Sir Earle Page) has joined in the chorus of voices demanding postponeat ment. That has. been the tragedy of the wheat industry.",60
319,Sir EARLE PAGE,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"I secured the legisdebater, lative enactment of a scheme, and i sabotaged by the present Minister.",61
320,Mr ROSEVEAR,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"Yea r after year, that for fifteen years; while the right able gentleman was Minister for Comhigh merce, this problem arose, and he was never game to face the issue.",61
321,Sir EARLE PAGE,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,This is a replica my scheme.,61
322,Mr ROSEVEAR,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"The right honorexpressed able gentleman did not on any occasion attempt to bring down a realstabilizathan tion scheme. His policy was that of patching and mending year after year, with a levy here and a levy there, in year excluding from the benefits of legislation those farmers whose income tax reached a certain level, and another year embracing all of them when the Government was dependent upon the Australian Country party for its existgrowers ence. The right honourable gentleman now wants to continue to patch. Is that the sort of administration we can expect from him-waitin g all .the time to see what will happen?",61

"" The honourable member for Dalley is getting a long way from the re- - Mr Rosevear - I have said enough to prove conclusively that all this talk about expropriation and robbery is so and much "" eye-wash"". Believe me, the wheat-growers are a "" wake-up"" to all that they have been hearing for years. are in favour of this scheme. But the people who stand behind and finance the Australian Country party want the scheme to fail so that they can continue to exploit the farmers and obtain for themselves the advantage of overseas",61
326,Mr TURNBULL,WHEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"Wimmera) [10.35]. ' - Recently , some bouquets were thrown the honourable .member for Dalley (Mr. Rosevear). If he is to continue to enjoy the reputation of being a convincing he should choose his subject with t was care. He has exhibited to-night an abundant lack of knowledge. In arguing it does not matter whether the wheathonorgrower receives the extra money from prices this season or in five years time, he has revealed how little he knows about the wheat industry generally and its sufferings during the last few years. of I say, in favour of the honourable member for Calare (Mr Breen), that he the belief that Australia should supply Britain with food at a lower price is being asked. But I definitely support the contention of the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Anthony), one that in such an event the cost should be the borne by the whole community. All Aus' tralians should agree with that. Thein concessional price at which wheat is being sold for other purposes is leaving a bitter taste in the mouths of the wheatat the present time. There have been countless arguments in favour of the amendment, which proposes that the clause be postponed as an instruction to the Government that the 1945-46 harvest be excluded from the stabilization scheme; but there has not been any logicalarguin support of the inclusion of - that of crop in the scheme. Summing up the the arguments in favour of the amendment, say that its acceptance would place the great food-producing wheat,industry on a sounder footing; allow the wheat growers to make certain renovations, which would help to maintain the wheat producing equipment that is such a great national asset; allow them to meet some, at least, of their financial obligations; and enable preparations to he made for the maximum production of food at a time when it is most urgently needed. The growers are in favour of this course being adopted. Regarded generally, it would, be in. the best interests of Australia and Australians, and in consonance with British justice.

IMPOST LICENCES. Motion (by Mr Chifley) proposed - That the House do now adjourn. (Mr Mr Forde (Capricornia-Minister for the Army) [10.43] - Wit h the consent of the House, I shall incorporate in Hansard the following reply to a statement made by the Leader of the Australian Country - party (Mr. . . 12 Fadden) on the 12th July. On the . . 30 motion for the adjournment of the House, he complained at some length 18 about the administration of import AYES. licensing regulations by the Division of Import Procurement. The right honourable gentleman mentioned, in particular, ball-bearings for harvester machines, 1-lb. hammers supplied with certain agricultural implements, and roller-chain for agricultural implements. It is not posNOES. sible, from the particulars given to identify definitely the ball-bearing transactions, but I have ascertained that an application for the importation of ballbearings from Sweden was received by the Division of Import Procurement on the 23rd January, 1946, no supporting data being given. On the 27th February, the applicant was advised that a licence would be granted for 4,544 bearings, but that the balance of 1,900 bearings was available from United Kingdom sources. This advice was based on the best inforFuller, A. N . Sheehan. T. mation available to the department. PAIRS. The licence was issued on the 7th March, six weeks after receipt of the application, not three months as stated by the right honourable member. Only in June was the department advised of possible difficulty in obtaining delivery from the United Kingdom, and subsequent information - from that country indicated that at least half of the most important types could be delivered within twelve to fourteen weeks. It is the usual practice of the department to check applications for import licences for ball-bearings against surplus stocks held by the Department, of Munitions, and secondly against available supplies from the United Kingdom. However, to avoid the possibility of harmful delays, the Eivision of Import Procurement some time ago authorized the granting of licences to a total value of £20,000 c.i.f. and e. to S.K.F. Ball Bearing Co. (Australia) Proprietary Limited, without ""With regard to 1-lb. hammers, the particulars given are insufficient to identify the transaction in the departmental records, but if the right ber will supply more details, a further inquiry will be made. Three applications were received on the 13th, 14th and 20th May, respectively, for licences to roller-chain. The issue of licences in respect of all three applications was print authorized on the 20th June. During the war, stocks of motor vehicle and tractor cations spare parts were maintained by government purchase, in order to avoid breakdowns of essential equipment. The slight delay which occurred was unavoidable, answers:as it was necessary to check the goods shown on the applications against import remaining stocks. The right honourable the member will realise that the process checking licence applications against available supplies, first, inside Australia, examination and, secondly, from sterling sources, no which is essential if our limited overseas currency resources are to be conserved for essential requirements, is one which the inevitably involves a certain amount delay. The delays encountered are not Regulations excessive, in view of the great volume transactions involved. Question resolved in the affirmative. PAPERS.

Asa result the present length of galvanized plain wire is greater in proportion to the tonnage than the pre-war production. . 4 - Wire arid wire products are allocated - to the various States .by the.Commonwealth control, which receives* full co-operation from the - wire drawers, to ensure an equitable share to each State. Control of distribution within a State iB the responsibility of the State government which will, no doubt, see that the various sections of industry receive .their fair proportion. SALES TAX. Mr HARRISON askfd the Treasurer, upon notice I.. Is sales tax charged on a net price which. includes freight on goods transferred from city wholesale firms to wholesalers in the country which supply retailers and primary producers! 2. Does this, in effect, increase the freight charges on the goods? 3. Has he received numerousprotests from 1 country centres to have the Sales Tax Act' amended to remove'the. tax upon the freight of goods?4. Is it a fact that city warehouses railing goods to the country do not have to pay plain wire, these charges T 5. Will he take steps to have this anomaly in remedied so that wholesalers in country centres will be placed on an equal trading basis with' city warehouses which send identical goods to the' same country districts? - Mr CHIELKY - The^ . answers to. the honourable member's questions are as follows:1. Sales tax. is not. payable on the sale of by city wholesale merchants to country wholesale merchants who purchase goods for; resale by wholesale. In such circumstances, the country wholesalers obtain the goods free of tax by. quotation of certificate, and are required to pay tax on their sales of the goods by wholesale, the tax being calculated upon the amount for which the goods are sold 2. No."" 3. Representations have .been received' on this subject at various times during the period of operation of tbVsales tax, not only by the present Government but also"" by preceding governments.. 4. City wholesale merchants do not pay tax at all on their sales to country wholesale merchants of goods for resale by them by wholesale. When .city wholesale merchants sell goods to country retailers at a delivered rice the tax is payable on the delivered price, ut when the sale is on f.o.r. terms, the tax is payable on a price which does not include freight. 5. The matter has already received consideration by each successive government since the inception of the tax. It is an essential feature of the whole scheme of the sales tax that the tax shall fall on the last wholesale sale of the goods, and shall be charged upon, the amount for which the goods are sold. If this basic feature of the law were changed, it would involve the conversion of the' tax from a tax on wholesale transactions into a tax on manufacturers' sales only. It is considered impracticable to amend, the law to provide for the payment of tax by country wholesalers' upon any basis other than the price for which the goods are sold by them. ROAD-MAKING MAOHKTEBT . Mr LAZZA&TNI - On the 19th -1946; the honourable member 'for Wide Bay (Mr Corser) .asked me a question about the disposal of lend-lease road-making, equipment. There has been - no delay by my department in making lend-lease road-making machinery available to - State government departments and local government authorities, which require it for road 'making and other public WOTKS. I h Queensland, the matter is handled on behalf of the State - Government by the Premier's Plant .Allocation Committee under the chairmanship of the Deputy Co-ordinator of Public Works, Queensland. The committee has had submitted to it a very large quantity of plant,, including many lead-lease items and, although large quantities have been allocated; there are still numerous applications awaiting finality, mainly because the plant which has been offered to the authorities has not yet been accepted by them. Additional, plant is coming forward from service departments - almost every week, and as this is received by my department it is readily made available to the various 1 Answers to Questions. States. I can assure the House that there is ho. delay on the part of - the - Commonwealth Government in the alloca.tion of lend-lease and other' equipment to the States, for ultimate disposal. As a matter of fact, my department would like to see the surplus equipment taken up more readily by State instrumentalities, but this is .entirely in the hands of the State authorities. I suggest that the honourable member refer the Associated Chamber of Manufactures, Queensland, - which complained of delay in the allocation of lend-lease plant, to the chairman of the State Allocation Committee with a view to expediting any cases which may have been brought to notice.
