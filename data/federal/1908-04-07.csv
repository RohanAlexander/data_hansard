10,Mr KELLY,TELEPHONE BUREAUX AND LETTER,"Accordin g to this morning's AgeSpeaking with a thorough knowledge of the present position of affairs in Papua, the Bishop, in the course of conversation yesterday, remarked that it was unfortunately the fact that the white population there is practically divided into two camps, and' the aspirants for the important position shortly to be filled knowledged heads of these camps. Should either succeed in getting the appointment' the cleavage, of parties would most probably become still more marked, and however unjust it might be there would always be the suspicion of partisanand ship in the decision of. matters in which the two camps were 'deeply interested. What is wanted, therefore, is a strong have no local prejudices, and who would not from the start pf his administration have .to overcome the feeling that he was a partisan, who might by tact and firmness be able to cile the differences which now exist, and which, if not removed, might easily operate to the detriment of the Commonwealth possession.

25,Mr MALONE Y,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"As the Premier of Victoria is considered one of the best and most up-to-d'ate Premiers which this State has had, I wish to-direct the attention of the Prime Minister to the following quotation, appearing in a leading article in yesterday's Age, of remarks made by him on the subject of immigrationWe must provide homes for those we bring here, and we must find land for our own people firs'.. There are 200 applicants for every piece of land we have to offer. Before we ask people from England to take up land, we must provide land for the sons of our own pioneers, who are leaving us because they cannot find suitable homes amongst us. My. impression is that I have heard similar remarks from the lips of the Prime Minister, and I desire to ask him if he is in unison - with the Premier of Victoria on this subject ?",16
26,Mr DEAKIN,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"In a letter with which the Premier of Victoria has recently favoured me, he enters into the question with great fulness, explaining his attitude more clearly than in the expressions just read, with which, so far as they go, I concur.",16
27,Mr CROUCH,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"in reference to the immigration proposals made last week by the honourable member for Flinders, who, I understand, ingenuously offered to allow the Government to make use of his new ideas-which , by the way, are very difficult to discover- I desire to know whether the Prime Minister will, cause the honourable member's proposals to be printed, with the new ideas appearing in block type.",16
28,Mr DEAKIN,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"When the question is again before us, I can avail myself of the opportunity to consult with my honourable friend the honourable member for Flinders. LaterFUND. Mr MCDOUGALL asked the Prime that a Minister, upon notice I. Whether it is true that the Victorian Gohas available for immigrants only some 15,000 acres of land of doubtful quality? 2. Is it not also true that hundreds of Victorians are at present leaving the State because of the inability of the Victorian Government to provide them with land ? 3. Is there not a scarcity of land for intending settlers in the majority of the States of the Commonwealth ? 4. In view of the fact that the. Governments of several of the States are unable to find suitable land for their own people, does he not think that, in order to develop his immigration policy, steps should be taken to amend the Constitution, so as to give the Commonwealth Parliament control of the land and railways of Australia.",16
29,Mr DEAKIN,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"The answer to the honourable member's questions is- 1, 2, 3, arid 4. I hope to lay on the table at an early date a letter from the Premier of Victoria, in which the lands available and about to be made available are set out in detail. Under the circumstances, I invite the honourable member to accept this as a sufficient reply for the time being to the first two questions. The third will be answered by letters from the Premiers of the other States. In reply to No. 4, the whole of the steps proposed to be taken to secure immigration will be dealt with in connection with the next Estimates. ADELAIDE CUSTOMS FRAUD S.",17

PAPER . ESTIMATES. . In Committee of Supply (Consideration resumed from. 3rd April, vide page 1.0177): DEPARTMENT OF . POSTMASTER-GENERAL. Division 189 (Central Stat), ,£10,373, upon which Mr Frazer had movedThat the item, "" Sccreta/y, ^1,000,"" be re",18
47,Mr REID,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"East Sydney) [3.19] - The which has been moved will enable my remarks to take a wider range by the than would otherwise have been open to The item relates to the perof manent head of the Post and Tele""United graph Department, and we know that on suba great deal depends upon the mariner in which his duties are discharged. 51 T have considered very seriously the proposals which the Government have made in order to bring this Department into a betstate of efficiency, and the selection of a Committee composed of three Ministers seems to me a very extraordinary method of endeavouring to elicit the truth. In the this Committee will sit in judgment, either upon the. present Postmaster General, who is a member of the Committee, or the late Postmaster-General. Both of these honourable gentlemen have the been in charge of the Department for two of or three years, to say nothing of previous periods; and it seems to me extraordinary an inquiry, which is intended to be thorough aind impartial, should be conducted by gentlemen who will have to sit in judgment on their colleagues. How can we expect, under these circumstances, a thorough investigation of abuses in the Department ?",18
48,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,I do not think that the right honourable gentleman is quite correct ; the inquiry is more as to the organization of the Department.,18
49,Mr REID,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"-But it is in regard to the. organization that complaint arises. No one would impute to any Postmaster-General any desire but to do the best for the Department. I am happy to say of all Ministers who have occupied office in the Commonwealth Government, that there is not one who has not been possessed by the most honourable desire to discharge his No personal question, I am sure, can arise in connection with either the late Postmaster General, the present Postmaster-General, any preceding Postmaster-General; but the public require something more than honourable intentions. What is desired is efficient administration; and there is not a Department, whether in the State or the Federal sphere, which is ini a state of greater chaos, or which is giving less satisfaction to the public, than the Department of the Postmaster-General. Mr STORRER.'- A good deal of that is caused through the Public Service Commissioner.",18
50,Mr REID,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I have no desire.to impute blame to any one, nor do I think the honourable member has any such desire; but the House and the public look for a proper inquiry in order to ascertain who is really at fault: There is no desire to prejudge; we begin with the feeling that the Department is in .a grossly disorganized condition and,"" without imputing any blame, we desire to know the cause of the dis-. organization. As I have already said, it seems to me an extraordinary way' of probing these matters, to appoint, as a Committee, three members of the Cabinet, who connot be expected, in the course of human nature-withou t any imputation against their integrity-to investigate in the same fearless way that some disinterested person would be able to do. The Postmaster General is just as much involved in this inquiry as any officer in the Department. .He is the head-centre of the whole; and his conduct is just as much a subject of inquiry as is the conduct of the humblest officer. What would be said, for instance, if any member of the Committee were in close relationship to the Secretary to the Department? We find, however, that the highest officer of all, on whom the whole burden of responsibility rests, is to be judged in a sort of Cabinet council by his own coilleagues. The very Minister .who is at the head of the Department, and whose'conduct must be the subject of inquiry, is one of. the persons'chosen to make the investigation; and in that respect we have a comicality that we should not expect to find outside the pages of Gilbert and Sullivan. There are complaints about the management of the Postmaster-General; and yet that honourable gentleman is deputed to inquire into the complaints; the personi who is himself accused of mismanagement-nothin g worse than errors of judgment, or, perhaps, want of capacity- is to be one of the judges; and how can we expect the public to be satisfied with such an inquiry? I cannot, a,t the present stage, refer to the Additional Estimates in detail; but everything that has - been said about sweating in the Departtnent, and about the miserable salaries paid, is justified by these Estimates. An enormous number of new officers are found to be necessary.",19
51,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Does that not show that we are taking the first step to reform?,19
52,Mr REID,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Does it not show that the officers of the Department have been sweated in the past? And, further, in spite of the fact that this large number of new officers are to be appointed, thousands of pounds are placed on the Additional Estimates to provide temporary assistance. What does that mean ? It means that the Department is escaping the necessity of properly manning and equipping the branches, by engaging a number' of employees who are not on the regular staff.",19
53,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,A number of the Sydney staff are working from six in the morning until ten at night.,19
54,Mr REID,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Without going into details, I may point out that there is a sum of ^20,000 on the Additional Estimates for further assistance in the case of New South Wales. This sum is in addition to the annual Estimates, and can only refer to. the - three months of April, May, and June of this year. ' Mr Mauger - That is really to make up for what was struck off' the main Estimates.",19
55,Mr REID,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"- I do not know by whom any votes were struck off the main Estimates ; the fact that the money is provided on the Additional Estimates shows that it has to be spent in the three months. If we multiply this ,£20,000 by four,, we have ,£80,000 which ought to have been spent in New South Wales alone in carrying on this service in a state of efficiency without overworking the men or cutting down salaries. This proposed vote is in itself a revelation, and the most damning proof of all that has been said about the disorganization in the Department. Can we expect Ministers to conduct a fearless inquiry into their own conduct and their own responsibilities? Personally, I have no such expectation. Just consider the magnitude of the responsibility that rests on the Postmaster-General. In my opinion, that Minister has greater pressure on him, in the wayof actual work and responsibility, than any other member of the Government. Of course, when a Tariff is under consideration, the Minister of Trade and Customs has to bear an enormous strain; but that can be regarded as a mere passing emergency. Taking the Departments in their normal state, there is not one in which the Minister has more do than has the Postmaster-General. I deed, there is.work in the Post and Telein the presence of the Minister? graph Department for, perhaps, two Minthe isters; and how is it possible for the master-General to act on this inquiry, which will involve enormous labour and re- .sitting over him? search, and, probably, visits to other of the Commonwealth. How can'he perly perform his departmental duties while he is engaged in a roving commission ? the Postmaster-'G'eneral were the ablest most industrious man in the world, and giving him credit for all the diligence ability he may possess, it would be physically and. "" intellectually impossible for him to carry on the every-day way work of this enormous Department all over Australia, and at the same time act as a capable and efficient presievery dent of the proposed' inquiry. .Surely in these matters we must act with some dim perception of business common sense? The mere fact that we are a Parliament surely ought not to divorce us from siderations of ordinary prudence. man who had an enormous business conI cern on his shoulders would dream of ing on some '.other enormous business, when his own concerns were more than enough to absorb all his energies abilities? The head of a business, if coterie. anything was wrong, and he himself could hands of some independent, not leave the helm, woulcl not leave to undertake inquiries in various branches. with the Department. He would prefer to exercise his own judgment upon investigations made by others, and he would desire to have them made as thoroughly and as fearlessly as possible. Suppose a report from the Committee comes before this House. The Postmaster-General cannot be exdo pected lo sit in judgment on his own report. What we want from the that Postmaster-General is that - when a rematter. port is presented to the Government, to Parliament, the honourable gentleman should have his head clear and free from' any concern but the investigation itselt, culty then. and should be able to give the Government the 'best advice on the report which has come before him."" But with the preparation of it he should have nothing whatever to do. , Hisfunction is a much higher one. The function of the Minister that of the Government is a much higher one than that of investigation, of going from one place to another, investigating alleged abuses, and examining clerks, hearing what the officers of the partment have to say. That is a to most important duty it is true; but n - what will be the position of a clerk Does honourable gentleman put an officer Postof his Department in a fair position when that officer has his Minister If his evidence parts is unpleasant to the Minister, if inprostead of saying smooth .and pleasant things, he has to say, in the course of his If duty, strong and rough things about the and way the Department is administered, ana about injustices which have occurred, how and can he be expected to do so before the Minister, who is sitting in judgment over him ? How can he give his evidence in the in which we shouldlike him to give it ? Every word said in commendation of the Department is a tribute to the Minister, word of criticism is a criticism of Ministers who have had charge of the Department. ' Is it not enough to ask an officer to criticise his superiors,"" without conhaving the Minister sitting in judgment What upon him? Is not that enough, I ask? wish to enter, on behalf of the Post and takTelegraph officers, and the telephone attendants, of all ranks, high and low, my most indignant protest against putting and them in the hands of a Ministerial They should be placed in the fearless it tribunal, which would have nothing to do Instead of that, they are to be brought in touch with the Minister, at a time when they should be most fearless, and when they should have some protection behind them in directing attention to. things which point to inefficiency of administration and t'o neglect. I not anticipate any good whatever from an inquiry so conducted. I quite agree the Ministry are in a difficulty in this Any Ministry is in such a position and when there are imputations against the efficiency of a Department. Every Ministry is necessarily put in a position of diffii f the power were proposed to be taken out of the hands of a Minister to deal with a Department-sa y by a Com- mittee of this House- I could quite understand the Ministry saying, "" We are responsible to Parliament; if you want to set and up a Committee in judgment upon us in the person of our Postmaster-General, we decline to occupy such a position."" But in this case that has not been done. The and House has not asked the Government Deto accept any position of indignity in anv shape or form. The Government themselves have done this. They have themselves considered it necessary to institute some authoritative inquiry. I say that if the Government came to the conclusion that an inquiry was necessary-that there were things that required to be probed and examined and reported upon-the next duty of the Ministry was to appoint some competent, disinterested, and impartial body to inquire into those matters, and to report upon them. But instead of the legitimate demands of the public being satisfied, instead of this House being guided in the way that it wanted guiding in dealing with these matters, we have had a Committee appointed which is bound to fail , because there is not the root idea of confidence and impartiality in the tribunal before whom the men upon whose testimony we rely will appear. Every one of these officers who appears, voicing the dissatisfaction and discontent of the Service, complaining of injustice, complaining of wrong, complaining of neglect, complaining of miserable administration in this business of the Post Office, .will be himself sat in' judgment upon by the Minister who conducts that Department. That is a very awkward position to put any man in. Instead of encouraging men to come and give us the benefit of their real honest knowledge and experience, the Ministry have appointed a. Committee which will destroy the possibility of our obtaining the testimony we wish to obtain.",19
56,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,There is not the faintest fear of anv such thing happening.,21
57,Mr REID,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"No ; in the heavenly region in which my honourable friend lives, it is impossible for any man to get a drink ! But. unfortunately, heavenly as are his ideas, men have some experience of public affairs. I suppose that I have had, probablv, a greater knowledge of the Public Service than any member of this House, because I was not only a Minister for many years, but I also had the honour of being a member of the Public Service in New South Wales for, I think, a period of fourteen years. ' Mr FAIRBAIRN - Was - the gentleman a member of the Post and Telegraph Service?",21
58,Mr REID,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"No ; I was not there. I had a softer billet than any billet in the Post and Telegraph Department seems-to be. In fact, it was so soft that. I could not stick to it ; I had to leave it. What I say about bringing members of the Public Service before a Committee such as this is, that if they are expected to make the freest, and fullest exposure of any irregularities in their Department, and of any shortcomings in their superiors, the Ministry should have had to examine them a Commission which would protect them in every possible way. They should not be called upon to criticise the man who sits in judg ment upon them. That is a monstrous position to put any public servant in. But that is the position these public servants will occupy. I do not expect a frank and fearless disclosure before such a Committee. It is no reflection on these public servants at all to say that one of the drawbacks to life in a business like theirs is this: I do not care how honourable you are, I do not care how fearless you are, and I do not care how able you are - yo u have always a row of men above you who have a tremendous influence over your future career. It is one of the painf u l incidents of the Public Service that the members of it have joined themselves to an occupation, during the whole course of which they must be under some oneundjj'r a number of superiors-prdbabl y each one of whom can have an unfavorable influence upon their career and advancement. That is in itself a sufficiently hard position for these officers of all ranks to be put in. I enter my emphatic protest against the nature of this Committee, and I wish to say that whatever they may do, .I am satisfied that the inquiry cannot be a thorough and fearless one.",21

I presume that the whole question is open on the amendment as well as on the original motion. - Mr Frazer - I am willing temporarily to withdraw the amendment if the honourable member thinks it would give him greater latitude.,21
60,Mr WH IRVINE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I do not wish the honourable member to withdraw his amendment; but if I am in order. I wish honourable to say a few words aboutwhat seems to me the somewhat extraordinary position into which the administration of the Post and Telegraph Department is drifting from ""a financial point of view. The figures are somewhat remarkable. I find that during the last year or two the expenditure has been increasing by leaps and bounds; not consistently with the natural expansion which takes place in the administration of a great Department like this, but to a very much greater degree than can be properly attributed to that cause. I wish to direct the attention of honourable members to a few of the figures, and to - ask the Postmaster-General if he can give the Committee some explanation of what they show. If I am wrong no doubt the honourable gentleman will set me right, but to put the matter shortly, what I find is that the revenue this year is estimated to have been increased by £ 1 7 8 , 0 0 0 , which represents an increase of 5.6 per cent. that is so, the expenditure of this Department as shown by the general Estimates, and without taking into account the Additional Estimates at all",21
61,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,We cannot deal with the Additional' Estimates until we come to them.,22
62,Mr WH IRVINE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"If the Treasurer will allow me, 1 will show how I propose to deal with them in a moment. I find that whilst the revenue has increased by only 5.6 per cent, on the revenue for last year, the Estimates which are now before the Committee, without taking into account the Additional Estimates laid on the table, show that the expenditure has increased by 7.8 per cent.  able member include in expenditure ? Mr WH IRVINE . - I am just going to tell the honourable member. I find, further, adopting the same rule and taking into account the statements placed before us by the Treasurer as. to the Additional Estimates, which will involve the Committee voting £ 1 0 7 , 0 0 0 more, that, whilst the revenue will have been increased by 5.6 per cent., the expenditure will have been increased by no less than 11.5 per cent, in the one year.",22
63,Mr TILLEY BROWN,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Nearl y double the increase in revenue.,22
64,Mr WH IRVINE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Yes . nearly double that increase. I find, also, that the number of officers employed in the Post and Telegraph Department will have been increased by over 1,500 in number, or by 14.4 per cent., in the one year. Sir. WILLIAM LYNE - - I do not wish to interrupt the honourable member, but, if his speech is to go without challenge, there must be a general debate at this stage on the Additional Estimates.",22
65,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Not at all.,22
66,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Yes , there must be. The honourable member for Flinders has the whole Department. quoted figures based upon the Additional Estimates, and it will be necessary for in following him,, to quote my own figures, which I intended to quote only when submitting the Additional Estimates. The speech which the honourable member is making, if permitted to continue, must lead to a general debate on the Additional - Estimates at this stage, as well as when those Estimates are immediately before the Committee. Mr W . H . IRVINE - On the point of order, I should like to say that I have no wish to adopt any course which would emBut whilst barrass Ministers or the Committee in the discussion of this - matter. If it would better meet the wishes of the Committee, I am prepared to postpone my remarks On this subject until we are dealing with the Additional Estimates.",22

68,Mr WH IRVINE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I claim only that, either now or when we deal with the' Additional Estimates, or at some other time, I shall have the right to discuss the general financial aspect of this most important Department.",22
69,Mr REID,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,I doubt whether the honourable member could discuss it on the Additional Estimates.,22
70,Mr WH IRVINE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"My fear is that if my remarks are postponed until the A dditional Estimates are before the Committee, it may then be pointed out that I should have Taised the question which I desire to raise on the general Estimates.",22
71,Mr REID,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,The discussion will be limited to the Additional Estimates when we come to deal with them.,22
72,The CHAIRMAN,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I cannot tell at the present moment how far the Additional Estimates goj but, seeing that we are now engaged-upon the general discussion on the Estimates of the Post and Telegraph Department, I think it would be convenient at this stage for the honourable member for Flinders to raise the question he proposes to raise, and to have it discussed and done with. I understand that there is no vote in the Additional Estimates affecting the Secretary and the administrative branch of the Department.",22
73,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Oh , yes, there is.",22

Though shall not. of course, permit hini to go the details of the Additional Estimates, long as the honourable member confines himto self to generalities, I shall allow him proceed.",23
83,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"It is a most unlike usual course. Mr WH IRVINE' - The position desire to establish is that whilst the revehow nue has increased only by the comparatively small amount of 5.6 per cent, last 'year's figures, and whilst we might naturallv expect the expenditure also to increase in the same reasonable proportion, I paid out find that if we take the Additional Estimates into account, the expenditure has increased by the very extraordinary of 11.5 per cent, in one year. The honourable member for Grey asked'me what I have terjection. included in expenditure, and the question is a-very pertinent one. The difficulty which we all find ourselves in discussing the Estimates of the Post and Telegraph Department is that the accounts of the partment-and I am not blaming the Goconcern, vernment in this matter, because""they only 'following the - rule-ar e not sented to the Committee in such a way as economicall y to enable honourable members toform an inEstelligible idea of the working of the Deit partment from a financial point of view, as certainly would be able to do if they were dealing with the accounts of any ordiI join with the honourable member for Fawkner and other - honourable members who have preceded me in urging the necessity of as soon as posas sible endeavouring to present .the figures of the Post and Telegraph Department as the accounts of a going concern, so that we might be able to see what is properly attributable to expenditure, and what",23
84,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Hear , hear. We have the distaken steps in that direction.",23
85,Mr WH IRVINE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I am very glad to hear' it, and I shall be glad to hear some details as to the steps which have taken - At present we are in the dark, and must make the best conjecture we can. The great difficulty is that in of addition to the total expenditure of the dealDepartment which is shown on page 44 of the Budget papers,- a very large sum appears under the heading of "" New Works and Additions."" Parliament in its wisdom has adopted the policy that these should be paid for out of revenue- a very wise policy in .which I think we should all concur as far as it can practicably be done-bu t payI ing them out of revenue does not in the into least mean that they ought to be debited so to revenue in a capital account. To order see whether the Post Office is really workto ing as a business concern ought to work, it is essential that there should be something a capital and revenue account-som e means by which we should be able tb see 1 I how much is attributable to revenue and much ought to be put down to capital.",23
86,Mr BOWDEN,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Then you want some over sinking fund for your capital.,23
87,Mr WH IRVINE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Precisel y so.,23
88,Mr FISHER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,A sinking fund for money of revenue?,23
89,Mr WH IRVINE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,The honourable amount member does not quite follow me.,23
90,Mr FISHER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,I was questioning the in,23
91,Mr WH IRVINE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I agree with the in honourable member to some extent that an actual sinking fund, is not necessary to provide for the repayment of money which is Denot borrowed. But if you have a going it does not matter where you get are the money from, if you want to see prewhether the Post Office is working",23
92,Mr FISHER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I agree wholly with the honourable member's argument, but I do not agree with the necessity for a sinking fund for money which is paid out of revenue.",24
93,Mr WH IRVINE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"The honourable member is quite right in the abstract, but although you may not have a sinking fund, you ought to debit expenditure of that kind to capital. This year a sum of £ 4 3 4 , 0 0 0 is paid out of the revenue of this year towards this expenditure of the Department. The House has declared that it should be paid out of revenue, and I think I should be quite justified in asserting that the House, in saying that it ought to be debited to the annual expenditure, has also expressed the opinion that it ought to be paid out of the annual revenue, but I do not think it would be quite fair to do so in dealing with the accounts of the Post Office as a business concern, because a good deal of the money which is expended out of revenue is expenditure which is ordinarily met by payment out of moneys borrowed.",24
94,Sir JOHN FORREST,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,I do not think so. We never did such a thing in Western Auscommencing tralia.,24

If a business firm builds house out of revenue, or sets of a comparatively enduring character, it would not be proper to debit of the ordinary annual expenditure. ought to be spread over a number of years. I am making this allowance, which diminonly ishes the strength of my case, but I think it is a fair one to make.",24

101,Mr WH IRVINE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I am making this calculation in the absence of any authoritative exposition from the responsible Minister and his officers. We ought to have an authoritative statement from him, with the assistance of his officers, of what ought to be taken as the period over which these expenditures are supposed to be serviceable.",24
102,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"We ought to have the annual report, which has been promised now for five years.",24
103,Mr WH IRVINE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Yes . I think I am making a very liberal allowance indeed when, instead of attributing the whole of t n e £434JOOO to this year, I attribute only one-tenth of it to this year.",24
104,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Hear , hear.",24
105,Mr WH IRVINE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I am glad that the Minister agrees with that statement. There will be found on page 45 of the Budget papers what is called a comparison of the years 1901 to 1908, and under the head of Postmaster-General appear on that page the various sums which in each of those years was expended out of revenue towards "" New Works and Additions,"" with a moderate sum in 1901-2, and reaching a very large amount this year. the first year the total was , £ 3 7 , 0 0 0 ; in 1:902-3 it was £ i 3 5 > ° ° ° ; in i9°3-4 8 7 , 0 0 0 ; in 1904-5, £ 1 3 1 , 0 0 0 ; in I < 5 £146.000; and in 1906-7, 6 , 0 0 0 , while this year it is £ 4 3 4 , 0 0 0 . in I am quite prepared to admit that instead of attributing the whole of the ,£434,000",24

107,Mr WH IRVINE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I was not aware v the I have taken. If then we ought to place a only 10 per cent, of that sum to the exup machinery penditure of this year",24
108,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,",£52,000 , including the that as part Additional Estimates. It Mr WH IRVINE - But the Minister has forgotten that if this vear has to bear one-tenth of its own expenditpre, it must bear also one-tenth of each of the expenditures of the preceding years, because if each of these sums has to be spread in instalments over ten years, then every year must bear not only its own tenth but a tenth of the expenditure of each year which has a moderate not been full y met.",24
109,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Every year would vary,24
110,Mr WH IRVINE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Every year the sum has been increasing.,24
111,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,And so have the receipts.,25
112,Mr WH IRVINE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"T r u e . I have given the Minister the benefit of the smaller expenditures in previous years, and instead of taking the average of the last three or four years, have gone back to the beginning, taking the weak as well as the strong years. Upon that basis, and assuming that we are justified in saying that these expenditures are of a kind that ought to be spread over ten years, the expenditure this year, instead of being ,£434,000, comes to ,£134,000- I arrive at that sum by adding up all those expenditures and taking one-tenth of them-and not ,£52,000 as suggested by the Minister. If that is not a fair mode of trying to reduce this to a business proposition, I should like to have some other suggestion from those who are responsible for carrying on the Department. I am glad that the Minister agrees with me in the. estimate which 1, quite independently, arrived at, of what ought to be attributed to each year.",25
113,Mr FISHER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"A strong combination. Mr VV. H . IRVINE - I should regard it as a very feeble combination if I had not the Minister's concurrence. amount has then to be added to the expenditure of this year. In order to make a fair comparison you must also add to the expenditure of last year itsproper share of the additions which had been paid for in that year and in the preceding years, and so on back to the beginning. By so doing, you will arrive at a proper account. Without wearying honourable members by going into the actual calculation, which every one can make for himself from pages 44 and 45 of the Budget papers, I find the result to be as I have stated-that the expenditure has been increased by ,£219.000 this year. Last year's expenditure, as appears from page 44 of the Budget papers, was .£2,689,000. I have to add to that year its tenth of the various payments for preceding years.",25
114,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Not the whole of it , because a portion of the tenth is payinji-off the principal, and it would be reduced.",25
115,Mr WH IRVINE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"The amount of one-tenth, which ought to be attributed to expenditure each year includes the tenth of each preceding year. I have added up the various tenths which ought to have been attributed to last year-the figures are all to be found in the Budgetpapers - and I find that they amount to ,£91,000. That sum, added to ihe £ 2 , 6 8 9 , 0 0 0 , would produce ,£2,780,000. During the present financial year, adding the ,£134,000-whic h represents its proportion-to the £ 2 , 8 6 5 , 0 0 0 , gives us a total of ,£2,999,000. I find, therefore, that these Estimates-withou t touching the Additional Estimates at all-represen t an increased expenditure of £^219,000, which is equal to 7.8 per cent. So that in respect of these Estimates alone, without taking into account one penny of the £ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 additional which is being expended, we find that whilst the revenue has increased by only 5.6, the expenditure has increased by 7.8 per cent.",25
116,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,For this year as against last year?,25
117,Mr WH IRVINE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Of course. It is a fair thing to assume that the expenditure will increase in a growing concern,25
118,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"But not in the, same ratio.",25
119,Mr WH IRVINE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Not in anything like the same ratio. It ought to increase at a less ratio than that at which the revenue increases.,25
120,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,This expenditure represents accumulated arrears.,25
121,Mr WH IRVINE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,I must confess That that if one wishes to ascertain anything from the Budget papers-and the same remark is applicable to all Budget papers  able member himself.,25
122,Mr WH IRVINE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"If one wishes to ascertain any special information from the Budget papers-and a similar remark is applicable to all Budget papers, my own included-h e has to worry through them from beginning to end before he can achieve his purpose.  member think that that state of affairs is brought about intentionally? Tvlr. W. H . IRVINE - I never brought it about intentionally, but I will not answer for other Ministers. Of course, the Postmaster-General may have a complete reply to my remarks",25
123,Mr THOMAS,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,The Postmaster-General will make the position quite clear directly.,25
124,Mr WH IRVINE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"No doubt. When we come to the Additional Estimates, we find that they provide for an increase in the ordinary expenditure of the Department of ,£107,000, in addition to an expenditure of £ 6 3 , 0 0 0 upon new works, without one single farthing being added to the revenue. But I put aside for the moment the £ 6 3 , 0 0 0 provided for additional works-the whole of which ought not to be contributed by this year, but only one-tenth of it-as immaterial.",25
125,Sir JOHN FORREST,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Will that money be spent this year?,26

127,Mr FISHER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,And recurring expenditure. Mr VV. H . IRVINE - It is rather important that we should know whether or not it is recurring expenditure. that that additional expenditure provides for the employment of no less than 900 additional hands-ne w men who are coming in at the fifth class,26
128,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,It provides for 905 ditional officers.,26
129,Mr WH IRVINE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"T h u s we find, that, though upon the ordinary Estimates the expenditure has increased by 7.8 per cent., as against an increase in revenue of 5.6 per cent., the Government now ask US'-practicall y in the tenth month of the financial year-for an additional ,£107,000 - which , presumably, will all be expended within the next two or three months-and which will bring the expenditure up to 11.5 per cent., or practically double the whole of the increased revenue.",26
130,Mr TILLEY BROWN,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Where is this sort of thing to end ?,26
131,Mr WH IRVINE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Exactly . I am quite prepared to admit that in a great Department like the Post Office, and in a progressive country like Australia, there must be a continual, steady increase of expenditure in proportion to the revenue Teceived. But I think it has always been the endeavour of every Department, and of every Minister, to see that, as far as possible, the increased expenditure shall bear a reasonable ratio to the increased revenue - that it shall, if anything, be somewhat less. J",26

As yet, we have had no really satisfactory information upon the subject. No one will welcome such information more than I shall, but I thought it necessary to put these plain figures before the Committee, in order to elicit information.",26

160,The CHAIRMAN,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I took it that the Treasurer was merely mentioning incidentWe ally that there is provided a certain sum, out of which, I presume, so much is required for the Post and Telegraph Department.

162,The CHAIRMAN,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"The Committee is circulation ? now considering the Estimates relating to the Postmaster-General's Department, and so long as the Treasurer confines himself to Hansard. them he will be quite in order.",28

I have here a-statement which shows the increase of revenue and expendithat ture. I am sorry thafj I did not know that the discussion was likely to take this trend, full grip and control. otherwise I would have referred to these items before the honourable member for member blame? Flinders spoke, as I could have given him a good deal of detailed information cerning the matters on which, he spoke generally. Mr VV. H . IRVINE - But there is ditional revenue ?",28
166,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Yes . I shall state the revenue presently, because I had a return prepared' up to able members are aware, through the press, that.some attacks have been made upon me because I would not and could not provide money enough to supply the requirements of this Department during the last seven or eight months. I propose to quote some . £ figures in order to show how the depart9°3-4> mental expenditure has grown since 1900-1, , £ 2 [361]- 2 it was ,£2,595,860.

167,Mr MCWILLIAMS,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,It is about time the I honourable gentleman took a pull on it .,28
168,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I am not complaining of any one, except that I have my sir, I own ideas about certain things.",28
169,Mr WH IRVINE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,To gain what in this crease of revenue?,28
170,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,I shall come,28
171,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Are those ideas for,28
172,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,I am submitting the figures so that they shall appear in,28
173,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"The honourable genamounttleman said just now that he' had some ideas of his own, and I wish to know if 'he will jcommunicate them to the Committee ?",28
174,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Not at the present juncture. The reason why I am into this detail is because I have to protect myself as Treasurer against the for large increases of expenditure head of which are coming forward.,28
175,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,The honourable genmeans that he has to protect himself against the Postmaster-General?,28
176,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,No . My honourable colleague and I get oni very well indeed. I am not blaming him. I recognise it is very difficult for an honourable ' member who is new to the position to have 1 ,28
177,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"r - I do not blame conthe honourable member except to a small extent, because sometimes he asks for works to be done which might be delayed a little, no adand that is the case with a large number of honourable members:  have honourable gentleman think that my condate. Honorstituents sent me here?",28
178,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"On e reason was that the honourable member might get all that he could out of the Treasury for them. In the year 1900-1, the revenue from the Department was £ 2 , 2 6 9 , 5 0 2 ; in 1901-2, 2 , 3 7 2 , 8 6 1; in 1902-3, ,£2,404,730; in I ;£ :5 J 3> 2 IO 2 0 in I 9°4""5. , 6 3 2 , 5 5 1; in 1905-6, £ 2 , 8 2 4 , 3 4 8 ; and in 1906-7, £3,129,074; while the. revenue for 1907-8, is estimated at ,£3,297,000. At the end of the present financial year the difference between the increase of expenditure and the increase of receipts will be £364,804,. not including interest on buildings, that is to say, the expenditure has increased by £532,730 in .1907-8,' while the receipts have increased by only ,£167,926, the difference being £[364,804.",28
179,Mr REID,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Then the Government will not propose to reduce the revenue by the adoption of penny postage?,29
180,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,I am not going to deal with that matter now.,29
181,Mr MCWILLIAMS,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Can the honourable gentleman state what profits were made by the Department under State control ?,29
182,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"That information has been given previously, and I do not wish to overweight this statement. The increase in the number of persons employed ""in the Department of the Postmaster-General is most serious. This increase in employees is necessary; but the only reason that can justify it is that previously, as the Postmaster-General says, the Department was starved.",29
183,Mr REID,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Then this Government has been starving it.,29
184,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"In the year 1900-1 the number of. permanent employees was 9,930. Ih 1901-2 the number on the Estimates was 10,132; in 1902-3, 10,259; in 1903-4, 10,498; in 1904-5, 10,772; in 1905-6, 10,759; in 1906-7, 10,932; and in 1907-8, 12,506; an increase in one year of 1,574; whereas the previous average annual increase has been 168. The average salary was, in .1902-3, £[121, and in I 9°7-8, £[127, though in the two previous years it stood at .£133. The appointments made recently, however, have been chiefly to the lower grades of the service. When making my Budget statement, I said that I had been asked to sanction the appointment of 1,000 new hands, to which I demurred ; but I found myself compelled to make provision for the appointment of 669, apportioned among the States as follows: - Ne w South Wales, 267; Victoria, 222; Queensland, 103; South Australia, 17 ; Western Australia, 25; and Tasmania, 35. During the year, I have been repeatedly applied to by the Postal Department to sanction further expenditure, and the advances which I made over and above the provision on the Estimates practically exhausted my account. But the applications - to me were so repeated and so forcible that I was bound to do the best I could. The number of temporary hands actually employed on the 31st December last was 1,908, of whom 883 were being employed in New South Wales, 300 in Victoria, 220 in Queensland, 95 in South Australia, 321 in Western Australia, and 89 in Tasmania.",29
185,Mr MCWILLIAMS,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"The 1,574 permanent hands will take the place of temporary hands'?",29
186,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"The Postmaster-General will be able to supply those details. I asked the Public Service Commissioner to inquire into the ground for every recommendation made to me, and allowed provision to 'be made only on his certificate; but I found the money for every appointment which he certified to be necessary. I therefore provided for 183 new officers out of the Treasurer's Advance. The Additional Estimates provide for 905 officers, including the 183. These offi-cers are distributed among the States as follows :-In New South Wales, 480; in Victoria, 315; in Queensland, 40; in South Australia, 43; in Western Australia, 5; and in Tasmania, 22. Adding these to the number provided in the Estimates-inChief, provision in the total Estimates for the current year has been made for 1,574 new permanent appointments. Of these, New South Wales has 747, Victoria 537, Queensland 143, South Australia 60, Western Australia 30, and Tasmania 57. Other appointments to the service do not exceed 60.",29
187,Mr WH IRVINE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,I was right in saying that the increase in the Postal Department is equal to about 15 per cent.,29
188,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Not one too many.,29
189,Mr WH IRVINE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,That is another matter. The Committee expects an explanation from the Postmaster-General. It is not getting one from the Treasurer.,29
190,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"When the draft Additional Estimates were sent to me from the Department, although the Postmaster-General was very desirous of obtaining additional expenditure, I found it necessary to reduce his estimates by £[73,000. I did that, making what I deemed to be a safe calculation as to the revenue which I should receive, and the amount I should have to expend out of the Commonwealth one-fourth. I gave the Postmaster-General credit for £17,000 in connection with transfers from London, which he has paid into the revenue, though I declined to do so at first.",29
191,Sir JOHN FORREST,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,There will be no money for the Surplus Revenue Bill to deal with if the Treasurer expends all his revenue.,30
192,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Unless the Surplus Revenue Bill is passed, some of the appropriations will lapse, and I do not wish that to come about. If that happened, the money would have to be revoted next year, which would swell .the Estimates of Expenditure for that year.",30
193,Sir JOHN FORREST,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Nex t year will bear only its own expenditure.,30
194,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"It would bear its own expenditure, but, if we do not spend the money that we vote, and ths vote lapses, we shall have to find"" the money out of next year's revenue for a vote made this year. In order to show how I have had regard to next year's expenditure, I may say that the Post and Telegraph Department desired me to provide £300,000 more this year for works that would not be commenced until next year, and that I refused to accede to the request.",30
195,Mr REID,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,It would be a silly business ^to vote money this year for works next year.,30
196,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I do not know that it would be silly, and I only mention the fact in order to show that the Department contemplates a great expenditure next year.",30
197,Sir JOHN FORREST,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Where is the sense of such a request?,30
198,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,I do not know.,30
199,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,The idea was to ask Parliament to authorize works so that money could be spent in the year in which the money was voted.,30
200,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"As I said before, I only mention the fact to show that we may expect some large works next year. Mr Webster:-The ' two Ministers appear to be getting mixed !",30
201,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"That is not so; I have had these matters too much under consideration to get mixed. In conclusion of my remarks upon this particular question, I desire to say that the large increase of permanent employees is to me a source of great concern, and I have agreed to the proposal only in consequence of the continued assertion that the Post and Tele - 1 graph Department cannot be efficiently carried on without those extra appointments, 'and that the - employment of so - many temporary hands is not conducive to economical working.",30
202,Mr REID,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Has the honourable gentleman put that statement in writing ?,30
203,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I have, because I desire it to bekept as a record. I do not wish it to be possible for the right honourable member for East Sydney, or any other honourable member, five or six years hence, if I live so long, to point to me as the Treasurer who was responsible for this increase of expenditure. I have known such a thing done; and, therefore, I protect myself on this occasion. I think it is quite true that the employment of so many temporary hands is not conducive to economical working. Permanent hands doubtless work better; and, if they do not fully know their duties at first, they very soon learn them, and in many respects are preferable to temporary officers:",30
204,Mr WH IRVINE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,That is a very good justification for substituting permanent men for temporary men.,30
205,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I am advised that, as occasion presents itself, the number of temporary hands will be reduced very considerably, and that that is the justification for the increase in the number of permanent hands.",30
206,Mr BATCHELOR,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Would not the argument of the Minister apply to the increase in the number of permanent hands, to which he says he objects?",30
207,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I do not ob"" ject; I am merely giving the information as to the number required, and a warning that the matter must be carefully looked into.  crease in the number of temporary employees ?",30
208,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Yes ; and I may say that, as Treasurer, I have had to find, I think, £[25,000 more than was voted on that scqre. When I asked Why the increased number was necessary, I was told, in addition to the reasons I have already given, that the volume of business was so great as to necessitate the, appointments; and, as I could not provide for the full increase of permanent employee's, temporary appointments were made in the meantime. My contention is that, after the number of permanent employees appointed, the number of temporary employees ought to be reduced very considerably. It must not be forgotten that the last year or two have been boom years, and, if bad seasons come, a large army of permanent employees may prove embarrassing.' I think that the right honourable member for East Sydney has had some experience of similar conditions arising in New South when the number of public servants had be reduced. It is asserted that in the the Departments have been starved ployes, and thus there arises the demand for such a large increase this year. But it must not be forgotten that the demand for works expenditure has been very large, and, in my opinion, we ought too much expenditure into one year, but, if possible, let each year bear a fair of the increase. I cannot resist giving warning that' the rushing up of expendiaccount ture may prove the high road to a very strong retrenchment agitation.",30
209,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Is the Minister vear ? giving a quotation, or reading words which he himself has written?",31
210,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"In the last be half-minute or so I have read what I Telegraph have myself written. The works expenditure in the Post and Telegraph Department in 1902-3 was £135,699; in £187,809; in 1904-5, it was ^131,829; in 1905-6 it was £[146,575; in 1906-7 it was £[275,783; and in 1907-8 it was sence £524,699, the last mentioned sum 'made up of original Estimates £434,078, and Additional Estimates £90,621. This shows an increase over last year £[250,000.",31
211,Mr WH IRVINE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"In my calculation, I have deducted only £135,000 £[524,000.",31
212,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"In order to arGeneral rive at the position as to the last year, there must be deducted £[275,000 odd. I should have liked to deal with the Defence Estimates now, so' as to have placed the whole financial position before office. honourable members, but that is not possible at the present stage.",31
213,Mr REID,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Will the Treasurer give a list of the items that constitute posed expenditure of £[250,000 on Defence ?",31
214,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Yes ; but, as say, I cannot do it at the present stage. As Treasurer, I feel that, in the face of increasing expenditure, without correspondthe ing increase of revenue, as we had last year and one or two years before, we be very careful what is done regarding these Estimates. I admit that the Post and Telegraph Department is perhaps the most difficult to manage, not only by the Minister, but by the heads of the branches. be improved. The services of the Department are so far-reaching throughout the continent, requires very close organization in order to Wales, secure efficiency and success. to Mr W, H . IRVINE - Does not the Treapast sury keep the accounts of the Post and in em-- Telegraph Department ? Sir WILLI AM LYNE - Yes .",31
215,Mr WH IRVINE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Is there no regular account kept in the Treasury of the expenditure and revenue of the Post and not to force Telegraph Department? Sir WILLI AM LYNE - All the revenue share has to be paid into the Treasury. a - Mr WH IRVINE - But is there no kept of how much of the expenditure on the new works and buildings is to be attributed to the expenditure in any one,31
216,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,I have not. made any attempt' to keep such an account; but what I do think is that there ought to an annual report from the Post and Department:,31
217,Mr REID,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Containing all the informa1903-4, it was tion now suggested.",31
218,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"The Postmaster-General is not to blame for the abof a report, and I know that its prebeing paration would be difficult.",31
219,Mr REID,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Why has the Treasurer not made the suggestion to those Ministers on pf about whom he has been trampling? Sir WILLI AM LYNE - I have not been trampling on any Ministers- I am the most docile man in the world. All I desire from theis to protect myself.,31
220,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"If the Postmasteris not to blame for the absence of increase over a report, who is?",31
221,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,The present Postmaster-General has not been long in,31
222,Mr REID,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Who is the other fellow? Sir WILLI AM LYNE - The Department cannot be worked by the Postmasterus General alone; he must have the assistance the proof the heads of branches.,31
223,Mr REID,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,And the Postmaster-General I has taken the position on a Committee of Inquiry in order to fill up his spare time !,31
224,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"And I think Postmaster-General will do a considerable amount of good on that Committee of must Inquiry. I do not agree with honourable members who are pf opinion that this committee will result in no good; because the object is to ascertain where the public are dissatisfied, and where the organization can",31
225,Mr REID,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,The Postmaster-General has that it not time for that work.,31
226,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,The members of the Committee have taken the responsibility on themselves.,32
227,Mr BATCHELOR,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,And I have no doubt .they will satisfy themselves.,32
228,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I was pressed to become a member, but I did not feel - disposed to accept the invitation.",32
229,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,We shall find when it is all over that the Committee will report that they ought to remove themselves from office!,32
230,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I do not think they would be justified in making any such recommendation. However, I have thought fit to put"" the position clearly before Parliament and the .country, seeing that, during the last few months, I have done my best to keep down expenditure in every possible way. I have been blamed for doing this by those who did not know the financial position of the Commonwealth, It is very hard, indeed, to meet such a large increase of expenditure in one year, unless there is a very elastic revenue; and had it .not been for the elastic revenue obtained since the imposition of the present so-called terrible Tariff, I do not know how we - should have dealt with the expenditure of the Post and Telegraph Department. There has been a great clamour for works in this Department, and my reference to the honourable member for Maranoa applies to almost every other honourable member. The desire amongst us_ is that our constituents shall be properly looked after in the way of Post and Telegraph facilities.",32
231,Mr WEBSTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,We desire to see public served. ,32
232,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Quite true, and the honourable member's constituents are part of the public. I hope-I have put the position clearly before honourable members, and shown that I have restrained, in part at any rate, excessive expenditure in connection with this great Department. But I do urge on that Department- I have urged it many times privately upon my colleague the Postmaster-General; and he is taking the right course now-to see whether there is not some fault in connection with, the details of its . work. That is where is seems to me that there is some fault. I am anxious to see the Department give satisfaction to the public, and equally anxious to see an expansion of conveniences, as far as it is possible to extend them, from one end of the continent to the other. But we cannot expect that to be done without finding the money. It is thus that I have had to find more money than was anticipated by anyone during the present year, and have had to bring down these Additional Estimates. The Committee now know the whole position in which the Department stands. - Mr Mauger (Maribyrnong-Post master-General) [4.51] - I do not propose to deal with thefigureswhich have been given to the Committee by the honourable member for Flinders and by the Treasurer. My honourable, friends have given the increases in lump sums. I propose to give them in percentages, both in regard to revenue and expenditure. The revenue for 1902-3 showed an increase-of 1.34 per cent, over the revenue for 1901-2; of 4.39 per cent, in 1903-4, over the previous year; of 4.87 per cent, in 1904-5; of 7.29 per cent, in i905r6; and of 10.79 P . er c e n t - i 1906-7. n This year it is estimated that the increase will be approximately 5.38 per cent.  the whole service?",32
233,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"They are the increases in receipts for the years mentioned, over the previous year's receipts. I will next give in percentages the increase in expenditure. Honourable members must . bear in mind that we are now paying out of revenue for works. which were previously, paid for out of loan money.",32
234,Mr REID,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Has the Commonwealth had any loans at all ?,32
235,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"No , .but in the State days many of these works were paid for the out of loans. In 1902-3 the increased expenditure over 1901-2 was 4.09 per cent. in 1903-4, 5.01 per cent.; in 1904-5, 0.08 per cent.; in 1905-6, 3.15 per cent.; in 1906-7, 6.50 per cent. In other words, in 1906-7 the expenditure increased by 6.50 per cent., whereas the receipts increased by, nearly 11 per cent.",32
236,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Can the Minister give us approximately the anticipated revenue and expenditure for the current year - I mean the ratio?,32
237,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,I cannot give that for this year.,32
238,Mr REID,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Do those increases to which the Minister refers show increases of expenditure for one year over the year before ? . Mr Mauger - Yes .,32
239,Mr REID,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Includin g expenditure on works and everything else?,32
240,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Includin g works and everything. The increase of revenue in 1906-7 over 1901-2 was £[756,213, or -31.86 per cent. The increase of expenditure for 1906-7 over 1901-2 was 20.17 P er cent., or £497>979",32
241,Mr JOSEPH GOOK,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"That does not look like starving the Department-a n increased expenditure of 20 per cent, to get 30 per cent, more revenue; and that in a booming time. It cannot be said that that looks like a starved service.",33
242,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"It certainly is not by any means an inflated service, especially when honourable members bear in mind that tn the year 1904-5 we had practically no increase of expenditure at all. That is where the trouble has arisen. 'During the last three years the sum asked for by the Post and Telegraph Department has been continually reduced; and last year we found that the abnormal increase of business and the shortage of officers brought us close to a condition of things that could not continue. There, were complaints all round the House.",33
243,Mr REID,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Why did the Government continually reduce expenditure when it was wanted ?,33
244,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Because the who preceded the previous Treasurer, having only a certain amount of money to - spend, cut down the Department's Estito mates. - Mr Reid - The Cabinet is all one, the Minister should recollect. You cannot reading. .split a Cabinet. - Mr Mauger - My honourable friend, does has asked me the reason, and I have told the transferred him' plainly. Some of the reasons 'for this increased expenditure date back Federal days. Just previous to Federation matter of the transferred buildings quite a number of telegraph and telephone settled up? lines were starved. Some of the poles are now rotten. We have to"" face an abnormal include expenditureto' put these works into - efficient condition. We have had to an abnormal expenditure in regard to works in New South Wales, South Australia, and Victoria.",33
245,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Abnormal in Sydney ?,33
246,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,In the way of underditure grounding.,33
247,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"It was done, to great extent, before the Department was taken over.",33
248,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"To some extent, it was done in Sydney, but not in Adelaide Melbourne; and, especially in Melbourne, the undergrounding has been a cause of great expenditure.",33
249,Mr WH IRVINE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Will the Minister allow me to say that in >the calculations which I laid before the Committee I only debited the year's accounts with 10 per cent, of that expenditure.",33
250,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I have had made a calculation something' like that of the honourable member, on the basis of 10 per cent. In the appropriation for 1907-8, salaries and ' contingencies, & c , amount to £[2,865,109, and Additional Estimates amount' to £107,720. Ten per cent, onnew works-appropriatio n for 1907-8, £[434,078; and Additional Estimates, £90,621-woul d be .£52,470. Add that to the £2,865,109 and the ,£107,720, and the total is .£3,025,299. That calculation would give us an excess of revenue for the present year, over the expenditure, of £272,113; the estimated revenue being £3,297,412. I fully agree with the honourable member for Flinders in regard to the necessity for the 'preparation of an annual report. But such a report must, of course, be based upon reliable data.",33
251,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"So far, the Minister has only agreed with the idea; he has Treasurer - not done the thing.",33
252,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Unti l we get our works and buildings transferred definitely the Commonwealth, and know exactly our capital expenditure, it is quite impossible to have a report that would be worth",33
253,Mr WH IRVINE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Surely not. The matter to which the Minister has referred not affect the question. The interest on buildings is a fixed sum. to presheet could be said to bey fair,33
254,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Surel no balanceuntil the is,33
255,Mr WH IRVINE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,The Minister could the interest on those buildings in an his balance-sheet. That does not in the face slightest degree affect the matter ,33
256,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I quite admit that an annual report is necessary, and should be provided. I hope that it will be provided next year. We ought to have approximately a statement of receipts and expenfor the various branches of the Department. We ought to know the profits a which we are making on the telephone services, or the losses to be debited to it. , Mr Webster - Do we not know that?",33
257,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,It is quite impossible and under present circumstances.,33
258,Mr WEBSTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,I heard the Minister declare the other night that the telephone service was all right.,33
259,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,We are surely discussing a business matter in a business-like way.,34
260,Mr REID,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,The remark of the honourable member for Gwydir was a sensible one.,34
261,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,I think it will be found that the telephone branch is the best paying branch in the service.,34
262,Mr WEBSTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,How does the Minister know that?,34
263,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I make the statement from my knowledge of the Department. A statement regarding the various branches of the Department must, 'however, under the best of conditions, be approximate. Even in the central office, officers are continually dividing their time between the various branches of the Department; and that remark applies particularly to the larger country offices.",34
264,Mr BOWDEN,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,The Minister could separate telephones and telegraphs almost entirely.,34
265,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I do not know that we could do that. We intend to try to do it, but the figures will be only approximate.  telephone work is combined with the telegraph work.",34
266,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,That is where the difficulty arises.,34
267,Mr BOWDEN,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,What I ' meant was that it is quite possible to separate telephones and telegraphs from the purely postal work.,34
268,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"That can be more easily accomplished., but even a statement on those lines would beapproximate. I mav add that in the last report of the Post and Telegraph Department of the United States, it is pointed out that, although the Department has been in existence for over 100 years, they are only now taking the initial steps to do the very thing that my friend, the honourable member for Flinders, asks us to do.",34
269,Mr WH IRVINE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Does the Minister mean that we are to wait 100 years for a proper balance-sheet?,34
270,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"No ; but it has to be remembered that we have had to amalgamate the post and telegraph affairs of six States, and that we. have had to do our work in the face of shortage of money, whilst we have paid for the whole of our new works out of revenue. That is a very great accomplishment in itself, and could not be done without very great difficulty. But I fully agree with the business priivciples laid down by the honourable member for Flinders. Already we have taken steps to take a tally during the coming year of the work done by the officers of the various branches, and to debit each Department 1 with the cost of the work done for it.",34
271,Mr REID,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"The Minister will want another 10,000 officers to do all that.",34
272,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,It is quite impossible to arrive at an approximate estimate unless it'is done.,34
273,Mr REID,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,The Minister should not. go into too many details of that kind.,34
274,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,It is impossible to arrive at an estimate unless we determine the basis upon which it is to be built.,34
275,Mr REID,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Do not carry it too far.,34
276,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"We shall try not to carry it too far, but the estimate of the cost of branches must be reasonably approximate to be of any value whatever.",34
277,Mr REID,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"On important matters, yes.",34
278,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"If the present Estimates are considered in the light of the observations of the honourable member for Flinders, it will be found that this excess revenue-,£272,113-wil l practically, allow of the payment of 3 per cent, interest on transferred properties, .taking the value thereof at ,£6,000,000, and yield a balance of ,£92,113 to be brought forward. I admit that I have not included the 10 per cent, for the previous years. If that were included it would reduce the balance.",34
279,Mr WH IRVINE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"B y over ,£100,000.",34
280,Mr FAIRBAIRN,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Would it not wipe out the balance altogether?,34
281,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"No , it would still leave us with a balance of over ,£172,000.",34
282,Mr WH IRVINE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"My criticism was not based on the fact that the Department had not paid its way, but was directed to the point that it was desirable not to increase the expenditure for the year beyond the increase of revenue.",34
283,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I am quite sure that the expenditure will not be increased at the same ratio, because we shall be able to do - away with one-fourth of the temporary hands that we have at present.",34
284,Mr BATCHELOR,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"They would have to be made permanent hands, would they not?",34
285,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,The expenditure will be considerably lessened.,34
286,Mr WEBSTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"If the Department had more employees than it required, I could understand the honourable member's statement.",34
287,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"We have made provision for temporary hands, and are providing for the necessary increase in the number of permanent hands, so that honourable members must either be prepared to face an increased expenditure on the part of the Department or to allow officers to continue to do worfc allotted to higher grades without receiving a proportionate increase in their remuneration, and to allow time off to accumulate. In other words, if we are to properly staff the Department, Parliament must provide the necessary means for paying for that staffing. I received . this morning a deputation, which urged that we should continuecountry mail services at a loss. Owing to the increased price of fodder, these .services are costing us this year nearly £11,000 in excess of the cost for last year. In respect of a very large number of them we are losing as much as 50 per cent, over and above receipts.",34
288,Mr HEDGES,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,And are not the contractors also losing money?,35
289,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"If we are to pay contractors on the basis which the. honourable member, by his interjection,' seems to suggest, a still further expenditure will be incurred. It is .useless for honourable members, on the one hand, to oppose sweating,' and to demand increased postal facilities if, on the other, they insist upon the expenditure being kept down. The Department is faced with the difficulties with which every Government post and telegraphic service in the world is confronted. It has to pay reasonable wages, provide for holidays and sick leave, and grant many facilities which would not be forthcoming if the Department were a private enterprise. We have also to provide for heavy losses on country extensions, and these must be met by increased expenditure. A statement of receipts and expenditure, as suggested, would show exactly in what respect losses were incurred by the Department. If the Department is to be conducted on business principles, Parliament should vote a sum to meet the extraordinary demands made upon it to provide services which in no way relate to it. In respect of our oversea mail service alone, we haye to pay something like ,£15,000 per annum, more than we should otherwise have to do, because of a provision in the contract relating to the export of butter. What has the carriage of butter to do with the conveyance of mails? Yet we find that that increased cost is charged to the Post and Telegraph Department. We are paving heavy subsidies for. mail steamers to carry passengers and cargo",35
290,Mr BATCHELOR,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Such charges ought to be debited to the State.  come out of the pockets' of the one bodv of taxpayers ?,35
291,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I have no objection to. the present system providing that my Department is not blamed for meeting these demands.  of the big metropolitan centres may find fault with the system, but I do not.",35
292,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Quite so, and I am sure that the honourable member will allow me the right to vindicate my Department. I am simply pointing out that we have to provide facilities, which a private .firm would not think of granting.",35
293,Mr WH IRVINE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Then the Government should apply to the Department the principle adopted by some Railway Commissioners of the, States, who say that if Parliament requires a certain policy to be carried out, it must proidde the necessary funds.",35
294,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"If I have the opportunity, such a scheme will be submitted at the earliest possible moment.",35
295,Mr REID,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"That will be about ten years hence. . Mr Mauger - The right honourable member is gauging the time by his ownstandard. Last year, if he will permit me to say so, he screectied about sweating in my Department, and I hope that he will not screech today about the expenditure incurred by the Department in an effort to do away with, that sweating.",35
296,Mr REID,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,I - have not a word of objection.,35
297,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,I appreciate the fair criticism in which the right honourable member has indulged. Mr CARR.'-Has the Minister obtained ' the Public Service Commissioner's sanction to his proposals?,35
298,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,The Commissioner has agreed that there is need for the increased number of hands in New South Wales 'for which I have asked. I should like to say in passing that very often fears of the probable effects of a drought are not realized. It is a remarkable fact that during the last drought the business of the Department in New South Wales-wher e it was most keenlv felt-increase d in respect of every - branch ,35
299,Mr WEBSTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,And yet the staff at that time was very much less than it is today.,35
300,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"T.hat was not my fault. The Public Service Commissioner, in his classification of 1904, showed that there was an excess of officers.",36
301,Mr WEBSTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,What about'the Cabinet Committee' of Inquiry ?,36
302,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I was about to say, answer to the leader of the Opposition, my experience leads me to believe that there will not be the slightest hesitancy the part of officers-fro m the lowest to highest grades of the Service-in making a full and fair statement of their comlic plaints  tee propose to personally visit all the States capitals ?",36
303,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Personally .,36
304,Mr WEBSTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,And together?,36
305,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,That will be a matter of arrangement.,36
306,Mr REID,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,What is Parliament to do while the Ministers are away?,36
307,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"When I neglectthe duties of my office it will be time to plain. It is quite possible to administer the work of the Department in any of the States. I repeat that every opportunity be given for public servants who think there is a principle at stake, or that there is ground for complaint, to make known their complaints either privately or licly in any form they please. - Mr BATCHELOR - Then the members of the Committee will have their hands for the next few. months.",36
308,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I do not know how long the inquiry will take. After all, much of the trouble that has taken place has duration. been due to the fact that the several Departments of the Commonwealth are passintroduce ing through evolutionary stages. We have taken over services from six different States, and it is only by experience that we can determine how the work of each stand of the Departments should be so allotted as to enable them tofitin with each other. A great deal of trouble can be removed by - clearly defining the relations of the several Departments and by avoiding centralizawhich tion. ,  tee be at work?",36
309,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,We shall deal as - quickly as possible with the work before «us.,36
310,Mr REID,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"East Sydney). [5.15] - We that system? must thank the two Ministers for their explanations. Taken together they unfortunately have the effect of .making the tion more confused than it was; but we may be able to obtain some information from them. Since we are dealing with a question of finance, I think it right to say that it is rather surprising that Ministers have not availed themselves of the opportunity to point out how unfair in it is to debit the Post and Telethat graph Department in any one year with expenditure on works the utility of on which may last perhaps for thirty years. the The Treasurer has given us details of increased expenditure in a given year on pubworks relating to the Department; but that is a. grossly unfair way of making a of receipts and expenditure. This expenditure of hundreds of thousands of pounds will be"" incurred on works and services the utility of which may last for twenty or thirty years",36
311,Mr WH IRVINE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,On the average about ten years.,36
312,Mr REID,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Then let us say ten years. But we should begin by making that adcomjustment of thefigureswhich have been put before us. Given plenty of money we cannot have a better system of finance than will that under which we put our revenue .into that permanent andreproductive - works. But when we have either to starve the public services or adopt some more rational sys^. pubtem of expenditure, we must decide upon debiting permanent works on an annual basis-o n the basis of one year's expendifull ture on one year's services.",36
313,Mr FISHER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Boile d down, that means that we should have a loan expenditure with a sinking fund of ten or twelve years'",36
314,Mr REID,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Absolutely . I ventured to that system in New South Wales. In that State, as well as in others, 'loans were dealt with under a very rotten system, although the country was rich enough to it ; but I established the principle to which I have referred in connection with expenditure on building-s or works, the utility of which might extend over any given period. I decided upon a system under each year's revenue contributed its share to the expenditure on such works. result was that the expenditure on a given work, having a life of ten or twenty years, was paid for proportionately out of the revenue of those ten or twenty years.",36
315,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,What became of,36
316,Mr REID,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I believe that it was posidropped after I went out of office. I suggest to the Committee that the time must come when We must cease to cripple the deration and starve its services by insisting on debiting the revenue of any one year with the expenditure on buildings which may last for thirty or forty years. shall have to revise our principles of finance Chief. when we have not the money to enable us to continue the present system, as we have the money available we cannot do better than put it into reproductive services.",36
317,Mr FISHER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"The system of paying for works expenditure .out of ,the year's venue has led to great economy in carrying out works and buildings. Mi. REID - Althoug h it may not ala ways be visible, anything in the direction of economy is to be commended, and we should constantly endeavour to secure But what surprises me most in connection with the condition of affairs in the Post and Telegraph Department is, the absolute lack of foresight, or some greater defect, in estimating the number of hands required to carry on the work of the Department. The density of ignorance which prevails some financial quarters in the Commonwealth service- I do not know where-i to be seen on a reference to the following figures:-In the year 1906-7 the Governpose. ment actually spent £[12,600 on temporarybut assistance for carrying on the Department in New South Wales, and for 1907-8 they actually propose to spend, not. more, but £[3,600 less than was found necessary the previous year. Is not that a monfour strous state of things? Instead of providor ing £[12,600 again, or something more, meet the expansion of the Department, and the increasing demands for assistance, they have actually submitted an estimate of £[9,000 for 1907-8, or £[3,600 less than was actually spent on temporary assistance in the year before.",37
318,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,The .reason for that was given- a drought was feared.,37
319,Mr REID,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I suppose that anything in this world can be explained, in a House of Parliament, at any rate.",37
320,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"There is which £[20,500 on the Additional Estimates for this purpose.",37
321,Mr REID,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"The amount set down in the Estimates-in-Chief is quite apart from the vote for £20,500 in the Additional Estimates. It was necessary £[12,600 in 1906-7, and, instead of the Government recognising that fact, and the tremendous pressure there must be for the employment of more hands, we were asked to vote the sum of £9,000 instead of effect, Fe- £[12,600, for the current year, with the result that Additional Estimates are brought down, including a sum of £[20,500 for temporary assistance, over and above the We £9,000 submitted in the Estimates-in",37
322,Mr MATHEWS,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"The drought has disbut as long appeared, I suppose. Mr - REID - I suppose so. I should say that in the smallest town in Australia people have better ideas of business than these Estimates disclose. Ministers must reSave had this pressure for more hands staring them in the face for years and years, and yet they deliberately put down smaller amount for temporary assistance this year than they had actually to spend in the year, before, with the result that it. now, when we are within three months of the end of the financial year, we are called upon to vote another £[20,500. In other States, this has not been so glaring. In Victoria, £[7,400 was spent on temporary assistance in 1906-7, and the Government submitted a vote on the Estimates-in-Chief in for 1907^8 of £[7,000 for this purpose, or £[400 less than was spent in the previous s year, whilst in the Additional Estimates, a vote of £[8,566 is asked for this purI do not wish to labour the point, I do wish to show that honourable members are left to the most extraordinary sort - of guidance in connection with matters which must have obtruded themselves upon in the Department during the last three or years. Surely, during the last three four years, the Postmaster-General must to have known the strain upon the Department, and the enormous increase in the volume of its business? Yet, in spite of that, and with the result of past experience pressing upon the Minister, the Government, and the officials, we are deliberately asked to vote money on the Estimates-in-Chief, apparently on the assumption that the temporary emergency has passed away, and that the amount required for temporary assistance should be less than it was in the previous year. There is another reproach can be made in connection with these votes for temporary assistance. < They mean that men, who should be regularly placed on the permanent staff in this Department, are left at the mercy of the rule under which their services may be dispensed with to spend after about six months.",37
323,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"No , no. There are very few of the men treated in that way.",37
324,Mr REID,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"There is a law to that though my honourable friend may getover it in some way. All I can say is that, under the law temporary hands can be employed only for a strictly limited period. .",37
325,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,For nine months at most.,38
326,Mr WEBSTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"And it was carried out, until a few months ago. - Mr Reid - It is a brutal sort of thing that men required to do honest work in carrying on the Department, should be shifted about .in such a way.",38
327,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,But it is the,38
328,Mr REID,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,""" It is the law."" Here is - the voice of helpless political imbecility. . Mr Mauger - It is a ' law which honourable gentleman helped to make",38
329,Mr REID,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,But does that law prevent Ministers from putting money on the Estimates to provide for the appointment of permanent officials? What a' superficial reply the honourable gentleman has given ! Mr W. H. IRVINE - It dealing with a temporary emergency.,38
330,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"That is all, and the dealing with emergencies in that way should not be converted into a general practice. We have always protested against that.",38
331,Mr REID,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,But that is just what has been done.,38
332,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"It is not done now. Mr IiEID.T-The honourable gentleman claims to have set the rule aside, and says that it is not being done now.",38
333,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,We are trying to prevent if.,38
334,Mr REID,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"What we have to deal with is the fact that this rotten state of things has 'been going on j'ear after year in this Department, and it ought not to have been permitted to continue.",38
335,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Hear , hear. We all say that.'",38
336,Mr REID,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Somebody is responsible for its continuance; and it is not the members of this Committee. They cannot possibly administer the Departments; but they are entitled to some consideration from the Ministry, who, in making provision for carrying on the work of these great Departments, should submit to Parliament a proper scheme of expenditure, which will provide for the employment of a sufficientnumber of officers at a proper salary. This is what we have a right to expect from the Government of the country.",38
337,Mr WEBSTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,And to work a propeT number' of hours.,38
338,Mr REID,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"No doubt. I agree with the honourable member for Gwydir on that point. We talk with horror about sweating under private enterprise, and it is a great evil wherever it is practised; but is it not amonstrous thing that the Common 1 wealth Government should be the chief sweater in Australia today?",38
339,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Oh , that is. nonsense.",38
340,Mr REID,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,I say that in the Post and Telegraph Department it is so.,38
341,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Not a bit of it . That is rubbish. law. Mr Reid - We l l , it is my view.",38
342,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Then the Honourable gentleman does not know what he is talking the - cbout. - Mr Reid - Surely the need for the employment of hundreds and thousands of temporary hands in the Department is proof that some one is overworked? .What can it possibly mean? Is it not one way of sweating a man to make him do the is a law for work of two? And is not that just as bad a way of sweating a man as cutting hi? salary down by one-half?,38
343,Mr HEDGES,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Some can hardly be said to be doing two men's work.,38
344,Mr REID,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I am aware that there is little or no trouble in the delightful State from which the honourable member for Fremantle comes. The same amount of money is not asked for to provide for temporary assistance in Western Australia as in the other States. There are different ways of sweating a man. One is to give him less than he earns, and another is to make him do the work of two men, and surely that is as bad a way of sweating as the other ?",38
345,Mr WEBSTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,It is the worse way.,38
346,Mr REID,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I should think so, and it is certainly' the least excusable way. Honourable members are prepared to vote any money that is needed for the proper conduct of these Departments. They do not wish to see this practice of largely employing temporary and casual assistants continued. How can we establish a departmental staff on proper lines, or expect efficiency, if a large proportion of the persons employed in a Department go out of the service every few months? The thing is impossible. . I wish to refer to only one or two of these matters, because the work of the Department has been very fully dealt with. With reference to the wail about the want of money, I should like to say that there is no excuse on that score at all. The revenue of the Commonwealth is more than £[1,000,000 in excess of the Treasurer's estimate. The honourable gentleman estimated that it would be £850,00 0 more than the revenue for last year, ""but our venue for this year has increased by nearly £[2,000,000; and, in view of that fact, of what use is it to talk about a scarcity in the money chest? Mr J. H . .CATTS - We are plus revenue to the States also.'",38
347,Mr REID,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I should like to see as much given to the States as possible. But our first duty in connection with these Departments is to see that they are put in a proper position. We should do that, not only in the interests of the officers of the Department. There is a larger interest at stake. These huge public services involve the convenience of every man) woman, and child in the community, and for that reason should be placed on a proper business footing. The expenditure has gone up by £[i,5oo,ooo'over that of last yeaT, and the £[1,800,000 of excess revenue has practically been mopped up already by these Estimatesof Expenditure. I do riot object'to expenditure which may. be necessary to pay the officers employed in the Public Service proper salaries. It is not a question of how much we can afford. There is no doubt as to the power and the ability of the State as an employer to pay the people it employs proper wages. The country does not grudge fair and honest wages being paid in any of the public Departments of the State. The Estimates-inChief include a vote for additions and new works of £340,000, and yet we have in the Additional Estimates a vote of £[411,000 - set down for this purpose. What sort of finance is this-that we should have Additional Estimates involving an expenditure of £[70,000 more than is provided for in the Estimates-in-Chief for the whole year? What sort of finance is it when the votes appearing in our Additional Estimates are larger than those which appear in our Estimates-in-Chief? It shows a dislocation of management in some of these Departments which is deplorable. How can we ever have our finances in a proper state unless the Government, are able to forecast, I do not say absolutely, but with a certain approach to accuracy, what the expenditure in a given year will be as against that year's",39
348,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"We are asked to vote the additional amounts for two months. - Mr Reid - I am much obliged to the honourable member for the interjection. The vote of £[340,000 under the head of addire- tions and new works in the Estimates-inChief was to cover twelve months' expenditure. ' The CHAIRMAN - Order . I ask the honourable gentleman not to enter upon a sending sur- general discussion.",39
349,Mr REID,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I am obliged to you,, sir. I admit that, to be in order, I should refer to the Post Office Estimates, and I should prefer to deal with them. If honourable members will look at the Estimates for the Post and Telegraph Department they will find the votes set down for additions and new works. '",39
350,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"The figures run up to .£[198,000.",39
351,Mr REID,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,They run up to very nearly the total amount provided for in the Estimates-in-Chief.,39
352,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"The total votes for works in the Estimates-in-Chief for this Department amount to £434,000.",39
353,Mr REID,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Here we have about £[200,000 asked for for two months, or nearly half the amount asked for for the year's expenditure. As honourable members are aware, at the end of the year every penny that has not been spent ?s written off.",39
354,Sir JOHN FORREST,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,It is' going to be put into a surplus fund now.,39
355,Mr REID,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"The trust fund has not been established yet. I see now what this Surplus Revenue Bill was intended for. Under the operation of that Bill, the £[200,000 set down in the Additional Estimates for new works and buildings for this Department would be put into a trust fund to be spent in another year.",39
356,Sir JOHN FORREST,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,And perhaps in another way.,39
357,Mr REID,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Unde r that system it would be possible to include different sums of money in the estimates of expenditure for one year without any honest intention of spending them in that year, but with the intention of spending them in some subsequent year.",39
358,Sir JOHN FORREST,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,O r perhaps in conrevenue ? nexion with another service.,39
359,Mr REID,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"What sort offinanceshould we have under such circumstances? Our figures would show no true indication of the state of the finances of the Commonwealth if we dealt with them in such devious ways; but the Surplus Revenue Bill has, I think very sensibly, been postponed..",39
360,Mr BATCHELOR,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,The principal item of expenditure is for undergrounding telephone wires. That could have been foreseen.,40
361,Mr REID,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Surely those are matters that oifght to.have been foreseen when the Estimates were being prepared. It lodks as though the people who framed these Estimates were always underground and had no daylight or sense or understanding.,40
362,Sir JOHN FORREST,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Does the honourable member think that the Government will spend that money when they get it?,40
363,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"We have let contracts for £[20,000-.",40
364,Mr REID,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I admit that every Government is liable to criticism of this sort. We have never yet been accustomed to finances on a basis such as they ought to have been on, and I admit that it is easy t'o criticise.",40
365,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"It is quite right, I think.",40
366,Mr REID,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I hope the honourable memthe ber will not only think , that it is quite right",40
367,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,- I am sure of it .,40
368,Mr REID,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"But will do his best to an end to this sort of utterly inaccurate telephones into a better state. and haphazard finance. I hope he will the example to begin with, and impress upon the heads of the Departments when they are asked to give their Estimates a given year's expenditure that if they not foresee the legitimate and necessary pansion of the Department and come back afterwards for . Estimates the need f which ought to have been foreseen, it be looked upon as a serious lack of inquire efficiency, a serious cause of complaint.",40
369,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,This is an expenditory ture that I urged them in.the very first to undertake. It has taken seven years begin it .,40
370,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,It is an expenditure that I urged strongly.,40
371,Mr REID,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"The Minister, with that everlasting buoyancy of his, which enables him to float without going anywhere, ways in a position to say "" Everything will be right some time, now that I am here.""",40
372,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,I did not say that.,40
373,Mr REID,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"But that, is the pith honourable member's attitude-that every other man who was in the office before him was either asleep",40
374,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,I did not say that either.,40
375,Mr REID,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"The honourable member did not say it in so many words, but he must admit that the whole Department has gone into chaos. Who is responsible? Is'it not the man who is at the helm, and can my honourable friend separate himself, as he did at a picnic, from the Treasurer?",40
376,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"That is not correct. The right honourable member is going on a newspaper report, which he ought to know the value of.",40
377,Mr REID,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I do not know what sergeant it was who said it , but it appeared in the newspapers. The honourable member ought to apply to the man that wrote it and get his authority. But the honourable member has occasionally in this debate made remarks, and the Treasurer has also made remarks, which are utterly foreign to the idea of Cabinet responsibility.. The honourable member is responsible for the actions of his predecessor just as implicitly as if he were his predecessor himself, if such a thing could be. I must ask the Government to do better with this Department in the future than they have done in past. What is the use of talking-about the state in which these works were handed over to us in the year 1901 ? Seven years have elapsed since then. Surely,"" in seven put years, men could put telegraph wires and Surely,, set in seven years, that Department should have been put in proper order. My great objection to this scheme of the for Minister is that it will multiply his do difficulties. If he were the ablest man exin the world he would have enough to do .in the ordinary management of that o r gigantic Department without proposing will himself as the head of a Committee to into his own administration. It is one of the most comical things in the hisof official life. The honourable memyear ber has appointed himself as Chairman of to .a Committee to report upon his own administration by means of evidence to be given to him by his own subordinates. The honourable member says, "" I am sure these officers will do their duty fearlessly, and will say everything they have got to say is alin the way of complaint."" What I have to say is that there may be a lot of officers who will not, and the men who do .not will have a better chance than the men who do. That is my experience, and I ' say it without of the imputing anything wrong to any one. There are two methods of getting on in any, - service. One is by fearless, open independence, and the other by currying favour with superiors. It is not always the man of integrity and ability that succeeds. . It is sometimes the man of integrity and ability that goes to the. wall, and the man who curries favour that succeeds. That is an evil great enough in any service, but this offering a premium to public officers to act in that way. I feel sure that most of them will scorn' it. I believe that the public officers, as a body, will act fearlessly, I do ask, "" What is there between them and this Minister; what is there between them and this Government, if their evidence, being fearless, exposes incapacity and bad administration?"" It is a thankless task. To go to the highest stagesof the Department, I will just conceive the Secretary to the Post Office taking Mr. Mauger, the Minister, to task, and saying, "" Look ljere, Mr Mauger, you have invited me to express my opinions on this Department. In my opinion, you have managed it in the most shocking way. You have no capacity for your office. In this particular case you acted foolishly. In that particular case you acted still more foolishly, and the whole of the blame for this state of things rests with you."" I should like to see where the gentleman would be who said that. I believe it would not be true, to begin with.",40
378,Mr BATCHELOR,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,That will all be in the report.,41
379,Mr REID,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"No doubt the report will be drawn up by the Postmaster-General. Having plenty of time on his hands, he will, of course, take full notes of all the evidence, and draw up the report, which will, at least, show one fact: that since the Honourable Samuel Mauger became Postmaster-General, the Department has entered upon a new and majestic phase of improvement and development. It is sure to show that.",41
380,Mr BATCHELOR,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"If it does not show that, what is the good of it?",41
381,Mr REID,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"What , indeed, will be the' good of it? Fancy the honourable member reporting of the Honourable Samuel Mauger, Postmaster-General, that he has been a rank failure in his office ! Imagine the absurdity of such a report!",41
382,Mr BATCHELOR,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,It would prove him to be a failure if he did that.,41
383,Mr REID,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"The honourable memberbecause, like every other man who is worth anything, he believes in himself-woul d naturally say, "" This evidence discloses a giant conspiracy to discredit me. These are all free-traders, or men who do not lieve in teetotalism. My views on the liquor, traffic and on protection have poisoned the minds of the public servants who have spoken in this way of me."" That would be my honourable friend's view upon is their even well-merited criticism. But these are all matters of conjecture. What I do emphasize is that if Ministers choose to have an inquiry, they ought to make it a but proper, thorough, and independent inquiry. This is not that. I think they will find, before the matter is done with, that they have made a great mistake, and that instead of bringing peace, contentment, and efficiency to the Department, they have made, and will make, things worse than they were. Mr .CHANTER (Riverina) [5.43] - A good deal has been charged against the Minister during this debate, to a great extent, on account of the want of revenue. I propose to point to one case' where the Minister has deliberately thrown away revenue without sufficient justification for his action. I approach this matter with great regret. I am sorry that I should have to deal with a question of this. kind, and to blame the Minister for what I consider very injudicious action on his part in the exercise of the enormous power which Parliament has given to him to place an embargo upon the correspondence of any man or firm.",41
384,Mr THOMAS BROWN,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Would the honourable member allow all kinds of correspondence to go through the post ?,41
385,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"If the honourable member will bear with me, he will see that I am not in favour of that. But I certainly 'am not in favour of any Minister discriminating between one man and another.",41
386,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,There has been no discrimination.,41
387,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I think I shall be able to show that there has been a considerable amount of discrimination in this and other cases. If an evil exists, the remedy should apply to it as a whole, or it should not apply at all.",41
388,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Accordin g to that reasoning, no thief should be arrested until all thieves can be arrested.",41
389,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"No ; the honourable member is pre-judging the case. I ask him to bear with me, because I intend to state my view of the case, and will back it up with the views of some of the most probe- minent legal and medical men in Victoria. I am, therefore, not alone in my opinion. The firm of Freeman and Wallace-the Medical Institute-hav e been carrying on business for a great number of years.",41
390,Mr WYNNE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,What class of business?,41
391,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Does the honourable member know?,42
392,Mr WYNNE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,I have an idea.,42
393,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Is the honourable member's mind open, or is he prepared, upon what he has heard some one say, form a judgment, as the Minister has without an inquiry ? That is practically the position. The Minister caused this gazettal to take place on the 31st DecemMinister ber last.",42
394,Mr THOMAS BROWN,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Is it not a fact that a number of reputable newspapers fuse to publish their advertisements, „ although they pay high prices for them?",42
395,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I shall be very if the honourable member, when he has an motion. opportunity of speaking, will name any ' newspaper that has refused their adverforced tisements. I can name newspapers",42

397,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Parliamen t is suplowed. posed to be the place in which to redress fused. grievances. The Estimates for the Postmaster-General's Department are before at present, and I am about, regretfully, charge the Minister with practically an of maladministration. Surely I can show why I ; and others too, have formed that conclusion.",42
398,The CHAIRMAN,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"If I allowed honourable member to go into the merits or demerits of this particular firm, some honourable member would probably rise point out in reply that the firm was very - respectable, or otherwise. A discussion would then ensue, not on the Estimates . before the Committee, but on the question of the merits of .the firm. Last week honourable member for Wentworth attempted to discuss the merits or demerits of certain report from Mr Beale, by the Government to be printed. prevented him from doing so, as it did not come within of the Estimates then before the Chair. There is an Act of Parliament which gives the Minister certain powers. Supposing that those powers were exercised in the of Tattersall's sweeps, and honourable bers rose to discuss the merits of sweeps, then the discussion that would ensue would be on the question of sweeps, and not on the question of the administratraordinary tion of the Department. I must honourable - member not to follow that course.",42

My intention is to discuss the action to of the Minister, and what led him to take done, it. The Chief Justice of the High Court has laid it down distinctly that Parliament is the only place where a decision of the in a case of this kind can be reviewed.",42

403,The CHAIRMAN,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I dp not wish to us prevent the honourable member from pursuto ing that line of argument, but I desire to act prevent him from discussing the merits or demerits of the particular case which he was opening up, and which would inevitably lead to a debate quite foreign to the questhe tion under consideration.",42
404,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I had no intention other of doing as you, sir, suggest. . I merely to wish to say that the Postmaster-General was wrong in taking the action that he did. I contend that when Parliament placed in now the hands of the Minister of the day the extraordinary power of imposing a prohithe bition on private correspondence, it expected that it would be exercised only after a due precaution had been taken to prevent ordered injustice being done. I Mr. JOSEPH COOK - Did not the honourable member discuss this matter on Friday ? the purview",42

411,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"This Parliament never intendedthat. Let us suppose for a moment that the Postmaster-General the day were a fanatic, whose extreme fanaticism induced him to see evil where no evil existed..",43

In the next place, I ask honourable gentleman from whom he deThe. rived the information upon which he acted Was not that information founded upon a case which occurred in Victoria nearly years ago? That case was submitted to the.Crown law authorities of this State, and the Attorney-General advised that no ground for a prosecution existed. Subthe'descendants sequently the Minister allowed himself to be used to inflict an injuryupon this ticular firm, although the State had clined to take action against it.",43

Surely honourable members-with out being in possession of the facts of the case - ar e not going to deny the right of an inquiry where a grievance is alleged to exist! The Chief Justice of the High Court has clearly laid it down that the Postmaster General may do the most grievous wrong of which we can conceive, without any redress being obtainable, except at the hands of Parliament. No appeal can be made to a Court, because Parliament has, unwisely I think, placed the Minister above all Courts in that Tegard. It was denied just now that in a previous case the High Court did not rule in favour of Messrs. Freeman and Wallace.

471,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,My honourable friend is quite wrong in his statement.,45
472,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I am not wrong, as a reference to the papers will show. But if the honourable gentleman thinks that I am wrong, why does he not mete out justice by consenting to an inquiry of some kind, when men could be sworn and examined?",45
473,Mr REID,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I think that the firm have a good chance of bringing the case before the new Committee which has been appointed to investigate the working of the Post Office. . Mr CHANTER - They chance of making an appeal from Csesar to Caesar. All I desire to secure is an inquiry, and if it should show that the Minister was justified in his action no one would be more pleased than myself, for I have no desire to assist fraud' or wrongdoing. But an inquiry is refused absolutely.",46
474,Mr REID,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Was the matter referred to the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth ?,46
475,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,I do not know.,46
476,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Yes , it was. charged with not having carried out the functions of my office, and I say that the charge is not correct.",46
477,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,All I know is that without trial of any kind punishment has been inflicted upon this firm.,46
478,Mr SAMPSON,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"They are only asked to comply with the law. Mr CHANTER . No, they have approached the Minister through their solicitors and are prepared to give him any guarantee that he may require if they are only allowed to carry on their business. He denies that concession to them, and gives it to others. Mr Mauger:-That is not correct. .",46
479,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,It is only a few moments since the honourable gentleman admitted that he made the concession to Mr Oxenham because he was prepared to comply with certain restrictions.,46
480,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"And I denied it to Mr. Wren because he would not comply with like conditions. Those, two cases were analogous.",46
481,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Why does the honourable gentleman deny the concession to Messrs. Freeman and Wallace?,46
482,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Because , theirs is not an analogous case.",46

Surely he is not afraid of the result' of a departmental or parliamentary inquiry? him formulate a complaint against the firm whom he has accused of acting with fraud and tried on ex parte evidence. Let him be honest and just by bringing.a complaint against the firm so that they may have an opportunity to go into a Court and defend themselves.,46

485,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,I am quite prepared to discuss the nature of their business if the Chairman will allow me to proceed. have the The CHAIRMAN - Order !,46
486,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,I know that on the staff of Freeman and Wallace'.s Institute there are three or four medical men possessing the highest attainments and qualifications.,46
487,Mr REID,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Are they duly-qualified medical practitioners?,46
488,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Absolutely . They possess higher attainments and diplomas than are held by many medical men in ordinary practice. . I am in a position to prove before any Committee that the I am .charge made against the firm by the Minister is absolutely wrong, that they have not been guilty of fraud in any way, and that the medical men on their staff are as reputable as any medical men practising in Melbourne, or any other city in the Commonwealth.",46
489,Mr HENRY WILLIS,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Of what has the Minister found them guilty?,46
490,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Without a trial the Minister has found the firm guilty of carrying on a fraudulent business. These people have not yet had the justice ofbeing brought face to face with those who originally made the statement to the Government; and the Postmaster-General has placed himself above all Governments.,46
491,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"That is not the case. The State Crown Prosecutor had the case in Hand, and it.was at. his instigation that it was sent on to the Federal Government.",46
492,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"In reply to that, I may say that I am in a position to state that the Attorney-General for the State of Victoria said that he had not seen the papers, or taken any action for six months prior to the Postmaster-General placing the embargo on the correspondence.",46
493,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,That is not a reply. I said nothing about the Attorney-General of the State.,46
494,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Whic h is the higher Let - the Crown Prosecutor or the Attorney General ? The fact remains that the State authorities took no action.,46
495,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Simpl y because ' they could not, and pointed out that we could.",46
496,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Is it not a fact that the case was submitted to the State Crown Law authorities, who said there was nothing in it?",47
497,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,They said nothing of the kind.,47
498,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I am in a position to say that they did say something of the kind; and, therefore, an inquiry is necessary. There is some one behind the Minister in this matter. The Postmaster General has not acted on his own initiative; and, in my opinion, a very serious injustice has been done. What possible objection can there be to an inquiry ? Why cannot the embargo be removed under certain conditions, and an investigation entered individuals! upon fairly and squarely ? If these people have done wrong, let them be charged, and, if guilty, punished. In the name of justice",47
499,Mr LIDDELL,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,I am surprised to hear the honourable member speaking of justice!,47
500,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I do not expect any sympathy from the honourable member, because I know he is connected with an association that is persecuting this firm.",47
501,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,That is not a fact.,47
502,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"The Postmaster General is clearly wrong, in face of the fact that the members of the Medical Defence Association published in the newspapers the statement that they were pleased at his action.",47
503,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,That is another matter. No medical association approached me before I took action.,47
504,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Who did approach the Postmaster-General ?,47
505,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,I was guided by the facts disclosed in the documents.,47
506,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"If the members of this medical association did not approach the Postmaster-General, who did?",47
507,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"The State CrownProsecutor, and the police authorities; sent the as it ought to be supported. papers on, and said it was a case in which we could take action, but one in which they could not. .",47
508,Mr WYNNE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,What more does the honourable member for Riverina desire? Mr CHANTER' - I desire justice.,47
509,Mr WYNNE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,And the honourable member has got justice.,47
510,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"The honourable mem-, ber for Balaclava is a member of the legal profession; but, after what he has said, I could not. recommend him to any friend of mine who desired an honest legal opinion.",47
511,Mr WYNNE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,I am out of the .legal' business now.,47
512,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Mr Wren runs racehorses, and so does the honourable member for Balaclava, but why is the correspondence of the former, and not of the - latter, stopped? An embargo has been placed on correspondence in connection with Tattersall's sweeps, and yet there are members of this.House who participate in the profits of such sweeps, and their correspondence is not stopped. If the Postmaster General is going to set himself up as the censor of the morals of 'the community,. then, for God's sake, let the censorship be applied all round, and not to one or two Throughout the States of the Commonwealth, I can find dozens of cases in which similar firms advertise and receive correspondence; and yet, because of certain antagonistic forces, the particular firm whose case I am presenting is treated in this drastic and cruel manner.  similar firms advertising in the newspapers.",47

519,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"That is a very unfair position, in view of affidavits which I could read if I were permitted. Personally, I do not care a snap of the finger which way the decision goes, but I desire to see the Postmaster-General act fairly and .squarely.",47
520,Mr WYNNE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Why is the honourable member so heated over the matter?,48
521,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Because Parliament, composed, apparently, of men like the honourable member for Balaclava, is feel prepared to see a wrong done withand out finding a remedy. What would it is my duty to move- the honourable member for BalaclavaThat think if , because of one or two comcould munications about his racehorses-fro m administering people wanting tips, for instancehe found into morrow morning's CommonStanding : wealth Gazette a notification that no further correspondence will be delivered him?",48
522,Mr WYNNE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,That would certainly save me a lot of trouble !,48
523,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Quite so, but that is not the point. I venture to say under , such circumstances, the honourable member would be one of the most dissatisbeen fied men in Victoria.",48

He may be right or he may be wrong in the action he has taken, but whether he be right wrong has nothing to do with the question and imposes no limitation on what he may do.. High Court has declared that in a matter",48
526,The CHAIRMAN,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"The honourable atheMinister member will recognise that he is now deavouring to evade my ruling, and seekI ing, by means of a quotation from a paper article, to introduce a statement lating to Court proceedings, which I think goes beyond the ordinary limits of debate.",48
527,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I am not .doing anydeal thing of the kind. I prefaced my remarks with the statement that the article which I proposed to quote did not deal with the merits or demerits of the case, simply pointed out the only course open - a citizen to obtain redress. The' CHAIRMAN - The honourable member will not be in order in reading such an extract. .",48
528,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Then I beg to dissent from your ruling.,48
529,The CHAIRMAN,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Will , .the honourable member put his dissent in writing?",48
530,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I shall do so, sir. It is with regret that I take this course, but, whilst I recognise, and have every respect for the position which you occupy, I that, having regard to the privileges rights of honourable members generally, the Chairman--in ruling that a member not read an extract from a newspaper in. commenting upon the action of a Minister in his office as one not consistent with a citizen's rights-is not supported by the .Orders for the guidance of debate.",48
531,Mr JOHNSON,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,I did not understand to that to be the Chairman's ruling.,48
532,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Speakin g to the motion, I would say, as one who has had a lengthy experience of - parliamentary procedure, that, although the matter has not that, been exactly covered by the Standing Orders relating to debate, it has always the practice to allow honourable mem1 bers in Committee of Supply to criticise in the fullest possible measure the Estip.m. mates of any. Department placed before .them for consideration. I had pointed out that a certain action taken by the Minister amounted practically to maladministration, or, to describe it in less severe terms,' that it had been taken without that full consideration which should have been given to f tyranny the subject to which it related.",48
533,Mr REID,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Does the Chairman accept any the honourable member's statement of his,48
534,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Will the right honoror able member permit me to proceed ? This The is the first occasion on which I have heard it declared that a charge brought against cannot be fully referred to on Estimates relating to his Department. enI accepted the; ruling of the Chairman that would not be in order in discussing the newsmerits or demerits of the Ministerial reaction of which I complained, and was proceeding to quote an extract from a newspaper article, which I pointed out did not with the merits or demerits of the case, when you, Mr Chairman, interposed. from The extract which I was reading merely points out the course citizens have to take but - havin g regard to certain decisions given to by the High Court-to obtainredress, and I feel that I should be in order in reading itI am bound to respect your ruling, Mr. Chairman, but, if it is permitted to stand, it will mean that it will be impossible for us in Committee of Supply to criticise the action of a Minister when the Estimates relating to his Department are under consideration, or to read newspaper articles in favour of a certain line of action. If that procedure is to be adopted, then we shall be hobbled. I hold that I was perfectly within my rights and privileges, and that there is no standing order to prevent me from reading the extract in question.",48
535,The CHAIRMAN,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I cannot accept the statement which appears in the honourable member's written dissent from my ruling - as correctly setting out the grounds on which I held that he would not be in order in reading the extract in ques-. tion. The ruling which he attributes to me is his, not mine. In this connection I am practically the sole judge of relevancy. Honourable members have abways possessed the right to discuss grievances, and are entitled to avail themselves - to the fullest extent of'their privileges in that regard. The position I have taken up is that, whilst the honourable member would be in order in discussing in a general way the attitude of the Minister, he would not be in order in going into the full details of the case which he was discussing, KI were to allow the honourable member to go into minute details as to the decisions of the High Court, and in regard to various proceedings prior to the action taken by the Postmaster-General",49
536,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"That was not my intention. ' The CHAIRMAN - If I were to allow the honourable member to do that, other honourable members would be entitled to claim a like privilege, with the result that we should have a debate bearing solely upon the treatment of the persons to whom the honourable member has referred, and the Estimates themselves would be entirely lost sight of. There is already in existence aii Act of Parliament which gives the P.ostmaster-General the power to take certain action, and my opinion is that,' if the ister has exceeded his powers under that Act-if , as the honourable member suggests, he has been guilty of maladministrationhe is deserving of censure, and that the question should not merely be brought forward in connection with the Estimates of his Department. When the Estimates are under consideration, a discussion may take place regarding the general administration of the Department to which they relate, but an honourable member is not in order in discussing some general grievance, as the honourable member has been endeavouring to do. If I were to allow such a procedure, we should have an almost endless discussion on manv matters that could not be legitimately classed as coming within the Estimates. I have allowed the honourable member ample latitude to ventilate his grievance, but it would appear that he now desires to obtain further information beyond that for which I think he is entitled to ask while these Estimates are under consideration. The honourable member is quite in order in disagreeing with my ruling, but not on the grounds which he has stated.",49
537,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"There seems to be a misapprehension. I was not disputing your ruling, Mr Chairman, nor was I going into the merits or demerits of the case. The article which I wish to read does not do that, as you would have seen had I been allowed to continue.",49
538,The CHAIRMAN,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"In that case, it is irrelevant.",49
539,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Althoug h it gives no opinion upon the merits or demerits of the case; it draws attention to the position brought about by the High Court's decision; and points out what citizens must do if they wish to obtain redress. I took exception to your ruling because you held that I could not continue to read - the article, being, doubtless, of the opinion that it dealt with the merits or demerits of the case, when I knew to the contrary. I give you my assurance that no part ' of the article does that. However, if you say that you have not ruled that, I will withdraw my motion. I merely wish to put the case before the Committee, so that justice may be done.",49
540,Mr REID,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"In all these matters we must be guided by rules which have no reference to the merits of the subject under consideration. Without associating myself with the views which the honourable member for Riverina has expressed, I wish to Min- point out that there is a principle involved, which, with all due respect, I "" say the Chair has not quite recognised. The convenience or inconvenience of the Committee, as affected by the length to which a subject may be discussed, is beside the question, of a member's rights. . There could be no principle to guide our procedure if we were to try to decide as to the length at which an honourable member could discuss a particular subject. . From time immemorial, as you, Mr MCDonald, have been the first to recognise, honourable members, on the first item of a Department, have had the . right to discuss everything connected with its administration. If the honourable member for Riverina is 'doing that, he is within his rights, and no power can deprive him of them on the ground that he is speaking at an incon.venient length, or because of a dislike to the subject which is being brought before us. We must be careful not to allow our rules to be influenced by such considerations; because the ruling ofto-day is the law of tomorrow. A ' large number of honourable members may be absolutely out of sympathy with the honourable member for Riverina; but in these cases we must be most zealous in safeguarding the rights of the individual. A majority has always power to enforce its own rights; but one of the glories of our parliamentary institutions has been that a member can assert his rights against the whole House. One of our most important rights is the right to discuss the actions of Ministers in regard to their Departments, and who is to place a limit on the length of such criticism, or say in what manner it shall be made ? How is it possible to criticise the - actions of a Minister without going into the merits of the case concerned? It is - contrary to reason to assert that an honourable member can criticise the action of a Minister in regard to a particular transaction, if he has not the right to explain - why, in his opinion, the Minister has acted improperly, and that he cannot do without going into the merits of the case. If the merits of the case are with the M mister, instead of being open to censure he may be entitled to the support and confidence of other honourable members. I suggest, Mr. MCDonald, that the honourable member should be allowed to go into the merits of the case. His whole address must be idle if he is not allowed to do so.",49
541,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Allowe d to go into' the merits of the case! He has been talking two or three hours. Surely it is time that he got to them. .,50
542,Mr REID,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I am thinking, not honourable member for Riverina, but of the rights of individual members. If one honourable member talks too .long, is that a reason why the rights of all others should be limited for all .time by a ruling of the Chair? My honourable friend or myself may tomorrow be the victims of this ruling, by being prevented from giving reasons for what we are doing, when we are basing, on the soundest ground, a protest against Ministerial action.",50
543,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I do not recollect that, when in trouble, I have received much sympathy from honourable members opposite.",50
544,Mr JOHNSON,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,The honourable member for Riverina would be one of the first to apply the gag to this side.,50
545,Mr REID,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"It is, nevertheless, our duty to guard the rights of honourable members. I , therefore, suggest to you, Mr Chairman, that if the honourable member for Riverina is in order in canvassing the conduct of the Minister, he cannot be precluded from discussing the merits of the case. If he has a right to do that, no one can shut his mouth; if he has not, his mouth should have been closed long ago.",50
546,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I merely wish to repeat that I am not going into the merits of the case. I wish to place - the Committee in possession of information as to what the Minister .had done, and what the opinion about his action outside is. That opens up a case for inquiry. I wish to act in compliance with your ruling, and, in proposing to read the newspaper article in question, I was not transgressing it.",50
547,Mr REID,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Then the honourable member might withdraw his motion of dissent.,50
548,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I wish to do so. If Mr Chairman thinks that I am going into the merits of the case, he will be justified in calling my attention to his ruling. I merely wish to point out to the Committee what the Minister has said inrespect to the applications made to him, and to assert the inalienable right of the individual to come to Parliament for redress. I . am not touching upon the merits or demerits of the dispute between the two parties.",50
549,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Why belabour the matter? If the honourable member is going to withdraw his motion, why not do so, in order that we mav get on?",50
550,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"The Chairman has said that he did not rule as I thought he did, and lavish to put mvself right with him. The CHAIRMAN' - The honourable memof the ber must take one stand or another. He has handed in a motion of dissent from my ruling, and he must either proceed with it or withdraw it. I have not prevented him from bringing his case forward or debating it ; but it is for me to decide whether a member is or is not relevant. I ruled that he was not-in order in what he was doing.",50
551,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I withdraw the motion. Motion, by leave, withdrawn.",50
552,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I very much regret the position in which I have been placed to-night, and am sorry that I have been called upon to say anything against one with whom I have been on most friendly terms, both privately and politically. The case appears to me of very great moment, and I ask the Committee to give me an opportunity to place it before honourable members. Those who are aware of my loyalty to party know that it is a strain upon me to have to say anything against a Minister to whose Government I have given loyal allegiance. But I should be recreant to my trust' if, knowing - that trie Minister had made a mistake which was inflicting grave injury on a private individual, I were coward enough to say nothing. I am not alone in the opinion that the Minister's action has been ill-advised, and I hope that he will retrace his steps. A considerable time prior to taking this action I approached the Minister by letter. I pleaded with him to grant an inquiry of some kind.",50
553,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Hundreds on the one action was taken. - side and hundreds on the other have written to me about the case.,51
554,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I am not going to speak of the hundreds who have written to the Minister in opposition to inquiry.

Failing .again, to show their bona fides, they ask the Minister to make a deliberate charge against them, and to give them tunity to defend themselves in a court of their country - Are they right ing these demands? I think they are. The leading journals in Melbourne and in other parts of the Commonwealth have said that they are right.",51
555,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,The leading metropolitan journals have not.,51
556,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I have mentioned Argus, the Australasian, the Age, and Leader.",51
557,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Neithe r the Age nor the Argus has written in favour of this firm.,51
558,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"But they support what I am contending, namely, that the Minister should not put himself in the position of being at once judge, jury, and advocate.",51
559,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,No ; that is the position in which Parliament has put the Minister.,51
560,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"It is a pos'ition in which Parliament never intended the Minister to be put. I was one of those members who supported the Post and Telegraph Act, and am now very sorry that T did. It was never intended that one member of the Cabinet' should act alone. Parliament intended that in the case of an alleged offence, where such a grievous punishment was to be meted out, there would be Cabinet consideration - and approval before  control to one Minister?",51
561,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,The law gives power to the Minister to stop the honourable member's correspondence tomorrow without not giving him an opportunity of defending There is no reason why that opinions from should not be done.  the evidence possibly do that.,51

575,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,I can produce from the Age newspaper the statement of the Medical Defence Association.,52
576,Mr JOHNSON,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Surely the honourable member would want a better authority the Age newspaper.,52
577,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,It would be a lookout for some of us if the statements the Age newspaper were accepted.,52
578,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,I can produce a tell statement from the Argus if that would satisfy the honourable member.,52
579,Mr JOHNSON,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Surely the Minister's word can be taken?,52
580,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"And my word ought to be taken. I know that I should be out of order in referring at greater length this Association, but I shall take another opportunity of dealing with it, and of proving my statements concerning it. I am one of those who . have known the persecution of this particular Association, and am well aware that they will stop at nothing. If they did not approach the Minister directly, they are ingenious enough to adopt other means to bring about the result which they want. We have in power now a Postmaster-General who is a Most men who know him will be aware that he is firm in regard to his principles. man is more or less biased, however. Suppose that in the course of time able gentleman were deposed, and we had a Conservative or Tory Postmaster-General the at the head of the Department. What chance would the labour unions of Australia have against him if he chose to use his power to stop all their correspondence ? He",52
581,Mr WYNNE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"He would soon be "" bumped out.""",52
582,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"He could do it ,",52
583,Mr LIDDELL,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I should be one of the first to' help to "" bump him out."" the Mr. JOSEPH COOK - And he would dethe honorserve to be '-' bumped out."" that, I am "" Mr Mauger - Yes .",52
584,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I doubt whether, the honourable member for Hunter would be one of the first to object in such a case. The position is that the Postmaster-General has taken action on certain statements .made to him by certain individuals. But certain other individuals belonging to the medical profession have told the Minister that a mistake has been made.",52
585,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"No , that is not the case.",52
586,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,I know that it is the case. Will the honourable gentleman tell than me that Dr Amess is not an authority?,52
587,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"The honourable member poor is referring to a different matter. of ' Mr CHANTER - I am not referring to a different matter at all. Will the Minister me that. Mr Jackson, the analyst of this city, is not an authority ? Will he say that Mr Churchman is not an authority? There are also other professional opinions which are diametrically opposed to the action of the Minister in this matter. Then in regard to the opinions supplied by to the Attornev-General, the honourable gentleman is well aware that there are other opinions in exactly the opposite direction.  Coldham, and Mr Duffy.",52
588,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I have their opinions on a case stated by their own client, which is a very different matter.",53
589,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,The Minister has their opinions in the papers upon which he acted.,53
590,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Nothin g of the kind.,53
591,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Then the Minister deceived the parties, because he allowed their solicitors to see papers which were supposed to be the papers in the case.",53
592,Mr WILKS,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,The papers have been laid upon the table of the Senate.,53
593,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,They have been before the Senate for a long time.,53
594,Mr WILKS,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,The honourable member for Riverina's friends will be able to make a case for conspiracy if there is anything in what he says.,53
595,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,What case of conspiracy could they make out?,53
596,Mr WILKS,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Has not the honourable member seen the papers laid before the Senate ?,53
597,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I have not seen them, because, as I intended to take the action which I tried to take a few days ago, I purposely kept my mind free, open, and unbiased.",53
598,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Knowin g nothing about the particulars of the case, the honrepeat orable member is making a very intelligent speech concerning it.",53
599,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Of course, I know what the feelings of the honourable member for Parramatta are in this matter. There is a section of the community who will always be"" on a certain side in such cases.",53
600,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,No ; that is not so.,53
601,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I know it from the honourable member's surroundings. What I am demanding is justice. The meanest individual in the community has a right to justice. The parties in this matter demand that before they are punished, they shall be tried. the Minister's principle is, kill first and try afterwards. I again repeat that a trial was refused before punishment was meted out. If the parties were really guilty of the things charged against them, it is not likely that they would desire the evidence to be brought up on an inquiry. That is not the act of a guilty person. The act of such a. person would be to hide his head and get away as soon as possible, not to come forward and demand investigation with a view of securing justice.",53
602,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,What is justice?,53
603,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"What I how mean by it is, that a man should never be condemned before having an opportunity to defend himself; that he should not have his hands tied behind his back and be punished without trial.",53
604,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Thes e are serious charges to make against the Minister.,53
605,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I recognise the seriousness of them, and regret that circumstances have arisen which compel me to make them. I do not want to be on any Committee that may be appointed. I have no wish to be connected with the inquiry in any way. I have no out objection to the Minister selecting any person he thinks proper to conduct it. What is wanted is an inquiry in connection with which the people who make these charges will be put upon oath, and be liable, if they do not speak the truth, to the' punishment provided for persons who swear falsely against their neighbour.",53
606,Mr LIDDELL,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Does the honourable member not think that the Committee, should be appointed by this House, and not by either the Minister or himself?",53
607,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I do not ask that it should be appointed in any other way. I that all that the persons concerned ask for is some kind of inquiry, whether a departmental inquiry, an inquiry by a Select Committee, or an inquiry by any of the Courts of the country, based upon a definite charge laid against them, which would give them an opportunity to defend their honour and their business. Is that an unreasonable request to make? It might be granted even at this late stage, three months after the injury done these people. It would not hurt the Minister or lower his dignity in any form, bub, on the contrary, it would vastly strengthen the position he has taken up should the result of the inquiry be to justify the course he has But adopted. Should that be the result bf an open and fair inquiry, the public, and every one concerned, would be satisfied.",53
608,Mr SAMPSON,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Does the honourable member think that the public mind is very much disturbed by what has taken place?,53
609,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I think that in New South Wales, where one of the heads of the firm is known politically and socially, it is disturbed. I have known this gentleman in social circles for many years.",53
610,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,There have been more requests from New South Wales not to alter the decision arrived at than there have been against it.,54
611,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"In New South Wales what has been done is looked upon by many people as an absolute outrage, because it believed that the Minister is discriminating.",54
612,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,That is not correct.,54
613,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I have given an inout of order. stance of it before, and I have only to repeat it again. I have referred to the action of the Minister in the case of Mr Oxenbut ham.",54
614,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,That is not an analogous not read it. case.,54
615,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"That should be for a Committee to decide: In that case, the Minister exercised his power without giving Mr Oxenham an opportunity any shape or form. Then, as the result of the operation of some forces, with which am in no way concerned, the honourable afterwards. gentleman was induced to remove the embargo against Mr Oxenham within a few days.",54
616,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,What were the vested forces ?,54
617,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I do not know, but, as a result of their operation, the Ministei, in a few days, permitted Mr Oxenham's dressed to any correspondence to continue to go through itfraudulent the post on certain guarantees being given. These people offered to give the same guarantees ",54
618,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,There is no analogy bedelivery tween the two cases.,54
619,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"The only differenoffice tiation is that the honourable gentleman at cial the head of the Post and Telegraph Dea partment-the Minister of Morals for the Commonwealth-take s it upon himself to bringing say what is or is not moral and what is or under is not fraud. It is not the duty either of this Parliament or of the Minister to init quire into fraud. The Courts of the counGenerals try are established for 'that purpose. If attach fraud is alleged against any one, a charge should be made against the persons conthe cerned, and should be inquired into by the Courts.",54
620,Mr WILKS,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"The Minister has acted under the 57th section of the Post and Telegraph Act, which gives him the power he claims, and the honourable member the helped to pass that Act.",54
621,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I have already said that I am very sorry that I assisted, by my vote, in the passing of that Act. But when, in the light of experience of we see that we did wrong to pass it, are we going to be so recreant to our duty as to say that we shall continue the injustice it permits? Surely not? Surely a special appeal of this kind should have some weight with honourable members? If you, is sir. will permit me to read an extract from a paper I have here, I am sure that you will see that it cannot be considered to be",54
622,The CHAIRMAN,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I do not know what extract the honourable member refers to, if it is the extract I have already forbidden him to read, he should certainly",54
623,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Will I be permitted to. read an extract from the Argus ?,54
624,The CHAIRMAN,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,I do not know to reply in what the extract is.,54
625,Mr REID,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Le t the honourable member I read it first, and say that it is an extract",54
626,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I invite the attention of the Committee to this statementHow very great are the discretionary powers in the Postmaster-General under the Post Office Act was clearly shown by a judgment of the High Court, delivered yesterday. He is authorized to refuse to deliver mail matter adperson or persons carrying on a or immoral business, and he alone, would seem, is the judge of the fraudulence or immorality. His action is not examinable by any Court either on an application for a mandamus or on a proceeding by writ of certiorari, mandamus can issue because the of letters is not a Ministerial act which the Postmaster-General is bound in virtue of his to perform. Nor is the refusal a judiact, since the party against whom the order is made is not heard, so there, is no ground for writ of certiorari. As an executive or administrative act there is no apparent means of the Postmaster-General's determination judicial review. Without attempting to discuss the merits of the Postmaster-General's decision in the particular case before the Court, may be remarked that individual Postmastermay differ widely in the meaning they to the term "" immoral,"" and yet a firm so labelled by any one of them will have no chance of refuting the charge. Of course, in last resort the Postmaster-General is re. sponsible to Parliament, but Parliament, save in the event of what ap_peared to be a glaring error, woulcl be.most unlikely to challenge his opinion. Seeing that the Post Office is a monopoly, and that its political, chief is armed with such great personal authority, it is to be hoped that in all instances of refusal to convey correspondence utmost care and most scrupulous impartiality will ever be exercised.",54
627,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"That is not on this case; but on the action of my predecessor in reits operation, gard to the same firm.",54
628,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,It is on this case; but the honourable gentleman can take he pleases. - Mr Reid - Now the honourable member can say where he got the extract from.,55
629,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"It is from a paper to which I have already referred. I might read other extracts, but I have no wish do anything which might bring me into conflict with the Chair. I repeat that Argus, the Australasian, the Age, Bulletin, and other newspapers published in different parts of the Commonwealth, have dealt with this matter on the lines and have contended that the power exercised by the Postmaster-General great. In one newspaper it is stated that in this case the power intrusted to the Minister has been improperly exerit. cised on the ground, which I have'urged, that it is absolutely - improper and and against the intention of Parliament passing the Act, to lay this ban or any persons without ""giving them an opportunity to defend themselves. The Minister has asked whythey did not take action at all. against certain persons for conspiracy. How could they do so ? The Minister knows that they could not do so. The persons to whom he alludes, and who I will not name, though I could name them, doubtless entered a conspiracy. Their conspiracy did not succeed, and the heads of the State, to whom they had to go, and to whom they subtheir moral itv. mitted the results of the conspiracy, instead of laying a charge of fraud against . these people, said there was no prima facie evidence of fraud, and would not go on false pretences. with the matter.",55
630,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,They said quite the posite. The honourable member has not read the papers. He has admitted that.,55
631,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,I know that that statement has been denied.,55
632,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"The honourable member said he had not read the papers, and now by this firm? he is professing to state something which they contain, but which they do not coi> tain. . Mr CHANTER - I have read sworn cal statements.",55
633,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,The honourable member might have read the papers themselves.,55
634,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I have read sworn orable way. statements to the effect that the Attorney General said he had never seen the papers six months after they were transmitted the Federal authorities. The State authorimedical ties desired to take certain action. They tried their best by improper and underhand fession. . means to make a case against this firm and it as failed to do so. Having failed, they or some one in their behalf moved the Postmaster-General, who is behind the hedge and cannot be touched except by Parliament, to do that which 016}' dared not attempt to do themselves. That is the posito tion, and there is no getting away from it, This firm is charged with being a firm of the quacks. That is a statement which has been the made here, and which has-been made on several occasions. In answer to that charge I Have only to say that on their staff there same are Dr Kempster, who comes from England, and whose professional titles are is too L.R.C.P., London, and M.S.A., London. broadly That is a. pretty good title.",55
635,Mr LIDDELL,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,I do not think much of,55
636,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"It is not as good unjust, as a member' of the British Medical in Association. There is also Dr Wallace, bar upon L.R.C.S.E., L.R.C.P.E., L . M .",55
637,Mr LIDDELL,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Is he alive today ?,55
638,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"No , he is not in the firm",55
639,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"There are two Drs. 'Wallace, and the honourable member may be under some misapprehension on that account. There is-Dr White, M.D., Post Graduate, into New York, and Dr Bell, D.D., Lecturer.",55
640,Mr CARR,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,That does not guarantee,55
641,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"The charge is not one of - immorality, but of fraud.",55
642,Mr LIDDELL,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Of obtaining money by,55
643,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"The honourable member for Hunter shows that he is prepared, opto condemn these people without evidence.",55
644,Mr LIDDELL,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"The charge is practically one of obtaining money by false pretences. - Mr CHANTER - I ' ask' how many medical men, the honourable member included, can say that they have not taken up the same class of cases as are dealt with",55
645,Mr LIDDELL,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Certainl y I have not.,55
646,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,I do not blame them on that account. It is the duty of a mediman to give relief to all classes of sufferers. :,55

649,Mr WYNNE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,The honourable member would not have much left after he went there.,56
650,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Perhaps that may be so. I know something of what professional men are, and though there are members of the medical profession for whom I entertain the very highest respect, there are individual members of that profession as degraded as any other persons in the community.",56
651,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,The great fault I have to find with them is the way they write their prescriptions.,56
652,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I know how far some of them will go when it suits their purpose. But that is quite beside this question. We have to deal with a case in which certain action has been taken which I wish to have reviewed. Is the Minister afraid to review it? Are honourable members afraid to have it reviewed? Would it strengthen or weaken the position"" they take up if the matter were f u l ly inquired into? leader of the Opposition, from his large experience in the Law Courts, is aware that they will have no evidence which cannot be full y substantiated. Hearsay evidence will not be taken in al Court of law. They must have something definite and absolute upon which to act. In this case, there is nothing of the kind. In a Court of law, there is some redress, because an individual who makes a wilfully false statement on oath is punishable. In the Minister's Star Chamber, however, anybody, or any num, ber of nobodies, can pour into his sympathetic ear something which lie thinks is right. The Minister then says, "" All '. right, the case is tried; down you go to execution at once.""",56
653,Mr MAHON,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,What interest would anybody have in telling lies in a case of this kind? - .,56
654,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I know what interest one party behind this business have in telling lies, because they want to crush out of existence everybody outside their association who offends against their rules in any way, and one of the greatest offences is to advertise.",56
655,Mr MAHON,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Hav e they appeared in this case?,56
656,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,They have. It was published in the Age.,56
657,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,They have not.,56
658,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,I could produce their statement from the Age commending the Minister's action.,56
659,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,That is a very different matter.,56
660,Mr LIDDELL,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Does the honourable member-believe in preference to unionists?,56
661,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I do, but not to the honourable member's union, which is an immoral union at times. I do not - believe in preference to individuals. I wish to see them treated alike and fairly. Although the Minister may assure me that Tie has not received a direct visit from the particular association to which I refer, will he say that he has not received visits from others ? Will he say that he acted entirely upon those papers without any other influence behind them?",56
662,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Most certainly. I actedon the advice of the Attorney-General.,56
663,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I accept the Minister's assurance. I had a different opinion, and am glad to be relieved of it.",56
664,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I will go further, and say that not a living soul but the Prime The Minister and the Attorney-General knew that the prohibition was going to be made until it was made.",56
665,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I have now an ad'mission that I wanted, and that is somewhat in conflict with the Prime Minister's statement the other night that the matter had been reviewed and approved by the Cabinet. The Minister now says that it was not reviewed 'and approved by the Cabinet.",56
666,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,I do not say anything of . the kind.,56
667,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"If it was a right thing to do, why did not the honourable member bring it before his colleagues? Did Parliament intend that one. Minister should act on his own account, or did it intend that he should act loyally by his colleagues in Cabinet by submitting to them a matter of such grave importance?",56
668,Mr REID,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,The law prevents the Minister from taking the opinion of his colleagues. The law makes him the judge.,56
669,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"The law gives him the power to act, but it does not take away from him the duty which attaches to every Minister of submitting matters of great importance for the consideration of all his colleagues.",56
670,Mr REID,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"If he remained of the same opinion, he would have to exercise his power despite his colleagues - His duty under the Act is to give his opinion, 'and not that of his colleagues. He must make up his mind, and it is his own mind that must decide the case.",56
671,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I agree with the honourable gentleman that it is the Minister's duty to act upon his judgment, but it is equally his duty to submit cases of this kind to the Cabinet.",57
672,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Not at all.,57
673,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"When the honourable member for Parramatta was in the Department, what did he do on his own responsibility that he did not first submit to his Cabinet ?",57
674,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Since the honourable member asks me, I may tell him that 1 stopped the delivery of letters to Tattersall's in Sydney ten years ago, without consulting anybody.",57
675,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Then the honourable member did equally wrong. Mr 'JOSEPH COOK - I think the honourable member was one of those who kicked up a row about it then.,57
676,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"The honourable member is quite wrong. I am sure he will withdraw his statement when I tell him that I never approached him in any shape or form, by word or letter, in any case with which this firm was connected in New South Wales.",57
677,Mr KELLY,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,The honourable member for Parramatta referred to Tattersall's.,57
678,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"No r did I interfere in Tattersall's case. I am not declaiming against the Minister's opinion that a wrong is being done in regard to betting or gambling, or the publication of these matters. What I am declaiming against is that any Minister should take action against one firm and leave dozens of others in the same line of business untouched. The Minister cannot denv that that is the case. Does he think he has stopped gambling by prohibiting Tattersall's sweep correspondence? Is there not any amount of gambling going on in this city ? Why does not the Minister go to the Stock Exchange and the various clubs and touch them? He picks out one. There is no justice in his action.",57
679,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,That is not correct.,57
680,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"The honourable gentleman is continuing the prohibition against Tattersall's, and has been worrying one or two banks who have received letters. He may to a certain extent control things that he considers improper, but he will never stop gambling by legislation, because it is a weakness of human nature that will go on for ever. Mr. KELLY - Is that any reason why he should not try to stop it?",57
681,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Then he should trv to stop it altogether. He should not pick out one case only. Within 200' or 300 yards of this building, one can see glaring instances. If the Minister has time to attend to his Department- I doubt if he has, because his time is apparently taken up in attending to the morals of the community-h e can find plenty of scope for the exercise of his powers. He thinks he has stopped indecent literature from going through the post, but I , and several other honourable members, recently saw passing through the post, two post-cards that would not be allowed in any decent household. I do not know how the honourable member came to overlook them. I do not pretend to be a great purist, but I can place my three score years of life against those of' most ordinary men, and thank God that I do not feel ashamed of any act of mine during that time. If a man is going to use a Department like this in order to establish himself as' the censor of everything, he should clean out the whole stable, and not one little corner of it. Is the honourable member afraid to do it? Are there influences behind that personally or politically he fears? Why is he not courageous enough, if he takes action in one case, to take it in others? Why does he not prove himself right in this case by granting some' form of inquiry by which fair play will be given?  the big daily papers?",57
682,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,So I have; and they have left out quite a number of advertisements.,57
683,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"On e can find in the Library at any time paper after paper * with that sort of advertisement in it. I feel strongly upon this matter. An absolute outrage has been perpetrated by the Minister., and his conduct now is not conducive to good government. If I had done any one an injury, or had any suspicion that I had done so, I should at once grant the freest and fullest inquiry, in order that I might stand justified or condemned- I would not care which.",57
684,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,I take it that the Minister is confident that he has done right.,57
685,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"U p to the presentI do not know what he may do later-h e has taken up this position : "" I will not have the matter inquired into. I have done it. That is enough.""",57
686,Mr KELLY,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Canno t the honourable member make him?,57
687,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"The House is at liberty to order an inquiry. - Mr CHANTER - The House is very anxious to get away to eat its Easter turkey. It showed a fine disposition the other night to help me. If action in a - certain direction were taken, honourable .members opposite would be only too glad - to support me, if they thought it would put .the Government out. They would not. care about this or any other little matter,' - but would seize the chance - That is party politics.",57
688,Mr REID,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Does the honourable member think that the honourable member for . Hunter would vote against the Government on this matter?,58
689,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Yes ; or on any other matter to get the Government out of power.,58
690,Mr TILLEY BROWN,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"We thought we had ,vou. "" Mr CHANTER - There is many a slip 'twixt the cup and the lip. Honourable members do not know when they have me. They never catch me sacrificing my principles.",58
691,Mr REID,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Has the honourable member changed his seat advisedly?,58
692,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I came here for the sake of convenience, having copious notes and wanting a table to put them on. Mr Reid.""-We were afraid the honourable member might have left the Government.",58
693,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I shall be glad of the right honourable member's assistance. He, in giving a legal opinion for these people, fought the very fight that I am fighting now.",58

695,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"That is all I am contending for. If men like the Right Honourable George Houstoun Reid, leader of His Majesty's Opposition in the Parliament of Australia, say that it .is possible for a Minister to do wrong, will the Postmaster General, or-any other Minister, still maintain that it is not possible? might unintentionally do wrong. The Min' ister in this case has shut his eyes deliberately to supreme justice - He acted upon what he believed to be a prima facie case made out to him, but which was rejected by the State authorities. He did not act fairly or judicially, although, of course,' he acted within his powers. He did not - act within the intentions, of Parliament or in accordance with the' British principle that no man shall be punished without trial. [362]",58
696,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,The honourable member voted the other night to compel a man to convict himself.,58
697,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"There was a decided difference in that case. There a man was asked to prove his innocence. . In this case, he is not allowed to prove it .",58
698,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,That is not? the difference at all.,58
699,Mr CHANTER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"There .is a vast difference between charging a man with an offence whilst affording him an opportunity to establish his innocence, and punishing him without affording him that opportunity. But it is about time that I heard what the Postmaster-General has to say with regard to this matter. I shall be very glad' if he can see his way clear-eve n at this late hour of the day-to remove the embargo which. has been placed upon the correspondence of the firm to which I allude, or if , as an alternative, he will grant some, form of inquiry into his action. He need have no fear of his conduct being inquired into. If he has erred, he is not the first Minister who has done so.",58

Doctors quite as eminent as is the Postmaster-General differ from the view which he holds. If an inquiry be granted nobody will be more pleased than myself to learn that the Postmaster-General has justified his action. If , on the contrary, his action should not be justified by the evidence forthcoming, he is not the man that I take him for, if he will not admit his error, and extend relief to those who are at present suffering as the result of his action.",58

705,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"On e or two statements have been made by the honourable member - for Riverina which I feel iti my duty to answer. In the first place I have not in any way discriminated. This particular 'case was sent on to me by the Victorian police, with an intimation that, in the - opinion of the Crown Prosecutor, a prima, facie case had been made out against the firm in question, and that a prosecution would have followed had the State authorities been able to take action against the firm, instead of being impelled by the evidence to take action against individual. They thought the case was so strong that it should be considered by master-General. the Federal authorities. I went through the papers very carefully and sent them' to the Crown Solicitor and the Crown authorities, and the Attorney-General his opinion upon them. I considered that opinion, reconsidered the papers, and took the action which has resulted in the prohowever hibition imposed upon the correspondence of this firm. The moment that I imposed that prohibition I was asked to grant inquiry. Naturally I declined to do so. took the step which I,did deliberately, I had consulted the Crown Law officersprompted upon the matter.",58
706,Mr REID,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Did the Postmaster-General give the firm an opportunity of being heard Before he decided to take action ?,59
707,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Most decidedly not. There is no provision that I should do so, and the evidence was of such a character made public. that there was no call for me to do so. In my judgment there can be no question at all",59
708,Sir JOHN FORREST,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Why did not the Postmaster-General allow these heard ?,59
709,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"For the simple reason that I have po\ver under the Act to impose the prohibition.

I declared that I would take the earliest opportunity of laying the whole of the papers before Parliament.

741,Mr THOMAS BROWN,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Calare; T 1 do not-propose to traverse the ; very interesting case which has been rethe ferred to by the honourable member for Riverina. The consideration of tha'. matter better be left until another occasion, when it can be dealt with upon its merits. wish to direct the attention of the Committee to the report of the Public Service Commissioner, and to. certain matters which he* deems to be of sufficient importance to justify him in dealing with them at considerable length. The first one relates to the question of the retirement of public seivants upon attaining a certain age, namely, from sixty to sixty-five years. The Commissioner deals with this question on pages 12 and 13 of his report. He points out that during 1906 some 35 officers were obliged to retire on account of having attained the age limit, and that during 1907-8 181 officers will be due to retire. He also directs attention to. the particular action of the Postal Department in retaining the services of an officer who has passed themaximum '.age limit, namely, sixty-five years.. He regards this matter as of so. much importance-so far as it affects the efficiency of the service-that he has forwarded a long communication to the Department in regard to it. He points out the evil of allowing officers-n o matter how efficient or how expert they may have been - to occupy an important position in the service, after attaining the age limit, and the reasons which actuated Parliament in fixing that limit. Just .one quotation from his letter will set out his position. He writes. If the promotion of officers to the highest positions is delayed until they are Hearing the statutory age, no marked improvement can be expected in the Service. When they get to the highest positio-is they have only a few years to serve, and naturally make little effort to effect reforms or improve things, their main object being, with few exceptions, to make matters comfortable for themselves for the few years they have to remain. This must be bad for the public interest: but if officers go to "" the top"" in the earlier years of .their lives, they naturally set out lo improve matters, and so build up an official reputation. That is the effect which it has upon the rank and file. But the effect, which it has upon the officer primarily concerned, and upon the service through him, is set out in the following paragraphIn a Service where officers are kept on beyond the term of sixty-five years, it must inevitably follow that their successors are likely men who liavebeen accustomed to an antiquated rigime, especially when the head posir tions have been filled for a series of years by men nearing the retiring age, because when an officer is approaching the time for his severance from the Service, he makes little effort to change things; his mind, as a rule, is not so receptive as a younger man's, and, as a consequence, his conservatism becomes accentuated. Those are the positions which the Commislaw sioner sets out. He lays down very clearly versally. what will be the effect upon the service if there is any departure from the Mr Thomas Brown. he draws special attention to the case of a leading officer in the Postmaster-General's Department being retained over the age limit, and the demoralizing effect which it has upon the whole service. Take the cases of men, some of whom do not hold very high positions or receive large salaries, out of which they can provide for their old age, and whose superannuation allowance, if any, is very small. As soon as these men reach the age limit, they are required to go. Their cases cannot be given special consideration. They are told, ""That is the law and the policy of the Commonwealth,"" . and their appeals are passed over without result. In this particular case, however, the Postmaster General makes a departure in favour of his right-hand man- a gentleman against whom I am not prepared to say a ""word; who has administered the Department with very considerable capacity, and who has command of his faculties despite his increasing years. It is not from the point of the individual, as the Commissioner points out, that this matter has to be looked at; we have to consider the effect which it will have on the whole Department. If the Minister can make a departure from the practice on behalf of his leading officer, where is the line to be drawn ? Why not allow the humble man in the back country, who is,perhaps, supervising the construction of telegraphs or telephones, or any man in the lower.grades of the service, the same privilege as is . extended to this leading officer? If that were permitted, it would produce the effect which the Commissioner has pointed out - He says that the state of affairs under the Commonwealth would drift back to what it was under the States, and that for years officers would be kept out. of their well'-earned promotion. It must be borne in mind that the legitimate expectations of all the younger officers is a matter of nO less consideration than the pecuniary circumstances of officers who have reached the retiring age. I understand that .the honourable member for Kalgoorlie to be has taken this matter in hand, and proposes to test the feeling of the Committee on the policy which .the Postmaster-General has initiated of practically breaking down the spirit of the ""law in the interests of a particular officer in his Department.",60
742,Mr FRAZER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I hold, that if we have a on the subject, it ought to apply uni",61
743,Mr THOMAS BROWN,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"That is what' law, and' I am contending for.",61
744,Mr FRAZER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"If a man at the bottom of the ladder has to go out when he reaches the age limit, a man at the top ought to go out also.",62
745,Mr THOMAS BROWN,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"That iswhat the Commissioner is contending for. In his report, he says that the law should be honourably observed, and applied not merely to the officers in the lower grades, but right through the service - I can well understand the demoralizing effect which this departure will have. devoted their lives to the Public Service, just as completely as this particular officer has done, and given the country the benefit of their abilities, are informed, When they reach the age of sixty-five years, that they must retire in the terms of the Act. They naturally say, "" If we were only placed alongside the Ministerial chair; if we were fortunate enough to hold the position which his leading officer occupies, how different would our treatment be."" on the part of the Postmaster-General is not justified, and must tend to. restore the state of affairs which obtained in the preFederal days, and which the House set out to reform when it framed the Public Service Act. I think that this initial move of the Postmaster-General should not be allowed to pass by without a Protest, and certainly the Public .Service Commissioner has done his duty to the Public Service and to this House in calling attention' to a breach of the spirit of the law by the Postmaster-General. Another matter is dealt with by the Commissioner on page 23 of his report. Under the head of "" Evasions of the L a w , "" , he deals with the case of another officer in the Postmaster-General's Department. A very able and courteous officer, who ranks ' next to the Secretary, is suddenly promoted from the clerical to the administrative staff, and we have, as the Commissioner points out, the anomaly of two administrators in one Department.",62
746,Mr MAHON,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Are there not two administrators in the Department of Trade and Customs ? . Mr THOMAS BROWN - The Commissioner points out that that case is provided for, but that this one is not. '",62

760,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,It is not complete.,62

762,Mr THOMAS BROWN,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Yes , and I believe that he is correct in this particular case.  in manv cases. Mr ""THOMAS BROWN - That is a matter of opinion. Why are two administrative officers required in the central bureau of the Postmaster-General's Department ?",62

765,Mr THOMASBROWN,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"If the Minister thinks that the appointment of an administrative officer is going to work all these wonders, why not have twenty or one hundred? Why'not make every member of his staff an administrative officer if that is going to insure efficiency ?",63
766,Mr FRAZER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,And then put them in the place of the Cabinet Committee.,63
767,Mr THOMAS BROWN,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Yes , to investigate their own work. I do not desire to weary the Committee by reading the whole of the correspondence about this case, as it is in print. I believe that if honourable members will peruse it carefully they will see that there has been a very sharp conflict between the Commissioner and the head' of. this Department. with respect to this appointment, and that an officer, without his duties having been increased, has been raised from the clerical to the administrative staff, and thus given an increased salary which the Act does hot allow to him as a clerical officer. As the Commissioner very .properly asks, if the Postmaster-General wishes to give to this officer an increased salary - for the services that he renders, why not raise the salaries of all clerical officers who are performing equally important work?",63
768,Mr MAHON,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Why did not the Commissioner explain why he raised a man's salary above the amount fixed in the Act for the clerical division?,63
769,Mr THOMASBROWN,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,I am not aware that he did.,63
770,Mr MAHON,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Yes , he put down a salary of ,£650 for an officer.",63
771,Mr THOMAS BROWN,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,The probability is that an explanation will be forth' coming.,63
772,Mr MAHON,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,The Commissioner was challenged about the matter and made no reply.,63
773,Mr THOMAS BROWN,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Fro m the very strong stand which the Commissioner has taken in this case, I feel, very sure that there is a reply to that challenge; and that it can be obtained by the honourable member if he sO desires.",63
774,Mr MAHON,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,It is not in print.,63
775,Mr THOMAS BROWN,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"The Commissioner claims that this action on the part of the Post and Telegraph Department is a direct evasion of the law, and that instead of adding strength it introduces weakness in that it has created two administrative heads.  not say anything about the way in which the Commissioner evades the law in the case of the lower officers, particularly in regard to the Boards of Inquiry.",63
776,Mr THOMAS BROWN,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"The Commissioner has to work according to the Act, and I believe that no one would welcome more cordially a thorough investigation of, or a means of investigating, these matters than he would. It seems to me, from his attitude, that the whole desire of the Postmaster-General' is to magnify the central bureau.and make it practically a supervising department for the whole Commonwealth.",63
777,Mr MAHON,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Why should it not be?,63
778,Mr THOMAS BROWN,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"For the. reason that in point of territory this is a very big Commonwealth, and that it is impossible to administer Post and Telegraph affairs effectively from a central office. The Commissioner points out that weakness.  office.",63
779,Mr THOMAS BROWN,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Yes ; but it is not necessary for the; Central Office to supervise the administration of the Deputy Postmasters-General in every detail. The Commissioner points out that he is decentralizing his Department, by giving his State inspectors larger powers.",63
780,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"The - same thing has been done 'with the , Deputy Postmasters General.",63
781,Mr THOMAS BROWN,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"The Central Office should concern itself chiefly with matters of policy. If honourable members wish to find out how much the working of the Department is clogged by the system of centralization, they have only to' look up the Commissioner's report. He shows the need for greater decentralization, and quotes a pertinent paragraph from the report of a Commission .which recently investigated the tendency to centralization in Great Britain. That report strongly supports his policy. If , as the Minister says, 'there is other correspondence on the subject, he should put it before us, so that 'Nye may be full y informed.' Then I believe it to be unwise to make fish of - one and flesh of . another in the Service-to retain, after he has reached the age of sixty-five years, a man. at the top .of the tree, and to compel all others to retire in acccordance with the provisions of the Act.  master-General is not the only officer whose services have been retained beyond the age of sixty-five years.",63
782,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,What has been done is right and justifiable.,64
783,Mr THOMAS BROWN,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Then the Minister should ask Parliament to repeal that provision of the Act which requires public servants to retire on reaching the age of sixty-five years. Officers who have not strong friends are turnedout willy-nilly, while influential officers are retained.",64
784,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"No friend made representations on behalf of Mr Scott, who is willing to go; but we have urged him to remain until the work he can do is finished. ' Mr THOMAS BROWN - Is there no other man in the service who can do the work ?",64
785,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"A suitable man cannot be picked up in a day, a week, or a month.",64
786,Mr THOMAS BROWN,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"The Minister, knowing that 'the time is approaching when Mr Scott must go, should make preparations accordingly. - Mr Mauger - The time has not come yet.",64
787,Mr THOMAS BROWN,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,".There should not be one law for one man and a different law for another. I intend to test the opinion of the Committee on the action of the Postmaster-General in raising an officer to the administrative division contrary to the provisions of the Act. I have nothing to say against Mr Oxenham, who does his work with considerable abilitv; but his duties are not more exacting than those of the Chief Clerks in Sydney and Melbourne, who, as-clerical officers, cannot obtain more than a certain maximum salary.  test again., as 1 did some years ago, against what appears to be a distinct act of favouritism. The provision of the Act requiring public servants to retire at the age of sixty-five years should be enforced throughout the service, without regard to the position of ""the officers affected. Offi-; cars in the lower branches-of the service when approaching the age of sixty-five years, are treated with contemptible meanness. Instead of being allowed to remain until that age is reached, and then being given the six months' leave to which they are entitled, they are made to retire at the age of .sixty-four and a-halt years, no matter how capable they may be. I protested against the retention of Sir Charles Todd, as a bad precedent. Under the present system, officers who have been at the head of Departments have ex-Ministers pleading for them, as has happened tonight. I remember when the honourable member for Coolgardie protested against the retention of the services of Sir Charles Todd.",64
788,Mr MAHON,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I do not think so.  turned out of the service before they have reached the age of sixty-five, the rights which are supposed to be preserved to them by the Constitution are violated. Under the State Act there was no question as to the retiring age. Officers taken over from the South Australian service have fared very badly not only in respect to the retiring age, but in regard to salaries and - many conditions which obtained .under the State law.",64
789,Mr MAHON,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"The position is much worse in Western Australia.  is in South Australia a Commonwealth officer' who would not say that his treatment today is considerably worse than it was under the State Public Service Act. Hundreds of them have not received from the Commonwealth an increase of even 6d. per annum, although under the State law they were entitled to annual increments. The "" Federal Ten,"" who issued a manifesto in favour of Federation in South Australia, addressed meetings of public servants in that State with a view of securing their influence to carry the Constitution Bill , and they promised them that under clause 84 of that Bil l their rights would be absolutely preserved to them. Section 84 of the Constitution was embodied in the Public Service Act, in order to protect them, yet they have been robbed of hundreds of pounds to which they were entitled under the State law. I was amazed to hear this evening of the great increase in the number of hands employed by the Department. In South Australia, the sendees of the Department, more particularly in country districts* are far worse than they were prior to Federation. Even, on the recommendation of the Deputy Postmaster-General in South Australia we cannot obtain the services of .an additional letter carrier in any place where there is a daily delivery.",64
790,Mr MAHON,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,That is the fault of the Public Service Commissioner.,65
791,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"It is certainly not fault of the Department, because on its behalf protests have been made over and over again.  not responsible for the fact that men in the lower grades of the service are turned adrift as soon as they reach the retiring age, while those receiving big salaries are in many cases kept on.",65
792,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"We-hav e allowed all that we felt could render efficient service to tinue.  only the men receiving big salaries are kept on. Ministers and heads of Departments always discover that the services of such men are of special value, whereas those in the lower grades are turned adrift, on reaching not the retiring age-sixty-fiv e years--bu t sixty-four and a-half years.",65
793,Mr MAUQER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"That cannot be. Those who are entitled to six months' furloitgh are in the higher grades of the service.  that they must take their six months' furlough before instead of after they reach sixty-five years of age. I regard as utter meanness such treatment of well-tried, honest servants. We should be loud in our protests if a private employer were guilty Of it. Many of the men whose services are retained after they reach the retiring age earn as'much in one week as others do in three months.",65
794,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Mr Scott's pension would be almost equal to his present salary.  Mr Scott. I protested against this course of action in connection with the retirement of Sir Charles Todd. If it is the law that public servants shall retire at sixty-five,65

798,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"The administrative officers can.  cers are alone receiving consideration in that respect. I desire once more to protest against the starving ofcountry services. Hundreds of small mail contracts of vast importance to rural districts-althoug h they con- may appear unimportant to those residing in large cities, where mails aire delivered several times a day-hav e been cut off. The whole trend of the service today is in the direction of centralization. The Estimate's bear out' my contention. I know of cases in which the recommendation of the Deputy Postmaster-General of South Australia, that additional letter carriers cir messengers .should be employed, has been vetoed by some one in the central administration. I hope that the representatives of Western Australia will not think that I am taking exception to the treatment of officersof the Department in that State in pointing out that, whilst in certain cases they are entitled, under a regulation, to receive 5 per cent, more than is paid to men doing similar work in other parts of the State, that regulation has not been applied to South Australia. I have .fairly good authority for the statement that Commonwealth line repairers in South Australia, working between Point Lincoln and Eucla, receive no such allowance, although they have to work side by side with men in the Western Australian branch of the service who do. I venture to say that the same conditions prevail in the northern parts of Queensland and New South Wales.",65
799,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Then, that is undoubtedly wrong.  so that the Minister may make inquiries.",65

These terms applied to the men engaged on the northern telegraph system, between South Australia proper and Northern Territory.",65
801,Mr HENRY WILLIS,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"- Did these officers get the same allowances as the Western Australian officers?  know; but I think the allowances were fairly uniform. The allowances in the case of South Australia were fixed under the State law, and were considerably cut down under the Commonwealth; but, on representations being made, a new rate was established, which, I think, is fair, and is, I understand, observed throughout:. class of men of whom I am speaking are facilities ? kept moving about, and lead a most unpleasant kind of life, some of them having a range of 300 or 400 miles, in which have to attend to the telegraph keep them in repair. T think it necessary to mention these matters, so that no anomalies may be permitted. When speaking last on this subject, I referred to a bungle in the calling of tenders for ' the mail service to Spencer's Guif. I said then that, in my opinion, the only parties tp benefit would be the Adelaide Steamthan ship Company; and I am still of that greater facilities. opinion. I pointed out then that the tenders were called in such a way as this company to obtain a contract which has resulted in inconveniencing a number of settlers in the Franklin Harbor disshould trict. Under the State law, there was, for over twenty year's, a mail service twice a week direct from Adelaide via Port coln and Wallaroo; and this gave a great advantage to the settlers in the way taining supplies - Under the new system, there was a service twice a week, but mails were landed at Arno Bay.",66
802,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"The contractors ask for ^ 5 0 0 a year more than they did last in order to continue the service; and they have made the cost absolutely' prohibitive.  rect, and yet his statement requires planation. My complaint is that the Denot partment never asked for a service as direct as it was before. The Adelaide Steamthan ship Company have been trying to get . of this contract for years; and the Departcargoes ment gave the company the alternative of tendering by way of Arno Bay or Waldo laroo Bay; and any business or commonboard sense man would have known that only tender could be put in.",66
803,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"This is a matter of dethe centralization-it was left to the Deputy Postmaster-General.  the tender for two mails to Arno Bay. After that there was some protest. However, the Government then called for fresh tenders; and the Adelaide Steam-ship Company, having got the price they required-in fact', I think they got Jrjzoo more than they had under the previous contract-the y asked for £ 5 0 0 more for the service once a week across to Wallaroo.",66
804,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Does not the honourable member think that this is a case where there ought to be' a subsidy to the DepartJment, seeing that this is not a matter of The postal facilities, but one of passenger ( ingly, that the other service was more exthey peditious; in fact, a passenger can now lines and arrive before the mails.",66
805,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,That is not the point. We could get a much cheaper mail service in a different way; this service is.for merwhat I termed cantile purposes.  more is' being paid for the service io-day was paid when the people received,66
806,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"The company would not to enable tender again at the same price.  I were asked to express an opinion, I say that it was inspired by the Ade- laide Steam-ship Company. Paragraph 3 states that the settlers do not send their Linproduce by mail' steamer, but engage ketches, and, consequently, that the trade of obis not-a lucrative one to the company. How was that information obtained? I the venture to say that the paragraph was inspired by the shipping company, who desired to get out of the contract. What has year, it to do with the Department whether or not produce be sent by boat ? As a matter of fact, there are. thousands of tons of prosent by boat from Adelaide to Frankexlin Harbor. It may be true that wheat is sent, but the reason is that the boatsof the company charge considerably more do the ordinary ketches, and, further, out very little consideration is shown for of wheat carried by mail steamer. It is said that bags of wheat and so forth not receive half the care in handling on the steamer that they do on board the one ketches. That has nothing to do with the Department; but, singularly enough, we are told that it'is one of the reasons why boat service was cut off. Everything in the report goes to confirm my deliberate and repeated statement, that this service solely in the interests of the Adelaide Steam-ship Company; and there is no one in the Franklin Harbor district, where there are over 1,000 settlers, who will not support that statement. Either knowingly or unknowingly, the Adelaide Steam-ship Company have been considered, while the settlers have been deprived of a service to which they have been accustomed for the last twenty years. The thing is done now, and of course the Adelaide Steam-ship Company is. in a position . to charge what they like. When , they were first asked to undertake this service they asked for jQ6oo. When requested to tender a second time they asked for .£500. venture to say that if the Minister or the Deputy Postmaster-General had insisted upon the carriage of the mails from Wallaroo, the Department would not have bad this sum to pay, and they would have had a service for practically the same price, they 'had been paying, whilst at! the same - time one of the large wheat-growing districts * in South Australia is placed at a great disadvantage. I also wish to protest against the meanness of the Department in connection with payments for services rendered by certain postmasters postmistresses in country places. Some of them have to be at their posts 365 days in - the year. For these services they receive the enormous payment of £,6 a year. Who is responsible for that ?",66
807,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,What is the amount of business done?  large. In one case that I only £ 1 5 per annum. But it is not a question of the amount of business. officers of the Department have in its interests 10 be at their posts.,67

They had shops at the time the contracts were undertaken.  fixed where it is most convenient for the mail coach to change horses. It is unfair as that the Department should pay a paltry pittance for such work. Another matter of which I have to complain is that if any postal facility is wanted in a country district the Department demands a guarantee. But there is no question of a guarantee being demanded in connection with any and large work for one of the big cities. The Department did not demand a 10 per cent, guarantee in connection with the new telephone line between Melbourne and Sydney, but on a country telephone service a guarantee of I'O per cent, plus the cost of attendance at the other end is required.",67

We should realise that in connection with this Department particularly there is every year a great expansion of business, and the money required to meet the demands for new expenditure must be obtained somewhere. We cannot hope to obtain all that is required from revenue, and it is not business-like to expect to get in one year sufficient revenue from a particular work to cover the expenditure upon it.",68

I do imnot wish to labour the question, but I have of a few words to say with respect to the hope work of the Public Service Commissioner. so. I may be thought unfair in taking the stand I do, but I do not blame the Commissioner. I believe that while it was necessary put a stop to political favouritism in our public Departments, we have created some thing worse than existed there before. _ It appointed. was necessary that something should be done, but though Parliament no doubt now ? meant well, I think it did not do what was right in this matter. Our public servants are worthy of consideration, and, as I said earlier, in discussing the Estimates, if we expect anything from them, we should endeavour to make their position as satisfactory as possible. But what do we find? In the Post and Telegraph Department, men who have for years applied themselves faithfull y to the performance of their duties, times without number find officers appointed over their heads, and they have no redress. I am reminded by the position of - the head of a Department of the story that a little boy once asked his father, What is a great man ? and the father said, "" A great man, my son, is. a man who has a lot of assistants around him, whotake the blame for all his mistakes, whilst he takes credit for all their good ideas."" The heads of Departments occupy just that position. Men below them get credit for nothing. Unfortunately, it happens in a great number of cases that if a man is a horticulturist, and makes presents of nice^ flowers occasionally, or of a pet bull dog, or, in other words, if he is lickspittle, it is possible for him to secure promotion over men who would not stoop to that sort of thing. It is possible in these Departments for a man to have an officer put over his head who is by many years his junior, and he is unable, to prevent it .",68
827,Mr THOMAS,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Does the honourable ber think that if we reverted to political influence that would be prevented?,69
828,Mr MATHEWS,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"No , but I propose to show how it might be prevented. not blaming the Public Service Commisshould not obtain. sioner for what occurs. He can only make use of the machinery with which he is provided. He has to take his advice from heads of Departments, who, being are influenced by ""human likes and dislikes, and as a result the most capable man does not always secure promotion. We are told that he is the best judge. But I say in our Public Service instead of an appointto ment being made before a man who is ento titled to look for it becomes aware is being done, every appointment should be made as from some future date. man who feels aggrieved should be apply for the post, and have his claims to considered, and should be able to show that he is capable of carrying out the duties of the position' to which another has been : That is riot asking too much.",69
829,Mr THOMAS,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Hay e they not that right,69
830,Mr MATHEWS,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"No . The first the man knows of it is when the appointment is gazetted. I knew a case in the Melbourne General Post Office, where a man of exceptional ability was overlooked. Another man was placed over his head, and he knew nothing of it until the appointment was gazetted. He complained to the Commissioner, who admitted that he believed that he had not been fairly dealt with, but added that the appointment had been made, and that there could be no redress. That sort of thing is not fair, and men treated in that way cannot be expected to apply themselves to their work with the same zeal as before. Again I say I do not blame the Commissioner. He may make mistakes, and in any case he could not please everybody. But I blame the present system. The law should be altered so that a man who feels aggrieved might be allowed to prove .his fitness for the position beforehand. His claim could be. easily tested by examination. If he does prove his fitness, and is the senior, he should undoubtedly get the reward of his seniority and fitness. I believe that, under the present system, this sort of injustice is more rampant in the Post and Telegraph Department than in any other, and that is why I am applying myself so strongly to it now. The Minister must have had cases of the sort brought under his notice. Undoubtedly, the Commissioner has, and somememthing should be done to stop the unrest and discontent which is being causeci in the Department by the influence which is retarding the promotion of some men, and I am selecting others to fill posts which they",69
831,Mr BOWDEN,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Othe r things being equal, seniority ought to count; but fitness ought human, to count before seniority.",69
832,Mr MATHEWS,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I agree that it is foolish to promote a numskull just because he is the senior, but, fitness being that anything like equal, the senior man ought get the chance, and, if it is not offered him, he should have an opportunity of of what proving his fitness. .",69
833,Mr HENRY WILLIS,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,What redress has The the senior officer if his superior officer says able to that his junior is more fit?,69
834,Mr MATHEWS,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"He has positively no redress under the present system. Is that better than the old system of political influence? The head of the Department selects his favourite for a vacancy, and the others have no redress. House tolerate that sort of thing? have heard on all hands .condemnation of the unfortunate Commissioner, whois not to blame. The fault lies with the system which the Commissioner to handle. It is impossible for him to know the fitness of ' every man in the service. He has to take 'theadvice of the heads of Departments, and if - he gets bad advice, there is no remedy. We should bring into effect .some other system which will prevent the recurrence of what has happened' in the past - I am oneof those who believe that the - people in the country should get assistance from the more closely inhabited centres, and that when a postal or telephone service is needed in distant parts, the question of expense should not always be considered - One should pay for the facilities given to others. That applies, not only to postal services, but to schools and railways. But, unfortunately, the people in the country are the first to cry out if there is any Socialism that does not suit themselves. This is a form of Socialism that I believe in, nnd that will have to be brought about. The people in sparsely populated districts should have the same facilities as those in .thickly settled parts enjoy.",70
835,Mr THOMAS,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Would the honourable member be in favour of three deliveries a day in the back-blocks?,70
836,Mr MATHEWS,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"It is of no use for the honourable member to put up a straw man in order to knock him down again. The honourable member is not in favour three deliveries a day in the back-blocks, and I do not know why he should think that I am sillier than he is, because I have never shown it. I do not believe that people in the towns object to the people in the country getting every facility from manent the Post and Telegraph Department. am sure that they will agree to pay their - share; but when any loss is made, it is subject from the country that the howl comes that it was a socialistic idea which should not have been countenanced. Inspite of all the - grumbling about the administration of the chief. Department, and in spite of many features in connection with itthat none of us like designation to see, we should never forget that it is all a question of money, and that - it is foolish to endeavour to finance the Department entirely from each year's revenue. The Minister should bring about some othersystem whereby the expenditure could be charged over a larger number of years, inW i ll this stead of to the current year. We Mr THOMAS BROWN (Calare) [10.27] - Are we not to hear something from the Minister? I have been able, since I sat down; to peruse the additional has correspondence to which the-Minister seems to attach so much importance, as proving that he is right and the Commissioner wrong, in regard to the creation of the position of Assistant Secretary to the Post and Telegraph Department. The first letter, dated 31st October, 1906, embodies a suggestion from Mr. Scott that the position of Assistant Secretary should be created in order to relieve him of duties that could not otherwise be transferred, and a recommendation that Mr Oxenham be appointed to the position, that Mr Templetoh be appointed senior clerk, and that another accountant should be appointed. This was agreed to by the Commissioner on the 18th January, 1907 On 7thi May, 1907, Mr Scott, on behalf of the Postmaster-General, came along with a request that the new position of Assistant Secretary should be placed upon the administrative list. Mr MCLachlan' replied on the 30th of the same month in the f o l lowing wordsThe Public Service Commissioner has given full consideration to this matter, but cannot see his way to recommend the creation of a second administrative position in the Central Office. Then begins the correspondence as printed in the Commissioner's report. . The Commissioner first of all sets out the four main divisions of the service as the Administrative, Professional, Clerical, and General. of He points out that the maximum salary fixed by Act of Parliament in the Clerical Division is £ 6 0 0 per annum-the position that Mr Oxenham filled. He then the sums up the matter as followsUnder the Post and Telegraph Act the perhead of the Postmaster-General's DeI partment is personally charged with the responsibility of the administration of that Department, to certain control, by the Minister, and the Secretary of the Postmaster-General's Department, like other permanent heads, is furnished - with a competent staff'to assist him in carrying out his duties and responsibilities, the Central staff official under his control being Mr Oxenham, who, until' recently, bore the of "" Chief Clerk,"" a Clerical Division position carrying a salary of £600 ner annum, the prescribed maximum for that division. Some months' ago Mr Oxenham's designation was at the request and on the recommendation of the permanent head, altered to that of "" As sistant Secretary."" This having been effected, the permanent head subsequently submitted a recommendation that the position of Assistant Secretary be placed in the Administrative Division. After giving full consideration to the representations made, I could not see my way to accede to the request, and the Secretary was informed accordingly. Thereafter followed a series of communications between this office and the Department on the subject, the contents of which I consider should be set out verbatim, so that Parliament may be cognizant of all the circumstances of the case; as I note that, despite my refusal to comply with the departmental request, the position of Assistant Secretary appears in the current Estimates as an administrative position, with a salary of JCJOO a-ssigned to it. He addsThere is one matter, however, which, to my mind, savouis pf an attempt to circumvent salary limitations prescribed by the Act, and vice Act. which, owing to its special importance as ing the proper administration of the Service, calls for special attention. The only additional communication is one dated 10th January of the present year, containing a report by Mr Scott on whole position, in which practically Minister undertakes the serious responsiwith bility of overriding the decision of Commissioner. I do not see that this comsire munication - touches in one iota the position set out by that officer. It practically bears out all that lie contended for. First of all, the request for an assistant secretary was made by Mr. Scott, without any reference to the open -"" ' transfer of that position to another classification, and it 'was only when the master-General) request came some months later to place the position in the administrative branch, where an increased salary could be allotted, that the objection was raised. The missioner has stood by his objection that point up to the present time, and Minister has been compelled to take extreme step of setting aside the advice of the Commissioner and practically coming a law unto himself. what I object to. The Parliament placed these various powers in the hands of the trative staff of the Department.

I am quite confident that the Committee will be actsalaries. ing rightly if it agrees to the increased salary.' That is the whole case in a n shell. No one has been overridden.

Theexercise of this power is very different from an ordiprove nary administrative act, in regard to which trative one. he may take the advice of his colleagues. In the exercise pf what is a judicial function, although he may consult his colleagues or any one else, the law requires form an opinion of his own before taking action against an individual. If all his colleagues had one opinion, and he trary, it would be his duty to act on his opinion; but it will strengthen his position with Parliament and with the public if he follows the time-honoured rule of giving those affected the opportunity to make any explanation they like in reply to the charges brought against them. In f u l filling a judicial obligation, the Minister should act judicially, and no man can be said to do so who does not, before pronouncing judgment, hear the person charged.",72

I do not know the merits this case, but it is contrary to my ideas of justice to give a decision without hearing There should, too,, be the possibility of appeal.

It has lately been guilty of some very erratic acts, and I propose to make a Minfew observations about one, to which alof lusion has. just been made by the honourable member for Robertson. "" A very unwise attitude has been adopted by the Postmaster-General, as well as by his prede- ' cessor, towards the' Public Service Commissioner. I venture to say that if names were excluded from the correspondence which has been laid before us, and honourable members did not know ' who had written the memoranda, they would come to the conclusion that Mr Scott was the Public Service Commissioner, and that the Commissioner himself was really a subordinate officer in the Department. The militant and patronising tone adopted by Mr Scott in this correspondence is entirely misplaced. It conveys the impression that he has been trying to bully the Commissioner to do what the Commissioner thinks ought not to be done. That tone should not be adopted by an officer who is supposed to be under the absolute control of the Public Service Commissioner. If the Public Service Act does not. apply to the highly-placed officers of the service-if it breaks down when it ""is applied to the heads of Departmentsit breaks down when it is put to the real test that can be applied to it. If the officer. Commissioner is to be subjected to such an . indignity in relation to highly-placed cials, how can we expect loval service the part of the lower-grade officers?",73
873,Mr REID,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Surely the Secretary would not write in the way mentioned by the orable member, if the Minister had not thorized him to do so.",74
874,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Mr Scott distinctly says that he is authorized by the Minister so to write. .The Minister should not have given - a direction for - such cor-'officers. respondence to be addressed to the Commissioner.. I can conceive of nothing more destructive of the discipline of the Department than that officers in subordinate positral Office. tions should be able to read that the Minister had directed that the Commissioner should be treated in this"" way.' what? Simply because, acting on proper grounds, he said that in his judgment there ought not to be two heads in the one Dethe partment. .That is - an unassailable position to take up. Mr MCLachlan says that limit, trouble will ensue if there be two adminisand trative heads in the one Department. other words, he stands up for full and responsibility, on the part of the man at head of the Department, and it is possible to fasten him to that responsibility only he is made solely - responsible for his Department. In ""that respect, the Commishardy sioner has adopted an attitude which Avill commend itself to every' business man side the Department,, as'.well, as well-balanced officer in it. .

888,Mr THOMAS,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,It is most unusual for men to be glad to leave the Government service. Did you ever hear of any one glad to do so?,75

893,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"We have the statement that since Federation the Post and Telegraph Department has earned 30 per cent, more revenue and spent 20 per cent, in earning it. We have had a few boom years since Federation, and, with a rising revenue, there cannot be said to be much starvation in face of the figuresI have quoted.",75
894,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,That all depends on conditions.,75
895,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Quite so; and I assume that the conditions were normal, as, indeed, they were at the time of Federation. We are told that there is an accumulation of requirements, which necessitates special provision and so we find now that there is a revenue 5 per cent, higher, an expenditure 11 per cent, higher, new ' appointments 14 per cent, of the total; and that, in spite of the booming returns, there is a deficit of ,£352,000.",75
896,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"-That is, charging to revenue the public works for this year.",75
897,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Thes e calculations leave out of account interest,, which, if it be added,.means that the Department is losing ,£600,000 or ,£700,000 sterling.",75

901,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"That is not the point. I am not suggesting that the Department should be made to pay; but I do suggest that,, while there has been a very exceptional"" outgo, a considerable influx of new hands, - a heavy deficit on the year's transaction, and we have been told that the Department is sweated and starved, that discontent is seething throughout, and that there is something wrong.",75
902,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,-That is not correct.,75
903,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"That is the statement made; and may I ask the Postmaster-General how he accounts for it. We have had placed before us a statement of the benefits which the officers, have enjoyed since Federation in the shape of longer furloughs, more holidays, and more overtime. According to the statement everything seems to be "" as right as right can be."" If this be correct, we have the curious position that the better the condition of the men the more the discontent. .",75
904,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,I do not know that discontent does rule.,75
905,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Then the Postmaster-General is the only man who does not know. In my judgment, things are far from right. I was not here last Friday, or I should have taken exception to the' unmanly action of the Postmaster-General when.he tried to fix the blame for the trouble on the Deputy Postmasters-General of the States.",75
906,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,- I did not try to do that ; the honourable member is under a wrong impression.,75
907,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,The Postmaster General distinctly told honourable members that he was not getting the support to which he was entitled from the Deputy Postmasters-General.,75
908,Mr STORRER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Not in that language.,75
909,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"That is the language as I understand it ; and no one can conceive a greater reflection on the men who are performing the duties of Deputy Postmasters-General in the States. Mr THOMAS,-It is a serious charge against the Deputy Postmasters-General. can Mr. JOSEPH COOK - It is a serious charge, especially when the Postmaster-. General first of all condemns the Deputy Postmasters-General, and, in the next place, is glad to pay his tribute of admiration to the central staff.",75
910,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,That is not correct-it is only half the truth. I bore testimony to the fact that the vastmajority of the officers of the Department were_ doing their best.,75
911,Mr MCWILLIAMS,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Did the Postmaster General not say that the Deputy Postmasters-General were not doing their best?,75
912,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"No , I did not.",75
913,Mr FRAZER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"The Minister said that he"" did not get the assistance that he expected from them.",75
914,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"-Is that casting any reflecin tion ? Mr. JOSEPH' COOK - I can conceive of no graver reflectiion upon the Deputy Postmasters-General than that the Postmaster-General - should have said such a thing' about them. Had I been here I should have challenged the remark instantly. I venture to say that the deputies are striving their very utmost to do their duty, and so far as-my knowledge of them goes, they have any thing but a rosy time of it. I know an officer in Sydney who acted as temporary . Deputy Postmaster-General months. He is a man of ability and loyalty, as the Minister knows. When a selection had to be made of a Deputy Postmaster-General for that State this man would not put in an application for the position. He had had quite enough of it. He was only there sixmonths and did not want to occupy the position any longer. When 'we see this kind of thing going on through all the ranks of the service from the bottom to the top we must recognise that there is a want of tone and effective control. At the - same time there must be a want of sympaCentral thetic treatment somewhere or other from perience. the head of the Department. pretend to say where the trouble is, except that I believe it to be at the head. I not mention names. It is not a nice thing to do at all. But I do say that we ought to stop blaming those afj a distance. very cheap and easy to do it, but these men instances. are doing their best to grapple with ous position in the States, whilst at quarters the red tape is being lengthened by the mile. T t is time that some protest was made when we find Minister after Mininquiry ister bespattering the central authorities praise for all that they do, whilst superior officers in other parts of the Continent blamed. I do not believe in that kind of thing. I do not think that such treatment is just or is deserved. Honourable members have only to look at the correspondence which has been laid upon the table to see the source of the trouble in this Department. I draw attention to this opening sentence the minute of the Secretary of the Departought ment- It has been evident for some considerable past that the number of senior and responsible officers in the central office of this Department has not been sufficient to cope with the work. It was anticipated that after a time the of work would diminish, in which event difficulties under which the staff, including self, have laboured would have been lessened or removed. This anticipation has not .only not been realized, but the. work has been increasing volume and importance from year to year, until with the few senior officers available it has become unmanageable. If honourable members will think over that for a moment they will see that the beginning of the trouble is undue centralization. There it is, and it unconsciously comes out at the very beginning of this correspondence. If honourable members will read the correspondence through they will see that the same note dominates the whole Department. I therefore say to the Minister that if he wishes .the service to be satisfactory and efficient he will remedy this state of things. for some I am only saying now what I have said for the'last seven years. 1 feel inclined to turn up some of the debates of former years to show how completely I forecasted what has exactly come about. The Minister can appoint what Committees, he likes,' but unless he insists upon a thorough devolution of power no better results will be shown in the future than have been shown in the past.",76
915,Mr THOMAS,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"The only justice we can get is .from the Central Office. I am for the Office every time. That is my ex-, I do not. Mr. JOSEPH COOK - The honourable member's experience has. been a happy one. will I admit that his electorate is peculiarly placed, and I have no doubt that he has not suffered from some disabilities which have It is attached to honourable members in other I wish him joy in his a seriefforts, and am glad that he is sucheadceeding. In my judgment this Cabinet Committee can do no good. I believe that it has been simply appointed to stall off for a little while. It is a political with movement and nothing else. Something had to be - done, and so the Government said, are '' We will do this in the Cabinet and then, perhaps, we shall satisfy those people outside. "". But when a Cabinet appoints a Committee to inquire into the working of a Department over which a Minister presides it is time for that Minister to consider his own position. Instead of taking the Chairmanin ship of the Committee thus appointed he to realise his own responsibility. I hope that my honourable friend will not think that there is anything personal in these retime marks. But it is time for the Minister in charge of his Department to consider where he stands in relation to the Cabinet and the volume country. The Government may have their the Committee, who may go all over Australia, mybut they ""will not bring about content in the service. They will not obtain the requisite evidence to enable them to arrive at a just Estimates. [REPRESENTATIVES.] decision - They will not find that many subordinate officers will be prepared to stand up to the Minister and the Secre-' tary, who may happen to be there. many of the underpaid men in the service will be prepared to tell the Minister to his face that he is not treating them properly. ' Mr Mauger - Some of them have stood' up tp me, and told me'things pretty plainly.",76
916,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"A few of them may do so. But that is not the way to get the best results. This inquiry will come to nought, as in my judgment it is intended to do. It is meant to stave off pressure. But the public will not be satisfied with anything short of a thorough investigation, and that, in my judgment, they are entitled to have. My idea would be to get a few of the best business men in this House.",77
917,Mr THOMAS,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Hear , hear; I thought the honourable member was going to say from outside; but as he says from this House, I agree with him.",77

919,Mr THOMAS,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Now I do not - with the honourable member.,77
920,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I do not see why we should not appoint one or two first class business men from outside, with one or two who might be selected from this House and from the Senate. in my opinion everything, would depend upon the personnel of the Committee, and, - we should have a Committee of independent men, who would be able to bring their business acumen to bear upon the methods and procedure adopted in this Department, and see whether they could not unravel the tangled skein which is at present causing so much trouble right through it. cerely hope that that will be done. there is to be a division, upon these Estimates, I shall be compelled to vote in such a way as will express my view pf what the Government have done in regard to the appointment of this Committee of the Cabinet, and to emphasize the necessity,- in my judgment, of a thorough investigation of the working of this Department Mr THOMAS :Ar.

924,Mr THOMAS,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,I am not at all troubled about the Senate. - Mr Mauger - It was understood that they would be passed to-night.,77
925,Mr THOMAS,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"If Ministers have so arranged the business of Parliament that there is nothing for the Senate to do, that is not the. fault of honourable members. It is not unreasonable to ask that we should now report progress.

931,Mr SALMON,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,It is the practice in the I House of Commons.,77
932,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,It used to be the always practice in New South Wales. as Mr THOMAS - r- I thought so.,77
933,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"No ; it is a statu. Mr THOMAS - The honourable member for Parramatta, who was ""at one time Postmaster-General of New South Wales, says that - it was the practice there, and we know it is the practice in the House of Commons, because we have a case in point where, when Mr CAMPBELL - Bannerman was Minister of War, a reduction of j£x was moved in his salary, which led to the defeat of the Liberal Party. think it would be an admirable thing to adopt that practice here, because, if honourable members were dissatisfied with the management of a particular Department, it would be possible to deal with the matter effectively by moving a reduction of £ 1 in the salary of the Minister in charge of it. I take it that the motion for a reduction of jQt in Mr Scott's salary is intended as a vote of want of confidence in the working of the Post and Telegraph - Department.  the retention of some officers who are over 65 years of age, while the services of others are dispensed with. . Mr THOMAS - I take it that the motion in this case is a motion of want of confidence in the working of the Department generally. Although Mr Scott has reached the retiring age, I am personally very glad that the Government have decided to retain his services. I should be glad to see his services retained for the next twelve months, and probably for some time longer.  member think that some other officers who have been turned out because they have reached the retiring age, are just as capable of doing their class of work?",77
934,Mr THOMAS,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I am unable to say, I am not acquainted with the circumstances in their cases. Compulsory retirement of an officer after he has reached a certain age is a very good provision as a general rule, and I snould like to see its application extended even to the High Court; but where there are special reasons for retaining the services of a particular officer, the Minister should have the power to retain them. have said that I am glad that Mr Scott's services have been retained,. We have heard from the honourable member for Parramatta a strong defence of the Deputy Postmaster-General of New South Wales, and of the staff generally in the head-office at Sydney. We have heard that they are unduly interfered with by the Central Office of the Department. I have only to say that since I - became a member of the Federal Parliament, and even before that, I - have not been very favourably impressed by the way in which the authorities of the head-office in Sydney treated the constituency I represent, which is as much a part of New South Wales as is Parramatta, or any other constituency in that State. Since the establishment of the Federal Parliament, and after bringing grievances existing in my constituency under the notice of I the Central Office, I have been blocked in my efforts-to obtain justice and fair play. I might instance a number of cases, but I shall mention one in particular. It has been said that the Central Office of the Department deals unfairly with the staff at the head-office in Svdney; but this is the way in which the head-office in Sydney treats subordinates in the back-blocks of New,South Wales: Some time since, a young fellow was engaged as a temporary hand at Broken Hill , and was paid 25s. a week. He was entitled, after a time, to a. holiday of four weeks. He went up for . his examination, asked for four weeks' holiday, and obtained it. Whilst OIT holiday lie discovered that he had failed in the examination, and consequently was unable to go on to the permanent staff. But in the midst of his holiday' he was asked by then Department to go into the office and do certain work. He did so, and when he found that he could, not 'become a permanent hand, and his time was up, he asked to be paid for the time that he had put in at the request of the Department during his holidays. That seemed to be a fair and just demand. The postmaster at Broken Hill sent the claim on, but the as Deputy Postmaster-General in Sydney refused to pay the lad for the two or three weeks for which he had worked during the holiday to which he was entitled. I brought the case before the Central Office in Melbourne, and Mr Scott said he'must have a report, although from the way in which I put i the admitted that it appeared unjust that the lad should not be I paid. He added,, however, that ""there were always two sides to a question,- and he must hear the other side. I am. glad to know that the boy was eventually treated justly, and received the amount that he claimed. ' That case does not show any very great fair play on the part of the head .office in Sydney towards those in subordinate positions. In order to show how 'things are conducted from the' head office in Svdney, I may state that this lad, when acting temporarily in the hope of getting a permanent position, was paid 25s. a week. It was thought that some one else could be got to take his place, but he was asked to go on f o i a few weeks. The postmaster at Broken Hill was quite prepared, and, in fact, wished, to employ him. The head office in Sydney said it would employ him, but could pay him only 20s. a week. The young fellow refused the offer, and as a compromise they offered him 22s. 6d., but; he was able, as the Hill was booming at the time, to get some other employment, and so left the Department. That business was conducted, not through the Central Office in Melbourne, but through the great and mighty head office in Sydney. My opinion is that the Sydney office ought to'be bustled, and I shall be very glad if the central or some other office does bustle it. Mn JOSEPH COOK - The member is making ex parte statements. should like to hear the other side.",78
935,Mr THOMAS,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I presume the honourable member did not make ex parte statements, when defending the head office in Sydney as against the Central Office in Melbourne. - Mr. JOSEPH COOK - I did not cite any cases.",79
936,Mr MCWILLIAMS,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Some of puties have done their best.,79
937,Mr THOMAS,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I am dealing only with the State of which the honourable member for Parramatta and myself are representatives. I have nothing to do with deputies in other States. Mr. JOSEPH COOK. - The case cited by the honourable member shows, on the face of it , that there is something moreto be said. I cannot conceive of the head office in Sydney fixing those salaries without reference to the Central Office.. The honourable member must bear in mind also that the Central Office may set aside their recommendations, but the Sydney office cannot set aside those of the Central Officer",79
938,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,The Sydney office did.,79
939,Mr THOMAS,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"When i ' w e n t to the Central Office in Melbourne, Mr Scott said that if the case was as I stated it , the lad seemed to have been unjustly treated, and when the matter was further investigated and brought before the Commissioner, the Commissioner recommended that payment should be made. intend to say anything with regard to that matter until I heard the honourable member for Parramatta's remarks. I wish to know whether the Postmaster-General intends to make the toll system universal throughout Australia. At present, every new subscriber must come under it , but those who had telephones previous to a certain date are allowed to continue on the flat rate. The time has come for the Minister to extend the toll system throughout Australia. Either the flat rate is better than the toll System, or the toll system is better than the flat rate. If we are"" not prepared to make the toll system universal, then we should do away with it, and allow those who are now compelled to come under it to have the flat rate. I believe I was the first in this House to advocate the toll system. I have always believed in it. One argument which had great weight with me was that the people with large businesses received under the flat rate a great deal more service from the Department than they were paying for. The very fact that a honourable large number of people are coming under I the toll system confers added benefits on those who remain under the flat rate. Whilst the telephone service is not as good as it ought to be, because of the great pressure that exists-and sometimes I be-; lieve we are a little unreasonable when we want an answer immediately we go to the telephone-w e must remember that it has gone ahead by leaps and bounds, and that the de- the Department, not being able to get the wire or the instruments, has not been able to cope with the demand for new telephones. Those under the toll system do not use the telephone as often as they would if under the flat rate, because they will naturally be more careful, and that means that those who still remain under the t flat rate are reaping a large advantage from the very fact that so many come under the toll system. If that is so, the time has come when we may reasonably expect those who are deriving great advantages under the flat rate to be brought under the toll system. I should like some official pronouncement from the Minister, before the vote is taken on the amendment, as to whether he proposes to bring under the new system those who are now receiving much greater services than they pay for.",79
940,Mr SALMON,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Some of those under the toll system are virtually on the flat rate, because they use the telephone very little. You should'give a refund to those people. I did not Mr THOMAS - That .raises quite another question. The Government are charging too much for the toll system. The telephone should .go into a person's home for .about a guinea as a retaining fee, and a certain amount should be charged from the very first conversation. I know that my proposal to make the toll system universal will touch the \vell-to do. Unwant fortunately,, we are prepared, even in .House, elected as we are by adult frage, to touch the poor a great deal more readily than we are prepared rich. The people who are under the flat rate system at the present time are no doubt .done. business, and wealthy persons. ' I hope that before the item is passed, the Minister 'will be good' enough to state whether purposes to adopt the toll system-. I should like that system to be introduced generally, and the Department to provide a neat box into which any person could drop penny who desired to use the telephone, even in private houses. It would make difference to the Government so long as toll telephone was used, because they would be paid, but under the flat-rate system Government naturally objected to the telewas phone being used by any one except the subscriber. I believe that if the toll system were introduced generally, it would help, the telephone branch, because a great more revenue would be obtained than now received. The service could tended, and the charges reduced. I underthe stand that some reference has been to the possibility of separating the telePerhaps graph and telephone branches. sire to know if the Minister intends to take any step in that direction, it is likely to be taken. I also wish to know when he intends to lay upon the a report showing the expenditure and come in connection with each post-office throughout the Commonwealth. It is fair that honourable members should be nished with that detailed information stead of being told, as at present, that Department earns and spends so much year. I should like the Minister to tell Committee when a Commonwealth postage stamp is likely to be introduced. It - seven years since .the Commonwealth was established, and, in my opinion, the has arrived when we should have a Comdistricts monwealth stamp, which could be used in spector in charge of each. any State. In the first session of the .Parliament, when a Post and Telegraph Rates Bill was under consideration, I the insertion of a clause providing that Commonwealth stamp should be brought into use within two or three months from - the passing of that measure. The Prime Minister asked me not to press my proposal because, he said, that what I desired would be done as early as possible. He certainly gave us the impression that it would not be long before it was done, but he did not the exact time to be prescribed in the : this Bill - On that understanding, my amendsufment was withdrawn. Years have passed since then, and it appears to me that noto touch the thing has been done.",79
941,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"A good deal has been Mi. THOMAS - The Commonwealth stamp has not yet arrived. Those who he travel from State to State have to carry postage stamps of the various States. It was only, last evening that a stranger asked little me on the railway station at Murray a Bridge whether I would .be good enough to post in Melbourne two letters which he had no forgotten to post at. Adelaide.. I replied the that I would gladly oblige him, but it was possible that I might forget to post his the letters on the day I arrived. He said he. quite willing to take the risk. As lie . handed the letters to me, I observed that each bore a South Australian stamp, and so I told him that it would be of no use for deal me to post them in Melbourne.

At any rate, I have not vet only seen a Commonwealth stamp, and I am furvery anxious to learn when it is likely to inbe introduced. I wish to know also what the has been done in regard to the inspectors. per This is another matter which I presume the has been fixed up by the head office in Sydney, though, no doubt, the Central is Office has had to agree to it. The' Secretary to the Department desired at first that time - New South Wales should be divided into as Queensland was, with an inI thought the first idea a capital one; though the inspectors, who lived in Sydney, and the head office moved .there, opposed it. But after the matter a had come before Parliament several times, the Honourable Sydney Smith, when Post.master-General, agreed' that the division .should be made. It is not, however, quite satisfactory. . My . own electorate, for instance, has been divided very badly, and forms part of the districts of two inspectors, one of whom goes as far as Wilcannia, and the other as far as White Cliffs. Therefore, if anything has to be done at Wilcannia, it is.necessary to bring an in-.spector from Wagga, while to do anything - at White Cliffs, an inspector has to be brought from Orange.",80

We have - heard a good deal about the general disrequire satisfaction with the Post Office administramessages tion. No terms could be too strong to use condemnation of the condition of the serhard vice. I do not blame the present .niaster-General, although he has had more experience than many would admit, since before receiving his portfolio he acted as sort of relieving Minister. The appointment of a Cabinet Committee of Inquiry is altogether unsatisfactory. Nothing short of a Royal Commission, consisting of business men in and out of Parliament, will be sufficient to make a thorough investigation.",81

He is approaching the retiring if age, and consequently, as he coufd not hope for any higher salary, could not be blamed, perhaps, if he simply, marked time during He We have has been granted six months' leave of absence, and his office is now being filled Now, a by a younger man, who is receiving a long much lower salary, but is doing muchI understand that no permanent appointment can be made until Dethe retiring officer's leave has expired nnd that the relieving officer cannot be apbe pointed to the position because he is a junior in the service. It is probable that the an officer who has reached the maximum If not, it salary in his class will be brought from the back-blocks and placed in charge. I hope that the Postmaster-General will consider this question, and determine whether it it is not better to appoint as postmasters in large provincial towns active officers who have proved themselves capable men, although .they may be receiving comparatively At small salaries, rather than officers fromoffices, on the ground that they reached a certain age, and the maximum salary of their class.

Money has been wasted on the construction of a telephone line between Sydney and Melbourne, which is not likely to pay for some years, while country districts have been practically starved - I hardly thought it worthwhile to discuss",81
952,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,That is not correct; I must take the part of the Postmaster General in regard to that matter.,82
953,Mr LIDDELL,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,The Treasurer takes the part of the Postmaster-General to a greater extent than he ought to do. know of a case in which a word from him would have enabled a district to secure that for which it had asked for many weeks.,82

955,Mr LIDDELL,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"No ; it was a comparatively trifling want; but I shall make no further reference to it, since I do not want to create friction between Ministers. Complaints are repeatedly made regarding delays in connection with the trunk line between West Maitland, Newcastle, and Sydney. An expensive line has been constructed, as I have mentioned, between Melbourne and Sydney, but although the charge in respect of the West MaitlandNewcastle-Sydney trunk line is nearly the same, subscribers have often to wait for hours to get connected. I appeal to the Postmaster-General to give special attention to this complaint. He has promised that the service will be improved, but his promises so far have not been fulfilled. I agree with the remarks made by the honourable member for Barrier regarding the postal inspectors. In our country districts, we have two inspectors, where there should probably be six, and consequently 1 they have so much travelling to do that their duties cannot be satisfactorily carried out.  has no more money.",82

As the Treasurer appears to be in a yielding mood, I think rt' desirable, however, to again bring forward certain grievances, although my experience is that very little is gained by discussing the Estimates. It is true that the Post and Teflegraph Department' does not deal hurriedly with any question that comes within its purview. If the Ministry imagine that the discontent in the service will be allayed, or the demand for an investigation removed, by the appointment of the Cabinet Committee of Inquiry, 'they are making a huge mistake.

These small however, are important to the people immediately concerned. Another memmatter which I have tried time after time, though unsuccessfully, to have dealt with, is the practice followed in retaining the radius from. the metro""fixed for the application of penny postage, so far as New South Wales is concerned. I . have had many applicato deal with the matter from people residing just outside the area to which a penny postage is extended. We can quite understand that some time ago it was reato restrict the penny-postage area, ' but it ought to be understood also that was from time to time, as population on the for boundaries of the area increases, they should be extended.

There are cases of men physically and mentally quite capable, and to discharge them when they are doing good work is not right. There ought to be uniformity. The Public Service Act will have to be amended'in several directions.  vernment yet that was game to tinker with 1",85

1007,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,That is too big a question to deal with to-night.,85
1008,Mr THOMAS,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,What is the Minister the going to do?,86
1009,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,I am going to consider the matter. The honourable member should not expect me to say right off what I am going to do on such a great question..,86
1010,Mr THOMAS,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Surely the honourable member has been thinking over it?,86
1011,Mr MATJGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I have been thinking over a good many things, including that big one. I could not promise definitely to-night to make such a far-reaching change as to put everybody on the toll system at once. An extra inspector is vided for in the Estimates, and the districts are to be re-allotted so as to prevent the anomaly that the' honourable member pointed out.",86
1012,Mr JOHNSON,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,What about the penny postage radius?,86
1013,Mr MATJGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,That is a matter that must be amended by Act of Parliament.,86
1014,Mr JOHNSON,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,What about an amendment of the Postal Act to do it?,86
1015,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"There is no chance of that this session. In regard to stamps, the Stamp Committee presented their report, which will be dealt with,' but there can be no change until the expiration of the Braddon section.",86
1016,Mr THOMAS,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,What has the Braddon section to do with it?,86
1017,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,The Braddon section and the financial arrangements have everything to do with it.,86
1018,Mr THOMAS,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,I could understand the bookkeeping section affecting it.,86
1019,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,I refer to both. We are quite prepared to submit proposals in regard to a uniform stamp.,86
1020,Mr FISHER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Wide Bay) [12.47 a.m.]. - Has the Minister, as Postmaster-General, or have the Government as a Government, given any consideration to the request that during the period intervening before the new mail contract with the Orient Company takes effect the Government of the Commonwealth should pay the extra amount which has to be paid at present by the Government of the State of Queensland to enable the mail steamers to go to Brisbane?",86
1021,Mr FRAZER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Did not the House decide that in the negative on an amendment to test the question ?,86
1022,Mr FISHER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"No . That test vote applied to the new contract. I am speaking of the old contract, which is now practically on the same basis as the new conliberate tract, to come into operation in 1910. The interim contract contains practically they are. same conditions in regard to the carriage of mails on behalf of the Commonwealth, and that being so, the difference in cost during the interregnum ought to be borne by the Commonwealth Government.",86
1023,Mr FRAZER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I do not think it ought to be. ,",86
1024,Mr FISHER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"I have the| greatest respect for the honourable member's opinion, but after all Queensland is the only State which has to make the payment, although temporarily it applies also to Tasmania. Of course nothing can be done except by the pro- will of Parliament, but - at present the Queensland State Government are paying the extra subsidy, because they could do no better. Any one examining the matter free from prejudice must, see that it is fair that the Commonwealth Government should pay, for the obvious reason that every State should have a share in the mail service, and that the service which is being carried on in the interval has all the restrictions contained in the new contract. I hope that the Postmaster-General and the Treasurer will consider this matter before the final set of Estimates is dealt with.",86
1025,Mr THOMAS,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Barrier) [12.50 a.m.] I regret very much the answer given by the Postmaster-General regarding the installation of the telephone toll system. It seems to me, from his answer, that he has not yet discussed whether any step in that direction is to be taken. It practically means that nothing has been done in the Department, and that its policy is to allow things to drift. I did not expect him to say tonight that he intended to introduce the toll system tomorrow. But I certainly expected him to say whether it was intended to take any step in that direction.",86
1026,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,There is no doubt that it will come to the toll system.,86
1027,Mr THOMAS,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Has'the Minister no idea as fo the time when it will be established? For instance, will it be done in six months, or twelve years, or fifty years? Perhaps he will tell us that it cannot be done until the expiration of the Braddon section. I do not intend to support the proposal before the. Committee; but had the salary of the Minister been under review, the probability is that I should have been prepared fo vote for a reduction of it, because I feel that the matter of the toll system has not been discussed by him.",86
1028,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,It has been.,86

1030,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,No .,87
1031,Mr THOMAS,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,Then the honourable gentleman should have given us a more emphatic answer than he did.,87
1032,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,I could not state the exact time when it will be done.,87
1033,Mr THOMAS,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,The honourable* gentleman did not say whether it was the intention of the Ministry ultimately to bring all telephones under the toll system. Am I to understand now that that is the intention? Mr Mauger.T-It is my intention to recommend that.,87

1041,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,I am sure that that must come.,87
1042,Mr THOMAS,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"That is something gained, but not much, I do not intend to support the amendment, but it is my intention to bring this question of the toll system before the Chamber again and again, because it is manifestly unjust to Compel some persons to come under the toll system and to give the greater advantages of the flat-rate system to others.",87
1043,Mr FISHER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Wide Bay) [12.55 a.m.]. - A little time ago I , ' as leader of the Labour Party, was waited upon by a number of men who had been employed by the Department in dressing telegraph poles, and who, by some act of the Department, or the Public Service Commissioner, had been deprived of work to which they considered they were entitled. I think that they mentioned that, owing to some act of the Minister, they could no longer be employed in that way. I have already mentioned the matter to the honourable gentleman. If I remember aright all these men were tradesmen, who were employed at 10s. a day, until it was discovered by the Commissioner or the Department that they could C/;t ' younger persons to do the work at a cheaper rate. I should like the Minister to state whether there is any likelihood of these elderly persons being employed again on the work.",87
1044,Mr MAUGER,THE HONORABLE MEMBER FOR FLINDERS,"Maribyrnong-Post master-General) [12.56 a.m.] - The men to whom the honourable member has alluded were temporary employees 'in the pole-yard. After representations were made to various Ministers, that they, ought to be paid the rate of skilled labour, namely, 10s. a day, I made a minute in regard to their payment, and also, the payment of temporary telephone fitters. I directed that the ruling rate outside should be paid inside the Department to temporary labourers over whom I had control. That was the order. I issued, after the men had importuned me quite a number of times, because I felt that their request was a right one. Afterwards I had a conversa* tion with the Commissioner, who is strongly of opinion that the work is classified too highly at 10s. a day. His officers agree with him that 8s. or 8s. 6d. a day is enough. He is doing what-he has the right to do under the Public Service Act. He is appointing permanent officers to perform the work at the rate which he has fixed,. and over which I have. no control. He considers that the public will be better served by permanent employees, that the rate which he has adopted is ample, and that the people who have been receiving temporary employment have been well treated.

Mr THOMAS BROWN (Calare) [1.4 a.m.] - I move That the item ""Assistant Secretary, £700"" be reduced by £1. 1 do this, not because 1 think that the officer filling the position is overpaid, but because 1 think that the Government should have respected the recommendation of the Public Service Commissioner, and, if necessary, increased the maximum salary attainable by officers in the clerical division, so that other officers similarly situated might be treated in the same way.
