Petition received and read. STATE REPRESENTATION .",13
1,Mr GROOM,Unknown,Can the Minister of Home Affairs say when he will take the steps necessary to determine the representation of the various States in accordance with the census returns? Mr KING O'MALLEY - Almos t immediately. We have already begun with Western Australia. M i . BAMFORD - Has the Commonwealth Chief Electoral Officer.yet reported to the Minister under die terms of the Act that a new distribution of seats should be made?,13
2,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,"Not officially, but it is thoroughly understood that it must be made immediately. PORT DARWINFREIGHTS . - Mr MASSYGREENE - On Tuesday last I drew the attention of the Minister of External Affairs to certain statements in the Age, and ask him now if he can give the House any information as to why the subsidy for a steamer service to Port Darwin has been withdrawn?",13
3,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"I am informed thatThere was a contract between the Government of South Australia and the Eastern and Australian Steam-ship Company for two years from the ist October, 1909, under which the company undertook to carry Government cargo in accordance with terms agreed upon, and to carry passengers at fixed fares between the southern and eastern ports and Darwin. The subsidy for the service was at the' rate of ,£2,000 .1 year. Thr question of renewing the existing contract or inviting applications for a fresh service was submitted to my predecessor, who, in view of the fact that the Navigation Bill now before this House might, when passed, materially affect the situation, resolved to take no action till the decision of Parliament in regard to that measure was known. I see by a statement-ill today's paper that the three shipping companies whose vessels trade to Darwin have agreed to adopt an increased and uniform scale of rates. It is stated in connection with this announcement that the expenses of shipping at Darwin have increased. I am having inquiries made into this assertion. PEARL - SHELLI - NG INDUSTRY .",13
4,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"Has the Government taken into consideration the importance of the pearl-shelling industry as a factor in the settlement of the Northern Territory, recently acquired by the Commonwealth? Is the Minister aware that experiments in the growth of pearl-shell have been made for some years by Mr T. H . Haynes. at the Montebello Islands, off the coast of Western Australia, and that the success of such experiments would enable the pearling fleets to be manned with white labour exclusively? In view of the fact that Australian taxpayers pay over ^J.,000,000 per annum for the promotion of the sugar industry in Queensland, does he not think it possible to find money to employ a capable biologist to continue the experiments at Montebello Islands, abandoned by Mr. Haynes through exhaustion of funds, especially as Mr Haynes is willing to give the Government the results of his researches?",13
5,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The Government is' aware of the importance of the pearl-shelling industry, and had Mr Haynes' proposal before it. I cannot say now what the taxpayers contribute for the maintenance of the sugar industry of Australia. As to the employment of a biologist to continue experiments the Government have not come to a determination. WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY. NA CONTRACT.",14
6,Mr MASSYGREENE,PENNANT HIL LS AND FREMANTLE,"for Mr KELLV) asked the Attorney-General, upon notice I. At Ihe time the contract for erecting wireless telegraphy installations at Pennant Hills and Fremantle was signed in Sydney, in December, igio,, did he express or voice to the then contracting syndicate, or to any member of it , any doubt as to the capacity of the syndicate-the capital of which was £5,000-to carry out its contract ? 2. Did he at that time suggest, or acquiesce in a suggestion, that the contracting syndicate should transfer its contract to a company to be floated subsequently, with a working capital of not less than ,£25,000? 3. If so, did the suggestion for ihe transfer of the original contractor's contract to a public company originate with him, or did he f all in with the suggestion of the syndicate, or of any member of it, in this regard?",14
7,Mr HUGHES,PENNANT HIL LS AND FREMANTLE,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are1. Yes. 2. No. 3. The suggestion did not originate witli me, nor was it mentioned at the time or prior to the signing of the contract in December, 1910. The Government, after the new company was formed, agreed to the transfer on certain conditions. POSTMASTER-GENERAL'S DEPARTMENT. MISDELIVERED LETTER : CASE OF MH. ALEXANDER BLACK.",14
8,Mr HIGGS,PENNANT HIL LS AND FREMANTLE,"the Postmaster General, upon notice I. Did the Postal Department at Brisbane receive the following letter from Alexander Black :"" Fairymead, Bundaberg, June 22, 1909. Sir,-Would you be so kind as to forward any letters that may be held over for me to the above address, and hold over any other letters that may come for me until I write again, and you will oblige, Yours respectfully, ALEXANDER BLACK "" ? 2. Was this order to hold letters in force oil the 9th of August, 1909? 3. Was a letter containing two money orders totalling ^30 16s., and addressed to Alexander Black, received at the G.P.O., Brisbane, on or nbout the 5th August, 1909, and delivered to some person other than Alexander Black while the latter's order of 22nd June, 1909, to hold letters until he wrote again was in force? 4. Were the money orders referred to cashed ut the G.P.O., Brisbane, on the 9th of August, nnd was not the signature of the person who received the money not the signature of Alexander Black? 5. Did Alexander Black complain of the loss uf the money? 6. Did the Postal authorities at Brisbane hand over the case to the Queensland Commissioner of Police, and did the police report contain the following paragraphs :"" On the 9th August last he (Black) was working on the Fairymead plantation, and he was not in Brisbane at any time last year. "" I interviewed Mr J. Crabtree, accountant, who looked up the records and informed me that Alexander Black worked continuously during the month of August, 1909, and was not absent from the plantation on the 9th, or any other day of that month. "" Mr Black appears to be a decent man, and I am of opinion that his complaint is a genuine one "" ? 7. Will the Postmaster-General give instructions that Mr Black be paid the full amount of the loss he has sustained ?",14
9,Mr FRAZER,PENNANT HIL LS AND FREMANTLE,"The answers to'the honourable member's questions are1. Yes. 2. Yes. 3. Such would appear to have been the case. 4. The money orders indicated were cashed as stated. The Alexander Black referred to repudiates the signature, which may, however, have been the signature of another Alexander Black. 5. Yes. 6. Yes. 7. The Postmaster-General is specially exempted by law from liability in such cases, and would require the authority of Parliament to make such a payment. PAPUA : . MINING DEVELOPMENT",14
10,Mr WATKINS,PENNANT HIL LS AND FREMANTLE,"for MR. HOWE) asked the Minister of External Affairs, upon movenotice1. Whether the Minister will take into consideration the question of granting a loan of ,£$0,000 to the Government of the Territory of Papua for the purpose of connecting and developing the gold-mining industry of Woodlark Island and assisting the development of the Astrolabe copper-fields? 2. Will the Minister communicate with the Lieutenant-Governor of Papua for the purpose of establishing the terms of such loan in the event of the loan being favourably viewed by the Ministry?",15
11,Mr THOMAS,PENNANT HIL LS AND FREMANTLE,"The answers to the honourable member's questions arei and 2. Proposals in regard to a loan for Papua weTe submitted by the Lieutenant-Governor, and correspondence between him and the Department on the subject is now proceeding. When further particulars are received the matter will receive special consideration. NA LAWYERS.",15
12,Mr HIGGS,PREFERENCE TO UNION,"the Attorney-General, upon notice I. Whether it is the practice in the Attorney General's Departments of the Commonwealth and States of Australia to give preference to union lawyers, barristers, and solicitors? 2. Does the Attorney-General know of a single instance, ancient or modern, in which a non-union lawyer has been allowed to practise in a court of law ? 3. Would a non-union barrister under the ban of the barristers' union, and attempting to appear for a client in a Supreme Court, be allowed to address the Court?",15
13,Mr HUGHES,PREFERENCE TO UNION,"The "" union lawyers "" is not precise enable an answer to be given. BUTTER SHIPMENTS AND APPLE tioned,",15
14,Mr SINCLAIR,PREFERENCE TO UNION,"the Postmaster5,057; General, upon notice I. Whether the various Agents-General in don have approached the Commonwealth Governonly ment with a view to taking action to protect shippers of butter to London from loss through apple taint during the apple season? 2. If so, what steps have been taken effect to the request?",15
15,Mr FRAZER,PREFERENCE TO UNION,The answers to the honmotion orable member's questions are-*j . Not so far as I am aware. 2. See answer to No. r. PAY AND ALLOWANCES: LOAN. PERMANENT MILITARY FORCES.,15
16,Mr RYRIE,PREFERENCE TO UNION,"North Sydney) '[2.41] - I 1. That a Select Committee (with power to send for persons and papers) be appointed to inquire into the pay and allowances of the warrant, non-commissioned officers, and men of the Permanent Military Forces of the Commonwealth. 2. That such Committee consist of Mr Charlton, Mr Kelly, Mr Mathews, Mr MCWilliams, Mr Roberts, Mr Bruce Smith, and the mover. I make no apology for submitting this motion. It is one to which, I think, no honourable member will take exception, and it is in. the interests of the Commonwealth that it should be carried. No question of party is associated with it, and I propose very briefly to put forward several reasons that should recommend it to the favourable consideration of the House. We must all admit that it is essential that we should endeavour to create and maintain an efficient military force j and a great factor towards the creation and maintenance of such a force is efficiency in the highest degree on the part of our comparatively small Permanent Forces. The Permanent Forces, which are held up as an example to our Militia and Volunteer Foroes, and will be held up as an example also to the great body of. soldiers to be created under the compulsory service scheme, are comparatively small in number. At the end of September, 1910, in the whole of this great Commonwealth, Ave had only 1,522 permanently-paid men and officers in our Military Forces, or, omitting officers, a little over 1,400 men. expression Mr GROOM - Do those figures include enough to the Administrative Staff ?",15
17,Mr RYRIE,PREFERENCE TO UNION,"Yes , they include the Head-quarters Staff. On the date menwe had a force of 83,333 men, exclusive of cadets, the total being made up TAINT . as follows:-Militia , 16,930; Volunteers, Rifle Clubs, 57,826, and others, including officers, &c., about 1,000. Of this Lontotal, it will be seen, my motion relates to about 1,400 men. I mention that fact in order to remove from the minds of honourable members any fear that if , as a result of this action on my part, an increase to give in pay were granted, great expense might be incurred. I purposely omitted from my any reference to commissioned officers, fearing that unless I did so, there might be, perhaps, in the minds of some a suspicion ""that I had some ulterior motive,. and desired to advance the interests of personal friends or relatives of my own who happen to hold commissions in the Permanent Forces. All parts of the House will realise that the non-commissioned officers and men of our Permanent Forces are not receiving payment corresponding in any sense with the remuneration received by those wbo follow civil vocations. Wages of all descriptions have recently gone up, but there has been no corresponding increase in the pay of our Permanent Military Forces, although they are just as deserving of a rise as are those employed in other directions. In these circumstances, therefore, I make no apology for this motion, and whilst I should like honourable members opposite to give expression to their views upon it, I sincerely hope that no attempt will be made to talk it out. A soldier in our Permanent Forces at the commencement of his career receives about one-half the wages of an unskilled labourer today. In order to emphasize that point, let me state the scale of pay of non-commissioned officers and men. A gunner-and a gunner has no easy task in performing his daily routine of duties-receive s 4s. a day j a bombardier 4s. 3d. per day; a. corporal 4s. 6d. per day, and a sergeant 5s. 6d. per day. Before a man can attain the rank of sergeant in the Permanent Forces, he has to go through a good many years of hard work. It is a great mistake to believe that soldiering is something in the nature of an amusement-that a soldier has nothing to do but to walk about and disport himself in fine uniform. There is a great deal of hard work and drudgery entailed in soldiering, and a man, after some years of this hard work may, if he behaves himself, and is particularly attentive to his duties, reach the rank of sergeant and receive 5s. 6d. a day. In the present prosperous times, and in comparison with the present rates of wages ruling outside the service, that is not enough. A Company Sergeant-Major gets 6s. 3d., a Staff Sergeant-Major ios.. a Quarter-Master Sergeant IIS . , a Regimental Quarter-Master Sergeant, u s . , and a Master Gunner ios. od. per day. The pay of a Master Gunner is really only equal to the pay of an unskilled labourer, but I do not think that a Master Gunner who has to go through years of hard work and - study can be fairly classed in that category. He is really an expert at his business, having had to pass very difficult examinations, and to go through many hard and strict - schools of gunnery, and other subjects. A soldier starts his career at about 4s. 4d. per day, or perhaps less than half the pay of the unskilled labourer outside. If he applies himself carefully and diligently to his business he may be receiving 7s. or 7s. 6d. a day in about five years, and after a further period he may receive 8s. 6d. Subsequently he may by small rises of perhaps 3d. per day reach something like 13s., but often those small rises may entail his having to move, with perhaps his wife and family, from one State to another. Mr W. J. JOHNSON - It might make more of them go to work.",15
18,Mr RYRIE,PREFERENCE TO UNION,The honourable member is perhaps under the misapprehension that the members of the Permanent Forces- I am not speaking of the Volunteer Militiahave no work to do. Mr W. J. JOHNSON - No good comes of their work.,16
19,Mr RYRIE,PREFERENCE TO UNION,"I can assure the honourable member that he is under a misapprehension. If he believes that we should have no defence force, I can understanu his position j but if we are to have a defence force, and I think the honourable member's party are determined that we shall have one in Australia, we must have an efficient one. We cannot have an efficient force unless we give encouragement to this comparatively small body of permanent men. To show how essential this is, practically the whole of the Australian Army to be created under our compulsory, service scheme will be dependent upon the permanent men for instructors. We must encourage the best men to join our Permanent Force, and encourage them to remain in it when they have joined. They will not be encouraged to remain if they are paid a lower rate of wages than is obtainable outside. That fact is accountable fbr the wastage that is always going on in the Permanent Force. In the Royal Australian Artillery fully 40 per cent, of those who sign on resign after the first period is up and leave the force. That is not desirable. Many of them are good men, who should be encouraged to stay in the service. Mr W. J. JOHNSON - Most' of them save enough money in one term to buy a public-house.",16
20,Mr RYRIE,PREFERENCE TO UNION,"The honourable member's remarks are just about on a par with the first speech that I heard him make in this House on the Address-in-Reply. On that occasion he wound up with a magnificent peroration about "" this rotten, silly business of defence."" The Lord help this country if i i majority of men of his class were governing it ! It is deplorable that men who are supposed to be moulding the destiny of this gceat Commonwealth should give expression to such puerile sentiments. I think I have said sufficient to show that there is some warrant for my action in moving the motion. A Committee ought to be appointed, and I am sure that no one on either side of the House will oppose its appointment.",16
21,Mr FRAZER,PREFERENCE TO UNION,"Kalgoorlie-Post master-General) [2.55]-- I regret that the Government are unable to accept the motion. I quite agree with the honourable member for North Sydney that the desire of the great majority of the members of this House, and I think of the people of Australia, is to establish cient Defence Force; but the honourable member has not pointed to any information that is not available, or that cannot be secured without the assistance of a Select Committee. In those circumstances the Government would not be justified in incurring the expense of appointing such a body. Within the next week or two the Budget will be debated in this House. The pay of all the officers and men of the Defence Forces mentioned in the motion can then be discussed at any length ancl in any aspect. If there is shown in the House a sufficiently strong feeling to justify an alteration of the existing state of things, the Government will be prepared to give consideration to the views then expressed. The information for which the honourable member asks can certainly be obtained without the aid of a Select Committee. If the honourable member desires any particular information regarding the non-commissioned officers or men, I will undertake that, if he will frame a motion and move it in the House, the information will be secured from the records. We know the number of men employed in those branches of the service. Every one who has a knowledge of military affairs knows that they are engaged in particular work. The Department knows the number of hours they work. We know the obligations of the Department towards them so far as allowances arc concerned. In those circumstances, what additional information does the honourable member expect to get by adopting the cumbersome expedient of appointing a Select Committee?",17
22,Mr KYBTE,PREFERENCE TO UNION,A Select Committee does more than gather information. It makes recommendations which are often acted upon hv the House.,17
23,Mr FRAZER,PREFERENCE TO UNION,The honourable member can make his own recommendations when debating the Budget.,17
24,Mr RYRIE,PREFERENCE TO UNION,I am afraid my recommendations would not carry as much weight as those of a Select Committee.,17
25,Mr FRAZER,PREFERENCE TO UNION,. I am afraid the honourable member's recommendations might not in all cases carry much weight.,17
26,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PREFERENCE TO UNION,That ' is nasty. There is no need for it .,17
27,Mr FRAZER,PREFERENCE TO UNION,I do not know that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is entitled to exercise any censorship over my speeches in this Chamber.,17
28,Dr CARTY SALMON,PREFERENCE TO UNION,"It would be the recommendation, not of an individual, but an effi- of a. Select Committee ",17
29,Mr FRAZER,PREFERENCE TO UNION,I am quite aware of it.,17
30,Dr CARTY SALMON,PREFERENCE TO UNION,Surely the Minister will not say regarding the recommendations of a Select Committee what he said about the recommendations of the' honourable member for North Sydney?,17
31,Mr FRAZER,PREFERENCE TO UNION,"I am not saying so, ancl I am not allowing the honourable member to say it for me. The honourable member for North Sydney has not stated a case which would justify the Government in authorizing the expenditure that would be incurred in obtaining information, which, as I say, is available to every member of the House. In justice to the present Government, J must say that since we came into office the pay of these men has been increased from 2s. 6d. to 3s. 6d. per day, or by 40 per cent.",17
32,Dr CARTY SALMON,PREFERENCE TO UNION,When did lhat apply to the warrant officers?,17
33,Mr FRAZER,PREFERENCE TO UNION,"The pay of the sergeant-major of the Instructional Staff was increased from ,-£137 to .£156, if my memory serves me rightly, shortly before the Minister of Defence went to England at the beginning of the year. The pay of the lower rank non-commissioned officers has been increased in the same proportion. The honourable member for North Sydney desires such an investigation into the conditions uncler which the men work as would justify him in submitting a proposal to the House to increase the pay, although, of course, the honourable member has not definitely said so. There is no information that is not available in the Department as to the duties, rations, wages, travelling expenses, and everything else-showin g what the men have to clo from starting on Monday morning to finishing on Saturday night. Under the circumstances, the Government cannot see theii way to accept the responsibility of incurring additional expense.",17
34,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PREFERENCE TO UNION,"Parramatta) [3.2] - I repeat that there was no occasion for the Postmaster-General to treat the honourable member for North Sydney in such a testy way. The opinion of the honourable member for North Sydney may not be of very much value, or it may be; but I should imagine that a man of his experience in military affairs is quite as well able to express an opinion on the matter as is the Postmaster-General, who knows nothing whatever about the Forces except what is pumped into him by the Minister who presides over the Department.  houses should not throw stones "" ; the honourable member for Parramatta, as Minister of Defence, had information pumped into him !",18
35,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PREFERENCE TO UNION,"I quite agree with the honourable member. No information has come to this House except in driblets, since the Minister has been in another place. We get to know very little about the Forces, and we can get to know very little. It is impossible, for instance, to have a question of any kind answered until it has been on the paper long enough to grow stale.",18
36,Mr FRAZER,PREFERENCE TO UNION,- I cannot speak for the Defence Department j I do not administer it.,18
37,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PREFERENCE TO UNION,"I am not complaining of the Postmaster-General; but it ill becomes him to twit others with having no information, seeing that he himself has none. However, I do not wish to get into "" holts ' with the honourable member; but I : take it that he misapprehends entirely the purpose of the proposal of the honourable member for North Sydney. That honourable member feels that these men have grievances which he desires shall be rectified, and he believes that, rather than leaving the matter to the Minister or the Acting Minister individually, it should be the subject of full inquiry by a Select Committee. It is of no use beating about the bush; at the bottom of this proposal is the question of pay, allowances, and pensions. The whole must be investigated before there can be a satisfactory settlement; and I cannot understand why the question of pensions is de- layed so long. Before I left the Department, after a tenure which was all too brief, only just sufficient to allow me to see what required doing, I altered very much for the better thepay and conditions of some of these men. For instance, I abolished the third-class, or bottom rung, for the non-commissioned officers, and thus gave them a substantial "" leg up "" at once. Altogether, I did a great deal in that respect, but more needs to be done. The one impression I left the Department with was that there should be an exhaustive inquiry into the whole question of the circumstances and privileges of these men. If we compare the pensions and pay for similar services in the Old Country, we see that our men are still very much underpaid. The question of pensions must be faced sooner or later if we are to have a proper Defence Force; and the sooner the Government take action the better. It was my intention to deal exhaustively with this matter, and to launch a pensions scheme as an integral part of the new defence scheme; because we shall never have a satisfactory service until there is a system of either deferred pay or pensions. As it is, the Government are finding positions today for men who should have been able to retire honourably, with the guarantee that they would not be subject to serious disability in their home life. The Government are acting very properly in finding those positions, so that these men may not be turned on to a cold and cruel world after having served the Commonwealth faithfully for so many years. When the proper time arrives, I shall have .something to say as to the manner in which the positions have been found; for, while 1 commend the object of the Government, I think they might have attained it in an infinitely better way. The object of the honourable member for North Sydney is to have a full inquiry from every point of view, as the best way of informing the mind of the House. In what better position will the House be if the honourable member for North Sydney continues to address a series of detached and unrelated questions from day to day, or year to year, or if, as doubtless it will be, the matter is discussed on the Estimates? The fact is that the House is in the dark concerning these details.",18
38,Mr FRAZER,PREFERENCE TO UNION,"The House need not be in the dark. If the honourable member for North Sydney cares to submit a motion, I shall undertake that the Minister will supply all the information desired.",18
39,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PREFERENCE TO UNION,"In what better position will the honourable member for North Sydney then be, so far as his objective is concerned ? The Postmaster General has asked whether the honourable member is seeking for better pay and p r i ^ j ^ leges, and the honourable member frankly says that he is. Would the supplying of the information induce the Government to assist the honourable member to get what he desires ?",18
40,Mr FRAZER,PREFERENCE TO UNION,"Certainly , it would.",19
41,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PREFERENCE TO UNION,"Does the Government propose to deal with the matter, or do they not?",19
42,Mr FRAZER,PREFERENCE TO UNION,"The Government have increased the pay of the men by 40 per cent, since taking office.",19
43,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PREFERENCE TO UNION,"The reply to that is that the men still desire their tion looked into, in relation to the military forces of other portions of the Empire.",19
44,Mr FRAZER,PREFERENCE TO UNION,What is the reply to the . statement that the honourable gentleman did not do anything in that direction whilst he was in office?,19
45,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PREFERENCE TO UNION,The reply is that the statement is grossly inaccurate. The honourable member is so ignorant of these matters that he does not know what I did.,19
46,Mr FRAZER,PREFERENCE TO UNION,Does the honourable member say that he increased the pay of these meu ?,19
47,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PREFERENCE TO UNION,"Of some classes of non-commissioned officers. I did not pretend to deal with the case in an adequate manner. What I did, or what any one else has done, matters little now. The impression I formed during my brief tenure of office was that a serious and adequate investigation was necessary, and my last action was to instruct the Secretary to get every detail he could respecting the pensions payable by the Imperial Government, with a view to the inauguration of a pension system at the earliest moment hi connection with the new defence scheme then being inaugurated. Eighteen months have passed since then, and nothing has been done. Ministers tell the public, that this Government was the first to bring about a new scheme of defence, and repeat the statement until they have come to believe it, although there is no justification for it.",19
48,Mr SPEAKER,PREFERENCE TO UNION,The honourable member is going bevoncl the question.,19
49,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PREFERENCE TO UNION,"If honourable members look into the matter, they will see that the confident assertions of Ministers are not borne out. The Government might very well agree to an inquiry into the position of these men. wlio are the backbone of the service. If investigation shows that, taking everything into account, their position is not at least equal to that of men J^jding similar positions in other parts ol asi Empire, the matter should be rectified The Government. I take it, will not allow them to remain worse off than others of their rank in the Imperial service. Such conduct would be a strange commentary on the boast of Ministers that they are the friends of all who toil for their, daily bread. If the men are being as well treated as is just, nothing can be lost by making, the fact known. But I think that investigation will show that they are not as well treated as others in similar positions elsewhere. I should like a more comprehensive posiinquiry than is proposed. I wish to know if the Government intends to stand up to the financial obligations of the Kitchener scheme with respect to all sections. Ministers claim to be doing everything imposed by that scheme, but I should like to know what they are doing regarding the officers..",19
50,Mr SPEAKER,PREFERENCE TO UNION,The honourable member is now going beyond the motion.,19
51,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PREFERENCE TO UNION,"Tb e sooner the conditions of employment in the Department of Defence are subject to a close and' adequate inquiry the better it will be for all concerned. Such an investigation would' assist the House in dealing with many problems now pressing for solution. The Kitchener scheme, having been inaugurated, sbould be carried out in its integrity as soon as possible. It will necessitate a marked advance in the pay and privileges of these men who, as the honourable member for North Sydney has shown, are underpaid in comparison with others of their rank in the Imperial service.",19
52,Dr CARTY SALMON,PREFERENCE TO UNION,"Laanecoorie)[3.18] - I shall support the motion. I intervened when the mover was speaking, to> point out to the Minister that if a Select Committee were appointed its report would not be that of a single individual. I did' so because the Minister seemed to have lostsight of that fact in making his somewhat tart interjection. I understand that inJanuary last the men received an advance of is. a day. I am in frequent contact with them, and know that there - is grave dissatisfaction among them, for which, T believe, there is good ground. It is remarkable how conservative one becomes when in a position of responsibility. The Minister has followed the beaten track inobjecting to an inquiry into departmental methods by a Select Committee.",19
53,Mr FRAZER,PREFERENCE TO UNION,"If the honourable member for North Sydney will indicate how .1 Select Committee could obtain information"" which is not now available to honourable members, the Government will consider hiaproposal.",19
54,Dr CARTY SALMON,PREFERENCE TO UNION,"That reply could be made to every mover for a Select Committee. It is the old answer. House should not be satisfied with it , but should assert its right to obtain in its own way information regarding the working of Departments. Those who know anything of the case must feel shocked at the way in which these men are being treated. They are picked men, who have risen from the ranks. The most violent Socialist could not point his finger at those supporting their jlaiins, and accuse us of supporting the claims of over-paid and overdressed officers. Industry, application, and - ability have raised these men to the positions which they occupy. They have undergone constant and severe training, and have qualified by passing competitive examinations. treatment is, therefore, scandalous. many cases they receive only half what is paid to the unskilled labourer, either inside or outside the service, ancl they are doing special and highly technical work. Another injustice is that many of them who have seen active service, in some cases while holding commissions, are being paid only as much after seven or ten years' work on the Instructional Staff as is given to those entering the service today, their experience ancl work counting for nothing. Surely the Government does not propose to keep every one on the same dead level, adopting the doctrine of the Socialists! Men who have served the State well should be treated differently from the newest recruits to the service. To give the Defence system a fair trial, these men should be properly treated by the authorities. To get the best results our Forces must have the best training, and to secure that we must have a contented and - adequately paid teaching staff. No one can be expected to clo his 'best as a teacher unless he is in a contented frame of mind. No man can be contented when he is underpaid to the extent that these men are, and when he feels that his capacity and merit are not being recognised. We cannot have a contented service when men who have been doing certain work for many years receive no more than is paid to others who have been engaged in the same work for only a few months. I would suggest to the honourable member for North Sydney that he should make nn alteration in the proposed - personnel of the Select Committee. It was indicated a. few minutes ago by the honourable member for Parramatta that a certain amendment was contemplated, and I think 3. change in the personnel of the Committee may also be found necessary. The Mr. JOSEPH COOK - Hardly . There is nothing to prevent a Minister acting on - a Select Committee. L r . CARTY SALMON - The name of the honourable member for Maranoa might very well be substituted for that of the new Honorary Minister, the honourable member for Adelaide. The honourable member for Maranoa has had practical experience'as a soldier. He knows the work from A to Z, ancl I believe that his experience would be found of great advantage to the Committee in the prosecution of its inquiries. I ""trust that the Government are not going to resort to the old method of shirking inquiry by sheltering themselves behind the excuse that Their there already exists in the Department all In the information that is necessary. If we did net think it existed there we should not be asking for access to it. I appeal to the Minister-to say whether his experience leads him to believe that any individual member of this House would have the slightest chance of obtaining all the 'information he desired relative to a question of this kind, and whether, if he did gain it , he would be able to influence the House in regard to it .",20
55,Mr FRAZER,PREFERENCE TO UNION,It is open to the honourable member to submit a motion asking for a return.,20
56,Dr CARTY SALMON,PREFERENCE TO UNION,"A motion for a return is perhaps the most cumbersome and sluggish method of obtaining information of which one could conceive. I am surprised that so energetic an honourable member as the Minister should suggest that we should be content to f all back upon the old-fashioned parliamentary method of seeking this information by way of a return, when we can take a short cut and, by means of a personal interview on the part of a Select Committee with those who are in authority, obtain all the information we desire. The honourable gentleman has said that he objects to this proposal, on the ground, amongst others, of the expense that it would involve. I would remind him that Select Committees cost very little. From what he has said, people outside might imagine that members of a Select Committee are paid for their services. As a matter of fact, they receive 110 payment. The only expense i nvolved in this case would be in respect of the services of a shorthand writer and a supply of stationery. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Probably if we asked for a return the Minister would object.",20
57,Dr CARTY SALMON,PREFERENCE TO UNION,"What would be said if honourable members were, from day to day, to bombard the Minister with motions for returns? VVe should be accused of trying to hold up the whole Department in order that certain information might be furnished to the House. The Minister knows very well that one return often leads to a motion for another, to elicit additional information. By the ordinary easy method of an inquiry we can obtain all that we desire far more effectively and cheaply than we could hope to do by means of the obsolete method of obtaining returns. I do not » ant to talk out this motion; I hope that we shall proceed to a vote upon it, because I am satisfied that those who know anything uf the conditions of these men must not only feel sympathy for them, but desire to get at the very root of the reasons why they have been treated in the way of which complaint is made. We cnn get at the root of the matter only by the appointment of a Select Committee. I am'sure that the honourable member who has submitted this motion will be prepared to agree to a time limit being fixed so as to insure the Committee reporting to the House within a few weeks' time of its appointment. The additional information which such a Committee would elicit would place both the Minister of Defence and the Minister who represents him in this House in a very much better position to deal with the question than they are at present.",21
58,Mr MATHEWS,PREFERENCE TO UNION,"Melbourne Ports) [3.30], - I sympathize with the object which the honourable member for North Sydney has in view in submitting this motion. Not long ago the Defence Department found it impossible to secure recruits for the Permanent Artillery at the rate of pay they were then offering, and they were compelled to increase it. I cannot help expressing the hope that they will continue to find it impossible to obtain men at the remuneration now being offered. who enter the Permanent Forces have to be physically and mentally strong. They are the pick of those who present themselves for enrolment, and are certainly entitled to fair lemuiifctation. In reply to the complaints as to the small pay offered, it may be said that a man need not enter the service unless he chooses to do so. That is true of all employment, but if we compare the pay of the men in the Permanent Forces with that received by men following civil vocations we will see at once that it is exceedingly small. Promotion is also so slow that but few of these men are likely to reach in the service a position which will entitle them to remain in the Department until they have attained a ripe age. Many have to retire at a comparatively early age, and are thrown upon the world after years spent in a service which makes them utterly unfit to earn a living in many of the ordinary walks of life. Again and again during the last few years the pay of these men has been discussed, and although an increase was recently made, [ think that something more should be done in the direction asked for by the mover of this motion. This may not be the best method of achieving the object which we have in view; but it is the best that has been put forward, and, for the reasons I have stated, and more especially as there is no provision for the payment of pensions to those who reach the retiring age, I bave pleasure in supporting the motion.

59,Mr RYRIE,PREFERENCE TO UNION,North Sydney) [3.41]-- I move That a Select Committee of seven Members of this House be appointed to inquire into and report upon the whole of the circumstances connected with the visit of the Australian Cadets to England; such Committee to have power to send for persons and papers. I take it that the Government will raise no opposition to the motion. I have been led to believe that they welcome an inquiry into the circumstances connected with the visit of this contingent of Australian cadets to England.,22
60,Mr FISHER,PREFERENCE TO UNION,-The matter is much better as it is.,22
61,Mr RYRIE,PREFERENCE TO UNION,Without an inquiry?,22
62,Mr FISHER,PREFERENCE TO UNION,I think it is.,22
63,Mr RYRIE,PREFERENCE TO UNION,"I do not fear any inquiry so far as my side of the question is conto the King. cerned. If what the right honourable Prime Minister says is to be taken as a threat with regard to the officer who had charge of the contingent, all I can say is questions. that I welcome an inquiry, however it may turn out. An inquiry is absolutely essenthe tial, because there is, undoubtedly, a spread feeling of dissatisfaction in the Commonwealth with regard to the treatsent ment which it is alleged was meted out the contingent. I think the Prime Minister ancl the Government will-admit that there is a great deal of controversy going on present on the subject, and 1 take it it is for the benefit of the Government gram. themselves that the matter'should be cleared up. If they can bring forward evidence which will justify the action of the ister of Defence, so much the better for them. I take it, therefore, that they will not burke an inquiry, ancl will offer no position to the motion. There is a widemember spread feeling of discontent amongst the official papers. whole of the community, more especially amongst the parents, relatives, and friends of the lads themselves, over what occurred during their visit to the Coronation festivities. So far as I can make out, the facts of the case are something like these: First of all the Commonwealth Government refused to contribute anything towards sending Home any contingent of soldiers or cadets; secondly, through the aid of private citizens, and by means of contributions from the parents of the lads selected, we were able to send them to London without any aid from the Commonwealth Government. They were sent really by private subscription.",22
64,Mr LAIRD SMITH,PREFERENCE TO UNION,And you deserted them when they reached England.,22
65,Mr RYRIE,PREFERENCE TO UNION,"The Government did so. The Minister of Defence deserted them absolutely, and snubbed Major Wynne, who had command of them. Some of the mothers of the lads who went Home came to me, and really thought that their sons were left stranded in the streets of London, and would be unable to get back. It is to the advantage of the Government that the whole question should be cleared up, and that the minds of the people should be disillusioned of that impression if it is not justified.",22
66,Mr HIGGS,PREFERENCE TO UNION,-When did the Minister of Defence administer a snub ?,22
67,Mr RYRIE,PREFERENCE TO UNION,"Majo r Wynne took it upon himself, wliether rightly or wrongly, to despatch a wireless message of congratulation I clo not uphold his action the in regard to that matter, but he might not, perhaps, have been altogether au fai t with what I may call the etiquette of such I understand that when that message was received at the Home Office, Minister of Defence was asked whether widethis was the Commonwealth contingent, and, if not, how the message came to be from the "" Commonwealth Continto gent of Cadets"" ; and that Senator Pearce replied that it was not a Commonwealth contingent. I believe that, through his at lieutenant, Major Buckley, he reprimanded that Major Wynne for having sent the tele",22
68,Mr FRAZER,PREFERENCE TO UNION,"The Minister of DeMinfence, when asked by the War Office whether the Government had altered their original intention about sending a continopgent, simply said, "" No . "" The honourable can see all the particulars in the",22
69,Mr RYRIE,PREFERENCE TO UNION,"I have seen them; but I take it that the Minister of Defence might very easily have made the path smooth for the cadetshad he wished to do so. As a result of his practically disclaiming or repudiating the contingent, they very nearly had to camp out on the Thames Embankment. Major Wynne had to threaten to camp them out there because no provision was made to accommodate the in at the White City, .where provision was made for camping and maintaining every other contingent from other parts of the world. That is a disgraceful state of affairs, and does not reflect any credit upon this great Commonwealth, or upon the Commonwealth Government. The conbeen tingent was as fine a lot of fads as ever left the shores of any country. were a magnificent advertisement for tralia. Their conduct, so far as make out, was exemplary. They showed their' prowess satisfactorily in shooting and athletics. They won the King's in competition against cadets from parts of the world, and in many other contingent. ways showed that they were worthy sentatives of Australia. The Government might well have contributed something wasds their expenses in the circumfrom stances. It is intended to spend thousands, of pounds in advertising Australia, and I do not know whether the Government propose to spend £3,000 upon the picture of the wattle blossom the maiden rather scantily clad standing in the midst' of it, as now shown in the them back? Queen's H all ; but it would have been a very much better advertisement for tralia to have this splendid contingent cadets to represent the Commonwealth, and toshow what sort of men we can breed' here. What better advertisement could' we have for Australia and its mate than' those splendid, stalwart lads? The Minister' wasvery much to blame riot' ma-kingthe path easy' for them. if he had to say that they could not officially recognised as a Commonwealth contingent, he could have told the authorities that he would take it as favour to his Government if they could show them any favour in their power, make provision for their camping maintenance. If he had said one word that description, I am sure everything would have been made much more pleasant for them, but' he refused to do so. Dr, CARTY SALMON-Did the Government draw such a hard and fast line Other visitors who went Home from here?",22
70,Mr RYRIE,PREFERENCE TO UNION,I take it that they did not.,23
71,Mr FENTON,PREFERENCE TO UNION,Majo r Wynne made more difficult than ever.,23
72,Mr RYRIE,PREFERENCE TO UNION,"If Major Wynne has done anything subversive of discipline, I can be dealt with. I , as a military say that if a man offends against line, he must be punished. Surely it easily be shown whether that officer did offend. If he did, then punish him; it was not right to visit his faults the cadets. They should have been treated properly, no matte.r what their commandregard i ing officer did. It is not to the credit the Commonwealth that they should have left practically stranded at Home; and every credit ought to be given to Mr. They MCGowen, the Premier of New South AusWales,, for sending. ,£500 to assist I can to bring them back, when the Commonwealth Government refused absolutely to give a shilling towards it. Cup I take it that there was a good all deal of jealousy with regard to this The Government refused to reprehave anything to do with sending them Home. I suppose they thought there towould be no contingents of any sort sent here, and that private citizens ancl some parents would not be able to do it.",23
73,Mr JENSEN,PREFERENCE TO UNION,"If the Government refused to send them Home, how can the and Government be saddled with the responsibility of looking after them, or bringing",23
74,Mr RYRIE,PREFERENCE TO UNION,"We did not want the AusGovernment to be altogether saddled with of that responsibility; but the Minister of Defence might have shown them a little courtesy, and helped them by asking the Home Office to give them some consideraclition. Had he clone so, I am sure that every consideration would have been shown into them, instead of which he absolutely Even repudiated them as a CommonAvealth conbe tingent. His action in that regard was most unseemly, because he and the Prime Home Minister should have borne in mind that a they and all their suite were being royally entertained by the Imperial authorities. and In this connection, I might refer to the and enormous amount of money that was spent of on the visit of the Prime Minister and other Ministers and their suite to London. I understand that .£7,300 was spent in sending Home that suite, the largest that ever left the shores of Australia for any about function or festivity in Great Britain. Seeing that so much money was being expended, something might have been contributed for making the path easy for the it contingent; and I hope that honourable members on both sides - will see that the importance of the matter demands some inhe quiry. If the Government can show that the fault lies with the officer commanding man, the contingent, they can have no objection discipto the appointment of a Committee. If can the Government are blameless. I am preso pared to give them every credit; but, if they but are deserving of blame, the general public upon should know the facts. There is grave dissatisfaction throughout the country Will to the alleged treatment of the of cadets; and, - if the allegations be correct, the House and the people are entitled to all information. I hope the Government will .not oppose the motion, as they did my previous proposal. If the Government think they stand on a ""good wicket,"" ancl can show that I , and those who think with me, are wrong-if they can show that there is no action of Senator Pearce that calls for rebuke-the y ought not to be afraid of - inquiry, and I leave the matter in the hands - of the House. Mr W. ELLIOTJOHNSON (Lang) papers, [3-59]-- I second the motion, and endorse .generally the opinions expressed by the honourable member for North Sydney. was not at all satisfied with the way in which the cadets were treated by the Government. Certain statements were made to me by the officer commanding the contin.gent, and certain documents were shown .to me by him, which I regard as anything but satisfactory as to the treatment of the cadets after their arrival in England. It appears that there vvas every desire on the part of the British authorities to show all kindness, courtesy, and consideration to the contingent; but they were unable to carry those desires full y into effect-s I was informed in certain quarters-owin g to the action of the Minister of Defence in blocking proposals for their entertainment and recognition. At any rate, we know that these boys were not in evidence in the procession, nor when the Coronation medals were presented to the visiting contingents by the King, and further, so far as I am aware, that they were not allowed to take their place with the other oversea - contingents in the Coronation procession. After those ceremonies were over, and the Australian Ministers left London,"" thus severing the official connection, the Home authorities had a freer hand, ancl some effort at recognition was made. Through the intervention, I believe, of Lord Roberts it was ultimately decided that the cadets should have medals; but these medals will be presented to them in Australia. It would have been much more satisfactory if the cadets had been in the pageant and allowed to take patt in the parades and general assemblies of the oversea contingents at Buckingham Palace, and to receive their medals from the hands of the Sovereign himself. The medals would then have had attached to them a distinctive personal value, which will certainly not be the same when they are presented through a deputy, however exalted that deputy may .be. In any case, the granting of the medals was apparently an afterthought, the intention in the beginning being that, when the medals were presented, the Australian contingent should be deliberately left out. Mr Frazer.1-Does the honourable member say that the Minister of Defence tried to get the cadets left out? ' Mr W. ELLIOTJOHNSON - It was so asserted in London by those who should have been in a position to know. I do not make the assertion, but say they were left out, and that, according to the newsit was through the intercession of Lord Roberts and other military officials that the medals were ultimately conceded. I Whatever may be the facts, we have to depend on ex parte statements, and the fact that those statements are many and conflicting is a conclusive argument in favour of the motion. What the honourable member for North Sydney desires, and what I should think the House naturally desires, is to get at the facts of the case. The matter is clouded with all kinds of suspicion, and, generally speaking, the position is most unsatisfactory; and I can see no better way cf ascertaining the facts than by means of o a Select Committee. The Minister tells us that we have access to a return, but that return is an ex parte document.",23
75,Mr FRAZER,PREFERENCE TO UNION,"Honourable members can have the right to peruse the whole of the papers. As a matter of fact, those papers have been 011 the Library table for a month, and I do not suppose the honourable member has ever looked at them. Mr W. ELLIOTJOHNSON - I saw several of the papers in London. It is true that there .are the papers, but we require persons as well as papers. So far as they go, the papers are, no doubt, valuable, but something more is needed to ascertain all the facts. There has been so much public dissatisfaction that I think the honourable member for North Sydney is perfectly justified in asking for a Select Committee. If there is nothing to hide, the Government ought to be oniy too anxious for an inquiry of the kind, so that all may be cleared up, and the Ministry rehabilitated.",24
76,Mr FRAZER,PREFERENCE TO UNION,"Kalgoorlie-Postmaster General) [4V5] - The Government cannot see their way to accept the motion. This is a case that, undoubtedly, has caused a great deal of-wha t shall I say?-publi c criticism. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Scandal .",24
77,Mr FRAZER,PREFERENCE TO UNION,"Not scandal, but public criticism. In July, 1910, the gentleman in charge of the contingent asked the Government if it was intended to send a contingent to the Coronation, and a reply in the negative was given.' The question was repeated at a later stage, and a similar reply made. It was then intimated that there were a number of people in New South Wales apparently prepared to provide sufficient money to send the contingent; and the Government gave their sanction on the distinct ancl definite understanding that they had no financial responsibility. In the communication sent to Major Wynne, on the 20th February, 1911, the language was very clear, to the effect that the Government would give recognition to the proposal only on the distinct understanding that no liability, financial or otherwise, in connection with the raising, sending, or returning of the contingent would be recognised by the Government.",24
78,Mr FENTON,PREFERENCE TO UNION,That was before they left Australia ?,25
79,Mr FRAZER,PREFERENCE TO UNION,"Of course. But in con- that that would be done. nexion with the preparations the Government granted leave of absence to non-commissioned officers and cadets, the issue of arms ancl equipment, and camp equipment during the camp before embarking, and the services of two non-commissioned officers of the Instructional Staff to assist in the preliminary arrangements. definitely stated, however, that the Government would take no financial responsibility. The contingent went to London, and then we had the statements made by the gentleman to whom I referred the other day as the much-advertised Major. I believe that the chief factor in the whole of this little misunderstanding is that gentleman's association with a particular journal in New South Wales. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - I think so.",25
80,Mr FRAZER,PREFERENCE TO UNION,I think so; and I think that that connection is responsible for the enthusiasm of some of those honourable members who are advocating his claims in this House. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - That is very unfair and unjust statement to make.,25
81,Mr FRAZER,PREFERENCE TO UNION,"The honourable member may take any view he likes, but I think that if Major Wynne did not happen to be associated with one of the big powerful dailies of New South Wales there would not only not have been the publicity which was given to the statements made in London, but we should not have heard anything about the matter in the great dailies at the present time. When the contingent went to London the conditions were distinctly outlined. We find, however, that, when in London. Senator Pearce asked Major Buckley, the High Commissioner's military adviser, to see that accommodation was provided for the cadets; and that dees not seem to be a very strict adherence to the condition that no assistance would be given by the Government. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - That was after complaints had been made.",25
82,Mr FRAZER,PREFERENCE TO UNION,"It was an action by the Minister of Defence to assist the cadets, although it had been definitely stated that the Government had no responsibility, and the assistance was given when it was found that some difficulty had arisen. As to the cadets not being irf'the procession, Senator Pearce wrote to Lord Haldane, Secretary of State for War, asking that the cadets should be give a place on the line of procession, ancl a reply was received premising The Minister saw that they were looked after. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - They were placed along the line of procession; they were not allowed to take part in it like other contingents.",25
83,Mr FRAZER,PREFERENCE TO UNION,"The honourable memI t was ber's original complaint was that they were not given an opportunity to see the procession. When I reply to that, he shifts his ground. I do not know that they particularly desired to march in the procession. The Minister did all that he was asked to do. He met the cadets on their arrival, welcomed them, and assured them that he would do everything to make their stay pleasant. As to the need for an inquiry, all the papers have been on the Library do not table for a month, ancl no additional facts are to be got.",25
84,Mr JH CATTS,PREFERENCE TO UNION,What about the visit to Paris ? A great deal of scandal has been spoken about that; and the matter ought to be cleared up. a Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - That is another reason for an inquiry. Let Major Wynne ancl some of the boys be examined.,25
85,Mr FRAZER,PREFERENCE TO UNION,"An inquiry would onlyproduce the conflicting opinions of one and another. The honourable member for Lang will have an opportunity to deal with this matter at the greatest length when the Estimates are before us. It would be a serious thing for the House to intervene between the Minister ancl a military oflicer. Honourable members opposite may make the most of Major Wynne's statement, but they cannot show that the Government failed to carry out its undertaking in regard to the contingent. We believe that there is no need for an inquiry.",25
86,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PREFERENCE TO UNION,"Hume) [4.17] 1 regret that a party complexion has been given t:i this matter. An investigation on party lines would certainly be unwise. As 1 left Australia last December, I was not aware, when in London, of the terms on which the cadets went away; hut 1 saw them on several occasions. Most of them were from New South Wales, and a credit to that State ancl to Australia. It is true, as has been stated, that the Minister of Defence met them on arrival, and welcomed them; but there seems to have been some unpleasantness afterwards. I say. unhesitatingly that, as they were in England, although not sent by the Government, it is a pity that they were not officially recognised, especially as Australia had no other troops there at the time. They should have been in the procession. T gather, from the papers which I saw in London, that the Minister declined to send a contingent, or to be liable for any expense, but agreed to provide for the reception of .the cadets in England. The question has been raised, "" Was proper provision made?"" I do not think that it was. From what I have been told, mainly by Major Wynne, there was a celebration on board ship on Empire Day, when the cadets were going to England, and he did what I consider a mistaken and wrong thing. He sent a marconigram direct to the King, telling him of the demonstration. He has admitted to me that he made a mistake. He should have sent the message through the proper channel.",26
87,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PREFERENCE TO UNION,Throug h should it have been sent?,26
88,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PREFERENCE TO UNION,"I am not well up in military etiquette; but T think thai the message should have been sent through the High Commissioner, or through the Minister. When the boys got to England, there was, according to Major Wynne, an alteration of tone so far as the Minister was concerned, and official recognition was refused. I do not know whether the Minister should have allowed the cadets to be recognised as the contingent representing Australia; but it might have been recognised as representing New South Wales. I have been informed by Wynne that ground was prepared and tents erected for the accommodation of the cadets, but they could not use it because they could not get recognition, and had to camp at the Crystal Palace, paying for their accommodation there. There is. however, no case for an inquiry. Everyone is sorry that mistakes occurred; but the honourable member for Lang is making a mountain out of a mole-hill. When medals were distributed at Buckingham Palace to oversea trcops, I asked why the Australian cadets were not there, and was told that it was because the Minister did not allow them to be recognised. I thereupon saw our Prime Minister, the day before he left London, and told him what I had heard.  Buckley with him, and said that the case had not been put to him in the way in which 1 put it. In my presence, he in for the boys, the Minister of Defence having by that tithe left England. After my departure, Major Wynne saw Field Marshal Earl Roberts, and got him to interest him told me that he understood that the War Office had promised to give the boys the medals. I visited the cadets five times altogether, and no body of young men from other parts of the Dominions, or in Great Britain itself, drilled as well as they did. The perfection of their movements was marvellous, considering how short a time they had had for drilling. At the instance of some one from Australia who said that the food was not good, I made inquiries, paying two visits to the encampment. By in bridge and Major Buckley went with me. and we ascertained that the food was good, nnd that the boys were well cared for. Those who saw the cadets were very proud of them. We thought that they should be whom recognised; but, apparently, some power behind the throne was causing trouble. If the Minister proposed to take action regarding Major Wynne, an inquiry might be justified; but, as he does not, it would be best to let the matter drop. The public know exactly what has occurred. I was sorry to hear the honourable member for Melbourne Ports interject that the boys were Jingoes.",26
89,Mr FENTON,PREFERENCE TO UNION,No . He said that some of the New South Wales Jingoes helped to send them Home. Major Sir WILLIAM LYNE - I saw attributed to him in the press a statement that was derogatory to the boys.,26
90,Mr ROBERTS,PREFERENCE TO UNION,I do not think he intended to speak of them in a derogatory sense.,27
91,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PREFERENCE TO UNION,"At all events, it appeared to be derogatory to them. I know a large number of the boys who formed the contingent. I am acquainted with all who went from my own electorate, ancl I am able to say that, with one exception, they are all children of poor men. The exception to whom I refer is a son of Dr Woods, of Albury, who, although not a poor man, is certainly not wealthy.",27
92,Mr WATKINS,PREFERENCE TO UNION,Thre e boys also went from my electorate; and their parents are certainly not wealthy.,27
93,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PREFERENCE TO UNION,"Quite so. I feel that it would be unfair to the boys, and to their parents, to allow to pass uncontradicted the statement that the contingent comprised only the sons of wealthy men. It comprised far more sons of poor parents than sons of wealthy people.",27
94,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PREFERENCE TO UNION,"And in many cases, the towns from which they came subscribed the cost of sending them.",27
95,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PREFERENCE TO UNION,"I have heard that that is so; but I have no personal knowledge of the matter. I wish now very briefly to refer to Major Wynne, the officer in charge of the contingent. Major Wynne's father is connected with the Daily Telegraph. He himself is a journalist, and may have imported some of his journalistic methods into the work of advertising the boys; but, in any event, notone in a thousand could have undertaken the control of the contingent, and have carried out the work as successfully as he did. Too much cannot be said in praise of the way in which he looked after the boys ancl brought them back to Australia.",27
96,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PREFERENCE TO UNION,He did a good job.,27
97,Sir WILLAM LYNE,PREFERENCE TO UNION,He did.,27
98,Mr FENTON,PREFERENCE TO UNION,There are other sides to the story.,27
99,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PREFERENCE TO UNION,"I know all the facts relating to the matter, for I have taken a very great interest in the contingent, and I do not like to hear Major Wynne condemned. I am convinced that he did his best, although he may have imported into his work methods that were unknown to the Defence Department. In that respect-, no doubt, he erred, and Major Wynne himself is the first to acknowledge that he made a mistake. Debate (on motion by Mr JOHN THOMSON) adjourned. NA DISTRIBUTION.

100,Mr FRANK FOSTER,NATIONALIZATION OF,"New England)* [4.29] - I hope to be able to conclude, within an hour, my speech in submittingthis motion to the House. When it waslast before honourable members, I traversed' a good deal of the ground to be covered ,-. but I wish today to point to some of the efforts that have been made to cope with the waste of distribution, ancl to the injustice that is done to the people under the methods that have grown up with our civilization. The most striking example of co-operative effort that the civilized worldfurnishes today is that of the co-operativesocieties of Great Britain. As far back as the time of Robert Owen, attempts weremade to form co-operative distributingsocieties, and also co-operative societies for production, but it was not until 1844 that the great effort was commenced which has. led to the magnificent successes of today. The history of the movement in Great Britain is of much interest to students, audi particularly to those who desire that distriment bution shall be dealt with in an effective way. Whilst many co-operative efforts have been successful in Australia, more particularly in centres where a large numthese ber of men are employed in one industry, there have yet been many failures. main reason for these failures has been, think, the small amount of capital with which operations have been commenced, and also the neglect to obtain men capin able of conducting them from a purely ments business stand-point. The men who enter upon the struggle to establish a co-operative society are more or less sentimentalists and idealists. They are not altogether men practical business knowledge, and hence many of their efforts result in failure. great co-operative system of the Old Land, however, has reached a stage at which cess is absolutely assured. On the formaleaps tion of a co-operative society in Great Britain, the promoters may at once apply to the Co-operative Wholesales, and to their Co-operative Union, for a manager, who will undertake the whole work of ganization. The society, once started, able to obtain its goods on the best wholegamation sale basis, ancl success is at once assured. Although we have many successful coaccomplish, operative enterprises in Australia, we have distribution. not a Co-operative Wholesale, and, until we have such an institution, we cannot expect to make very rapid strides in the of co-operative distribution. One must ignore the educational value of co-operative effort. I clo not wish to discourage those in Australia who favour the building up of co-operative societies for production or tribution ; but I do not hesitate to say the nationalization of distribution would prove the master co-operative effort. It after all. the simplest of all methods co-operation. Although it looms large the eyes of those who are not familiar with partment the idea, yet it is the simplest method obtaining what we desire in regard to tribution. For the information of those who, like myself, recognise the necessity of fighting for the control of distribution by the people, I propose to quote some figures showing the growth of the co-operaing tive movement in England. These figures, which appear in The History of the Colike operative Wholesales, were taken from the Co-operative News, and show what was the position on 23rd June, 1904. The Wholesale Society was founded in Manducers chester, in 1864, with but a small sum its command, and it now has assumed gigantic proportions. In 1904, the in England comprised a federation of 1,133 retail societies, with a. membership of i.500,000, exclusive of outside customers. In 1904, the annual sales of societies totalled £20,000,000; they had a banking turnover of £87,000,000; The they owned eight steam-ships, eleven I foreign ancl four shipping and forwarding dep6ts, thirty-eight creameries, and fifty auxiliaries, two fruit farms, tea estates Ceylon, and fifty productive depart; whilst they employed 15,000 persons. There ate also branches at Newcastle and London. That, in brief, is the position of this great co-operative movement in of England up to June, 1904. I have seen later statistics, but I have not the exact The figures, and do not propose to quote from memory. I know, however, that the busisucness of the society has increased by and bounds. As an enthusiastic cooperator I altered this movement nearly twenty years ago. Apart from experience gained as a private storekeeper, I acted twice as a manager of co-operative socieorties, and I had before me the ideal that is we should eventually bring about an amalof all the co-operative societies into one great co-operative concern, and so in effect, the nationalization of Despite the successes of the co-operaway tive movement in Great Britain and elsenot where, I have had to give up that idea, however, believing that the nationalization of distribution through' the Federal Parliament offers a shorter road to the obdisject I have in view. In Australia, there that have been some other excellent efforts to cope with distribution. First and foremost is, amongst these is the action of the Governof ment of South Australia in establishing in a State Produce Department. That Dehandles produce of all of kinds, wheat, hone}', cheese, bacon, disbutter, and rabbits; and it is doing excellent work. The Government said, in effect, to the farmers of South Australia, "" You are being badly treated by the middlemen, while the consumers also are paytoo much for their goods. We are, therefore, going to help you."" I should to ask for what purpose a Government exists if it is not to help the people on the land ? A Government that refuses to take cognisance of the persecution of our proby rings-whicl i neglects to fight, at not only for the producer, but also for the consumer-is guilty of almost criminal negmovelect. The South Australian Produce Department has been an unqualified success. Even a man who has only a dozen fowls to dispose of may take them to the Department, and have them put into the freezer. Justice is done to the very small producer. In the public markets today, the producers, and especially those who are in only a small way, are defrauded right aud left.",27

107,Mr JH CATTS,NATIONALIZATION OF,The fact is that the institution is working successfully.,29
108,Mr FRANK FOSTER,NATIONALIZATION OF,"That is proof of the magnificent success of the system. The honourable member for Wimmera can America, easily be supplied with the items he reproduction, quires if he applies to the manager of institution. It is common knowledge lhat that department has been most successful. Even its success need not be emphasized -;o much as the common honesty which i has brought about amongst the otiier handling the produce of the farmers. The Commonwealth Parliament has passed a Commerce Act, which has made for a more honourable system of trading. We passed a Trade Union Label Act, which was aimed at protecting the Australian worker, who fights for his own rights, from the curse of buying sweated goods made under conditions at which he would blush. We have on record many attempts at dealing with adulteration. Adulteration cannot be taken in hand with anything like efficiency except in this wholesale way cloes its work. While ever private trading exists, adulterabut tion has a chance to thrive. We have gone a little further in the inspection of dairies and in watching the meat supply. All these things have helped, and are working up to the ultimate aim of those who want a complete reform in distribution, but there, also, I maintain, there has been a failure. With full national control of die productions from dairies, and of the butchering trade, we should get a purer food supply. VVe have had Pure .Food Acts passed. Many of them have gone a fair distance, but they, too, have failed, for the simple reason that, while ever there is a profit in tricking the public, by distributing adulterated goods, some person will find it worth his while to sell them. We have also had some anti-trust legisAmerica might be quoted as a country where it has been attempted on a Devery large scale, and it may also be said lhat there it has absolutely failedto cope the evils of the trusts. In France, Italy, Spain, and Roumania, the are distribution of tobacco has been made a monopoly. Unbiased accounts state that whenever you wish to purtobacco in those countries you know you will get exactly what you ask for, and 'he same grade is at the same price in every district of the State. There is no chance of adulteration, or of the article being made too dear. What has been done in regard to tobacco might easily be done with regard to all necessaries of life. Here I should like to quote from The Greatest Trust in the World, at page 185, figures showing how the Beef Trust in by taking hold of distribution ancl were able with one hand to rethe duce the price paid for cattle by several hundreds of millions of dollars, and at the same time to raise the retail price of meat to the consuming public. The following t figures show, in regard to Chicago, how the agents prices were gradually raised: Article. Oct. 21, O c t . 2 1 . May fi. igoo. 1902. 1905. cents. cents. cents. Sirloin steak, per lb. 10 12 20 Chuck steak 8 10 124 Veal cutlets ""i »5 20 Leg of mutton 10 I2i 14 Bacon (canned and rindless) 16 20 *5 Bacon (other grades) 10 M 18 Rousting chickens r i '5 Broilers, per pair 7° 90 $1.5. Ducks 11 i=i 20 These figures show how gradually the Trust It does not rush things, takes them nicely and easily. As the people get used to one increase another is put on. The above prices may be compared with Australian prices by reckoning that a cent is equal to about a half-penny. I wish to warn the people of Australia that if they clo not take hold of their distribution themselves, the trusts will take hold them. If we go on regardless of the high cost of living, ancl of the robbery of the people of their just earnings by increased prices ancl high rents, we shall land the people of Australia into the very conditions, that have taken hold in America. My main object in bringing forward a motion of this kind is to avoid that result. Those who say that I am looking too far ahead forget the results of trustification in America, and are too self-satisfied that legislation is sufficient to cope with trusts after they are formed. The only remedy the people of America have is to take over the trusts and nationalize them after they are formed. I admit that the trusts have shown the way to organize; but the difference between a trust and a Government controlling distribution is that in the latter case the prices would not increase, but could be decreased to what was reasonable. There are many articles the price of which even our nationalized system would have to regulate according to the markets of the world, but thousands of other articles could be regulated on a fair basis, so as to give producer a reasonable return. T have no objection whatever to production being carried on. as it is today. So long as adulteration is eliminated from it. so long as the articles produced are not sold under false pretences, and the sweating conditions of labour are eliminated, and .sanitation is properly attended to, especially in factories, and fair values are given for the products, and monopoly is wiped out, so long, also, as the producer is assisted by reasonable credit, and given free access to the land, I have no desire to see established the nationalization of production. With distribution, however, it is totally another matter, and the demand for its nationalization is imperative. One industry which has suffered severely through private handling of the products is that of mining. I have had a good deal of direct experience for several years in connection with the mining industry, especially gold, tin, copper, bismuth, and wolfranv. While we are always satisfied that so much an ounce will be given for gold, the unfortunate miner who produces tin ancl certain other metals is at the mercy nF a set of middlemen who do not hesitate ""to .swindle him out of a fair price. T have never yet seen a fairly good price given for tin. There has always been a tremendous margin, and the. miner has suffered under great disabilities. The follow; ing is contained in a letter sent to me uncler of it for date 2nd October, 191 r :Now, nearly all this year tin has"" been from J£ISG to £ i g s P e r to n i that is, at the three months' price of course; the spot price was mostly over £200 up to ^231 for a few weeks, ancl it is only this last four weeks there has been a slump, which seems to be steady now. Well, you know that most of the tin sold .here is 72 1 0 73i P cent., and that is never what they e r call top tin. Now, the highest price got here this year was one parcel of over a ton at ^119 ios. per ton, ancl then it was because Smith and Collins were in opposition; the highest I have got has been £115. Then, again, there is wolfram and bismuth and scheelite. How is it we can never see the market (European) quoted in the D.T. ?-becaus e theTe is a ring. That exemplifies what has been going on for years ancl years. Millions of pounds' worth of tin, bismuth, wolfram, and other minerals have been raised in New South Wales, and the middleman is fattening on them the whole time. The Government have never extended the hand of assistance to the miners; and I challenge the Federal Government to see that these workers are not exposed to this sort of manipulation in the Northern Territory. I challenge the the Government, in the administration of the Territory, and in assisting the miners and prospectors, to establish a system of storekeeping under Government control. The Government ought to establish depots, and so govern that part of Australia that every man shall get the fullest possible price in the best market of the world for the minerals he produces. I do not desire the Government to go in for wholesale buying, but rather to act as agents, advancing supplies to the workers, and seeing that the product is placed on the market to the best possible advantage. It would be risky for the Government to buy materials outright, seeing that this product fluctuates so much in the market; but I see nothing to stop the State from advancing supplies from the Government stores, and rendering assistance financially from a National Bank, if necessary. I clo not suggest that the Government should advance more than half the value. When I was interested in mining operations, if I could have lodged, say, a ton of tin with a local store, with the knowledge that I could have advanced on it 50 per cent, of its likely value, I ecu Id have carried cn until that tin was sold in the best market. I am sorry that the Minister of External Affairs, who is the Czar of the Northern Territory, is not present. That gentleman has been truly a sort of Czar up to the present; but the time is coming, I suppose, when some arrangement will have to be made for a kind of Constitution. The sort of assistance I have suggested for the miners may also be extended to those who go on the land. The Northern Territory, up to the present, with £3,000,000 spent upon it, has been practically a. failure, and the explanation lies in the fact that the pioneers and explorers have little or no assistance. The Territory is too far away from the base of supplies, and the difficulty is increased of getting a decent price for products. trust, however, that our Government will take hold of the proposition as a business one. If they do not, they will not be able to make anything like a decent success of the Territory. Until we have railways and the other facilities of civilization, there is no chance for the pioneer, the explorer, ancl the developer. The position is all very well for gentlemen like Mr. Kidman, Mr White, or Mr Christian, who can take up .1,000,000 acres and drive their cattle overland to South Australia or Queensland; but the difficulties presented are too much for the pioneer miners and settlers Government assistance. This robbery of the producer by the distributor of metals has been a scandal in New South Wales. Miners may be told locally on the field that they will get £90 for their tin, and they see quotations in the newspapers that the price is nearly £200 in the Old Land. That, of course, is for pure tin, and some allowance must be made; but, with tin touching, say, £160, the miner ought to get at least £125. But what about the halance of £35 of which they are defrauded? It would not be so bad if correct information were supplied about the market; but the middlemen in the tin trade send fictitious wires to the effect that, for various reasons, tin has fallen. When they know that a lot of tin has accumulated, they spread abroad a rumour of falling prices ; but, when the miners rush in with their tin, and it again becomes scarce on the fields, up goes the price. As to the general effect of the nationalization of distribution, I may point out that our international trade with other countries would reach a splendid balance. Trading as the Commonwealth of Australia in the markets of the world, we would gain a. standing which the Mr Foster. traders of other nations could not attain unless they took a similar step. At present trade is left to individuals, whose integrity in many cases is much doubted; but there could be no doubt as to the integrity of the whole nation. We would find that our international relations, as we built up Australia, would become very solid and sound throughout the world. There would be harmony between the producers of Australia ancl the producers of every civilized country. There would be pure reciprocity. If Germany took £20,000,000 worth of products from Australia, we might be able to take £20,000,000 worth from Germany on the best possible basis. There could I be no danger of trickery or scheming when the Commonwealth bought as one body. Now just one word on the general conclusions I have laid down. If honourable members look at the motion, they will find that, towards the finish, I express a desire to see the nationalization of distribution, in order to establish an honest currency, based on goods and services. We have never yet had an honest £ 1 note. There is a' supposition that the £ 1 notes issued by a Government or by the private banks will be met by sovereigns; but those who have gone into the question deeply have come to the conclusion that if suddenly, without throughout the civilized nations, the people were all to demand sovereigns for the notes, about is. in the £ 1 would be paid. The gold system is something like a pyramid standing on its apex instead of on its base. We in Australia have issued a Commonwealth note which is not absolutely an honest one. It is far more honest than the private note, but it is not totally honest, because, if there were a sudden rush, we could not pay a sovereign for each note, ancl we might have to provide by legislation for deferred payments. But if the £ 1 note were based on goods and services-if the Government had full control of the distribution., ancl every note they issued were to the man who performed a service or presented goods to the Government for sale-it could be met at any time in goods or in services. At present a man is guaranteed his £ 1 in gold, though we know that he cannot get it ; but if it were exchangeable for goods and services, he could take it in tea, sugar, boots, machinery or any other commodity. I hope we shall soon reach the time when the Government will absolutely control distribution, in order that we may issue an honest note based on goods and services. Of course, this is a subject which touches currency; but I desire to draw the attention of students of currency to the fact. The idea is not a new one, by any means. It has been advocated by many people, and it has been practised, but never by a State or nation. It has been practised in a small way, in exchanges ancl marts, where tradesmen' have agreed to accept a note based on goods and services. That, however, is only playing with a great principle. The moment the nation takes over the distribution, that moment we may have an honest £i-note superseding the absurd idea of the gold basis. I do not suggest that we should abolish the sovereign, which could still be utilised ifor international commejrce. In the motion I set forth that the nationalization of distribution would effectively and economically organize the distribution of products in Australian markets, and Australian products in foreign markets; and I need not add to the argument I have already adduced under that head. I further say that the reform would abolish the waste of the unnecessary middleman. It is self-evident that if we have one store where now there are several hundreds in a big city, the unnecessary middleman will have to go. Then I urge that we should secure fair and reasonable prices to Australian producers, because die produce would go directly from the farm, factory, or workshop to the consumer. We should extend the consumption of Australian products 'in Australian and' in foreign markets. To-day we have an excellent production in Australia, yet we find there is very little patriotism in the importer. He would sooner sell an imported article, even if made in a prison, than an Australian article, if he can make more profit. I do not accuse him heavily on that score, because he has a struggle to maintain his business, and we cannot expect him to be too much of a patriot. With a Government store, however, Australian productions would get the preference every time; and, if these were as good as the foreign, the latter would be wiped out. The quality of Australian products would also be improved, because, when the producer is encouraged by good prices to give of his best, he does so. it is astonishing, however, how producers, especially 011 the land, struggle year year to give the best despite the disability of bad prices. Then I maintain that the nationalization of distribution would abolish trusts, combines, and monopolies in Australia, and their influence on Australian commerce. The Government would be in such a position that they need not purchase articles manipulated or produced by a trust, if they could be obtained at decent prices elsewhere. What I fear today is, not the establishment of a trust in Australia, but its operations in Australia, although it may be established in Germany or America. We should, if my motion were carried into effect, decentralize Australia through commercial channels, with a view to its more effective occupation and defence. That point I have already dealt with; and I maintain that the solution I present is the only one which will settle this country and hold it. The national commercial channels presented in our railways, ports, and roads ought to be utilized so as to give the people every possible chance of getting their products to market on the best possible terms. I come now to a proposal which may look a little far fetched, but I am pleased to know that it has received countenance by the action of a member of the House of Commons in moving in the same direction. I propose the organization of food and other supplies in preparation for times of war. Honourable members know what scandals have been caused by the commissariat department of Great Britain in war time. They know what tricks have been played by contractors, and how Governments bave been embarrassed for the want of supplies. Tf Australia were thrown into a war now, she would suffer serious disabilities for want of the organization of food supplies, but with the nationalization of distribution everything would be ready to hand. One might make a long speech on this subject alone, its importance is so great. The danger of Great Britain from the cutting off of supplies is more serious than ours, because we are, or soon will be, self contained. The people of Great Britain, however, would starve in a week if cut off from the rest of the world. If my proposal were adopted, the public would not be defrauded ; rich contractors would not become richer by ill-gotten gains, soldiers would not be fed on rubbish, ancl adulteration would receive its death blow. The Japanese gave us many lessons in the art of warafter fare which we might well take to heart. They sent men ahead to examine water supplies, to prevent sickness, and we have as good cause for preventing illness by the use of bad food. I propose, too, that supplies should be stored to provide against droughts. There have been times when we have suffered very heavily from droughts, and prices have then become very high. When supplies are plentiful they are recklessly exported; but witR the control of distribution in the hands of the Government, countless millions of bushels of wheat and other foodstuffs could be put aside in times of abundance, and kept in great storehouses against times of scarcity, following the example of Joseph in Egypt. VVe have undertaken a'big contract in development of Central and Northern Australia, and must adopt methods less slipshod than those of the past. We cannot afford to leave any longer to private enterprise the distribution of supplies, making no provision against drought and scarcity. I hope that I have not unnecessarily wearied honourable members. I read in the newspapers that (lie blood of some of tbem turned to water. That will really happen if they do not clo something effective to provide against the increase in the cost of living. I warn the great labour movement of Australia that new Protection is not possible until the consumer is protected, and distribution controlled by the Government. Anti-trust legislation and the nationalization of monopolies, or other tinkering legislation, will not do what is needed. Under the present system of distribution the producers are robbed. I hope that the proposals covered by the questions put at the last referenda will ultimately be adopted. That will do a great deal for the solving of our difficulties; but I challenge the Labour party and the producers to take up this question of the nationalization of distribution. I recommend the Labour party to make the nationalization of distribution a plank of its platform. Then we can deal with it in this Chamber. In doing so. we shall be facing one of the greatest problems that we have had to meet since Federation.",29
109,Dr MALONEY,NATIONALIZATION OF,"Melbourne) [5.18] - I compliment my honourable friend upon his clear and thorough statement of the case. Though no party could do everything that he asks, his speech shows great research. I can verify what he says regarding the tobacco monopoly. Three years ago, wishing to study the Kanaka question, I visited the South Sea Islands, and at Vila, to my great satisfaction, found a French store where I could buy the brand of tobacco which I was accustomed to use in France between 1880 ancl 1886, and, so far as I could recollect, at the same price. The French Government monopoly gives the people of France a wholesome tobacco, which, although it may not be pleasant to the palate of those who have not learned to appreciate i l , is unadulterated, and obtainable wherever the French flag flies, at the one price. The profits of the monopoly are larger than the annual production of gold in Australia, being in one year £17,500,000, and in another £18,250,000. The existence of the monopoly does away with the terrible competithe tion to which we are accustomed, and enables the French Government to assist the widows of soldiers by placing them in charge of small country stores, and allowing them to sell tobacco, instead of paying them pensions. To show that a taste for French tobacco is easily acquired, I would point out that there are in London no fewer than ten shops which sell French tobacco. The first shop to clo so was established fifteen years ago, the trade being established by the demand of artists and others who had acquired a taste for the tobacco while studying in France. To those unacquainted with the book, J recommend a study of Albert Shaw's Municipal Government in Europe. It shows the advantages of having a Government analytical department to control the sale of pure foods. Until 1880, wine and bread were both adulterated in France, but it is dangerous to adulterate them now. A friend of mine once told me that, seeing a group in a side street, he asked .an interpreter what was the matter, and found that the assemblage was gazing at a baker's shop, in the window of which was a. notice stating that the baker had been fined for adulteration, the date and amount of the fine being given. . That notice had to remain in the window for three months. Imprisonment is the penalty for a second offence. I do not think that any shopkeeper would run the risk of adulterating food on a second occasion. The German municipalities are also taking stringent action to prevent adulteration. But within the confines of this great continent, which is washed at all points by the waves of the ocean, manufacturers who are base ancl wicked enough may make and sell foodstuffs whose use jeopardizes the lives of tender infants. A ll honourable members must be of opinion that the food of the nation should be pure and unadulterated, ancl that adulteration should be punished by imprisonment. I remember the glorious words of Mr Gladstone, when regretting that the English law permitted the sale of coffee adulterated to the extent of 60 per cent. It was in the speech that he made on that occasion that he declared that Great Britain was the home of adulterated foods. Much can be clone to prevent the adulteration of our food supplies, ancl I hope that the Minister of Trade ancl Customs will clo his best in the matter. The Produce Department established by the Government of South Australia is doing excellent work. It is so conducted that, through its agency, a farmer in that State can dispose of his sheep, can sell the skins and the flesh, and even have the offal converted into manures, and be sure that be will have returned to him every penny received on account of his sales. I know of no greater effort under the British flag to clo justice to those who go on the land, and who, undoubtedly. lead the hardest of lives, f can speak from experience in this regard, since I took up land in Victoria thirty-nine years ago, and carried out the three years' residence condition. I laugh sometimes when I think of my experiences in those clays. As the result of swinging the axe on my selection, I have a big chest measurement, but it was an infamy for the Lands Department of Victoria to send a poor little bank clerk into that heavilytimbered country.",33
110,Mr KING OMALLEY,NATIONALIZATION OF,H a d the honormeed able member to clear the land?,34
111,Dr MALONEY,NATIONALIZATION OF,"For three years we were working away at big logs. There was on the average twenty trees of an average diameter of 7 feet to every acre, so that the honourable member may imagine what were the difficulties experienced in clearing the land. If I had had a few acres into which I could have put the plough, perhaps I should have remained on the land, and have never sat in this Parliament. I am sure there is not an honourable member who would not support a movement to prevent the adulteration of foods. Sir Jonathan Hutchinson,, who was one of the greatest figures in the medical and surgical world of the latter part of the last century, strongly advocated the nationalization of bread, and I could wish that the British Government would adopt that proposal. I should be glad if the English had the organizing capacity of the Germans. If the controlling power of London were for twenty years in the hands of such men as now control Berlin, the result would be beneficial to the British race. conditions of living the Britisher can always hold his own. But the homes of the workers in London are far different from those of the workers of Germany. A Democratic Socialist showed me over Berlin, ancl when I asked where the workers lived he pointed to some splendid terraces, six and seven stories high, situated in a wide ancl well-kept street. I was astounded with what I saw. \ found that a mechanic could, for £,2 a month; rent a fiat of three rooms in one of these buildings, with light, water, and often heating, free. I know of no terrace in South Yarra or Toorak to equal those pointed out to me in Berlin as the homes of working men. I certainly never saw their equal in London. I can compare them only to the building known as "" The Mansions "" erected in Collins-street by the late David Syme. These terraces extend for hundreds and hundreds of yards, and the roadway in front of them is much better than is that part of Collins-street on which The Mansions "" abut. First comes the footpath, next the roadway, ancl then a tramline, running over mown grass plots, which have the appearance of a gentleman's lawn. Then there is a track in the middle of the road specially prepared for horses. Next comes another tram track, a roadway, and a footpath. The street in which I saw these terraces was half as wide again as is Collins-street, ancl I must certainly pay my of praise to the organizing capacity of the Germans. I saw no slums in Berlin, and I hope that we in Australia will keep our future cities free of slums, just as we hope to wipe out all poverty in our midst. On the occasion nf my recent visit to London I contrasted what 1. saw with that which 1 saw there twenty-five years before, ancl I felt that the stigma of infamy rested on those responsible for the failure to provide proper living conditions for the workers. The poor of London have not the opportunities to insure good health, and they are not even considered fit to have a vote. In no other country have I seen the infamy, degradation, and poverty that exists there. If the living conditions of the English poor were improved I believe that England would become greater and more glorious than she is. We, of the Southern Seas, hope she will always maintain her prestige among the nations of the earth ; but I , the sou of an English woman, anxious that the greatness of the British race shall never die, am yet forced to confess that unless a Tariff that will protect the manufacturers, and open up the lands of England, is With fair brought into force England will sink to terrible depths. The honourable member for Denison, who was one of the delegation to England, visited what was once known as Petticoat-lane, and also took a photograph of a right-of-way only some 6-ft. wide, on which two-story houses abutted. How, in Heaven's name, can people, living in such a place, be strong and healthy? The <5oo members of the House of Commons, however, continue to talk and to waste time instead of allowing England, Scotland, Ireland, ancl Wales to have their own local Parliaments, which would quickly enable the people to get rid of many of these undesirable conditions. In the fighting of trusts ancl combines the Empire of Japan furnishes us with an example. Indeed, I am inclined to think that Japan will be the first co-operative Commonwealth the world has ever seen. A fool is born in every line of Kings, ancl the present King of Bavaria is said to run about picking up in his mouth sticks with which to build a nest, imagining that he is a stork. I admire the Japanese for their love of their country, .and their great fighting power, ancl one cannot but admire the way in which they fought the great American Tobacco Combine. The Japanese Government endeavoured at first to arrive at an honourable compromise, but the Combine, secure in its millions, only laughed at them. The Japanese Government made a second offer, and that, too, having been rejected, they set to work to establish a State tobacco monopoly. Ih the first place, when they set up a. 50 per cent. Tariff, the Combine simply laughed at them. The Tariff was again raised, until, about 1904, it stood at 100 per cent. Then, under an article in the Japanese Constitution, it was ruled that everything required for a Government monopoly could come in free of duty, and when, in addition, the Tariff was raised to 1.50 per cent., the Combine began to display some anxiety. In the following year, it was raised to 250 per cent., so that it cost the Combine £35, plus landing charges and freightage, to bring into Japan cigars worth £10 pgr thousand, whereas the Government monopoly could secure them at a cast of only jQto per thousand, plus landing charges and freightage. The Combine then approached the Government, ancl expressed its willingness to accept their offer. The Japanese Government, however, refused to re-open the negotiations, and, in the end, obtained the machinery of the Combine at what was, perhaps, only a nominal sum. The - American Tobacco Dr Moloney. Combine thought that they had finished with that little part of the earth, but Japan today is fighting them over a far greater area. If we do not obtain power to crush the trusts, then, sooner or later, they will come in and injure us I have much pleasure in seconding the motion, and am sure that those vvho read the speech delivered by the honourable member for New England, in submitting it, will find in it information of much value and interest. Debate (on motion by Mr Frazer) adjourned. NA SHIPS. Debate resumed from 5th October (vide page 1150), on motion by Mr KELLY1. That this House is of opinion that action should be taken to discourage trading in Australian waters by such foreign merchant ships as are capable of immediate conversion into commerce destroyers upon the outbreak of war. 2. That the above resolution be sent to the Senate for its concurrence. .",34
112,Mr HIGGS,ARMED FOREIGN MERCHANT,"Capricornia) [5.39] Some honourable members have made a fetish of the question of the defence of Australia, and. having apparently worked themselves into an extraordinary state of alarm and panic, are casting about for various ways and means of emphasizing their views. The honourable member for Wentworth is now joining with other foolish people in making an attack upon a nation which, I believe, although there is a war party amongst its people, is in the main desirous of preserving peace. This motion is directed against the Germans.",35
113,Mr WEST,ARMED FOREIGN MERCHANT,Anc l the French.,35
114,Mr HIGGS,ARMED FOREIGN MERCHANT,"I do not think so. The French vessels which trade in Australian waters are not, so far as I know, ready to be turned into war-ships, but the German vessels are. If there is any truth in the maxim that the best way to preserve peace is to prepare for war, surely it must apply equally to every nation. I think I am entitled to a fuller House to listen to my observations. [Quorum'formed.] When an honourable member submits a question of this kind to the House for public discussion, he ought to be here to listen to the arguments on the other side. I regret that the honourable member for Wentworth is not present. The main body of the German people do not want wai. There is in Germany, just as there is in Great Britain, ancl possibly in France, a war party; but the most aggressive war parties in the world at present are those in Great Britain and Germany. The - German people, in the main, are not desirous - of having war, and we should not carry any resolution which is a reflection upon the German people, and which may have a - disastrous effect upon Australian trade.",35
115,Mr MASSYGREENE,ARMED FOREIGN MERCHANT,Why is this motion particularly a reflection on Germany?,36
116,Mr HIGGS,ARMED FOREIGN MERCHANT,Because the German vessels are the only vessels trading in Australian waters that are ready to be converted into men-of-war.,36
117,Mr MASSYGREENE,ARMED FOREIGN MERCHANT,How does the honourable - member know that?,36
118,Mr HIGGS,ARMED FOREIGN MERCHANT,"If the honourable member can contradict me, I shall be glad to 'hear the names of any other vessels to - which the same thing applies. I have 'here a picture in the Graphic, entitled, ""Shall There Be War? A Hundred ""Thousand Germans Answer ' No.' "" The letterpress below it is as follows:On Sunday morning, at the height of the Morocco crisis, while France was assembling a - vast fleet of war-ships to make an imposing display at Toulon, and Germany was doing thfi - same at Kiel, a hundred thousand Socialists - gathered very quietly in Treptow Park, Berlin, fo protest against the war agitation. In calling upon the people to turn out in their thousands - to attend the demonstrations the Vorwarls, the - chief organ of the Social Democratic parly in Germany, printed in large type on its front page, "" People of Berlin, proclaim your unshakable determination for peace ! Morocco is not worth the bones of a single German workman ! Down with the war fever ! Long live solidarity with - our English and French brothers !"" That is the spirit which actuates the majority of the people of the civilized nations; but it is men like the honourable member for Wentworth that are the disturbing element, ancl succeed in persuading the Legislatures of the nations to go in for huge war expenditure. It is misguided men like the honourable member-although , no doubt, the honourable member believes thoroughly ""that Great Britain and Australia are in danger-that are the instruments of the army and navy contractors of the world, who have simply got the civilized nations deluded into the idea that they should be afraid of one another. The army and navy contractors mainly in Great Britain are availing themselves of the panic which has been created by people Tike the honourable member for Wentworth to bieed the people of the world - of millions of money in order that they ma}' pay from 10 to 25 per cent, dividends. The curious fact is that all the large establishments in Great Britain will make guns and munitions of war for any nation, for Spain, for Japan, for ltaly, for anywhere. Those guns may at any time be turned upon Great Britain, but what clo their makers care? While they are talking about patriotism, and the necessity for keeping up an army and navy to defend Great Britain, they are manufacturing arms and munitions of war to enable other nations to attack Great Britain. The people of the world who want to live in peace with everybody else are being deluded by them. We have been led astray by motions such as the honourable member for Wentworth proposes. The honourable member belongs to the Free Trade party, and yet he proposes that we shall attack the Germans because the Germans have adopted a very sensible provision, which, if we had any sense, we would adopt tomorrow, by subsidizing our Inter-State vessels so that, if a war did occur, they could be turned into war-ships.",36
119,Mr RVRIE,ARMED FOREIGN MERCHANT,I do not think there was anything in the honourable member's proposal about attacking the Germans.,36
120,Mr HIGGS,ARMED FOREIGN MERCHANT,"Can anybody itell me what other nation is aimed at by the motion? A book entitled Our German Cousins, and published by the Daily Mail, in the Old Country, contains the following paragraph) 'concerning German merchant vesselsArrangements have been made in the event of war to arm all the faster German steamers. In time of peace they carry a few 6-pounders on board, and sufficient trained men to work the yuns. On the declaration of war they would hoist the flag and attack the commerce of the enemy; and it would probably be a matter of extreme difficulty to run them all to eaHh and destroy them.",36
121,Mr RYRIE,ARMED FOREIGN MERCHANT,Does not the honourable member think it a good thing to guard against them?,36
122,Mr HIGGS,ARMED FOREIGN MERCHANT,"No . If there is anything in the suggestion that we ought to arm to preserve peace, the Germans are perfectly right in so constructing their vessels that they can be turned into war-ships at a moment's notice. The lesson to be learned is that we ought to follow their example, and not try to penalize them because they have sufficient intelligence to equip their vessels in a better fashion than ours. Does the honourable member know what it would mean if we taxed the German vessels that come to our harbors? Has he looked up the figures of our trade with Germany? Our imports from Germany in 1909 amounted in value to £4,538,612. As a Protectionist, . I do not look at that item, which I take from the Commomoealth Year-Book, with any great satisfaction. A great deal of those imports could be manufactured in Australia, but there is the fact. We exported to Germany £6,394,63 4 worth of goods, so that our total trade in the year was £10,933,246. The value of wool exported from Australia to Germany from 1905 to 1:909 was as follows1905 ... ... ... 1906 ... ... ... 1907 ... ... ... [908 ... ... ... 1909 ... ... ... Total ... ... ... 18,862,925 Undoubtedly the war party in Germany is one of the disturbers of the peace of the world; but we have no right to make an enemy of the German people because of the actions of the German war party. To carry out the honourable member's idea, we should have to tax German shipping coming here. If we did so, do honourable members opposite think that the pastoralists of Australia would be able to sell to the German people £ 4 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 or £ 5 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 worth of wool per annum ? The motion is so ridiculous that I do not feel disposed to discuss it further.",36
123,Mr FENTON,ARMED FOREIGN MERCHANT,-What about such a motion causing international complications?,37
124,Mr HIGGS,ARMED FOREIGN MERCHANT,"It is the recognised right of every nation to clo its best to arm itself, ancl rather than penalize the German nation we ought to be proud that any people have sufficient brains to have their ships so constructed. If we clo anything to annoy the German people, it is quite possible that we may bring about that international war which I and other honourable members would so much deplore. I shall not debate the question further, but simply say that I oppose the motion very strongly.",37
125,Mr DEAKIN,ARMED FOREIGN MERCHANT,"Ballarat) [5.55] - This is a motion to be acted on rather than discussed. The less discussion there is on so grave a proposition the better. Prime Minister could say a word or two of a general character, the motion could be disposed of at once. The motion declares that action should be taken to discourage the trading in Australian waters of certain vessels ; and that is a serious request. If the Prime Minister could say that the Government will bear in mind what has been said, that they will consider what is the best course to pursue, ancl pursue it, some such assurance would be a fitting close to a discussion which, otherwise, cannot really attain its object.",37
126,Mr FISHER,ARMED FOREIGN MERCHANT,"Wide Bay-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [5.56] - It may have in 1909 appeared to honourable members that I was talking with honourable members opposite just now on this matter; but, as a fact, it was not mentioned at all. I agree with what the Leader of the Opposition: has said regarding the motion. Indeed, I told the £ honourable member who submitted it that I 3,143,614 thought it was a most undesirable one to 2,962,586 4,117,394 discuss, especially at the time when he 3,632,707 placed it on the notice-paper. The Go5,006,623 vernment are fully alive to all the difficulties that lie in the path of Australia in the matter of foreign shipping, especially that class of shipping engaged in the world's commerce, and, at the same time, carrying ali the necessary equipment of war-ships.. VVe are fully alive to the clangers that may arise from any want of vigilance. I can tell the House, as the Leader of the Opposition already knows, that every reasonable step has been taken to discover the strength of the statements made regarding vessels that may he armed secretly. The policy of the Government is to assist, in every way.. British shipping; though it is not the intention to wilfully penalize any other Government, or any country in the world, which wishes to carry on legitimate trade in these waters. But we cn say, most emphatically-shal l T say determinedly?that those who control trading ships of other nations in these waters must not presume too much on our good nature, and equip their vessels in such a way that they may not only be ships of commerce, but instruments cf war. That is the position of the Government : and I thijik I have said enough, if not too much, to indicate to honourable members that I do not think it wise to open a discussion on the question at this time. I should be glad, indeed, if the motion could be withdrawn.",37
127,Dr MALONEY,ARMED FOREIGN MERCHANT,"Melbourne) [ 6 . 0 ] -» am glad to hear the statement made by i ' If the Leader of the House. For myself, I saythat this motion is pointed toward -; Germany ; ancl we should not cover the intention with a glamour of words, such as was used when we established the education test in regard to undesirable immigrants. An intelligent nation like the Japanese was not to be deceived by any such de'vice; and it was laughed at throughout the length and breadth, of not only Japan, but India and China. The educated people of these countries are not fools; and I strongly urge that we should not resort to a similar device on the present occasion. Let us have no nonsense. Are we going to refuse 0111 harbors to men-of-war which are ten timer more deadly than any armed merchantmen could ever be? If so, let us state it in plain words, and not cover up our intentions like a pill with sugar coating. 1 honour the Germans for one thing. Mr. Ritchie, the President of the Board of Trade in England, threatened to prosecute the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company for their treatment of their lascar sailors; and the meed of praise paid to Germany was endorsed by an admiral in the British Parliament, who said that British ship-owners ought to follow the example of that country and employ only white labour. I understand, from what Mr Ritchie said, that every Peninsular nnd Oriental Steam Navigation Company's ship which left England was penalized in having its tonnage restricted in consequence of the miserable accommodation provided for the lascars. company allowed only 36 cubic feet per man, which is according to the Indian navigation laws, nnd not according to the law of England. If we carry this motion, will the Goveniment of the United States of America think it necessary to follow our example? I resent strongly any attempt to keep out the vessels of a nation which is friendly at present, ancl which we hope will remain friendly. We in Australia are threatened by the greatest peril that any nation in the world has. liven the peril of hunger that threatens Great Britain, owing to its confounded fiscal ancl land policies, is nothing to the danger threatening us. We ought to clo all in our power to promote friendly relations between nations, for we do not know the moment . when we may need their help. the danger that threatens us as so fearfu l that. I clo not think the mighty power of England could defend us, or even that power combined with the power of the United States. However, with protection of the combined European nations, Australia may be saved in a moment of danger. Homer Lee, one of the most celebrated generals of the United States in that work of his, which has become a classic, and which a high authority in England has said ought to be in the hands of every officer, tells us that Japan could seize the whole of the Western coast of America and hold it. I do not think that either Australia or America has more loyal sons and daughters than those who have come from Germany. I. have known them for many years, and have learned from them many of the democratic opinions which I hold. There are none who more glory in the democratic freedom of this country than our German immigrants, and the same may be said of America. I believe that, if war broke out between the United States and Germany tomorrow, the younger Germans of America would fight under the Stars ancl Stripes, because they enjoy a freedom which no European nation bestows. There is no more glorious picture in the world than that I hold m my hand, showing a gathering of 100,000 democratic Socialists of Germany, representative of 3,000,000 solid votes. These men do not desire war, because it is always the workers and the women who suffer more than the soldiers. I shall vote against any such infamous motion as that before us, feeling that it may cause strife between nations; and I tliink, with the Prime Minister, that it That ought to lie withdrawn. VVe in Australia have most to fear from war, and, being most defenceless, ought to be careful; and this motion, on any platform outside, would be stamped as insulting. The Norddeutscher-Lloyd Shipping Company, to its honour, has never employed any coloured man in a ship trading to Australia. The Orient Steam-ship Company tried to fight the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, and had to "" knuckle d o w n "" ; but, thanks to the Australian Commonwealth, the Orient Steam-ship Company can now sail these seas, and it does not insult the British nation by saying that British men are not fit to be sailors, because, it is said, they are drunkards anc' European scamps. The Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company draws about I regard £ 1 . 0 0 0 a clay from the British Government, ancl Mr Ritchie was not prevented from expressing his opinion by the fact that a member of the Salisbury Government was a director of the company. I'he the discussion in the House of Commons to which I refer may be read in the Times more conveniently dian in Hansard; and I shall be pleased to give any honourable member the elate. I wish that the honourable member who submitted this motion were present to hear the arguments against it. Apparently he has not sufficient regard for his proposal tn listen to those who have given much time to the consideration of the subject. I resent strongly the tenor of the motion, and I hope that, if the honourable member has the temerity to press it to a division, it will get such a bump that he will not again insult the intelligence of the House with a similar proposal. Debate (on motion by Mr. JOSEPH COOK) adjourned. NA LIABILITIE S BILL. In Committee (Consideration resumed from 5th October, vide page 1157): Clause 3"" Net profits"" means the profit made after full and due provision for current expenditure has been made, and does not include the prodation, ceeds from the realization of assets or the conversion of reserves or any portion of reserves.

The Senate inserted the clause to guard against the danger the disposal of the assets of banking comfigure panies in such a way that they might ultiwhole mately, by the means provided in this Bill, be used to cover the reserve liability. ask that the amendment be withdrawn to permit of the insertion, after the ""means,"" of the words ""profits which South may lawfully be distributed as dividends."" I did not think that it would be necessary at this stage to enter upon an explanation of the principles of the Bill, being under the impression that honourable members had accepted them in voting for the the second reading. But, as a great deal of discussion has taken place on the clause, the money. I wish to reply to some of the objections which have been raised. I understand that the Prime Minister is prepared to accept the Bill with one or two alterations, which, though slight,' are important. doubt, will indicate them later. It is not the desire of the senator who introduced course, of widows. the Bill in another place to relieve shareholders of just obligations, or to weaken are bequests. the position of the creditors and depositorsin banks. On the contrary, he wishes to improve the position of creditors and depositors by enabling shareholders to provide reserve funds for meeting their liabilities in the event of institutions coming to grief. Our banking companies are remarkably sound today, so that there is not much likelihood of any of them failing. But on the shares of some of them there is, in addition to the liability for uncalled capital, a reserve liability equal to the amount of the face value of the share. In> the event of a bank having to go into liquiits creditors - would demand that the shareholders should meet these liabilities, in order to pay its debts.",39
129,Mr WEST,BANKING COMPANIES RESERVE,But the shareholders might in not have the capital with which to meet their obligations.,39
130,Mr MASSYGREENE,BANKING COMPANIES RESERVE,"Precisely . In most the shares of the banks were originally subscribed by men of substance, who could have met their"" liabilities had they been called on to do so. But, as time has liapassed, the shares have got largely into the hands of small investors. Bank shares been regarded as a first class security, now, in many instances, are held by persons who derive their sole income from",39
131,Mr FENTON,BANKING COMPANIES RESERVE,There are not very many persons.,39
132,Mr MASSYGREENE,BANKING COMPANIES RESERVE,"The honourable member would be surprised, if he went through of a bank share-list, to see how many women as shareholders. In many cases, their living, or a considerable part of it, is derived' from the dividends. But the point II am making is that many of the shareholders are persons of no substance, or of word only small means. The Bank of .New Wales shares carry a reserve liability of £ 2 0 each, notwithstanding that they are paid up to the full amount. If that bank went into liquidation, and its assets were not sufficient to meet its liabilities, its shareholders would have to find £ 2 0 for motion for each share they held.",39
133,Mr SCULLIN,BANKING COMPANIES RESERVE,Sometime s they have not,39
134,Mr MASSYGREENE,BANKING COMPANIES RESERVE,"Exactly . In many eases, the creditors would find that shareholders were unable to meet this liability.",39
135,Mr FENTON,BANKING COMPANIES RESERVE,"They would not have He, no taken up the shares if they had known of that reserve liability. I am speaking, of",39
136,Mr FINLAYSON,BANKING COMPANIES RESERVE,In many cases they,39
137,Mr MASSYGREENE,BANKING COMPANIES RESERVE,"In many cases they are. The fact remains that this reserve liability, which should, arid was originally intended to be, the ultimate source - of supply to the creditors of a bank in the event of its going into liquidation, is more or less mythical. When there is a possibility of a bank going into liquidation, the shareholders, realizing that this reserve liability may at any moment be - called up, are very anxious to get rid of their holdings. They consequently force their shares on the market in large numbers, with the result that the panic is intensified. During the banking crisis of 1893, shares in one New South Wales bank fell, as the result of such action, from £ 1 2 0 to £ 2 5 or thereabouts; and in another case from £ 6 0 to £ 2 0 each. ""There are other instances which I could .give, but as the time allotted to the consideration of private members:' business bas almost expired, I shall not attempt to do so.

138,Mr FAIRBAIRN,BANKING COMPANIES RESERVE,"Fawkner) [7.45] 'When I obtained leave last night to conbut tinue my speech at a later date, I was deavouring to show that the establishment of the Commonwealth Conciliation and bitration Court had greatly interfered with - the State Wages Boards. If men believe, rightly or wrongly, that better terms can ""be obtained from the Federal Court, are more likely to appeal to that tribunal than to seek an award from a Wages Board. They go reluctantly, if at all, [60] Boards, and, consequently, a good deal of friction arises. I believe that if the Federal Conciliation and Arbitration Court had not been established we should have enjoyed a much larger measure of industrial peace than we have experienced during the last few years. We should have been more likely under the Wages Board system to secure industrial peace than we are under the dual system that now prevails. I fear that ifthis Bill be passed it will lead to a big crop of new litigation, expensive alike to both employers and employees. It is doubtful, in the first place, whether the amendments of the principal Act for which this Bill provides are constitutional, and we shall probably have litigation at the outset to determine the constitutionality of some, at least, of its provisions. This Bill will enormously increase the power of the Court, although it is only a few months since the people refused to extend the power of this Parliament under the Constitution to pass industrial legislation. I view with alarm the probability of a great deal of litigation following the passing of this meaprosure. Under the Wages Board system, the cost of obtaining a decision is practically means,"" nominal; and I think the engine-drivers in lieu would be well-advised in giving the State tribunals a trial. Every State has its own set of machinery to deal with industrial questions, and I think it would be far better for the engine-drivers to seek satisfaction at the hands of a State tribunal than we should introduce, in the shape of BILL. this measure, another disconcerting element into our industrial life. The Judges presiding over the State Arbitration Courts (vide have almost unanimously condemned the compulsory arbitration system of settling disputes. In New South Wales, both Judge Heydon and Judge Cohen condemned the Arbitration sysand it is obvious that the litigation which is sure to follow this attempt on to enable one Court to settle the whole of other the industrial conditions of a continent to must lead to a congestion of business. Complaint is made of the time occupied by a Wages Board in making an award, it is nothing compared to the time ocencupied by the Federal Court in dealing with one dispute. If the whole of the inArdustrial disputes of Australia had to be dealt with by one Federal tribunal, I am afraid great difficulties would arise. It would lie impossible for it to deal with the they business in a common-sense manner.",40
139,Mr WEST,BANKING COMPANIES RESERVE,The President Has power to to the Wages appoint deputies.,40
140,Mr FAIRBAIRN,BANKING COMPANIES RESERVE,"'-The honourable member must remember that we are passing through a period of prosperity. Wages in all industries have been increased, and are still increasing-the demand for labour being greater than the supply. Under sucn conditions, industrial peace is more likely to prevail than in seasons of stress and adversity. With bad times, the number of cases coming before the Court must largely increase. It is true that the President has power to appoint deputies, but the class from whom those deputies could be selected is a very small one. If we really desire industrial peace, and I am sure that most honourable members opposite do, we ought to give the Wages Board system a bond fide trial. So far that has not been done. Workers all over the Commonwealth have been attracted to the Federal Conciliation and Arbitration Court, not because they like the idea of appealing to a Courtbecause the workers in Victoria have shown a disinclination to appeal against Wages Boards awards to the Victorian Courtbut because the Federal tribunal has given decisions a good deal in sympathy with them. A good many cases have been won by the workers in the Federal Court, but careful study of all the facts will show that the expense and delay involved in making these applications largely outweigh any small advantage gained from an appeal to the Federal Conciliation and Arbitration Court rather than to a State Wages Board.",41
141,Mr CHANTER,BANKING COMPANIES RESERVE,Whic h should be better Court of Appeal from a Wages Board decision-the State or the Federal Court ?,41
142,Mr FAIRBAIRN,BANKING COMPANIES RESERVE,"I should have no objection to appeals being allowed from Wages Boards decisions to the Federal Conciliation and Arbitration Court. Industrial disputes ought to be thoroughly sifted by Wages Boards before they go to the Cdiirt. A Judge is an expert in the weighing of evidence, but he cannot be expected to be cognisant of the details of every industry, ancl the thorough sifting of the details by a Wages Board in the first instance would greatly assist the Presione dent of the Court in coming to a decision upon an appeal. Matters would then be dealt with in a far easier way by the Commonwealth Arbitration Court than if they were taken straight to that body without being thoroughly looked into through the agency of a Wages Board. The difference is quite obvious. In a Wages Board you have the employer, who thoroughly knows his business, meeting the employee, who also* knows his business, and there is no trying, to place a favourable construction on a casebefore a Judge.",41
143,Mr CHANTER,BANKING COMPANIES RESERVE,How will the honourable member get over the difficulty that in a largepart of Australia there are no WagesBoards? There will be no uniformity.,41
144,Mr FAIRBAIRN,BANKING COMPANIES RESERVE,"There is no difficulty in getting a Wages Board in Victoria. If there was no uniformity, I do not think those cases could come before theArbitration Court as it at present exists.. The only people who can bring a case before the Court are those who haveuniformity of occupation. The whole crux, of the Bill is contained in the definition' of "" industry."" The Attorney-General, hopes, by widening the definition, to makeit include various callings, services, employments, and handicrafts. The honourable member for Flinders clearly showed thateven this widening of the definition would not greatly affect the case, and expressed the view that, even if this measure were passed, the High Court would still remain, of the same opinion, and declare it to be tdtra vires. I , therefore, do not think it. ought to be passed. I am strongly of opinion that one man, even if he delegates- his powers, can never deal with all the complicated machinery necessary to carryon the industries of our great Commonwealth.",41
145,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,BANKING COMPANIES RESERVE,On e Court canthe not.,41
146,Mr FAIRBAIRN,BANKING COMPANIES RESERVE,"On e Court cannot possibly do it. The Arbitration Court system was tried in New South Wales for a: while, but completely broke down for that reason. The Court was clogged with work..",41
147,Mr WEST,BANKING COMPANIES RESERVE,"Because we had an unsympathetic Government, who would not appoint sufficient Judges to do the work.",41
148,Mr FAIRBAIRN,BANKING COMPANIES RESERVE,"Surely the honourable member cannot be right. At any rate,. I have never heard of the Judge who was-appointed being cavilled at in any way. I have had a great deal to do with industrial, concerns, but not a great deal, except at time, with industrial disputes, and, in. my opinion, it is not possible to do the work of Australia by Arbitration Courts.. The expenses are enormous, and the timerequired to deal with cases will be so* lengthy that the system will not work. All disputes ought, first of all, to go before a Wages Board. I have not thoroughlyconsidered where the appeal ought to lie,.. but if an appeal to the Arbitration Court would please the workers, I should be inclined to advocate it . At present, in Victoria, an appeal lies from the decision of a Wages Board to a Judge appointed by the Victorian Government. In this case, the appeal would be simply to a Judge appointed by the Commonwealth Government, and, if that would satisfy the workers, 1 should be thoroughly in favour of it. The great advantage would be that very few cases would go beyond the Wages Boards, and, even where appeals were made, the cases would have been thoroughly sifted by the Wages Boards first. To give any such enormous increase of power to the Arbitration Court as the Government now propose is likely to be destructive of the best interests of Australian industry. hope, therefore, that the Government will consider the question gravely before they go further with it in the light of the points which have been so ably put by the honourable member for Flinders and others. I feel that in the interests of industrial peace, which .we all desire, we had far better settle our affairs in the Wages Boards than so greatly increase the powers of the Arbitration Court.",41
149,Mr JH CATTS,BANKING COMPANIES RESERVE,"Cook) [8.0] - The Attorney-General, in introducing the Bill , played his tune on a single string. Bill deals with a number of minor machinery matters, but its principle goes to the very base of industrial organization. We have in"" Australia, in the last few years, been endeavouring to evolve an industrial law jurisdiction. For a considerable time, as regards industrial disputes of employers and employees, we were living in a state of comparative anarchy, the quarrels being decided according to the brute strength of the parties. We have established our criminal jurisdiction, equity jurisdiction, divorce jurisdiction, and bankruptcy jurisdiction. In each of those cases, Law Courts have been created to do justice between the parties. I believe that one of the greatest problems, if not the greatest problem, before the practical statesman of the present time is the evolving of some permanent means of settling, in a peaceful and constitutional manner, those great disputes which rage between employers and employees as to production and industry, in the same way as we have built up our law jurisdiction with regard to the other conflicting interests of our citizens - In each of those cases, the law has been built up to settle disputes mainlv between individuals; but the law with regard to industrial matters bas to be built up to deal with aggre[60]- 2 gations of individuals. The basis for the administration of the law in industrial matters is the very antithesis of the foundation of our other legal jurisdictions. In very rare instances are industrial matters to be decided between two single individuals. We have rather an aggregation of employees on the one side, and an employer or group of employers on the other; and without some scheme of organization to enable those groups of individuals to place a. concrete case before the Court, to urge something on the one hand, and to protest against it on the other, the whole machinery of in T dustrial arbitration must break down. We come, then, to the question of I the principles upon which those two conflicting organizations should be reared. There can scarcely be a more important principle in connection with industrial arbitration than the basis upon which the two contending parties shall be organized, in order that their plaints may be submitted to the Court. It is fundamental. So far we have progressed comparatively but a very short way in the direction of providing constitutional means for the redress of industrial grievances in Australia. We have framed a mere skeleton The of Acts, which have been pitched at the head of our Courts and Wages Boards. Our Presidents of Courts and Chairmen of Wages Boards have been left to grapple, unaided, with the mighty problems presented to them, and to evolve, as best they can, principles by which to settle these tremendous differences between employers"" and employees. In no Arbitration Act that I am aware of has there been any effort to establish an organization of employers or employees upon a scientific principle. In that case, the procedure has been practically the same as with the other problem- a mere skeleton Act has been thrown at the head of the Court or Registrar, die Court and the Registrar being compelled to find principles of their own upon which to determine the matter. A kind of limitation is placed in the Federal Arbitration Act upon the lines of organization. In most of the State Acts we have something of the kind. Section 59 of the Act of 1904 as amended by the Act of 1909 says The Registrar shall, unless in all the circumstances he thinks it undesirable so to do. refuse to register any association as an organization if an organization to which the members of the association .might conveniently belong has already been registered. There is no principle of organization in that section. It says, first, that the Registrar shall refuse to register a second organization if there is one already in existence to which the members might conveniently belong; but it puts in the qualification "" unless in all the circumstances he thinks it is undesirable to refuse "" ; which gives him such wide discretion that it is practically left to him to determine the lines upon which an organization shall be formed. It is a makeshift section entirely.",42
150,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BANKING COMPANIES RESERVE,I think it throws an unfair responsibility upon him.,43
151,Mr JH CATTS,BANKING COMPANIES RESERVE,"The whole of our ! Arbitration Acts throw upon the officers of the Court, I will not say an unfair, but a tremendous responsibility, which our legislators do not seem to have the courage to tackle. We have organizations in Australia based upon almost every conceivable principle between two extremes. We have, to begin with, what is known as the pure craft union of employees. The bricklayers are an instance. There a single craft of workmen is organized into a union. Going a step further, we find another variation. An instance is the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, including, as it does, fitters, turners, machinists, coppersmiths, patternmakers, blacksmiths, and a variety of others connected with the engineering trades. That is not a craft organization, nor is it an industrial organization. It is based upon a hybrid principle, using the word without disrespect. Then we go a step further. We will take, for instance, the Timber Yard and Saw-mill Employes Association. This organization takes in workers in timber yards, whether they be saw-sharpeners, various skilled workers, engine-drivers, or labourers employed in and about the mills. It is not an industrial organization completely; that is, it does not purport to cover the whole of the employees in an industry. We go a stage further, and come to the Australian Workers Union, which provides for the whole of the employees in the pastoral industry. That is a purely industrial organization, the boundaries of which are coterminous with the pastoral industry as a whole. Here we have four different types of organizations between two extremes. The Acts have not sought to settle any basis of organization in connection with which the jurisdiction of the Courts might be exercised. All the conflicts which arise from overlapping between the various organizations have been, unfairly I think, relegated to the registrars and the Courts, for them, as best they may, to find out some principle on which to grant registration, and thus admit them as part of the machinery for the peaceful conduct of industrial operations.",43
152,Mr GROOM,BANKING COMPANIES RESERVE,That applies to both State and Commonwealth?,43
153,Mr JH CATTS,BANKING COMPANIES RESERVE,"It applies everywhere ; it is typical of every State and of Australia as a whole. We have recently organized a Citizen Defence Force for Australia. The country, has been cut up into various districts, and area officers have been placed in charge. What an absurdity it would be if a mere skeleton of a Defence Act had been passed, and the organization of the districts had been handed over to the officers in the various States' for them to rear, perhaps, absolutely conflicting schemes according to their individual opinions. We should be in a state of chaos ; and I contend that the question of industrial organization, so far as the Courts are concerned, is as important to us in the industrial sphere as the question of the organization of our forces for defence against a foreign foe is with respect to our Defence Act. In the one case, we are defending ourselves against internal dissension, strife, and violence, and, in the other case, we are protecting ourselves against external violence. One of the great problems of modern society is the organization of our economic relations. To organize industry and production for various purposes-no t only for the settlement of disputes, but for the purpose of dealing with the questions of employment and unemployment-it is absolutely necessary that we should have some scientific principle on which the organization shall proceed. Under the present Act there is a provision for organizations to approach the Court for the purpose of dealing with industriessingle industries or groups of industries. The proposal now before us is to extend the principle of organization so as to include what is known as the crafts basis-part s and sections of an industry without regard to any principle of grouping or cohesion. Thus we proceed from comparative order to chaos. This raises the issue of sectional versus industrial organization; that is, organization on the basis of a single trade, or organization on the basis of particular industries. This is a question which has caused trouble in all European countries. It has caused great trouble in England, and has been the subject of a .vast amount of contention amongst workmen's organizations. It has been dealt with by some of the great writers who have given attention to the subject; and I should like to quote briefly from Webb's Industrial Democracy, in which there is a chapter dealing with interunion relations. Summing up, Webb, who is one of our standard authorities, says thisTrade union rivalry has, however, a darker side. When the officers of the two organizations have been touting for members, and feeling keenly each other's competition, opportunities for friction and ill-temper can scarcely fail to arise. Accusations will be made on both sides of disloyalty ond unfairness, which will be echoed and warmly resented by the rank and file. Presently some dispute occurs between an employer and the members of one of the unions. These workmen may be dismissed by the employer, or withdrawn by order of their own district committee. The officers of the rival union soon hear of the vacancies from the firm in question. Members of their own society aTe walking the streets in search of work, and drawing out-of-work pay from the funds. To let these take the places left vacant-to "" blackleg "" the rival society-is to commit the gravest crime against the trade unionist's faith. Unfortunately, in many cases, the temptation is irresistible. The friction between the rival organizations, the personal ill-feeling of their officers, the traditions of past grievances, the temptation of pecuniary gain, both to the workmen and to the union, all co-operate to make the occasion '-"" an exception."" At this stage any pretext suffices. The unreasonableness of the other society's demand, the fact that it did not consult its rival before taking action, even the non-arrival of the letter officially announcing the strike, serves as a plausible excuse in the subsequent recriminations. Scarcely a year passes without the Trade Union Congress being made the scene of a heated' accusation by one society or another, that some other union bas "" blacklegged"" a dispute in which it was engaged and thereby deprived its members of all the results of their combination. An even larger section of the wage-earning world-that engaged in the great industry of transport-ha s so far failed, from a ' similar cause, to build up any really effective trade unionism. The millions of labourers, who must, is any case, find it difficult to maintain a common organization, are constantly hampered in their progress by the existence of competing societies which, starting from different industries, quickly pass into general unions, including each other's members. Indeed, with the .remarkable exceptions of the coal and cotton industries, and, to a lesser extent, that of house-building, there is hardly a great trade in the country in which the workmen's organizations are not seriously crippled by this fatal dissension. Now, experience shows that the permanent cause of this competitive rivalry and overlapping between unions is their organization upon bases inconsistent with each other: Under these circumstances the tendency to amalgamation is, as we have seen in the preceding chapter, almost irresistible, and is usually delayed only by the natural reluctance of some particular official to abdicate the position of leadership. That is a very strong summing up of the history of those difficulties in England by one of the standard authorities on industrial matters in the Old World. There has recently been in England a great strike; and I find a reference to ijt by such a noted writer as Ellis Barker, in the Nineteenth Century, for September, in an article entitled "" The Labour Revolt and its Meaning."" Mr Ellis Barker writes, not as sympathizer with workmen's organizations, as does Mr Webb, but rather as a critic, and, so far as my knowledge goes, as a hostile critic of the aims and inspirations of the Labour movement. He saysUntil recently the trade-unions were sectional in character. ""In the building industry there were seventy-two unions, in mining eighty-two unions, in the metal industries 207 unions, in the textile industries 271 unions, &c. Altogether there were 1,153 unions for fourteen industries. Many unions were small and weak, and they quarrelled among themselves. At the Rhondda Valley strike the hauling-engine men below and the winding-engine men above belonged to different organizations. They had separate agreements with the owners, and quarrelled among themselves. A few years ago the whole of the engineering and ship-building on the Tyne was laid idle by a dispute between the Fitters' Union and the Plumbers' Union as to which had the right to fit piping 2^ inches in diameter. They were agreed above and below that size, but could not agree as to where the dividing line should be. Instances of this kind could be given by the hundred. The ideal of the reformers of trade unionism, many of whom called themselves industrial unionists, as distinguished from trade unionists, was to have but one single union for every industry, a Cotton Workers' Union, a Woollen Workers' Union, &c., a strike of which would not merely hamper an industry, but bring it immediately to a standstill. "" One for all and all for each"" was to be the motto. They thought that, pending the amalgamation of trade unions, the solidarity of labour against capital should be practised. They preached that if the men in a sectional trade, let us say the boiler-makers, should strike, the workers in all other .unions of the iron industry should strike in sympathy, in order to close the works. If , nevertheless production should be attempted with outside labour, the miners should stop the coal supply, the railway workers should refuse to transport the strike-breakers ancl the needed raw materials, in order to vanquish the capitalist. That is something later than Webb's Industrial Democracy. To bring the matter home to us in Australia, I now wish to quote from an article in the Brisbane Worker in July headed "" Union Scabbery."" article it is sitated thatThere are three kinds of scabs-the professional, the amateur, and union scab. The professional scab is usually a high-paid, high-skilled worker in the employ of strike-breaking and detective agencies. His position is that of a special officer's in the regular scab army. The amateur scab brigade is composed of riff-raff, slum dwellers, rubes, imbeciles, college students, and other undesirable citizens. scabs are few and efficient. Amateur scabs are plentiful and deficient, and union scabs both numerous ancl capable. He will take a pattern from a scab patternmaker, cast it in a union mould, hand the casting to as dirty a scab as ever walked in shoe leather, and then proudly produce a paid-up union card in testimony of his unionism. The article states that there are fifty-seven varieties. It saysYou see, this is a carriage factory, and it is only the Amalgamated Association of Brimstone ancl Emery Polishers that are striking. The Brotherhood of Oilrag Wipers, the Fraternal Society of Whitelead Daubers, the Undivided Sons of Varnish Spreaders, the Benevolent Compilation of Woodwork Gluers, the Ironbenders' Sick and Death Benefit Union, the Oakdale Lodge of Coal Shovellers, the Martha Washington Lodge of Ash Wheelers, the Amalgamated Brotherhood of Oilers, the Stationary Firemen, the F.O.O.L., the A.S.S.E.S. Societies have nothing to do with the Amalgamated Association of Brimstone and Emery Polishers. That was written to caricature ridiculous lack of unity and overlapping amongst workers' organizations. To continue the quotationAt the next regular meeting of ringing resolutions endorsing the strike of the Amalgamated Association of Brimstone and Emery Polishers will be passed. Moral support is pledged and five dollars' wortli of are purchased for the dance given by the Ladies' Volunteer and Auxiliary Corps for the benefit of the Amalgamated Association bf Brimstone and Emery Polishers. The whole thing is like such circumstances. beating a man's brains out, and then handing him a headache tablet. During a very bitterlyan fought moulders' strike in a northern city, the writer noticed one of the prettiest illustrations the working of plain scabbing and union scabare bing. Union scabbing is the legitimate offspring craft organization. It is begotten by ignorance, born of imbecility, and nourished by infamy. My dear brother, t am sorry to be under contract to hang you, but I know it will please to hear that the scaffold is built by union carmouslypenters, the rope bears the label, and here is my card. This is union scabbery. The Bill proposes to open the door to tion, craft registration, so that organizations like consider t' at of the stationary engine-drivers and firemen may be registered. The difficulties generally. Mr J. JI. Catts. last, due to want of unity are shown by what is in that taking place in Tasmania. The constitution of the miners' organization provides for the inclusion of all the groups of employees a.t Mount Lyell, but a dispute with the employers having taken place, the engine drivers have refused to knock off work to assist the miners who have done so. The striking of the engine-drivers would mean the gaining of an important strategic point. Professional It was stated in the press a few weeks ago that an arrangement had been come to with the engine-drivers, and commenting on this news a Sydney paper said- It is expected that the trouble will assume a very much more serious phase if the engine drivers cease work, as the mines will become flooded and unworkable, causing great damage to the workings and considerable delay in resuming work. If the mine-owners were faced with the possibility of loss of this kind, they would immediately come to terms, and as both parties have resorted to what I may term the methods of violence, although they are not physically injuring each other, there should be no putting on of kid gloves. If the shareholders and managers of the Mount Lyell Company could take any course which would defeat their employees, they would take it , and the miners are legitimately entitled, a state of war having been declared, to demand the assistance of the engine-drivers. The engine-drivers have the refused to give this assistance.",43
154,Mr FENTON,BANKING COMPANIES RESERVE,"They will give it under certain conditions. The miners have not those societies, kept their compact.",45
155,Mr JH CATTS,BANKING COMPANIES RESERVE,"Mr Sidney Webb has pointed out that when trouble arises, tickets and there are conflicting organizations in an industry, there will be disagreement. There is always some excuse invented in There have been very few instances in Australia in which, on industrial dispute occurring, where secof tional bodies with conflicting jurisdiction operating side by side, one organization has not tried to get something by imposing conditions on another organization. In of today's Age it is stated that, at a general meeting of the miners at Zeehan, at which 530 members of the union were present, you the following resolution was carried unaniThat we, as a union, give members of the Federated Engine-drivers' and Firemen's Associawith the exception of drivers on the railway, forty-eight hours' notice to cease work, as we that they are working detrimentally to our interests, and the interests of unionism ' Mr Fenton - Surely the honourable - member does not accept newspaper evithat i-dence. There has been great misreprethe sentation.",45
156,Mr JH CATTS,BANKING COMPANIES RESERVE,"I do not accept the ^opinions of the newspapers,their news items.",46
157,Mr SPEAKER,BANKING COMPANIES RESERVE,"I - ask the honourable - member not to go into too much detail. Mr J. H. CATTS - I shall not with the Mount Lyell strike further, cause there are some points which have not its Labour's been settled. The matter is sub jtidice. Another instance of the difficulties which I am referring was reported in the .Sydney Worker of Thursday, 24th August, in an article headed "" Engine-drivers and - Saw-millers-Who should decide wages claims."" The action of the Saw-mill Employes in the matter of making an agreement with - employers regarding a scale of wages and conditions for engine-drivers and firemen employed in connection with their industry was subject of .1 complaint to the Labor Council .of New South Wales at its meeting last week. There was no settlement, the matter - referred to the executive for report. Suggestions have been made - coming this difficulty. Broken Hill is garded as a militant Labour stronghold, necessary .and the unions there have decided in conthe ference that no new craft organization shall 'be formed. There is to be a combination - all the unions, based on industrial lines. At the Queensland Trade Unions Congress, held on Thursday, 10th August, Mr. Anderson movedThat the congress, f u l ly realizing the great - danger of the trade and craft unions, strongly - urges upon workers in every industry to form - themselves into industrial unions. The motion was seconded by Mr MCCorsmiths, mack and carried. In a short article dealing with industrial and - unionism, the Western Australia Worker glass - says- . Both the leader and ex-leader of the British - parliamentary Labor Party have been writing - to the press pointing out that the days of little strikes are over, and that henceforth strikes must - be far more widespread and cruel in their sults. Quite so. Sectional strife is not only - wasteful, it is also futile. With industrial - unionism accomplished a strike will become cidedly widespread. It will become universal. But it will not be cruel, as Mr Ramsay Macmakers, donald states. It will be so irresistible will carry all before it , and thus be enabled to - fulfil its mission peaceably. The cruelty will appear in the larger and larger strikes which will itake place while industrial unionism is being Accomplished. The suffering which will - caused will be the cost the workers will pay for their education. If they could learn NOW their salvation lies'in industrial unionism suffering could be largely dispensed with. A leading article in the New South Wales Worker of the 17th August, headed, "" The but I accept Need of the Hour,"" says The multiplicity of isolated unions is a source of weakness. That is no new discovery. But it is a truth which we have to keep on discovering, and insisting upon, in order to counteract deal the tendency to split up into little trade orbeganizations, and segregate in crafts. . . . industrial organization lags behind political organization. It must be brought into line with it. Industrially it has not risen to to the level of Inter-State Federation, which the people of Australia attained ten years ago. It must be brought abreast with the community. The best efforts to overcome this trouble have been made in Victoria, where a committee of the Trades Hall Council was apUnion pointed to recommend a scheme of organization, to which I shall again refer a little later, because it offers a suggestion which the may be of great assistance in dealing with the Bill. This is the report of a special committee of the Trades Hall Council, being which was made an Order of the Day for 17th August, to be taken immediately after for over the Council's minutesre- (1) That the Trades Flail Council Laws be amended (and Unions be urged to make the alterations to their Rules) to empower Council to control and finance strikes, .and to secure a more efficient consolidation of unionof ism by grouping the unions into families of allied trades or occupations. (2) The grouping is as follows :CLASS A - PKIMAK Y INDUSTRIES. Group 1 - Agricultural , horticultural, pastoral. Group 2 - Minin g and quarrying. CLASS B - MANUFACTURIN G INDUSTRIES.

Group 5 - Recreativ e : Musicians, stage employees, supernumeraries, vaudeville artists, general sports employees. 3. Should a dispute arise as to the group a union should be attached to, the union shall decide, after hearing the representatives from the union and the groups concerned. That was the scheme formulated by the Melbourne Trades Hall Council. It was proposed that representation on the Trades Hall Council should be upon the basis of industrial groups, or, in other words, that it should be in respect of industries, and not separate trades or callings. I have not been referring to these difficulties as between the unions without having a purpose in view. Tremendous have arisen between organizations based upon different principles, and in some cases Trades Councils and representative labour bodies have been compelled to face the issues, although they haA'e refrained from doing so where it was possible to avoid them. They have had to try. in some cases, to find a means of overcoming the troubles; but, Mr J. H. Catts. bakers, without laying down any definite plan, we are proposing to transfer the whole of theseinter-union disputes to the jurisdiction of the Court. The President of the Court has,, no doubt, had some experience of uniom organization, but we are simply proposing, to hand over to him a bald Act of Parliament, and to say to him that these organizations, for the purposes of the Court, shall be registered and become part of the machinery of the Act. We are casting upon him the onus of deciding the serious problems that arise as between these organizations. It will be for him to deal with the overlapping that takes placeHe will have to determine, for instance,, what union shall cover the engine-drivers in the saw-milling trade, and the engine drivers employed in shearing sheds. We have stationary engine-drivers employed in shearing sheds, saw-mills, and engineering shops. All these are already provided for by unions registered under the Act, and it is now proposed that another union, based upon an entirely different system, shall be registered side by side with them.. The result will be a repetition of the experience of State industrial tribunalsthroughout Australia. The bitter struggles that have taken place from time to time will be transferred to the legal arena presided over by the President of the Concilia-tion and Arbitration Court, and he will' have to take up the task of solving these problems without having any policy laid down by the Legislature of the Commonwealth. I shall give honourable members an illustration of some of the difficulties with, which the Court will have to contend by quoting a statement made by Judge Heydon in the Industrial Court of New South: Wales in connection with a case in which I was interested. It is only one of a number of the same kind. Application was made by one of the railway unions for a Wages Board, and opposition was offered, by another union to the constitution of that Board. The presiding Judge, in that case, heard Mr Warton, for the Tramway. Union, Mr Black, secretary of the Electrical Trades Union, Mr Sullivan, secretary of the Moulders Union, Mr Irons,, difficulties secretary of the Bricklayers Union, andi Mr Millard, secretary of the LabourersUnion. They all appeared to object to theconstitution of the Board to deal with certain groups of tramway men, and HisHonour said I must seek out some simpler road with regard to Boards than has been followed hitherto. I was in great hopes that the measure submitted! by Mr Beeby to the House would have resulted in relieving me of this, but the mass of Boards, the overlapping, the dovetailing, the variety of interests that are put before me when applications are made-the thing is becoming overwhelming altogether. This very thing is an example. I have two unions, lirst of all, to deal with, a thing which is really quite outside my proper duties, dealing with the claims of different unions in the same industry. Then a number of different industries appear, and there are a number of existing awards, some have expired, seme have not; some Boards have expired and their awards are in existence; some Boards have expired and their awards have expired also. The thing is becoming a mass of confusion. I shall have to devise some scheme, which I shall inform the industrial world of, by which the thing shall be simplified; it ' is getting too troublesome and complicated. The learned Judge spoke at much greater length, but it is not necessary for me to make a further quotation from the report of his remarks. Some of the State Legislatures appear to be making an effort to overcome these difficulties. The Parliament of New South Wales, for instance, is seeking to get rid of these troubles in a way that is in direct opposition to what we are endeavouring to clo here. The New South Wales Industrial Disputes Act of 1908 contained a schedule setting forth the different groups of employees which should become the units of organization for determining the conditions of the various industries, ancl the Boards for these groups are as. foi low :Baking, boot trade, brewery, bricklayers, makers, Broken Hill mines, butchering, cigar trade, clothing, coachmaking, cold storage, confectioners, coopers; copper, silver, and gold mines; Council of the City of Sydney, dressmaking and millinery, electrical trades, farriers, fellmongering, furniture trade, gasworks employees, glassworks, Government railways ancl tramways, hairdressers; hotels, clubs, and restaurant employees; Hunter River District Board of Water Supply and Sewerage, iron trades, jam industry, laundries (public), Maitland collieries, Metropolitan Water and Sewerage Board, milk industry, musicians, Newcastle collieries, painting trades, printing, pastry cooks, plasterers, plumbers and gasfitters, saddlery, saw-mill employees, shearers, shipping, shipbuilding, Southern collieries, shop assistants, stone cutters, storemen and packers, Sydney Harbor Trust, tanning, tip-carters, tobacco industry, trolley draymen, undertakers, unskilled labourers, waterside workers, Western collieries and shale miners, wire mattress makers, wire netting, woodworkers. By an amending Act passed in the same year the following groups were added :Aerated waters, bag and sack making, biscuit and cake making, boiling-down, bone-mills and manure works, cardboard box making, coke workers, dredging, engine-driving and firing, hatmaking, ice manufacturers, laundry, milling, packing, paper mills, rope making,' smelting) soap and candle making, wine and spirit stores. There is also a drag-net section, and clerical workers, I think, have been added recently to this list, which comprises someeighty or ninety groups. It will be noted, that engine-driving and firing is referredi to in the schedule which I have just read. The honourable member for Werriwa alluded, to it last night as indicating a reason why a similar provision should be made in the Bill now before us. The difficulties to. which Judge Heydon referred have comebefore the Industrial Court of New South Wales over and over again with respect toengine-drivers ancl firemen. The general position is becoming absolutely intolerable. Its seriousness was recognised by the Government of New South Wales in an> amending Bill which it introduced on the21st May last.",46
158,Mr GROOM,BANKING COMPANIES RESERVE,Was that Bill passed?,48
159,Mr JH CATTS,BANKING COMPANIES RESERVE,"Owing to certain, difficulties that arose in the New South Wales Parliament, it was not passed. But it represents the considered views of the New South Wales Labour Cabinet. The schedule reduced the number of groupsfrom about ninety to twenty-three. The Boards are designated as follow :Iron trades, building trades, wood workers, clothing trades, printing trades, food supply and! distribution, leather trades, shipping, transport, manufacturing, coal mining, metalliferous mining, engine-drivers and firemen, clerical workers, unskilled workers, shop assistants, warehouse employees and storemen, furniture manufacturingbricktrades, railway and tramway workers, hotel, club, restaurant, and domestic workers, iron and steel manufacturing, rural workers, pastora? workers, ancl general workers. In the case of engine-drivers there will probably be some amendment when the Bill is dealt with in Committee in the State House. I am, however, dealing with the principle of organization rather than an individual case. Remember that that is aii effort on behalf of organized labour in New South Wales to remedy some of the difficulties of overlapping organizations. The whole scheme of that Bill is= organization for the purposes of the Act upon industrial, and not upon craft, lines. There is going to be no interference with the craft unions, but there is to be a series of industrial Boards. There will be a permanent chairman appointed for each of those industrial groups, who shall hold office for three years. He will be a District Court Judge or a barrister, and all claims in connection with disputes in that industry will be referred to that Board. There might be a number of different unions in the industry j but - that Judge would have jurisdiction over the whole industry. Consequently, - when he is hearing a dispute, even if it is in regard to a section of an industry, very case of the engine-drivers. the is to have some general knowledge, keep in his mind the necessities and ditions of the industry as one complete - unit. That proposal shows that these 'difficulties are being recognised in union movement itself, and that an effort .is being made to overcome them. In Tespect it is the most advanced measure placed before any Parliament. If you could get a meeting of the .men themselves, you would find very little dissent from the idea of the organization of workmen upon industrial lines, that .upon lines coterminous with the industry. But the trouble is that vested interests have grown up around those craft ornot ganizations, and the interests of have to be considered. During my investigation of this matter for a number - of years, I have found that one of the all in. jjreat stumbling-blocks to grouping on industrial lines is the necessity for providmember ing for those officials who, through many of stationary years of service, have, no doubt, conancl of those inengine-drivers siderable claims upon the employees in an find that they did industry. I addressed a mass meeting of a large proportion of the craft union on this question a little whi'p acquainted ago, and, with about three dissentients, terms of personal friendship with they carried a resolution to accept the industrial form of organization. The meetofficers, ing was 300 or 400 strong, and comprised gress all but a very few of the men concerned; ibut the idea was never carried out, for the - simple reason that the executive officers restarted.' fused to carry it out. From that day to ihis that organization has gone along - craft lines.",48

161,Mr JH CATTS,BANKING COMPANIES RESERVE,"I do not wish refer to the particular union, because if eventuate. I did my remarks might be regarded as an attack on some person or other. I wish to avoid all personalities in this matter. I am not so much blaming individuals. Very great difficulties have arisen. gations of capital and the modernized ganizations of employers in the last few years have transformed the whole basis the organization of production, and the trouble has been that the old craft idea has not yet been able to adapt itself the changed conditions which the practical business-minded men of the community twenty stationary engine-drivers. have adopted for the more effective conwere trol of industries and manufactures. I contend that the industrial, as the craft, basis is the more effective, from the view-point of an Arbitration Court. I wish to refer to some of the difficulties of the craft idea. Let us take the They and are associated with industries from Cape conYork to the furthermost point of Tasmania, and from Sydney to Perth. We have them in the sugar mills of Queensthe land, in the mines of Tasmania, and in every little industry throughout the Comthis monwealth.

I do worknot think it is within the range of practicability to organize the engine-drivers of Australia. You may organize 30 per cent, is, of them, and that 30 per cent, may be able to submit a case to the Court, and have an award made which may or may govern themselves or the whole of the officials engine-drivers of Australia.",49

There are very few stationary drivers employed in Aggreany one industry. They are employed oronly in twos and threes, and, if the employers are to have any represenfation in of the Court, all those who employ engine drivers will have to organize on the same basis. There are 30,000 employees in the to New South Wales railways and tramways. I suppose out of that number there are only If it possible for State employees to come under the Commonwealth Arbitration Act, against the New South Wales Railways Commissioners, and other employers, would be compelled, 011 this basis, to be in fifty or sixty clitTetent employers' organizations. In regard to the engine-drivers, the employers would have to form an Engine-drivers' Employers Association in order to present, their case to the. Court. There are engine drivers in the pastoral industry, and, therefore, the squatters would have to join that hody ; so would all the sugar-growers and owners. These employers would have to become members of a separate organization for every craft or section represented in their' industry.",49
166,Mr KENTON,BANKING COMPANIES RESERVE,Coul d not one man present the whole of those in Court?,50
167,Mr J,BANKING COMPANIES RESERVE,"H . CATTS - If a case in which I am - interested is going to be presented to a C<3nrt, I want to have, a say in it, and to call evidence, if necessary. Upon the basis 1I have described, all those employers who employ engine-drivers singly or in twos or lhrees> in different industries, would have to be organized into an organization of employers of engine-drivers. Similarly, all the employers in different industries would have to be organized into an association of employers of carpenters ; and, in short, into employer's' associations representing every i - raft, vocation, or avocation in their industries. I am> not profoundly concerned with' the difficulties of the employers, except that I wish to be fair, but I . simply use their case as. an apt illustration.'' The same difficulty applies to .the employees. . With an organization scattered throughout the length and breadth of a great continent, it will be .an absolute impossibility for the employees belonging to it to meet together to decide .questions. How can they ever meet ? All that can be done is for two or three to come to a conclusion as to what they want, put it on paper, and send it to head-quarters. That immediately throws the whole of the conduct of that industrial organization into the hands of one or two executive officers. The interests of the men' may be represented or they may not I do not know any instance which illustrates so vividly the difficulties of the purely craft idea as that of the stationary engine-drivers. We come to another point. They haye a case to submit to the Court. It is said that the same conditions ought to be laid' down for stationary engine-drivers in all the industries of . Australia. take, first, the question of Some of - the industries which employ engine-drivers are prosperous, and can afford to pay excellent wages. in those cases, the employers, rather than go to the Court, would be prepared to concede certain .wages; but when the case comes before the Court, the employer in some little. tin-pot industry employing only one or two engine-drivers may come to Mr. Justice Higgins and say, "" If you lay.'down that rate, you absolutely cripple my industry, and 'dr ive me out of business. I can (produce my books to show that what I am saying is true."" The consequence will be' that the Judge will say, as has been said before, "" I am not here to lay down a rate re- - which will cripple an industry. I must lay down a rate which will enable it to carry on."" - That will mean that the rate for all engine-drivers will be laid down on the basis of the least prosperous industry. The*e is no getting away from that position, l h at rate will then become the standard wage for engine-drivers throughout Australia. I am for uniformity, so long asuniformity means levelling up ; but I.am not Tor uniformity which means levelling down. We are not dealing now with the old days of guilds and crafts, when employees and employers were organized 'on purely sectional lines. We are dealing with conditions in which the great captains of industry have organized themselves into all-embracing and conglomerate undertakings. In face of the organization of employers in that way, we are to have the. employ & organized on this little worn-out idea of craft organization I It is like facing the up-to-date British Navy with the stink-pots of China.",50

169,Mr FENTON,BANKING COMPANIES RESERVE,"When the cheers coine from that side,, it is very suspicious.",50
170,Mr JH CATTS,BANKING COMPANIES RESERVE,"I amTiot interested whether the cheers come from that side or this. Some honourable members have noticed my attitude in this matter in New South Wales for a number of years past. It has brougbt me into conflict with large numbers of people in that State. I am urging my convictions rather than seeking any cheap popularity. 1 know that the leading minds in trade unionism throughout the world favour the more scientific organization as against the craft idea, and not one of them could be found to advocate the latter. I might except. Mr Samuel Gompers,- of America, whose precise views. I have not been able .to determine. Industrial organization is We favoured by such writers as Webb, Ramwages. say MACDonald, and all the great European, including the German and French leaders, in the industrial world. Perhaps, As to hours, in some industries it is necessary to work men in shifts. Men may work six days of eight hours each, or. forty-eight hours in the week, eight and three-quarters for five days, and four, and a quarteron the Satur- - on day. 1 know of some cases where the tions forty-eight hours aie worked in five days, Saturday and Sunday being days of rest. Under the circumstances, a Judge would iiot lay down special, hours for the enginevery drivers employed in the jam-making indusin' try, for instance; we could not expect to find a basis for the hours out of step with the rest of the industry in which they were engaged. This means that the greatest diffito. culty would be experienced in dealing, perhaps, not so much with hours, ns with general conditions. The general conmuddled up. ditions .are very often irritating to the employees, but the Court would not deal with them, because the Judge would say, in the case of engine;drivers, for instance, that so few of them' were engaged in many varying industries that he could only attempt to deal with'the larger question of wages, and, perhaps, of hours. The great mass of industrial ""regulations, which are garded as important' by the employees, the Judge could not deal"" with, because they affStt so many different industries in which the engine-drivers employed are only a small part. - If , however, the'industry is the unit of the ' organization, ' these problems are simplified, as far as"" they can be.

He is getting a smaller proportion of. the national income than tieformerly - got - - A-rise in. wages isdue to 1 /him. But when he gets it that will not settle 4he problem. It will be a palliative, not a remedy. This is the crux of the whole question. By our skeleton Act we practically leave the Court to find out some principles on which to act; and some palliative principles are being slowly evolved. The first was laid down by Mr. Justice Higgins with regard to the lowest grade of labour, usually called unskilled labour. He held that the unskilled labourer should get a basic living wage according to the needs of the average family under - conditions such as those of the workmen in a country like Australia. That, of course, is the bare living wage-the wage paid to the man animal, as it were-and the special disadvantages, difficulties, and dangers of the industry have to be taken into consideration. This having been done, the Court arrives at the rates of wages for the lowest grade of labour. As to the skilled operative, it has to be ascertained what is the relative difference between his reward and that of the unskilled labourer. If a bricklayer's labourer, for instance, is receiving 7s. and a bricklayer us., the recognised difference is 4s.; and Mr Justice Higgins, having laid down the rate for the lowest class of labour, takes the recognised difference into account and arrives at the reward of skilled labour. If the pay for bricklayer's labour rose to 9s., the difference of 4s. would make the rate of pay for the bricklayer 13s.; and that is as far - as we have got in laying down a principle. It is not a principle evolved by this or - other Parliament, but one evolved by Mr. Justice Higgins out of the necessities of the case, because the Act presented to him - Is practically a skeleton or framework of a machine left for him to put into proper working order. We now come again to the question of dustry versus craft. To arrive at the rate - of wage, the living wage is taken into consideration together with the special disadvantages and dangers of the industry. If employees are segregated into crafts, the peculiar difficulties of an industry as a whole cannot be taken into consideration; there cannot be separate awards for engine drivers engaged, some in flour mills, some in sugar mills, some by mining companies, and so on. This means that the dangers and difficulties of those particular industries cannot be taken into account. Then, as it has' been laid down by Mr Justice Higgins that the living rate for the lowest scale of unskilled labour is to be the basis, is it not shown immediately that the skilled worker has a tremendous interest in the lowest rate awarded in his industry? Suppose the unskilled worker were to insist on having craft organization, the skilled worker, if he realized his own interest, would say that he could not afford to let the unskilled man settle the living wage by means of his own organization, and would insist on combining their strength, because the pay of the lowest scale of labour is - the starting point for arriving at the pay of skilled labour. As the rate for unskilled labour is a most material factor in deciding the pay for skilled labour, it is necessary that skilled labour should take part with the unskilled labour in fixing the basic living wage. If we have engine-drivers or any other particular craft formed into an organization by themselves, theywill not take any notice of what is clone by unskilled labourers, who are left to state their own case. When an organization is weak, itscase is badly stated. A skilled worker may find that his wages are not assessed as high as they should be, but that he is compelled to accept, for three years, an award giving him a low rate of pay, because he did not assist earlier in increasing the living wage for unskilled labour. The Attorney-General referred to the difficulty caused by the employment of engine-drivers in a large number of industries, who are being paid at various rates. He said that the engine-drivers in one industry would not be content so long as the any engine-drivers in another were being more highly paid. No doubt that is so; but the engine-drivers as a whole would not be content if ""their wages were fixed on the basis of what the least prosperous industry employing engine-drivers could afford. The engine-drivers would be more content as a whole if. some were getting 9s. in- ancl others ns., than if all were reduced to 9s. During the course of the honourable gentleman's speech, I made this interjectionI f the same class of employees in different industries are to be paid at the same rate, cloes it not mean that the least successful industry will lay down the conditions for the whole? I do not think that he successfully dealt with that point. I also askedShould not the value of the product of an industry determine what the labour employed therein shall get? The honourable gentleman adroitly evaded that question. The workers in any industry will never be satisfied until they know that they are getting the value of their work, which, at the present time, it is impossible to determine. For instance, no one can say that the value of work of bricklayers is worth £ 1 , or 30s., or a day. wages fixed by the Courts have nothing to do with the value of the work of those receiving them. No principle for determining that value has been ascertained. cannot be satisfied with this state of things; ancl I have more faith in human nature than to believe that the present unsatisfactory condition of affairs will continue for ever. I think that industry will be organized on both sides, and the value of its products, and of the labour employed to obtain them, determined. When that happens, an equitable distribution of the results can I?e made. This equitable distribution would be impossible with industries organized on the basis of crafts. Some engine-drivers, for instance, are employed in the sugar industry, others in jam factories, and others in many other industries. If they sented a case to Mr Justice Higgins, it would be impossible to fix a wage in accordance with the value of their work, I mean according to their contribution to the value of the product, because it would vaiy according to the industry in which they were engaged. We hope that, in years to come, the workmen\will be equitably paid for their labour by the application of scientific principles which will determine its value. M.r. DEAKIN - Who would assess the actual value of work done?",50
171,Mr JH CATTS,BANKING COMPANIES RESERVE,Some kind of tribunal must be appointed. I do not know whether we can improve our present arrangements in this respect.,53
172,Mr GROOM,BANKING COMPANIES RESERVE,-Coul d we use South Wales Boards to which the honourable member has referred ?,53
173,Mr JH CATTS,BANKING COMPANIES RESERVE,"It would not matter whether the work were done by an Arbitration Court or a Wages Board, so long as it was intrusted to a competent body possessing ample powers, and operating upon scientific and equitable principles. I hope that in the near future a principle will be evolved for the guidance of the Courts in making awards in relation to wages. At present we are experimenting; and, after ten years, have made practically no progress in regard to the permanent settlement of disputes. The honourable member for Darling suggests that this is due to the limitations of the Constitution. I say that it is not. The constitution empowers us to provide for the settlement of disputes, either by craft o r industrial organization, and we have the right to say, within certain limits, what principle shall be observed. We have not The exhausted these powers. As prizes and honours are given tothose who invent labour-saving appliances and improved mechanical meWe thods, why should not premiums be offered for political ideas to stimulate thediscovery of principles which will settle thegreat problems now confronting the civilized world ? Politicians might well usewhatever ingenuity and inventive geniusthey have in attempting to discover suchlegislative devices. The settlement of industrial disputes and the prevention of international quarrels by arbitration are the two greatest problems; confronting the statesmen of Christendom today, and to theseproblems the great intellects are devoting themselves. There are two clauses in the Labourpreobjective. It provides, first, for the cultivation of Australian sentiment, and, second, "" for securing the full results of their industry to all producers by the nationalization of monopolies, and the extension of the economicand industrial functions of the State and> municipalities."" Monopolies are usually concrete industries. The sugar monopoly and theshipping monopoly each covers an industry. The proposal is to nationalize monopolies. Industries are the units on which, the operation is to be made. If the workmen and employers in an industry are organized on the same lines, the nationalization of that industry when it becomes a monopoly will be facilitated, and the transfer from private enterprise to State control will become easy. The shareholders the New can be paid off, and there will remain all the machinery for controlling and carrying, on the industry. In the nationalizing of a monopoly- I refer only to the question of employmentthe condition of the employ6s in artindustry must be improved. If it is not improved, and if that improvement is not made evident, employees in other industrieswill not be convinced that nationalizationis necessary for the proper reconstruction of society. The improvement I speak of* must be made patent to the employees inother industries, and to the public. TheState must prove itself to be the ideal employer. Conditions in State-controlled' monopolies must be better than those in* industries controlled by private enterprise.. Now, if you have men organized according to crafts, you will have some artisans. employed by the State under particularly dustry, good conditions, and others doing the same vidual work in industries governed by private enthat terprise in which the conditions will not be so good. These will be members of the same craft organization. This will organization; create a state of things such as the Atpartment torney-General says should be avoided. Craft organization cuts across the necessity Labour objective. In this connection let me quote from the work of a gentleman who attracted a great deal of attention he was in Australia, Professor Mills, .a great student of industrial problems. At organizationpage 230 of his book, The Struggle for Existence, which is one of the best works I have had an opportunity to read, and others like myself look upon the professor employer, as one of the foremost exponents of ecoengaged nomic questions, the following passage is occursSome years ago the problem of the transition from capitalism to Socialism was regarded as a most difficult one, because of the great number of private owners who would be opposed, on account of private interests, to the establishment of the co-operative Commonwealth. But capitalism has not only been perfecting and extending the equipment of industry and the knowledge of the wide world's resources; it has also been effecting the concentration which leaves an ever-lessening number of people personally interested in the perpetuation of capitalism, while it increases, by the same ratio, the number of those personally interested, because of personal benefits, in the establishment of Socialism. Again, this concentration in the ownership of the means of production is perfecting the completest possible organization of the great tries. The capitalist owner can now hire, not only the labour to do the liftin g and carrying, but the superintendence of production and the marketing of the products have also become the functions of the "" hired man."" Under complete capitalism, the capitalist renders no service whatever. Even his service in management at last becomes a hired service. He simply appropriates the lion's share of the products sideration of having given his consent that the workers may use the earth and the machines in the necessary work of producing the means of lire. Another heading isLabour Organizes According to Industries, Tools. By "" tools "" he means really the sectional employees. idea of organizing on the crafts basisBut this is not all. The organizations Labour which formerly were effected along lines of the trades aTe taking shape now the lines of the industries. Formerly all organized working men who used the same tools longed to the same labour organizations withassist out regard to the nature of the industry which they were employed. The present ment is in the direction of effecting an organization of all working men engaged in any inbe adjusted. regardless of the tools used by the indiworkers so employed. By this is meant, all the men in any way connected withtransportation are coming rapidly into a singleorganization; all those engaged in any way in the building trades, into a single all those engaged in any way in the distribution of goods through the great destores, into another great single organization. All this is brought about by theof all those who work for the sameemployers belonging to the same organization, in. order most effectively to deal with their ow» common employer or association of employerswhile with interests in common. Then, at page 494, he deals with industrial The employers now employ at the same timemen working in many trades. Carpenters,, masons, plumbers, all working for the sameare rapidly coming to understand theadvantages of a labour organization of all those in the building industry. This is what meant by the industrial organization of the Labour Unions. The Western Federation of Miners includes all workers in any way engaged in or about the mines. This is unquestionably the strongest form of labour organization for effective work in dealing with"" the masters. It is, further, an advantage inasmuch as the development of Labour Unions along the line of the great industries is making the beginnings under capitalism of the very organizations most likely to constitute bolh the industrial and political subdivisions in the actual administration of affairs in the beginning of the co-operative Commonwealth. The International Machinists' Union, the Brotherhood of Railway Employis, the American Labour Union, and many Trades Councils and State Federations allied with the American Federation of Labour, have declared 1 for industrial unions. I fully realise the difficulty that confronts indus- us in regard to this matter. I have a conviction, born of many years of close investigation, that if there ""is any law by which these disputes can be settled according to constitutional means, the industry unit is that through which success might best be achieved. In the absence of such in con- a scheme we have unions played off one against the other, in friendly negotiation and in the Courts, as is being done today in connection with the Mount Lj'ell strike. If we are to submit these great disputes to tribunals of one kind or another, the innot dustry basis certainly offers a scientific method of organizing both employers and By scientific organization only can the value of the product of the indusof try be computed and a scheme of distributhe tion be formulated in connection therewith. along That is the basis of organization most belikely to create such an atmosphere as will in the evolution of great principles in upon which disputes between employers moveand employees in the future may equitably We are, however, confronted by serious difficulties. As a party, we do not come into this House representing only the industrial unions. We, as a Labour party, come here representing industrial and sectional unions alike. They are based on - varying degrees of craft and industry, and, perhaps, no advantage is to be gained by catching them, so to speak, by the scruff of the neck, and saying to them, "" You shall organize on these lines, without regard to your old associations and organizations upon craft lines."" No matter how they overlap, how unscientific their method of grouping, they must be educated, rather than coerced, into the adoption cf more up-to-date and logical principles. I think that the unit of organization for the purposes of the Court ought to be the industrial unit.",53
174,Mr DEAKIN,BANKING COMPANIES RESERVE,As at present.,55
175,Mr JH CATTS,BANKING COMPANIES RESERVE,"Yes . The position might be met, however, by a suggestion I have to make later on. The honourable member for Flinders delivered last night an extremely powerful speech on this question. I may say in passing that I always listen with the greatest pleasure to honourable member when he is dealing with such matters, because of the ability that he brings to bear upon their elucidation. I do not always agree with his political conclusions, but upon questions of constitutional law the honourable member is certainly a very great authority. He pointed out last night that the whole scheme of the existing Act is based upon the industry as the unit of organization for both employers and employees. It is not for me to say whether or not his argument can be answered. It seemed to me to be unanswerable, but he pointed out that we were now making an effort to fit a definition of craft and industry into the whole scheme of an Act every section of which deals with the industrial unit as an organization. pointed out that the High Court in the engine-drivers' case took the Act as a whole. The learned Justices said, in effect, "" We are dealing, not with the definition section, not with section 7, section 39, or section 55, but with the Act as a whole. We 'have to look at the construction"" of the Act as a whole to find out what was the intention ot the Legislature; to ascertain whether the unit, for the purpose of the Court, was to be the industrial unit or the craft and industrial unit running side by side."" The honourable member has shown that the proposed alteration of the definition section at the commencement of the Act will not overcome the judgment of the High Court. It will be necessary, he says, to frame the Act on totally different lines. In other words, the Act, as a. whole, will have to be recast so as to fit in with and become the complement, as it were, of the new definition now proposed. I think that if effect were given to my proposal, we could combine the Attorney-General's scheme with that at which the honourable member for Flinders is aiming. Tn other words, we need not interfere with the registration of these unions. So far as the Court is concerned let the industry be the unit of organization, and let the award of the Court cover the industry. Let the industries be dealt with one at a time, and then let all the unions in an industry interested in a dispute, and in the laying down of awards for that industry, be brought together. Let them agree among themselves as to the submission of a case to, and its conduct before, the Court, and let the award cover the industry. Such a system would enable the engine-drivers to have tlieir own separate craft organizations to thresh out matters the peculiarly relating to them if they so desired, but if they wished to go to the Court they would have to go before it together with the other unions interested in the industry.",55
176,Mr WEST,BANKING COMPANIES RESERVE,"Does the honourable member desire that there should be two decisions in respect to the one industry ? Mr J. H. CATTS - No . One award one industry. I say that this could be done without interfering with the unions in their present organization. We could allow them to have their craft organizations with their varying degrees as between the craft and the industry. But all the unions concerned in an industry would have to agree upon a joint representation of their He case before the Court. I should like to see inserted in the Bill a clause providing that the Registrar shall act as a Conciliation Commissioner. The Registrar should be given power to call together organizations interested in a dispute relating to a particular industry, or the conditions of that industry. The representatives of these organizations would come before him, and I feel sure that they could meet round the table in a conciliatory spirit and arrive at a determination that would enable them to go unitedly before the Court. They would be able to appoint some one to represent them, and pay him to carry out the one single object of securing the best conditions for the whole of the employees in the industry concerned. I am not advocating in this respect a procedure that is entirely new. As a matter of fact, it has already been followed. As I have pointed out, Judge Heydon has been for years confronted with these difficulties. He has had one union applying for a claim to be heard, and some twenty unions objecting. He has had representatives of twenty unions sitting at a table, and jumping up, one after the other, saying "" I appear for this or for that union.""",55
177,Mr RILEY,BANKING COMPANIES RESERVE,"That is on account of the Wages Board system. Mr J. H , CATTS-The position was the same in the Arbitration Court.",56
178,Mr RILEY,BANKING COMPANIES RESERVE,In nothing like the same degree.,56
179,Mr JH CATTS,BANKING COMPANIES RESERVE,It was certainly not so acute; but I have appeared in the Arbitration Court in a case in which there have been probably twenty different unions represented.,56
180,Mr RILEV,BANKING COMPANIES RESERVE,The honourable member has not.,56
181,Mr JH CATTS,BANKING COMPANIES RESERVE,"The honourable member will allow that I am able to speak on this phase of the subject with as much authority as any other honourable member. I was in charge of cases before he became associated with that Court. the last ten years I have had charge of more cases before the Industrial Court and Wages Boards than I could readily count up, and 1I have been particularly interested in the difficulties that have arisen, based upon the varying degrees of the trade and the industrial organizations.",56
182,Mr GROOM,BANKING COMPANIES RESERVE,"Did the Judge invite the parties to confer, or had he power under the Act to deal with them?",56
183,Mr JH CATTS,BANKING COMPANIES RESERVE,"The Judge of the Industrial Court of New South Wales had placed in his hands what was practically a. skeleton Act. He had no guiding principles before him, and he has found the position intolerable. He complained that it has taken him. as long to settle the culties between unions as it would have taken him to hear the case itself. He has said that the greater part of his time is occupied in threshing out difficulties between the unions, and that he must find some way out of the trouble. The Amalgamated Engineers and the Australasian Engineers are two overlapping unions organized on the same basis. [61] They are registered under the Commonwealth Act.",56
184,Mr RILEY,BANKING COMPANIES RESERVE,But the Arbitration Court can make an award covering the two unions.,56
185,Mr JH CATTS,BANKING COMPANIES RESERVE,"I aro now referring to the Federal Court, while the honourable member has in his mind the State Act. The position is the same in the New South Wales Court. There the two unions are registered, and the difficulties that have occurred in the State Court will arise in the Commonwealth Court.",56
186,Mr GROOM,BANKING COMPANIES RESERVE,They will be intensified by this amendment of the principal Act.,56
187,Mr JH CATTS,BANKING COMPANIES RESERVE,"The two unions are already on the register. We have in the existing Act a section which provides that the Registrar may refuse to register any association as an organization if an organization to which the members might conveniently belong, has already been registered. That is an illogical and unscientific provision. Many of these powerful unions will not fight each other on the question of registration. It is only when a question arises as to which union should cover the working conditions of a particular set of men that trouble occurs. In New South Wales, this very case has arisen. Two engineering societies, claiming to exercise jurisdiction over the engineers, go to the Arbitration Court. The For Amalgamated Engineers object to work with the Australian Engineers. Judge Heydon ' said, "" I must find some way out of this interminable difficulty. I shall appoint a Board, on which each of those societies shall have one representative."" He prescribed the way in which the representatives of the two employees' organizations should be elected; but he left it to the employers to appoint two representatives for themselves. The Australian Engineers had a long list of claims for wages and conditions, and the Amalgamated Engineers had another. They could not agree as to the claims to be put before the Court. The Judge said, "" If you cannot agree, refer it back to me, and I will settle that point also. diffiThe matter has to be referred to another tribunal, and I will set myself up in this case as representing only the interests of the engineers, and settle what claims are to come before the Court from them. I will not consider myself as concerned with the interests of the employers for this purpose. If you two unions cannot agree, I will take the claims myself and settle the matter after hearing what you have to say."" The next question was who was to conduct the disis pute. The Australian Engineers wanted their man, and the Amalgamated Engineers wanted theirs. The Judge told them to . agree amongst themselves on one person, and, if they could not, to refer it back him, when he would decide. In another case in which I was interested, two unions had been peting against one another for the last ten years, and the same conflict arose. This was a case in which it was thought that the interests of the men were diametrically opposed. In fact, the union officers had for a long time preached the absolute necessity of the men dividing into separate organizations on the ground that their interests could not be adequately maintained if there was unity among them. We went to Court, and the case of the gineers was quoted. The Judge said, "" will do the same in this case."" There was a conference between two officers of these organizations, and although it had been thought a vital necessity for the interests the men for those two bodies to stand up against one another to the last ditch, was .discovered at the very first joint ting that out of 100 different claims there was an amicable agreement on all except two. Those two points, I believe, will be amicably settled also. This shows that those two organizations could have worked all along in agreement, under one set of rules. Then the question of who was to conduct the case arose. The very moment one gentleman's name was mentioned both unions agreed to put their consolidated claims into his hands, and leave it to his discretion to decide what evidence to before the Court. . The award will be given covering the employee's in the two organizations as one unit. I believe that many of these union tion Commissioner. difficulties are imaginary. These craft organizations have been standing off, fighting each other at arms length for so long that they have never got into employers."" the same room to talk things over. They have imagined difficulties between which did not really exist. I snould like to suggest, in the hope that it may point to a way out of this great difficulty, the Registrar of the Arbitration Court should be appointed as a Conciliation Commissioner to deal with cases of that kind.",56
188,Mr GROOM,BANKING COMPANIES RESERVE,The same power might be given to the Deputy Registrars in the various States.,57
189,Mr JH CATTS,BANKING COMPANIES RESERVE,"That is really matter of machinery, but some authority wanted. In the. New South Wales Arbitration Court, the Judge himself does not hear the case, and consequently these disputes requiring settlement in the preliminary stages can be safely referred to him. to In the Commonwealth Court, however, we could not have these union difficulties thrashed out before the Industrial Judge. comHe hears and decides the disputes between employers and employees. I want to avoid that. If honourable members who represent Labour in politics want to do a service to the industrial organizations of this country they will try to prevent these union difficulties being fought out before Mr Justice Higgins. In that fight, some of the salient points in the union's case will be given away, and its weaknesses exposed, so that when the real enissue between employers and employees We comes before him for trial the Judge's mind will have been prejudiced by the arguments used by the unions in competing against one another. I should like some of other authority to settle these inter-union difficulties, and, for the moment, the Arit bitration Registrar comes into my mind. I sitbelieve he is a capable man. I want an absolutely capable and fair man, who will take no end of pains to see that justice is done between the various conflicting bodies. I feel sure that we can concede the question of the registration of these different crafts and sections, and give them legal recognition as to all other purposes. Outside the work of the Industrial Court, we can leave them free to follow their own lines of organization, but we can tell them, "" When - you come before the Court, the Court will put deal with industries, and lay down awards for industries. Where you overlap and have a conflict of jurisdiction, your difficulties must go before the Registrar or ConciliaSettle them there first, so that when you go before the Arbitration Court itself you may present a united case in response to the unity of the",57
190,Mr ROBERTS,BANKING COMPANIES RESERVE,"That will necessitate them many men being in two unions. A man will have to be a unionist as engineer, and a unionist according to the industry ""in that which he is engaged.",57
191,Mr JH CATTS,BANKING COMPANIES RESERVE,"Not at all. Take the shearers case which has just been before the Arbitration Court. There are a number of stationary engine-drivers in the pastoral industry. A case has to be presented to the Court dealing with the pasa toral industry as a whole. Mr Mitchell,  secretary, of the Engine-drivers Union, can confer with the Australian Workers Union as to the claim to be put forward for engine-drivers. If there is any dispute between the two, the Conciliation Commissioner will bring them together in order that their case may be fought out jointly. There is no compulsion there for men to be in two unions. They can be in whichever they like. We could adopt groupings such as the Melbourne Trades Hall Council Committee recommended. By that means we should not interfere with their method of organization, ancl yet we would not interfere with the value of the industrial unit as the organized basis for the settlement of the industrial conditions of the industry. We should be able to have an award laid clown on the basis of the industrial unit. We should be able, following Mr. Justice Higgins' plan, to decide the living wage for the lowest grade of skilled worker in the industry. We should have the whole of the .unions concerned in that industry putting up a united battle in the Court to lift up the rate of wage for the lowest grade of unskilled worker in it. That would give an opportunity to all the skilled workers to assist in the fight. That wage would be the basis on which we should arrive at the wage of the skilled workers. Their rates would be apportioned to them on the principles laid down by Mr Justice Higgins, by finding out the diflerence which originally was determined in the rates for skilled and unskilled work amongst the workmen and their employers. Thus, in the case of the bricklayer and the bricklayer's labourer, the difference being 4s., when the lowest rate for the labourer is lifted up to 9s. the rate for the bricklayer is automatically fixed at 13s. Skilled and unskilled workers would thus have an interest in each other's case, and each would be fighting to lift up the rates for the other. These principles would operate until a more perfect scheme emerged from our experiments. I hope that, in the near future, there will be laid clown some scientific and equitable method of apportioning the results of their industry to the various classes of workers, having some actual relation to the value of their work and of their production. We can never be satisfied until some such basis is reached. In providing for the industry as a unit upon which the Court shall operate, we shall be assisting in the evolution of those great principles [6x]- 2 which will enable us, in the future, to accomplish what is set out in the labour objective-to secure to the producer the full result of his industry-bu t also in the meantime to settle one of the greatest immediate problems confronting modern society, namely, the arrangement of some .equitable plan upon which the differences of employers and employees can be amicably determined in their industrial relationships. Debate (on motion by Mr GROOM) adjourned. NA BILL. Bill recommitted for the reconsideration of clause 2. In Committee (Recommittal): Clause 2The First Schedule to the Principal Act is amended(ii.) by omitting from Part IT. the definition of and rates of postage for "" Magazines"" and inserting in their stead the following definition and rates of postage :"" Magazines-that is to say, (a) Magazines, reviews, and other similar publications, wholly set up, printed and published in Australia for sale in numbers at intervals not exceeding three months and consisting of writings or articles on current topics, fiction, religious, technical, scientific, or practical subjects, for each magazine, ^d. per 8 ounces or part of 8 ounces; (i) Magazines, reviews, and other similar publications (including newspapers), printed and published outside Australia for sale in numbers at intervals not exceeding three months and consisting of writings or articles on current topics, fiction, religious, technical, scientific, or practical subjects, for each magazine, £d. per 4 ounces or part of 4 ounces; (c) Catalogues wholly set up and printed in Australia, £d. per 4 ounces or part of 4 ounces.""

192,Mr GROOM,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"Darling Downs) [10.10]. - Has the Minister considered the point raised by the honourable member for Angas with respect to the restrictive nature of this definition? In the original Act, the definition is a wide one; but here the meaning is specific, and magazines will have to come within the limited terms here given. ^ Mr THOMAS (Barrier-Minister of External Affairs) [10.11] - I can only repeat what I said the other evening, namely, that if honourable members think this definition is restrictive, I am quite prepared, to omit all the words after "" three months."" I do not think that the words ought to be struck out; but there is no intention on the part of the postal authorities to prevent the circulation of legitimate magazines.  sire to move an amendment to provide that the paper used shall be of Australian manufacture.

Before I accept the suggested amendment of the honourable member for Maranoa, I should like to hear the honourable member for Maribyrnong and other honourable members who support the idea of the magazines being wholly set up and printed in Australia.
