That is okay, but There is cost shifting through the cessation ties. Examples at the local level include: inspection such as milk vendors; the increased role in need to watch Faulty Towers to see the increased health inspections and standards-an increased by the state government but administered by the lance cameras as police presence is wound technical advice to the community such as agricultural care; community programs; transport; Local governments, as I mentioned earlier-take auspicing roles and responsibilities.

Mr Deputy Speaker Hawker, I could say to consulted widely, having spoken with committee chairs and having published its report, it members of the committee are speaking on this fair, because the public at large just have when parliament is sitting. We are increasingly down here in Canberra, so it does not come as on the report, nor should we say it is disappointing speaking to this report. I am glad that I have the opportunity, which committee allocated to the opposition when presenting the honourable member for Mackellar. It is true committee taking up this issue and presenting That in no way detracts from other members of bipartisan report of the Procedure Committee. I have to put my cards on the table and say the House miss out because we are not involved We miss out because we do not get to know opportunity for members who have special interests, to actually pursue those with the top officials is a great deficiency and burden that But let me not be overly optimistic about aware of this, Deputy Speaker Hawker-that and the parliamentary departments were cut back partment of the House of Representatives committee system. You, as a distinguished and truly earned that title-would know that tees are utterly stretched. At the end of the day we pretend that, any shortfall or deficit. That is wrong. A committee committees serviced by the Department of pendent on the skill, expertise and dedication a report that proposes to fundamentally change budget debates and the estimates. It is called the government because it will guarantee that a motion the budget appropriations through the House eara win for members because they will have a far they have hitherto had. This will occur in two and timetabled, and opportunities for memthings currently occur. Moreover, the debate estimates committee type process is again proFraser government had an estimates process and them in the long run, but I think this set of you that, with the Procedure Committee having secretaries, having spoken with committee is desperately disappointing that no-one but the report. But I think that would be grossly unno understanding of the time pressures on members trying to do more in less time whilst we are a surprise to me. I do not think it is a reflection that only members of the committee are I did not have in the four minutes the selection the report, to make special mention of that she deserves much of the credit for the the report and I commend her for her efforts. the committee.
