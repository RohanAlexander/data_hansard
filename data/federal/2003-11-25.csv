Mr Deputy Speaker Hawker, I could say to consulted widely, having spoken with committee chairs and having published its report, it members of the committee are speaking on this fair, because the public at large just have when parliament is sitting. We are increasingly down here in Canberra, so it does not come as on the report, nor should we say it is disappointing speaking to this report. I am glad that I have the opportunity, which committee allocated to the opposition when presenting the honourable member for Mackellar.

I have to put my cards on the table and say the House miss out because we are not involved We miss out because we do not get to know opportunity for members who have special interests, to actually pursue those with the top officials is a great deficiency and burden that But let me not be overly optimistic about aware of this, Deputy Speaker Hawker-that and the parliamentary departments were cut back partment of the House of Representatives committee system. You, as a distinguished and truly earned that title-would know that tees are utterly stretched. At the end of the day we pretend that, any shortfall or deficit. That is wrong.

Moreover, the debate estimates committee type process is again proFraser government had an estimates process and them in the long run, but I think this set of you that, with the Procedure Committee having secretaries, having spoken with committee is desperately disappointing that no-one but the report.
