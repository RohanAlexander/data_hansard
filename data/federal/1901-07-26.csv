1,Mr TUDOR,TEMPORARY PORTERS A T,"the Minister representing the Postmaster - General, upon notice I. Whether he is aware that men employed' as temporary porters at the Melbourne General Post-office do not receive a weekly half-holiday, thongh they are alleged to be doing the same work as ths permanent porters who get the halfholiday each week ? 2. Whether he will take steps to see that they receive one half'holiday par week ?",14
2,Sir PHILIP FYSH,TEMPORARY PORTERS A T,"The Postmaster General is aware that the men employed at the 'Melbourne General Post-office as temporary porters do not receive a full half-holiday each week, but their work, though similar, is not the same as that performed by the permanent porters, as the latter have greater responsibilities. He cannot promise to take steps to see that they receive more holiday time than at present. As their work is not continuous, they are not required to be in attendance 48 hours per week, and they are allowed to leave at 3 and 3.30 p.m., instead of at 6.30 p.m. on Saturday afternoon.

3,Mr CROUCH,TEMPORARY PORTERS A T,"the Prime Minister-, upon notice I. Whether, as stated in the press, ment has decided that "" it is undesirable that officers who have had rank conferred upon them whilst serving in South Africa should be required to forego such rank on their return to the Commonwealth""? 2. Whether he will apply this rule to those who, other than officers, have received promotion in South Africa?",15
4,Mr BARTON,TEMPORARY PORTERS A T,"The Government has decided that officers of the Commonwealth forces promoted for service in South Africa shall be allowed to retain their rank on their return to the Commonwealth. It would not be found practicable to apply this rule to all cases, other than officers, as in the case of those permanently employed there could not be found positions in which to place them in accordance with their rank. Therefore, they would either have to forego their positions or forego their rank. But, wherever found practicable, it is the desire of the Government that those who win promotion on service shall retain it on their return. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTUR E. that - Debate resumed (from 12th July, vide page 2514) on motion by Sir JOHN QUICK That, in the opinion of this House, a National Department of Agriculture and Productive Industries, on the same lines as that of the United States of America, ought to be organized and maintained in connection with the Government of the Commonwealth.",15
5,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,TEMPORARY PORTERS A T," I listened with a good deal of attention to the remarks .made by the mover of the motion, the honourable and learned member for Indi, and the honourable member for Echuca. There can be no question that it raises a very important issue, affecting the interests of the whole of Australia. It may be asked, and is asked by some of the States, what right has the Federal Parliament to deal with the question of agricultural education. Some contend that it should be left to the States. They further urge that we have no power under the Constitution to deal with the question. I shall proceed to show first what course is adopted in the various States and in other countries with regard to agricultural education, and also what steps, in my opinion,, should be taken to put this matter ou a satisfactory basis. The Constitution providesThe Parliament shall, subject to this Constitution, have power to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the Commonthe Govern- wealth, with respect to :I . Trade and commerce with other countries and among the States. III . Bounties on the production or export of goods, but so that such bounties shall be uniform throughout the Commonwealth. * # # * * # * * IX. Quarantine. The Parliament also has the power to appropriate the funds of the Commonwealth. If honourable members will refer to the Constitution of the United States they will see that so far as the formation of a department of agriculture is concerned, our powers are greater than the powers it gives. The importance of fchis matter is emphasized when we consider the growing production of Australia.. If we take the returns which are submitted in The Seven Colonies of Australasia, we find that the agricultural, pastoral, dairy, and forestry production in 1899 amounted' to £61,406,000 or, including mining and manufactures, to £112,273,000. In 1881 our total production was only £71,000,000, soit has increased by over £40,000,000' since that year. . What progress bos been made in regard fco agriculture generally? In 1881 the 'area under crops in Australia was 4,489,000 acres, whereas in 1899' it had increased to 8,666,000 acres. In 1881 our area under wheat was 3,002,000 acres, and in 1899 it had increased to 5,614,000 acres. In 1881 we produced 21,378,000 bushels of wheat and in 1899 the production had increased bo 39,998,000 bushels. We are producing now more than we require for the people of Australia. Therefore it becomes necessary for us to open new markets for our surplus products. In 1S89 the export of butter from Australia amounted to 800,000 lbs., whereas in 1889 it had increased to 25,000,000 lbs. We have to find markets for £18,000,000 worth of wool, £1,000,000 worth of tallow, £2,200,000 worth of meat, and £1,500,000 worth of hides and skins. While we have this large surplus, and while the production in agriculture is largely increasing every year, I fear we have not taken the steps which should be taken to capture the remunerative trade of Great Britain and other nations. Our area is about 3,000,000 acres. The area of Denmark and Holland - two small countries-is not a hundredth part of the area of Australia. Yet what do we find? Out of £111,000,000 food supplies imported by Great Britain from various countries every year, Denmark contributes nearly £13,000,000 worth, and Holland nearly £6,000,000 worth. In other words, these two countries, with only a hundredth part of the area of Australia, export about 17 per cent, food supplies, which include margarine, cheese, wheat, flour, eggs, fruit, bacon, beef fresh, bams, mutton milk, pork, and poultry. One notable instance of what can be done is furnished by Denmark, a little country about a twohundredth part of the area of Australia with .a severer climate, in which the fanner's have to house their stock for. many months in the year, and furthermore, to import food largely for their cattle. Notwithstanding all these disadvantages, Denmark last year eonfcributed no less than £8,000,000 worth of butter, out of £17,000,000 worth which the old country imported. I point out these facts to show the great possibilities there are before Australia, if we would only take - up this question in the way in which other nations are doing, and put forward our best .efforts to improve the condition of affairs here. The honourable and learned members for Bendigo and Indi referred to what is being done in America, and in the motion 'we are asked to follow the lines of the Agricultural department of the United - States. I am not one of those who believe .in being tied down to the scheme of any particular country. I think we ought to' have a free hand to adopt what we think suitable from America, and what we think .suitable from other countries. not to follow slavishly the lines of the agricultural system of America, because Mr Sydney Smith. - ] Agriculture. I can see clearly that in some cases it would not be wise for Australia to do so. The United States established a department of agriculture in 1862. We find that the Act sets forth that a department of agriculture shall be established, the general designs and dufcies of which shall be to acquire and diffuse amongst the people of the United States useful information on subjects connected with agriculture i nfchemosfc general and comprehensive sense of the word, and fco procure, propagate, and distribute amongst the people new and valuable seeds and plants. Another Act was passed in 1862 which granted large areas of land to the various States in order fco assist agriculture. I find from a report worth of presented to Congress last year that the Federal Government of the United States is now appropriating veiy large sums of money for that purpose. The amount last 3 ear, I r believe, was about 3,000,000 dollars. That appropriation includes various branches of investigation, and deals with publications, of the statistics, botany, entomology, vegetable butter, pafcholog}', chemistry, divisions of soils, divisions of forestry, experimental gardens, fresh, museum, library, salaries in connection with the animal bureau, collection of agricultural statistics, botanical investigations and experiments, forestry investigations, soil investigations, grasses, agricultural experimental stations, irrigation investigations, and various other matters appertaining to agriculture.",15
6,Mr BARTON,TEMPORARY PORTERS A T,Fro m what is the honourable member quoting ?,16
7,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,TEMPORARY PORTERS A T,"I am quoting from an Act of Parliament-reall y from the Estimates - which received the assent on March I , 1899. It is information which, I think, will be valuable to the Federal Government in considering this question.",16
8,Mr BARTON,TEMPORARY PORTERS A T,What is the title of the volume 1,16
9,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,TEMPORARY PORTERS A T,"The United States Statutes. Ib is an Act of Parliament setting forth the lines of investigation followed by the Deparbmenb of Agriculture in the United States, and appropriating a large sum of money- I think about 3,000,000 dollars - in order to assisb the various divisions of agriculbure, and in obher ways bo improve the condition of affairs in that countiy. The American people realise the importance We ought of paying attention to this question, and of securing the markets of other parts of the world. In nearly every country where it is likely that there is business to be clone, American agents will be found obtaining information for the benefit of the producers in the various States. It may be asked-- "" is there any difficulty whatever in working this plan, in view of the action taken by the various States "" ? I understand that the}' experience no difficulty whatever, that the States work hand in hand with the Federal Government - as they ought to do, and as I believe our States will do and ought to do-in endeavouring to assist in every possible way the producers of the States. If honourable members will take the trouble to look up some offchework which is being carried out by the United States in connection with experiments, and with distributing ad vice to her people, I feel surefcheywill be satisfied that the time has arrived when something ought to be done by the Federal Government of Australia towards helping our agricultural industry. The honourable and learned member for Bendigo has asked us to follow the lines of agricultural education in the United States. While, as I said before, I approve of a great deal that is already being done in America in this direction, yet I am sorry to have to say that they pay too little attention there to what, I term practical agriculture. In most of their colleges the examination is too severe, and very frequently it prevents young men from obtaining information which should be open to all who have the desire and the necessary ability to acquire it. The agricultural colleges are, sometimes misunderstood. I find that out of about 34,000 students at the agricultural colleges of the United States, only about 4,407 follow what I call practical agriculture. The remainder follow other branches. All the 132 students in the Massachusetts college take the agricultural coui-se, but of the 1,100 who have passed through that college, I believe that only about one quarter are engaged in agriculture at the present time.",16
10,Mr WH GROOM,TEMPORARY PORTERS A T,The honourable member will find that that is the case in all agricultural colleges.,17
11,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,TEMPORARY PORTERS A T,I mention this to show the difference between the United States and Australia at the present time.,17
12,Mr WH GROOM,TEMPORARY PORTERS A T,All agricultural colleges reveal the same result. Not more than one-fourth of the students who pass through them afterwards engage in agriculture.,17
13,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,TEMPORARY PORTERS A T,"I shall be able to show the honourable member that that is not the case. At Michigan College, out of 425 students, only 211 engaged in agriculture. Realizing as I did, as Minister for Agriculture in New South Wales for many years, the importance of getting up-to-date information on all matters appertaining to agriculture, on behalf of the Government of that State, I offered a bursary to the most successful student in its agricultural colleges. That bursary enabled him to go to the best college in the world for two or three years' training, and was a means of keeping the department informed as to what was being done in a practical way elsewhere.",17
14,Mr WH GROOM,TEMPORARY PORTERS A T,That was the righfc coursefcotake.,17
15,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,TEMPORARY PORTERS A T,"I believe it was. It cost the Government of our State £500, but I believe it was £ 5 0 0 well spent, because it enabled us to acquire information which has been of immense value to the State of New South Wales. In order to obtain further information as to the work that is being done, I recommendedfcheGovernment of New Soufch Wales to send one of its best experts to America, and other countries, with a view to seeing what improvement"", had been made infcbesystem of production, the different classes of machinery that are being used, the new crops that are being raised, and the new methods of cultivationfchafcare being employed. That officer was for over two years engaged in visiting those countries to obtain information, which would assist in placing the Department of Agriculture in New South Wales on a more efficient footing. He has recently returned, and I believe that he will be able to give, not only to the State of New South Wales-becaus e we must now look upon this as a federal matter-bu t to the whole of the States, valuable information bearing upon agriculture, which will be of immense advantage fco the Commonwealth Parliament should we decide upon starting a National Department of Agriculture. I know that officer very well. He is a most competent man- I refer to Dr Cobb-wh o has given a great deal of attention to different kinds of wheats, which was one of the lines of investigation that he was called upon to prosecute. He was commissioned to ascertain whether there were wheats used in any of those countries which would be move suitable than the wheats we use for our different climates. - means we may be able to get wheats which will grow better in certain districts than in others. We thought that. possibly he might be able to hit upon a wheat that would resist the rust and be able , to stand in some of the dry districts of the States. At all events, I believe that if the Government decide to' start a depart ment of agriculture in connection with the Commonwealth, the officer in question will be able to give us information which will be of immense value, and thus save us large sums of money in the carrying out of this undertaking. I have been referring to the United States. I think it only right that I should also refer to what is being done in the States of Australia. I. have always worked in a very amicable way with the various States of the group. In regard to agriculture, New Soufch Wales always felt-even federation was accomplished - that that matter was one of federal concern. felfc that what benefited one State would benefit; another, and that what damaged one State would damage another. every year we had a conference of the various Ministers of Agriculture with the view to thrashing out different tions. Those who have read our reports - will admit that much useful information was acquired, which has been of great benefit to the various Agricultural education was started in Victoria long before we introduced it in New South Wales. I remember references being frequently made in our Parliament to the fact that Victoria was a long way ahead of us in regard to fchis matter. I admit that Victoria started before we did, and I give her every credit; for having done so, although I do not think she went on the righfc lines. 1I have always said that, and I took the opportunity on many occasions, when discussing this matter with Mr. Taverner, when he was Minister for Agriculture-and he always took a great interest in agriculture, and deserves well of the people of Victoria-of pointing out that it would be impossible fco make a success of a department of agriculture worked on the lines that were then being followed in Victoria. I took that view because I knew that it was impossible to get the members of the Board of Agricultural Education to take deep interest in their work that was necessary to insure success. Unless you have Mr Sydney Smith. enthusiastic officers who will work morning, By that noon, and night, it will be impossible to make a success of a department of agriculture. Victoria started her department of agriculture before we did, and we have benefited byfchefailure-if I may so term it-of her systemWhen I had the honour of being called upon as a member of the late Sir Henry Parkes' Government to form a department; of agriculture in New South Wales, I felfc it my duty to make myself acquainted not only with the system in force in Victoria, but with what was being done in other States and countries, and I adopted the course that I want the Federal Government fco follow if the motion is carried in its present, or in an amended form. I want them to adopt the latest systems, talcing just those elements from the different countries and ' the different systems that may be best adapted before to the requirements of our States. If that course is followed, I think that we shall We be able, without much difficulty, to bring forward a comprehensive and satisfactory scheme of agricultural education. Instead Therefore, of adopting the Victorian system of constituting a board of agricultural education, our Government made the Agricultural ques- department-as is now proposed- a part of what may be called the Ministerial policy. We made the Government and the Minister in charge of the administraStates. tion of the Agricultural department responsible to Parliament and to the people, so that they could be called upon at any moment to answer any charges, or receive any suggestions from the representatives of the people in order to further the interests of agriculture. I sayfchafcfchafcis the only satisfactory way of administering any department of agriculture. I hope no amount of inducement will causefcheCommonwealth Government to go back to the system which has been in force for so many years in Victoria. I am very glad to say that even in Victoria the Government realise that a mistake was made, and that they are now start ing afresh on the lines adopted in New South Wales. I may be pardoned, perhaps, for making some reference to the work we are doing at the present time in New South Wales. I wish to refer 'fco this because, judging from some offcheremarks that have been made during the course of .the debate, that it seems that we are to go to the United States, and the United States alone, to find out what is best suited to the requirements of the Commonwealth in regard to agriand cultural education. I think, however, that I shall be able to show that nearly everythe thing that is included in the agricultural system of the United States, and a good zers, deal more, has been adojsted in New Wales, with, I am glad to say, very satisfactory results. We formed the department of agribecause culture in New South Wales in 1891. At that time the total area under crop was 846,3S3 acres. Last year- I do not it is altogether due to the system of agricultural education in force there a good deal is, no doubt, due to the liberal, land laws and other inducements that have been held out-ou r area under crop had increased to 2,240,000 acres. The farmer. area under wheat-and that was one of the branches to which we gave special lizers 1 attention in our agricultural departmenthad increased from 360,000 acres in 1891 to 1,446,000 acres. The product of wheat also increased from 3,963,000 bushels 13,000,000 bushels, or an increase of nearly 10,000,000 bushels within ten years. I could refer also to other evidences of the marked improvement that has taken place in New South Wales, at events during the last few years, as far as agriculture is concerned. In our State we have a system in force which I think should as far as possible be followed by the them. Federal. Government, if they start a department of agriculture. We have chemistry division, in which we carry out analyses of soil, and advise agriculturists to the best modes of treatment of what their soil, as to the proper manures to use in order to secure the best results from land, as to the crops best suited for the land, and the best treatment for those and we do all that free of cost. We take suitable for irrigation purposes. this view in regard to agriculture-thaf farmer should start fair, that he should know what his soil contains, and what soil is suitable for, and that the only way arrive afc a satisfactory 'conclusion on point is to first have the soil analyzed. the same way'that a doctor who is attendmade, ing a patient should first ascertain the ease from which the patient is suffering Queensland, I understand, before he prescribes, we say that a farmer should first have the fullest informato tion regarding the nature of the soil with which he has to deal. Every engaged. bond fide farmer on the soil of New South Wales is in a position to obclusion, tain analyses of soil free of cost, a similar privilege is accorded him with regard to fertilizers. We found that agents for the sale of fertilizers were charging £ 1 2 and £ 1 3 per ton for fertilithe real value of which was South not more than £ 4 . I saw that the people were being robbed in this wayignorant people did not know the value of the articles that were being sold to them-and we ordered that all these fertisay lizers should be sampled and analyzed. On the strength offcheanalyses then made, we ; published a work, which should be very glad to hand to honourable members, showing the actual prices put upon the fertilizers by the agents and the actual values to the",17
16,Mr MAUGER,TEMPORARY PORTERS A T,Were they imported ferti,19
17,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,TEMPORARY PORTERS A T,"Some were imported and some were locally made, but, of course, we did not discriminate between to the local and the imported articles.",19
18,Mr WH GROOM,TEMPORARY PORTERS A T,Was that done less than under an A ct of Parliament ?,19
19,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,TEMPORARY PORTERS A T,"No ; 1 took the responsibility of doing it. I was threatened all with an action for damages, but still I thought that in the interests of the farmers and agriculturists generally of our State, I was justified in doing what I did to protect",19
20,Mr WH GROOM,TEMPORARY PORTERS A T,We passed an Act a of Parliament in Queensland.,19
21,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,TEMPORARY PORTERS A T,"And a very as good thing, too; bufc we have been doing I have described for many years, with excellent results, and we have been carrying the out the work free of cost to the farmer. Then again, we examinedfchedifferent watercrops, supplies to see whether the water was Further, c the we also examined free of cost the first various descriptions of fodder plants, his in order that the farmers might have to the best information as to their respective fchis values. Then with regard to wheat and In flour, a very important departure has been and I am glad to say that South disAustralia has followed our example, and also has sanctioned the purchase of a mill, in order carry out investigations similar to those in which we in New South Wales have been We found that it was important, and the millers also came to the same conthat we should know how wheat would behave in the milling, and that we should also obtain other information regard to its milling qualities. The matter had been largely overlooked, but we realized that it was just as important to know the milling value of wheat as to ascertain dition, the value of milk by the butter We realized that the matter was one of imour portance to the millers, not only in our State, but in other parts of the Commonan wealth, and we made it a federal matter by inviting the millers in the various States send samples for treatment, so that our investigations might help them in regard this important branch of agriculture, as well as ourselves. The result was that samples of wheat were sent from the other States, and we had a small mill put up that was capable of treating wheat, even in small quantities of 1 lb. weight, in such a way as fco the world. enable the chemists to ascertain its value breadmaking and its nourishing We have also been enabled to obtain inadopt formation which has guided us in the selecment tion of wheat for cross-fertilization, so that we may secure for further cultivation those wheats which are the best for milling purto poses. This work was specially associated with the investigations that were referred by the honourable member for Indi, as conthat ducted by Mr .Farrer, at one or two of our experimental stations. The agricultural societies in the various parts of the State, also found it of great advantage to enlist assistance in allofctingprizes for the best of wheat. We gave them an opportunity having the various wheats tested, and in way have afforded them information I think in many cases has proved of immense value, not only to the agricultural societies but also to the fanners because it is important that the* farmers should know exactly the qualities of the wheats they are planting. Then, again, bakers have found this department of ours of great benefit, because they have enabled through it to obtain information to the qualities of wheat for bread-making pui*poses. I mention these facts to show is being done in the neighbouring of New South Wales in order to advance agriculture in its various branches, and have no hesitation in saying that in that particular department, which E have referred to as the chemistry division, the work in dealing with manures, wheat, soils, and fodder plants, and in ascertaining the of different products, has been of immense advantage to the farmers in our State. Mr Sydney Smith. with Ifc is very difficult to estimate the advantages which our farmers have derived, and will derive in the future, from this important branch of agricultural education. In adwe felt it our duty to issue, free of test. cost, to every bona fide farmer in the States, Agricultural Gazette. That is a work of own which, if honourable members have ever had opportunity of reading it, they will admit we have no reason to be ashamed ; in fact, to we are very proud of it . It is a work that has been favourably referred to in America, to England, and ofcher countries which have long given close attention to agricultural questions. We have reason to be gratified that a work of this kind is received with much favour, not only in these States, but almost throughout the length and breadth of We have given bursaries sucli for as those I referred to just now, and I would qualities. recommend the Federal Government to the same course if a federal departof agriculture is started. The system ought to be Carried out in order that every year one of our best students may be sent a college in France, Germany, America, or some other part offcheworld, and in order to that byfchismeans we may get information will be of immense benefit to Australia. It seems to me that we are too slow. We introduce new machinery which we consider to be modern, but in some cases it is out of date. our Modern machinery is of great advantage in kinds enabling farmers to compete in the markets of of the world. But somefcimes machinery, this supposed to be most useful, is brought out which here three or four years after it has been invented, and infchemeantime new implements have taken its place in agriculture. Because themselves, of the want of a proper system of obtaining information of value to our farmers, we are not making that progress, I am sorry to say, in connection with the export tradefchafcwe ought to do. We also give in our colleges been bursaries to sons of farmers and other as deserving persons who are unable to pay even the small fee charged at our agriculwhat tural colleges. Some people say that we State ought fco make the experimental stations pay their way; bufc while I believe that our I experimental station at Wagga does pay its way, that is not what I look to altogether. I look fco the importance of the information done acquired and given to our farmer as of infinitely more value to the agriculture of value Australia than the small amount we spend in assisting agricultural education. AVe look at this matter in a business way, and carry out perhaps thousands of experiments at the various experimental stations. Some of i these experiments are most usefnl. They | show that proposals which have been made , are of no value whatever, thus preventing hun- ; dreds of farmers failing in a similar diiection. The Government, by having a properly equipped agricultural college or experimental station, is enabled to have the very best advice and information bearing on the various experiments, whereas a farmer, through want of means perhaps, can only carry out experiments in an incomplete way. The Government carry out the investigations in a perfect way, and show whether proposals made are failures or successes, and thus save our farmers and producers from in' many cases spending thousands of pounds in useless experiments, which very often mean their ruin. Therefore in our agricultural colleges we give bursaries - no t many, I am sorry to say, but as many as are required-to deserving sons of poor people who are unable to pay the required fees, and we educate those boys free of cost for two years and support them into the bargain. I have no hesitation in saying that this system has been of immense benefit to many deserving lads in our State. There is another question in connection with which I have been the subject of a good deal of ridicule, and possibly it may appear a small matter to people who do not understand agriculture in all its branches. I refer now to the improvement of our herds.",19
22,Mr A MCLEAN,TEMPORARY PORTERS A T,Surely that is not a small matter.,21
23,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,TEMPORARY PORTERS A T,"It has been considered a small matter by many people, bufc I realized that it was not a small matter. Notwithstanding all the ridicule fco which I was subject, I went on because I knew that underlying it was an important principle which, if acted upon, would ultimately be of immense benefitfcoour dairy farmers and others. We sent to the old country and obtained the very best herd that could be obtained, in order to improvefchebreed of dairy cattle in our State, and I have no hesitation in saying that, before ten years are passed, the people of that State, and I believe the other States, will realise the immense importance of this new branch of agricultural 'education.",21
24,Mr WH GROOM,TEMPORARY PORTERS A T,That has been done in Queensland.,21
25,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,TEMPORARY PORTERS A T,I am glad Queensland is following the example of New South Wales.,21
26,Mr KINGSTON,TEMPORARY PORTERS A T,South Australia imported a bull long ago.,21
27,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,TEMPORARY PORTERS A T,"South Australia may have imported one or two, but how long ago was that ?",21
28,Mr KINGSTON,TEMPORARY PORTERS A T,Six or seven years ago.,21
29,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,TEMPORARY PORTERS A T,"I consider that this was one of the best things we ever did in New South Wales to assist agricultural education. I know that in our State, in some of the dairies two cows were being kept where one of the proper breed would have been sufficient, and would have given better results. Unless steps of this kind are taken, how can we expect to secure that remunerative trade with Great Britain-the butter trade-and place ourselves in as good a position as Denmark, as we ought to do, because our natural resources are greater than those of that country ? In many ways we are in a better position than Denmark to compete for the butter trade, but we cannot expect to compete unless we improve our herds and improve our methods in every way, not only in regard to the herds, but also in regard to the system of export and the handling of goods at home. As I said, I - was subject to a great deal of criticism by many people who do not understand anything about agriculture, and who look on a matter of this kind as of very small importance. I dare say that some great men look on matters of this kind as of no moment, but to the bone and sinew of the country they are of great concern. More than 50 per cent, of the whole population of the world are engaged in agriculture. That shows the necessity of the Federal Government giving consideration to this important question. We have also established experimental farms and agricultural colleges, or at least one agricultural college on a large scale in our State. When this college was started, some narrow - minded people, as I would call them, objected to students coming from the other States, but the Government decided to open the college to all, being anxious to benefit the whole of the States. I am glad to say that we have had a number of students from both I Queensland and Victoria. The late Minister for Agriculture in Queensland, Mr Thynne, and Mr MCCulloch, an exVictorian Minister, sent their sons to this college, and we have had students from England, Japan, and South Africa.",21
30,Mr OMALLEY,TEMPORARY PORTERS A T,And from America 1,22
31,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,TEMPORARY PORTERS A T,"I do not think we have had any students yet from America. I am glad to say our agricultural college has proved a great success. I mentioned a while ago that in some of the agricultural colleges in the United States, no more than about 15 per cent of those who took the agricultural course followed agricultural callings. In our State, I am pleased to say, 75 per cent of the students are following agricultural pursuits at the present time. That is a result which bas not been achieved in any country I know of-and it is a result that is very satisfactory to us. I may be pardoned for referring to what other people think of us in regard to agriculture. I do so because of the reference made in the debate to the system in force in America. I have endeavoured to show that in many of the colleges in America the examination is too high for the ordinary farmer's son, and that in consequence a number of youths who ought to be admitted are excluded. In New South ""Wales we prevent that by admitting any boy who has gone through the school system, is well behaved, and desires to follow agriculture. We ""have not the high educational test which is required in America and which I do not believe in. In our own State about three or four years ago, when we started the Public Service Board,it was thought that we ought to adopt the American system in connection with our colleges. That is to say, that we ought to have a professor- a man versed in various languages, and who could receive visitors-as the principal of the college. When I suggested Mr Valder, who is a practical agriculturist, and who bad proved his worth as a practical man, as u suitable man to take charge of the college, in view of the promotion of Mr Thompson to the position of travelling expert, the Public Service Board at first declined to cany out the recommendation. The Public Service Board thought that we ought to have a professor who, as I said, was versed in languages, could receive visitors, and was a scientific man. My opinion of scientific men is very high, and in their own particular calling they are all right; but take them away from their own investigations, and they may be altogether wrong, from a business point of view. To have appointed such a man would, in my opinion, have been a great mistake, and I am glad to say my recommendation met with success. I told my under-secretary that rather than appoint a professional man, such as I have described as the head of the Hawkesbury College, I would close the college in 24 hours, knowing that such an appointment would be a failure. While the Public Service Board has the right to nominate officers of a certain standard and with certain qualifications, I as Minister had the right to determine the policy offcheGovernment, and the policy of the Government was to carry on a system of practical agriculture, so far as it could be taught in agricultural colleges. Mr Valder was appointed, and I am glad to say that the chairman of the board admitted that the Government were right in the course they took, as the result has proved, in insisting on a practical man being placed in charge of the college. I may be pardoned for pointing out what other people think of our system. It is only right that honourable members should know what is being done, and should obtain such information as will help them in dealing with this very important matter. I have a copy of a letter which was sent to the Agen t General of New South Wales by Dr Morris, lecturer at the Botanical Gardens, in regard to the system of agricultural education in that State. He says The energy with which agricultural affairs are being pushed forward in New South Wales is a striking object lesson to all parts of the Empire. That is a very good reference to our work, but I shall come nearer home. Not long ago, the Government of Victoria, with a praiseworthy desire to remove the old system of agricultural education here, seeing that it was nob a success, rightly appointed a Royal commission to inquire intofchisvery important question. That commission went to New South Wales, and visited our various agricultural colleges and experimental stations. In looking through its report, I found this passage, which I may be pardoned for readingSumming up the results of our inspection and inquiries at Hawkesbury College and Farm, we are unanimous in the opinion that the system of education adopted,- together with the general organization of the institution, both in regard to class-room and farm work, are excellent. The institution is most certainly an object lesson for all the Australian colonies, and reflects credit upon the Department of Agriculture, the principal of the College, and the teaching staff. Our inquiries at the College extended over two days, and during this period we were able to thoroughly appreciate the fact that the institution has become highly popular with the agriculturists of New South Wales. Not the least important part of the work of the College is, in our opinion, the facilities afforded to growers all over the colony of taking advantage of the exjjert knowledge of the principal and his staff by means of inquiries by letter and by personal visits. It is certain that the liberal and progressive policy of the New South Wales Department of Agriculture, not only in relation to the maintenance of educational establishments, but in the provision of instruction through the agency of expert officers, aud suitable publications, has a marked influence upon the improvement and extension of the rural industries of the colony. A well-known expert from India, writing the other day to the Department of Agriculture there, saidThere is no doubt, in my opinion, that Mr. Farrer's work in New South Wales has already secured a large amount of success, and gives promise of much greater results in the future. He closes his report by speaking in a very complimentary manner of the work undertaken in New South Wales on these lines, and urges his own Government to take up somewhat similar work. I admit that even our system is faulty. I think we ought fco start earlier. Agriculture should be part of the curriculum of the public schools. So strongly was I impressed with this view, that I felt it my duty to strongly urge my colleague, the Minister for Public Instruction, to take steps to give the boys in our schools instruction in agricultural matters, and ottered to start the system in districts. That is the proper way to begin if the work is to be carried out as it ought to be. It will take some time before the system can be perfected, because possibly many of the teachers do not know much about agriculture. Facilities ought to be given by the State departments of agriculture at their experimental colleges and farms for the schoolmasters in the various districts to get a training in agricultural pursuits. I invited the Department of Public Instruction in New South Wales to send two or three schoolmasters from an agricultural district, say, the New England district, to an. agricultural college, and let them remain there from three to six months to acquire the groundwork of an agricultural education. By that means, and by the aid of experimental plots at various schools, they could obtain a lot of valuable information which, I think, would considerably help the work of the Agricultural department when it took the students at the age of sixteen years.",22
32,Mr OMALLEY,TEMPORARY PORTERS A T,A good idea.,23
33,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,TEMPORARY PORTERS A T,"I am sorry to say that view was not taken. I regret it is taken in very few countries, but it ought to be taken. 1 trust that if a federal department of agriculture be formed, it will endeavour to induce the Statesfcomove in fchis direction. I admit that it would not come under our jurisdiction; bufc I have no doubt that the States, having regard fco the importance of the subject, would receive kindly any suggestions made by the Federal Government. It is a question which ought to be considered from every point of view, and I trust that an addition will be made fco the work carried out in the various States if a federal department of agriculture be formed. One offchemost important things which could be done by a department of agriculfcureis the bringingaboufcof uniformity in experiments. AVhile we have six State departments of agriculture, with six different systems of experimental work, all engaged in trying to bring about the same results, bufc employing six different agencies, we have a loss of energy as well as of money. If we could bring about uniformity in regard to many of the investigations, and arrange that they should be carried out in, say, one State, and for the Federal Government to assist all proper investigations, 'then I think much - good would result. The Federal Government could insure uniformity in regard to experiments, and carry out the work of inspection. There is no doubt that with six departments carrying on. six different systems, with one not knowing what was being carried on by the ofcher, there musfc be a loss of energy and of money. The Federal Government exists to prevent the occurrence - of this loss, and to endeavour to bring about uniformity in this respect, to save the States and the people of the Commonwealth from a useless expenditure. I believe that much of the work carried out in the various States could be concentrated, say at one college for one particular experiment, and at another for another ; and let the Federal Government, like the Federal Government in the United States, give to each State a certain sum to carry out certain investigations. At the same time it should insist upon knowing exactly what is being done by the State colleges, and should require information as to the work carried out. In the United States the Government also insist that State Government shall send to the other full information on the different work is carried out in order that what is done one place shall be used for the benefit There is another very important which,largely affects our trade. Some sons say that quarantine does not come under the jurisdiction of the Federal vernment except in regard fco human beings. Put I think it embraces the quarantine stock, fruit trees, fruits, and everything else. Let us consider the losses which occurred in Queensland from the tick fever. Up to 1899 the losses from tick fever in that State amounted fco about 334,000 head of cattle. In the Townsville district alone the stock-owners lost 232,000 head of cattle. At the present time there is a want of uniinterest formity with regard to quarantine regulaenforced tions, and in view of those great losses it important that the States which have not been infected with tick fever protect their farmers and stock-owners from an invasion. Take our dairy herds in the Richmond River district. If the came there, what would it mean ? It would mean ruination to all the dairy farmers. And if it came over fco Victoria, the effect would be the same. We know very well Queensland that when the matter is left fear of damaging its interests it very often conceals diseases which exist. To avoid case. that danger quarantine oughfc to be made a federal matter, because we are interested in protecting the whole of the States. If State relaxes its quarantine regulations by allowing diseased cattle fco come over border, that may mean, as it has meant Queensland, a serious loss to the dairy farmers and pastoralists. The quarantine regulations should be uniform, and the Federal - Government should have superPederal vision in order to protect the States against tick fever or any other disease. Again, take the case of pigs. South Wales we e,re extra careful. prescribe that pigs shall be in quarantine for 60 days, whereas in Victoria and in Western Australia the period is 30 days. After very complete inquiry the Governeases, ment of New South Wales came to the coninfected clusion that 60 days' quarantine should prescribed for pigs. Supposing that through the want of uniformity, through carelessness, or through pigs not having sufficient time the quarantine ground, the swine fever Mr Sydney Smith. introduced into our States, what might each happen ? What happened in Denmark when the swine fever was introduced ? which The Danes had a large and growing at trade with Germany and other States, of all. but immediately swine fever was known matter to exist in Denmark, the whole of the pertrade ceased, because the importation of pork from that country was prohibited. GoAgain, take cattle. In New Soufch Wales, the period of quarantine is 40 days, and in of Western Australia 30 days. Por sheep the period of quarantine is 30 days in our State have from the United Kingdom, and from other countries 60 days ; whereas in Tasmania it is 30 days, and in Western Australia 14 days. We all know the great danger there is of scab being introduced among our sheep. In view offcheimportance offcheindustry, it is to our to see that proper regulations are in order to preventfchepossibility of is any disease coming in. Again, takefcheimportation of dogs. In New Soufch Wales the should period of quarantine is six months, and here I may say that I took the trouble to interview one of Pasteur's leading men, and asked fever what period was necessary to prevent the possibility of hydrophobia coming into our State. He advised me that a period of not less than six months was necessary ; and yet in they are agitating for a period of to one State, for three months.",23
34,Mr CHAPMAN,TEMPORARY PORTERS A T,There has been no,24
35,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,TEMPORARY PORTERS A T,"There has been no case because we have been very particular, a and that is a reason why we ought to have uniform quarantine regulations. In Victoria its they have introduced a system which I in do not believe in, private quarantine. We all know the dangers of introducing a system of that kind. We know how it can be abused. At all events I hope that the Government will be able to see their way clear to establish a department which will have supervision over the In New quarantine regulations. The same remark We is'applicable to our fruits. We know that diseases in fruits occur in different States. We must have a uniform law in regard to j the prevention of the spread of those disbecause if New South Wales permits frui t trees to remain on her borders, be it is only a question of time when those diseases will find admission to Victoria and go right through the various States. at | I feel that these are questions which was ought to be taken up by the Federal 1 Government. I have already referred to the importance of paying more attention to export trade. In view of the great bilities before Australia, I think that should take active steps to ascertain the movements of trade, the state of the markets of the world, the best places to which to ship, new methods of cultivation which are being employed, new products and new machinery, the condition of our produce upon arrival afc its destination and when is placed in the hands of the consumers We should note defects, ascertain their causes, and see that, our products do suffer through misrepresentation or jealousy, as fchey undoubtedly do at . the present time. We musfc also keep a watchful eye over the "" get up "" and quality of our ports, ascertain whether our system of tribution is faulty, and if so, how it improved, and comparefchefacilities offered to us with those of our successful comof petitors. In these and many ofcher ways the returns from our products could do so. be augmented. Only the other da} one r exporter told me that he was getting phraseology. -£d. perlb. more for his leather now on 'account of the improved system which been adopted to bring the users of the leather in closer touch with those exporting it to the old country. He said that when went to England he found that his leather was going into two or three different hands. Two or three different people profit, but by placing his leather directly with the manufacture]; he was able to gefc - Jd. per lb. more for it. That additional sum was of great importance to the pronot ducer. The same thing may be said with regard to our other products. In view the great effort which is being made attention by all countries to improve the condition myself. 'of agriculture in their midst, it behoves to make our farmers acquainted with the latest methods of cultivation, to induce them to acquire information with regard the ""gefc up"" of their products and the ing of the cost of production, in order enable them fco capture the markets of world. It behoves us fco be olive, and see whether we cannot in some way improve our conditions. We have a very large growing increase in our agricultural producthe tion and in other directions. I feel sure if* our Government will only take steps appoint a representative-o r a number representatives, if it be necessaiy-i various parts of the world, to advise as to the various improvements in agriculthe ture, the latest machinery, the new possiproducts, and the best way to put we them on the markets of the world, the result will be of incalculable benefit to the producers of our States. I hope that our Parliament will see fit to adopt a resolution to form a department of agriculture. I do not like the motion in its present form, because in my opinion it will only eni t able us to look to one countiy for informa1 tion bearing on agricultural education. I think that we could with advantage not follow many of the systems practised in Prance, Germany, and ofcher countries. Ifc is tying our hands too much to say that we shall only adopt a system on the lines laid exdown by the United States. Let us adopt; diswhat we think is suitable in their scheme can be to our conditions, and look round to see whether we cannot improve on the methods dealing with these matters followed by other countries. I feel sure that we can",24

I know what the farmers require, and what ought to be done for them by a to department of agriculture. I speak warmly lessenupon this matter, because to a very large to extent, I think that the prosperity of our the agriculturists depends upon the system to adopted by the States and by the Commonwealth Parliament. Whilst I know that and some of our States may take exception to action of this Parliament in making any that proposals bearing upon agricultural educafco tion, I feel that if they are approached of - as they no doubt will be approached-in n a fair and conciliatory way, they will not them place any obstructions whatever in the way of the Federal Government, but will assist them to perfect their scheme.

NA WESTERN AUSTRALIA.",26
41,Mr MAHON,ABORIGINAL INHABITANTS OF," I move That, with a view to determine the expediency or otherwise of amending section 51, sub-section (26), of the Constitution Act by the omission words "" other than the aboriginal races of any State,"" it is, in the opinion of this House, desirable that a Royal Commission should be appointed to investigate and report1. On the condition of the aboriginal inhabitants of Western Australia north of the 30th parallel of latitude. 2. On the system by which aboriginal natives are assigned and indentured to white employers. 3. On the administration"" of justice in the lower courts of Western Australia.in so far as the aboriginal inhabitants of that State are or have been affected thereby. That the foregoing resolution be conveyed by address to His Excellency the Governor General. At this late hour, I shall endeavour to be as brief and concise as possible in submitting this motion to the consideration of honourable members. I take it at the outset that the principal objection which can be urged against the motion is that the Commonwealth has no right to interfere in any matter in which it is excluded from interference by the Constitution. But I should like to point out that the motion is simply for an inquiry to ascertain whether ov not it is desirable that the Constitution should be amended so as to allow the Commonwealth to deal with the aboriginal race of any State. I am induced to take this action principally by reason of the fact that afc none of the Conventions afc which the Constitution was fashioned-and I have gone through the debates very carefully-wa s the question of the control of the aboriginal races by the Commonwealth ever discussed. Therefore I consider that possibly the exclusion of this question from our control is simply due to the idea of some draftsman, and that it is a fair question for this Parliament to consider whether we should not now amend the Constitution, or, at any rate, make an inquiry with a view to bringing under our Parliament the management of the aboriginal races. I believe that the Prime Minister in speaking a few days ago, expressed himself as disinclined to admit that the Commonwealth Parliament should have anything to do with this question. Bufc I would point out that this Parliament at times may have duties to discharge much higher than mere bread and butter questions. In this particular matter' the reputation of the whole people of Australia is at stake. It is not a pleasant tiling that the newspapers of the world should repeatedly contain . references to slavery under the British flag in Western of the Australia. I have here an extract from the London Truth of the 20th June last, in which the following occurs :Correspondence in the Melbourne press is indicative of a healthier opinion on the subject of the ill-treatment of the aborigines in Western Australia. Writer after writer has testified from personal observation to the ruthless oppression of the black population. The natives "" indented ""or ""assigned"" to squatters are in the position of slaves, and in the sparsely inhabited bush their taskmasters can use the knout practically unhindered. . . . The Age expresses the belief that many outrages upon the aborigines arc allowed to piss unpunished and unexposed, and calls upon the new Commonwealth Parliament, as a duty which it owes to itself and to civilization at large, to institute a searching inquiry into the whole question. Assuredly the Commonwealth cannot better begin its career than by improving the lot of the dwindling native race. Then, again, the London Daily News in March of the present year published a letter from a correspondent who drew attention to the flogging to death of three natives at Bendhu, and gave a lurid picture of the cruelty inflicted on the victims, specially epioting the remarks of the Chief Justice of Western Australia, before whom the case was tried, and who said that the crime was one of the most ferocious, cowardly, and brutal ever brought under his notice. I think that as these reports have got into the papers of the world and the matter has been discussed outside of Australia, it is eminently the duty of the Commonwealth Parliament to take the matter up. It may be objected that this is a duty which should be remitted to the Parliament of Western Australia. But I would point out that the Parliament of Western Australia is unfortunately not even yet a representative Parliament, inasmuchas one electorate-to take a particular instance, that of East Kimberley-havin g only 107 electors, returns a member to the Assembly, whereas in the electorate of Kalgoorlie it takes about 5,000 persons to return a member. I have no wish to say anything disparaging or disrespectful of any other Parliament, but we are not here to gloss over any facts, and I take it that the Western Australian Legislature does not truly represent the people. Then, again, if the Western Australian Parliament did appoint a commission to inquire into this question, I believe that the verdict, whatever it might be, would not command that universal respect which the verdict of an independent Legislature, such as this, would secure from the outside world. Ifc was pointed out many years ago by the Chief Justice of Western Australia, who was then acting as Administrator of the Government that an inquiry should be held into ; this matter by some independent body. I have here a despatch from Sir Alexander Onslow, addressed to the Secretary of State for the Colonies on ISth October, 1S95, A dispute had arisen between the Aborigines Board and the Government, and the Administrator made the following statement; for the information of the Secretary of State for the Colonies :(2) The objects which the members of the Board have had in view in framing their memorandum is again to draw attention to their previously expressed opinion to the effect that it is necessary to ""hold an inquiry into the working of the Boaid and of the distribution of the fund at its disposal"" for the purpose of "" ascertaining accurately the status of the aborigines of the colony, and their relations tofchesettlers from an external point of view . . . . (4) Further the language of the memorandum . . . would seem to show that the Board would wish the inquiiy to be held by persons not connected with the colony . . . . I woul d direct the special attention of honourable members to fchis statement (5) There can, I think, be no doubt that a thoroughly independent and impartial investigation into the condition of the aboriginal natives of the colony, followed by an authoritative report thereon, would be of very great value at the present crisis 'of the history of this question. Now that was the opinion of the Administrator of the Government in 1895 - I may say that the Imperial Government all through has shown a disinclination to hand over to the Western Australian Parliament the absolute control of the natives. Furthermore the Imperial Government has consistently shown very great consideration for the natives, and I can hardly understand why, in founding this Constitution, this question was never considered, because if the honourable gentlemen who are responsible for the Constitution had looked at the instructions which Her Majesty gave Sir John Young, as far back as 1861, when he was Governor of New South Wales, they would have seen the following, among other instructions:And it is our further will and pleasure that you do to the utmost of your power promote religion and education amongst the native inhabitants of our said colony (Sew South Wales), and of the lands and islands thereto adjoining; and that you do especially take care to protect theni in their persons and in the free enjoyment of their possessions ; and that you do by all lawful means prevent and restrain all violence - and injustice which may in any manner be practised or' attempted against them, and that you take such measures as may appear to be necessaiy to further their conversion to the Christian faith and their advancement in civilization."" As I have stated, all through, the Imperial Government has shown great anxiety* for wounding the welfare of the aboriginal natives, in proof of which I refer to legislation passed by the Imperial authorities before Western Australia became an independent colony. Every one of the Acts assented to by the Governor, as representing the Queen, show that disposition. If we go back to the first law passed in 1841, when Mr John H u t t was Governor, we see that the preamble declares that British law is inapplicable to aboriginals, since they are ignorant of any future state of rewards and punishments. Then it goes on to dispense with the usual form of oath, and allows aboriginals to make an affirmation of truth, &c. The next Ac t simply extended that law, but later on certain enactments were assented to by the Governor to protect aboriginal girls against anything in the way of seduction or attack. Furthermore, the first comprehensive Act that was passed in connection with the aboriresponsible ginals was assented to by Governor Weld, and is dated 1873. That marked the beof ginning of the system of hiring out natives for pearling and other industries, and the agreements provided for were hedged to round with all kinds of restrictions and safeguards for the unfortunate natives. That Act provides that the agreements whipped, shall be witnessed by a justice of the peace or other person appointed byfcheGovernor, that the natives shall understand and assent to the agreement, that they shall be perfectly free and under no sort this of fear, coercion, or constraint, that they shall not be engaged for more than twelve months' service, that they must be males and physically f it for the work, and that the last person engaging a native must return him to his district. The penalties^ for any breach of the agreement are very severe. Several other Acts were subsequently passed, and all show the same solisay citude for the natives. Later on it became female 1 necessary to distinctly provide by Legislation that no justice of the peace interested in matter of complaint should sit on the bench for the hearing of such complaint. This unique provision is found in an Act passed in 1883,, when Sir Napier Broome was Governor.",26
42,Mr CROUCH,ABORIGINAL INHABITANTS OF,Surely there was no necesmight sity for a statute to provide for that. Mr Mahon.,28
43,Mr MAHON,ABORIGINAL INHABITANTS OF,"Yes . Section 4 of the Act 47 Vict. No. 8 provides that aresident magissfcrate and one justice of the peace may try a native for misdemeanour and give him two years. Section 5 excludes cases of murder, with intent, rape, burglary with assault and intent fco murder, these being remittedfcothe Supreme Court; section 6 allows any resident magistrate or two justices of the peace to give a native one year's imprisonment for offences under section 4, and section 7 allows one justice of the peace to do what is provided for in section 6 if there is no ofcher justice offchepeace within 20 miles.",28
44,Mr BARTON,ABORIGINAL INHABITANTS OF,"If a magistrate trying such a case were interested, the Supreme Court would stop the whole proceedings at once.",28
45,Mr MAHON,ABORIGINAL INHABITANTS OF,"Buf c the Prime Minister scarcely realizes the difficulty of remitting cases, say, from Roeburne down to Perth; it is practically impossible.",28
46,Mr BARTON,ABORIGINAL INHABITANTS OF,No doubt.,28
47,Mr MAHON,ABORIGINAL INHABITANTS OF,"The next; ActfchatI wish to quote was passed in 1892, two years after government came into force, distinctly omitted the provision that justices the peace must not try cases in which they are interested. As soon as the colony became a self-governing colony it proceeded make that enactment;. This was the first time that the law provided for the whipping of natives. It not only allows natives to be but alters the principal Act by giving any single magistrate power to imprison a native for two years. Previously to that it required a resident magistrate and an honorary justice to deal with such cases. Under Ac t of 1892 one justice may imprison a native for two years; and, in the case of males, order a whipping up to 25 strokes.",28
48,Mr OMALLEY,ABORIGINAL INHABITANTS OF,And they did it too.,28
49,Mr MAHON,ABORIGINAL INHABITANTS OF,"If the offender is apparently not more than sixteen years of age, the court can order him to be whipped to ' the extent of not more than twelve strokes. 1",28
50,Mr BARTON,ABORIGINAL INHABITANTS OF,Did the honourable member there was power to inflict strokes on a,28
51,Mr MAHON,ABORIGINAL INHABITANTS OF,"There is no power to any inflict strokes on a female. In the case of males the punishment was to beimprisonment with 25 lashes, but if the offender were apparently under 16 years he was to get no more than twelve strokes. The whipping was to be inflicted before a justice of the peace, and take place, I presume, in the presence of the individual justice who tried the offence. This House need scarcely be that in a sparsely-populated country like Western Australia justices of the peace are not found under every bush. Honourable members will see the attitude of the Imperial Government if they will give their attention for a moment to the legislation which was passed in 1886, when Sir Napier Broome was Governor of the colony. Under that Act was established the Aborigines Protection Board. The extraordinary provision was put in the Act that the board was to be appointed and the money expended solely under the control of the Governor of the colony; that is to say, the Governor's responsible advisers were excluded from any power either in the appointment of the board or the administration of the funds. The duties of the board were to apply the public money in distributing clothes, medicine, rations, and so on. Prom that dates the period during which natives, males and females, have been indentured or assigned to squatters. The system of contracts established by that Act provided that the natives so assigned must be over fourteen years of age, and must understand the language of the contract. The contract must be free and voluntary, and be for a period .of not over twelve months. The employer on his part had to provide substantial, good, and sufficient rations, clothing, medicine, and attendance when practicable-""whe n practicable"" it will be observed-and must give the native 30 days' leave in each year. The Act also gave power to a resident magistrateto take the children, either aboriginals or half-castes, and apprentice them until the age of 21 years under the usual penalties. A single justice of the peace was allowed latitude to imprison for one month any aborigine not decently clothed from neck to knee, and found in atown which he refused to quit forthwith. In 1892, immediately after the adoption of responsible government, legislation against these unfortunate natives began to wear an aspect of severity. By another A ct passed on the 18th March, 1892, any aborigine refusing or neglecting to work, or absenting himself from work, or deserting - without leave, or for any other breach of the contract, was guilty of a criminal offence, punishable by three months' imprisonment with or without hard labour. The employer for breach of the contract was not to be imprisoned, bufc might be fined up to £ 2 0 . [200] told Mr HIGGINS - Imprisonment for breaking a contract ?",28
52,Mr MAHON,ABORIGINAL INHABITANTS OF,"There was imprisonment for the native who broke the contract, bufc not for the employer. That is to say, the employer was to be allowed to break a conbract and pay a monetary penalty; bufc if a native broke the contract, he not being worth anything, was sent to gaol. In January, 1893, also after the establishment of responsible government, and when Sir William Robinson was Governor of the colony, another Act was passed. Up to that timefcheword ""court,"" whenever used in these Acts, meant; a resident; magistrate and another magistrate; but by the Act of 1S93 "" court ""was defined to mean any single magistrate sitting alone. The Act omitted to provide that a justice of the peace interested in the subject matter of the complaint; should be ineligible to sit and adjudicate. The power originally given to a resident magistrate and another magistrate was to imprison a native for one year; that was enlarged to two years, and then - by the Act of 1S93 the power was still further extended to enable a single magistrate to imprison for three years. If there was a previous - conviction against the native, the magistrate might extend the term of imprisonment even to five years, with or without a whipping.",29
53,Mr KINGSTON,ABORIGINAL INHABITANTS OF,No judgment by an interested man would hold good.,29
54,Mr MAHON,ABORIGINAL INHABITANTS OF,"If the Minister for Trade and Customs had been here a few minutes ago he would have heard me say, in reply to a similar observation by the Prime Minister, that it would be practically impossible to appeal to the Supreme Court against a magistrate's decision, in the case of a native tried afc Roeburne, Derby, or any of the places away up north.",29
55,Mr KINGSTON,ABORIGINAL INHABITANTS OF,An interested man should be struck off the rolls for sitting.,29
56,Mr MAHON,ABORIGINAL INHABITANTS OF,"Before I finish I think the right honourable gentleman will be satisfied that a lot of the magistrates over there ought to have been struck off the rolls. Section 4 of the Act of 1893 provides that a "" copy of any previous conviction purporting to be signed by a justice of the peace or police officer not under the rank of sergeant"" shall "" upon proof of identity of offender""-legal members of the House will be able to appreciate this-be sufficient evidence of such conviction "" without proof of signature or official character of person appearing to have signed the same."" Thafc is to say, a native convicted at Derby, or presumed to be convicted afc Derby, can on a certificate purporting to be signed by a justice of the peace or sergeant of police be treated in Perth as a person who has already been convicted. It may be objected that the people concerned do not wish for this proposed Royal commission. I would like to say here that I have a perfectly open mind in regard to these charges which have been made against settlers. These men have had a very hard time. They have gone out into the wilderness and faced privation and death in a great many forms, and are deserving of every sympathy. I feel perfectly sure that the natives have been generously and fairly treated by a great many of them. I should be very sorry indeed if this House were to gefc an impression from my speech that I believe all the charges that have been levelled against the squatters in . the north-western portion of Western Australia. On the contrary, I may inform honourable members that I was talking some time ago to a gentleman who was stationed for some thirteen years in Wyndham, and who knows the countiy in which the wild natives are particularly dangerous and troublesome, namely, the Kimberley country. He told me privately-h e is a Government officer who has no interest one way or the other in misrepresenting the matter - that the cases of cruelty were very rare so far as he could make out, and that on the whole the natives were very fairly treated. That I put on the other side. Bufc at the same time, before I touch on the charges made, I would like to read a statement in regard to fchis demand for a Roj'al commission made by Mr Frank Connor, who represents East Kimberley in the Western Australian Parliament, and who intimately knows the district where a good many of these troubles take place with the natives. Mr Connor is not opposed in any shape or form to the appointment of a Royal commission. Speaking to a reporter of the West Australian on 24th June, 1901, be said :Some of these writers (on aboriginal questions) have urged that a Royal commission should be appointed to inquire into the condition of the blacks up in the north. No one more than Mr Mahon. would welcome the appointment of such a commission, for its investigations would undoubtedly prove that the East Kimberley settlers have been maligned. There may be a few exceptions, bnt I am speaking of the majority. That being the opinion of the parliamentary representative of the people concerned, I do not think any person could say that it would be unfair from the point of view of the settlers fco appoint fchis commission. I think I may now refer to charges which have been made, not by idle or irresponsible people, but by people in very high positions in Western Australia, in regard to the cruelties practised on these natives. First of all, I would like to read the opinion of the Anglican Bishop of Perth, Dr Riley, who paid a visit to the north spme years ago. When he returned he was asked by the Governor of the colony, Sir Gerard Smith, to give a report on his trip ; and on the 21st July, 1S99,fchisis what Bishop Riley said, amongst other things :One cause, perhaps the greatest cause in my opinion, of the cruelty is the system by which natives are indentured to settlers. This is only a form of slavery, as the natives, for the most part, do not know what it means, and for the rest, do not dare not to sign the agreement. As soon as a man is indentured he is absolutely under the power of his master. . . . I think that unless a policeman is really attacked he should not be allowed to shoot at natives. The last sentence, of course, has reference to the dispersal of natives by the police. It will be' noticed that Bishop Riley uses very strong language, saying that the indenture system "" is only a form of slavery."" I may say that within the present year, since Bishop Riley used that expression, statements have been published, and are not denied, that the slavery goes further than the mere fact that the aborigines work for the squatters for nothing. I have here a statement, published in Perth not very long ago. I do not wish to give names, but this statement refers to squatters having employed their natives for the benefit of others, and to have charged the latter for their services. The extract readsThe item referred to above is on extract from a formidable contra account furnished to the saddle firm, and runs as follows :13 days' work of native women at 2s. 6d £1 12 6 2 days' work of native 'boy, at 2s. 6cl £0 5 0 Let it be understood that the blacks who did the work are simply commandeered by the squatter. The only recompense they receive is the usual I starvation allowance. If they attempt to run away the squatters, who are all justices of the peace, act in concert-o r rather by - conspiracy. They assign the blacks to one another as freely as if they were beasts of burden, nnd if they attempt to escape from their illegally appointed masters, they are mercilessly flogged.",29
57,Mr HIGGINS,ABORIGINAL INHABITANTS OF,Who says that ?,31
58,Mr MAHON,ABORIGINAL INHABITANTS OF,That is published in a Perth paper called the Sunday Times.,31
59,Mr KINGSTON,ABORIGINAL INHABITANTS OF,Does the paper give the name of the authority *,31
60,Mr MAHON,ABORIGINAL INHABITANTS OF,The newspaper is the authority.,31
61,Mr HIGGINS,ABORIGINAL INHABITANTS OF,Was that Mr Vosper's paper 1,31
62,Mr MAHON,ABORIGINAL INHABITANTS OF,It was published about two months ago.,31
63,Mr ELIAS SOLOMON,ABORIGINAL INHABITANTS OF,Mr Vosper has been dead some time.,31
64,Mr MAHON,ABORIGINAL INHABITANTS OF,"The newspaper extract goes onThe blacks in the north-west rarely receive any money whatever. They are forced to work for any person to whom the squatter chooses to let them, and the. latter pockets the result of their labours, as in this cose, and slings them a morsel of food to starve on. If this bo not slavery pure and simple, we must admit we are ignorant of the meaning nf the word. Butldonot want to read newspaper extracts, when I have matter of equal import from people high in position. Dr Riley, in the present year, when visiting Melbourne, wrote, as follows to a gentleman, who has placed the'letter, which is dated 17th May, at my-disposal:You will bo glad to hear that I am always fighting the battle of the natives with those in authority. . . . It is still necessary, apparently, to fight the battle of the poor natives with those in authority. Bishop Riley goes onThings are much better in the West now. No one dare boost of his evil deeds. Six years ago, wlion I came, it was quite common to hear it. What I am now about to read is not the irresponsible attack of a newspaper, but occurs in a long communication from the Glovernor, Sir Gerard Smith, to the .Secretary of State for the Colonies on 19th May, 1896 :There can be no doubt in the mind of any reasonable and humane man that we are bound to do all we can for the 15,000 or more natives among us, whose means of livelihood will be destroyed, whom day by day we are driving back further and further into remote spots, to whom we deny the privilege of sharing in paid labour on the - mine fields, whose well and water soakages are exhausted by the incursion of large parties of-explorers with horses and camels, whom we flog and imprison with a severity all proportion to the nature of the offence committed when they yield to a temptation, induced by starvation or thirst.",31
65,Mr WATSON,ABORIGINAL INHABITANTS OF,"May I be allowed, sir,' as we have reached the hour at which the House usually adjourns on a Friday, to suggest that the honourable member, with concurrence, might be allowed to continue.his speech ou a date to be fixed.",31
66,Mr SPEAKER,ABORIGINAL INHABITANTS OF,"If the honourable member for Coolgardie desires to continue his speech on a later day, it will be competent for him to ask leave and foithe House to grant it .",31
67,Mr MAHON,ABORIGINAL INHABITANTS OF,"I feci deeply obliged to the honourable member for Bland and to yourself, sir, because I could not begin until after half-past three o'clock, and I have hardly had time to introduce the matter. I ask leave to be allowed to continue my speech on the 6th September. Leave granted. Debate adjourned. ADJOURNMENT. FRIDAY SITTING : ORDER OF BUSINESS r PARLIAMENTARY LIBRARY . Motion (by MR . BARTON) proposed That the House do now adjourn.",31
68,Mr THOMAS,ABORIGINAL INHABITANTS OF," May I ask the Prime Minister whether he will make some arrangement to meet earlier on a Friday or to abolish the Friday sitting. For the House to meet at two o'clock and adjourn at four, seems to me rather a farce. Wc ought either to meet at ten o'clock or to abolish the sitting, so.os to enable us to go back to Sydney on Thursday.",31
69,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,ABORIGINAL INHABITANTS OF," I wish to bring under the notice of the head of the Government a paragraph in the press this morning respecting a dispute between the State Government and the Federal Government over the control of our Library. I understand that we are paying the officers of the Library, and that there is an objection raised to the Federal Government having any control",31
70,Mr BARTON,ABORIGINAL INHABITANTS OF, I can give the honourable member an explanation which will save him from the necessity of going on.,31
71,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,ABORIGINAL INHABITANTS OF,V e r y well.,31
72,Mr BARTON,ABORIGINAL INHABITANTS OF,"The paragraph referring to the dispute does not cover the ground. and There is an arrangement made, verbally out of between the Premier of Yictoria and myself that the whole of - this matter shall be inquired into, at a conference between the Speakers and the Presidents of the two Parliaments. Unfortunately, while there has been on informal conversation, the necessary authorities to the Speaker and President of the State Parliament have not yet reached their hands, but when they do the whole of these matters will be taken into consideration together, and I have no doubt with a satisfactory result.",31
73,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,ABORIGINAL INHABITANTS OF," I do not desire to continue the debate but only to suggest, the advisableaess of having the matter settled as soon as possible, because the present state of affairs only tends to create feeling where none should exist.' In the interests of both Members of Parliament and of the officers of the Library on agreement should be come to without delay.",32
74,Mr BARTON,ABORIGINAL INHABITANTS OF,I am doing my best in that direction.,32
75,Mr A MCLEAN,ABORIGINAL INHABITANTS OF," I would like to draw the attention of the Prime Minister to the great importance of many of the measures on the business-paper. It is desirable that the fullest opportunity should be afforded to honourable members to read and consider the provisions of the measures to be proceeded with from time to time. If, .at the adjournment of the House each night, the Government could see their way to inform honourable members of the business to be taken next, I am sure that they would come here much better prepared to deal with it than they do. That practice was followed in the Victorian Parliament, and I think it is a very good one.",32
76,Mr BARTON,ABORIGINAL INHABITANTS OF,"On most occasions at the close of the evening on the motion for .adjournment I have indicated what the business would be for the next sitting. On one or two occasions I have been prompted by a question, and on other occasions I have - done it voluntarily. Next Tuesday we propose to take the consideration in committee of the Governor General's message, whichshould be only a matter of a minute,.and next the third reading of the State Laws and .Records Recognition Bill, which is a formal matter. Then my honourable colleague, the Minister for Trade and Customs, wishes to finish the consideration of the Customs Bill in Gommittee, and after that, my honourable friend, Sir Philip Fysh, proposes to move the second reading of the Post and Telegraph Bills, so as to give honourable members an opportunity to consider its scope, but not to continue the debate. It will, of course, be open to honourable members to have a reasonable adjournment so as to make themselves well informed on the Bill. Then we propose to take the second reading of the Beer Excise Bill, which is a measure of much less difficulty, and may, I fancy, be proceeded with from second reading at once. As to the Friday sitting, I would ask the honourable member for the Barrier- I do not think he was here at the time-to look at the reply I gave to a question on that subject one day this week. I think he will find that I explained the whole position so far as it affects the Government. Nevez-the less, I shall give every consideration to the representationhe has made. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 4.10 p.m.",32
