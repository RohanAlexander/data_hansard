Will he kindly state what work is being carried out, how many men are employed, and at what rates and wages? Mr KING O'MALLEY - The answers to the honourable member's questions are these1. Some of the survey hands employed the survey parties are paid at the rate of per foitnight. Labourers employed on other ordiuary Crown leases. work are paid 83. per day. 2. No, except those, who must necessarily employed on ordinary domestic duty. 3.

ELLIOT JOHNSON asked the Postmaster-General, upon notice I. Will he inform the House what steps (if any) have been taken towards providing uniform stamps for general use throughout the Commonwealth? 2.

3,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Does the Prime Minister intend at an early date to put into plain English the meaning of the resolution carried last night in the Committee of Ways and Means? It would be a great advantage to have it explained thoroughly.,15
4,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Wide Bay-Treasurer ) [10.38] - Last night "" I promised the honourable member for Darling Downs that a number of examples would be prepared to-show the operation of the Govern-, ment proposals; they will be available today, and will, I think, assist honourable members to understand what is intended. I move That the Report of the CommiUee of and Means be now adopted.",15
5,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"Wakefield) [ 39]--It is of great importance 1 0 honourable members should know exactly the range of the Government's proposals, and I shall therefore be glad if the Prime with Minister or the Attorney-General will in4s. form me whether the tax is to apply to The Attorneybe General said last night that the beneficial interest of the lessee of any Crown lease will 'be taxed, but I should like to know emwhether it is intended to tax all Crown leases.",15

7,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"Pastora l P fortnight. er leases and odier Crown leases. These have s er never before, in Australia, been made the subject of land taxation, with the sole exception of the absolutely perpetual leases, without re-valuation, which obtain in South Australia, and are subject to land tax. All other Crown leases, except where the land is in process of alienation, are exempt , from taxation.",15
8,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,Are the perpetual leases referred to charged a fixed rent indefinitely ?,15
9,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"The absolutely perpetual lease is held at a fixed rent, and is subject to land tax.",15
10,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"West Sydney-Attor ney-General) [10.42] - The matter is of considerable importance, but it will be better to discuss it when the machinery Bill is under consideration. Shortly, as I explained last night, the position of the Crown lessee under the Bill is that he will not be taxed unless the rent which he pays is so much below the full annual value of the land that the difference, if capitalized, would exceed £5,000. The honourable member's wide experience of South Australian land laws must make him aware that practically not.half per cent, of the Crown lessees will have to pay taxation. It is not for any arbitrary reason that Crown lessees have been brought within the Bill, but because of the adoption of a general principle applied uniformly..",15
11,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Will the tax apply to all Crown lessees, whether their leases are perpetual or not?",15
12,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"There is no distinction. The interest of the lessees is calculated on the amount by which their annual payments, if capitalized, would fall short of the true value of the land. Ways We cannot tax the Crown estate, and we tax the interest of the lessee only where, if he were untaxed, he would have an adthat vantage over the. ordinary lessee.",15
13,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,Unde r what clause are Crown lessees taxable?,16
14,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"It was thought at first that it would be unnecessary to specially mention Crown lessees, but it has since been found advisable to draft a clause to cover them; otherwise they could not be treated fairly, as they would not be entitled to any deduction as is the case with other lands.",16
15,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,I knew that the Bill did not do what the honourable member said it did.,16
16,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"The principle is affirmed in clause 26, which deals with all leases commenced before the Act. is the principle we intend to apply to all Crown leases whether commenced before or ufter the coming into' operation of the Bill.",16
17,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"Angas) [10.45] - Evidently this Bill has not been very caref u l ly scrutinized before being introduced. Having looked at the relevant clauses after the inquiry made by the honourable member for Wakefield, I failed to find any provision by which the policy of touching Crown lessees could be enforced. Bill submitted to us is one to tax freehold estates ancl all estates derived therefrom. The Crown estate is not a freehold, ancl a lessee under the Crown cannot possibly have an estate derived from a freehold, because a freeholder is a holder under the Crown. We are told that the Government, even at this early stage, are going to amend the machinery of this very widereaching Bill . I hope that this apparent change in policy- I cannot imagine that ii mistake has been made in drafting, because the blunder would be a most egregious one-is not to be brought about, because it will involve a serious doubt as to the constitutionality of a good deal of this Bill . Whilst not throwing doubt upon our power to impose land taxation, if it is taxation, I must say that a doubt will be cast upon the constitutionality of this legislation' if - we tax Crown lessees, and through them affect the instrumentalities of the States. Surely the Government are not going to impair the propriety of. the tax by taxing - a leasehold interest under the Crown? If lancl were held at a rent that was not fair to the State, it would be for the State itself to raise that rent at the next valuation, but, in effect, the Commonwealth Government would tax the very rental value which belongs to the State. think that we can do that. I am not speaking now from the point of view of the constitutionality of sueh an act; I think that a State can make an arrangement under its leasehold Acts to prevent that being clone. The South Australian Parliament has expressly declared, if my memory serves me rightly, that the Crown shall own the sale value represented by the difference between the rent paid and the true rent.",16
18,Mr FAIRBAIRN,Unknown,Who is to settle the true rent?,16
19,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"That is settled by the next appraisement. If land is held at a rental of ^ 2 0 per annum, and it is That found that the true rent, as settled by sales in the market, should be ^ 3 0 per annum, that becomes the true rent. The idea of the Government is to tax the capitalized value at 10 per cent, in relation to the duration of the lease. As a matter of fact, some of the Soutli Australian Acts expressly prevent that being done, because they say that in such cases the difference belongs to the Crown, and will he taken eventually by the Crown. The Government ought to leave well alone. If The they are going to dismay their followers by throwing a doubt upon the whole constitutionality of a Bill of this far-reaching character, then they will not be acting in accordance with the best interests of those who have sent them here.",16
20,Mr FISHER,Unknown,That is not a question to be considered here.,16
21,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I do not wish to block the measure, but I think it would be a great pity for us to be launched again into a sea of doubt as to the constitutionality of a far-reaching measure like this, which seems to have divided public opinion in Australia to a very large extent.  understood the Attorney-General to say that the power to tax Crown lessees, for which this Bill does not provide, will be covered by an amending clause. If that is so, I ask the honourable gentleman to reconsider this question very carefully, for such an amendment would broaden the principle of the Bill altogether beyond the extent contemplated. I am astounded at the statement made by the honourable gentleman, that Crown leases, whether pastoral or otherwise, are to be brought under the operation qf this measure. I urge him to look into the whole matter and to seek I do not advice based on broad experience of country and not merely of city properties, respecting what would be the result of such a proposal.",16
22,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Hume) [10.52]. - I think that we are correct in assuming from the statement made by the Attorney General that this Bill when amended will go further than was ever contemplated by being applied to lessees of the Crown. I agree with the ex-Attorney-General the Government cannot do what they propose in that regard, because I think that, the right of the States as owners would be asserted, and would effectually block action in that direction. may, such a proposal would be a staggering blow at the imposition of equitable land taxation. The land tax proposals of the Government, as set out in the newspapers this morning, are difficult of compiehension, but I sincerely hope that the tine principle of land taxation will be adhered to by the Ministry. ciple underlying the proposal to which we expected to be asked to agree is, first of all, that a tax should be imposed on verylarge estates. This Bill, however, goes a great deal further, and I question very much whether it does not go so far as to he likely to bring about its own defeat. far as I could gather last night, it seemed to me that the schedule of rates then put before us did not rise in easy gradations from id. to i^d., and from i|d. to 2d. in the £1, and ""so forth, but jumped from 2d. to 3d. and from 3d. to 4d. in the jQi.",17
23,Mr FISHER,Unknown,No ; every pound of value takes its own gradation.,17
24,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I have had the matter explained to me by a Minister this morning, but still the whole proposition as submitted is so complicated that I ask honourable members to say whether any farmer could be reasonably expected to understand it. Mr . MCWILLIAMS - He is not asked to understand it . He is simply asked to pay.",17
25,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"That is so. I am reminded in this connection of the menu in French, which is often put before one, and which the waiter himself cannot explain. I know something of algebra, but I confess that I cannot understand this schedule. I do not wish to put any obstacle in the way of the passing of land taxation, but I certainly do desire that principles shall be adhered to. I desire, to see the imposition of a tax that will have the effect that we have always desired. Our intention was that we should so tax large estates as to cause them to be more closely settled than they are. I fail to see why a tax should be imposed merely for the sake of imposing taxation. The Commonwealth Parliament is placing itself in an unenviable position if , in order to return to the States ,£5,000,000 per annum, it has to tax the people to find that money. that It would have been better to give the States just what we could afford, and leave them to impose the taxation necessary to provide the revenue requisite for their own purposes. We ought not to imBe that as it pose taxation merely for the sake of finding revenue for the States. My desire is that we should adhere to the principle of taxing large properties, so as to make more lancl available for settlement.",17
26,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Parramatta) [10.56] - I agree with the honourable member for Hume. The main prin- Mr BATCHELOR - What, in reference to the menu?",17
27,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The honourable gentleman's interjection reminds me that we have it on the authority of the honourable meinber for Hume that Ministers know So no more about the proposals they are submitting to the House than a waiter knows of the French on the menu that he puts before one.,17
28,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I did not say that.,17
29,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I cordially agree with my honourable friend.. There are many matters in connection with this proposal that need to be explained. We are treading paths that have never been previously trodden; and difficulties always arise when we enter upon paths that are expressly forbidden, not only by the Decalogue, but by the Constitution, which is our political Decalogue. However, I suppose that all these matters will be unravelled in Committee. I am surprised to hear, for the first time, that Ministers, who professed to believe with all the ardour of their political faith in the relationship of landlord and tenant, as applied to the land-owning of the country, are interfering with that ideal --perfec t as it is, according to their stand-point, from an economic point of view. I am surprised that they are taking steps to disturb that relationship as it exists today between the Crown and its tenants. The Crown and its tenants ought to be presumed to be proceeding on a fair basis. Whether that is so or not, we have no right to interfere with their relationship, which is fixed by the Statutes of the States. As the honourable member for Hume has said, such matters - should be left to the States to control and Tegulate. If I understand him aright, he - says that we have no right to impose this tax, except to burst up large estates.",17
30,Mr WEST,Unknown,And for revenue.,18
31,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"There should be no revenue, according to the dictum laid - down by the honourable member for Hume.",18
32,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I there should be no revenue.,18
33,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"But the honMinister orable member said that we ought not to for the sake of taxing, and that to the same thing. Our primary object, he said, ought to be some other than reto venue, ancl the honourable member is not inconsistent in his statement. ing of the honourable member's language on the platforms of the country is that he exactly what is being dona. Relieves there should in no case be double land taxation.",18
34,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I do not say that.,18
35,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The honourable portunity member has always taken up .that attitude, ancl never any other; he told his constituwe ents very clearly at the last election that what is proposed. there ought not to be two Governments taxcrise ing the same land.",18
36,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I did not say thing of the kind !,18

39,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I am quite liminary :.sure I am right. I hope the Government wiil issue the tables, and also a memoranhas dum setting forth clearly and concisely an Bill. explanation of the taxes; but it should not be such a memorandum as was issued i another case and intended to - through the country for political purposes. All that has been decided by the people, who may be presumed to have instructed honourable members opposite to proceed with the land tax up to, at any rate, 4CI. in the £ 1 .

We are beginning to Bill. realise for the first time the difference between propaganda on the platform and - crystallizing of the people's desires in Statutes of the Commonwealth. I hope, therefore, that the Government will issue a memorandum containing as much information as possible. I also suggest that this measure ought not to be proceeded with on Tuesday next. It is altogether too early to push a Bill of this kind through before even honourable members !of the House understand it . Sir: WILLIAM LYNE - I clo not think did not say there is any intention 'to push it through.",18

46,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I am glad that the matter is to be made plain, and the rough places rendered smooth; but I hope the measure will not be pressed next week.",18
47,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The other Bill will then that the be discussed, not this one.",18
48,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,We cannot,18
49,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,The matter before us has nothing to do with the machinery,18
50,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Indeed , it has, the as the honourable member will find put. the Crown leases are surely affected by the machinery Bill j and I urge that this legislation should not be pressed until we haye had proper time to digest the whole of its provisions.",18
51,Mr LIVINGSTON,Unknown,"Barker) [11.5] I hope the Government will look carefully into these proposals, and place them plainly before the House and the country. I am quite certain that leaseholders in 'South Australia thought that they were exempt from this taxation. many different kinds of leases in that State, and the State Government, instead of subjecting them to re-valuation, passed an Act bringing them under the same conditions as freeholds, for the purposes of land taxation. In my opinion, these taxation proposals will be, to some extent, interfering with State properties, and, for that reason, they require careful consideration. Perpetual leases in South Australia cannot be transferred to any person who already holds land of a certain value, and it will be seen, therefore, that the leaseholders in that State are in a very peculiar position. And, especially, care will have to be exercised in the valuation of these lands on their rental or selling value> as freehold or leasehold. I could point to hundreds of leaseholds that have been almost doubled in value by improvements, and yet there is scarcely a trace to show what has been spent by the occupiers, who thought they were free to deal with it under the State Government, without fear of further taxation in consequence. Then, again, perpetual leases in South Australia already carry a heavy land tax, and the double taxation will prove most burdensome. Indeed, I do not think that any State will be so hard hit by the Commonwealth land tax as South Australia.",19
52,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,What Oueenslancl ?,19
53,Mr LIVINGSTON,Unknown,In Queensland there are more pastoral and other leases than in South Australia.,19
54,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,There are numbers of leases in New South Wales.,19
55,Mr LIVINGSTON,Unknown,"I know no better authority than the honourable member for Hume, and I can accept what he says on such a matter. I hope, however, that the Government will not frighten people with a big land tax.  most impossible for leases to come under this tax.",19
56,Mr LIVINGSTON,Unknown,"At any rate, I hope they will not come under it . From freehold land the Governments have already had their money, though, I believe, not a quarter of the alienated areas are freehold today. It will be impossible for a man to carry out improvements on his land under the conditions contemplated, and I am afraid that land-holders may be driven to the conclusion that they had better leave the land alone if they are to be taxed in consequence of their own enThere are terprise and foresight-whicl i have made Australia what it is. In my own district I have known as much as £ 5 an acre spent in clearing and other improvements, and, m the absence of any evidence to that effect, I do not see how we are to have fair and equitable valuation.",19
57,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Darling Downs) [11.10]. - In view of the statement of the Attorney General that the taxation is to apply to Crown leases, I suggest that the Prime Minister prepare a table showing exactly the different kinds of tenure under which these leases are issued. The terms of freeholds and ordinary leaseholds are well known, and to these a uniform law might apply; but, in the case of Crown leases, of which there are several kinds throughout Australia, and very often several kinds in one State, difficulties and injustice must arise. A uniform tax may appear perfectly fair on paper, but, under the conditions., may prove unfair and inequitable in practice. I should suppose that the information I suggest has been found necessary in preparing this legislation, and there should be no difficulty in issuing a table.",19
58,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Every information that the Government can give will be available. Sir JOHN FORREST (Swan) [11.12]. - The statement of the Attorney-Genera t is very far-reaching and disquieting. L about never heard it suggested, during the elections, that Crown leases were to come under the operation of the land tax, thus affecting all the great mining and pastoral leases from the Crown. For instance, the great mines of Kalgoorlie are under lease from the Crown, and I suppose that in Western Australiaalone there are 60,000,000 or 70,000,000 acres under pastoral lease. Then, again, there are conditional purchase leases,, which, however, are of a freehold character, and in a different category. At any rate, a bombshell is nothing as compared' with the proposal of the Attorney-General, and I hope the Government will take theadvice of the honourable member for Angas, and leave well alone. It has been said that the object of the Bill is to burst up largefreehold estates; but I do not see how that principle can be attained by taxing town lands. I do not know whether it is intended by the Government to tax the mining leases.",19
59,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"The Government will never touch the miners. Sir ' JOHN FORREST - But the taxation will touch the mine owners. In most request. parts of Australia-certainl y in Western Australia and Queensland - the mine owners are only tenants of the. Crown for a number of years, and I hope that better counsels wili prevail. I wish to ask the Prime Minister to make quite clear in the Bill exactly what Ministers propose to do, there may be no doubt or confusion in minds of honourable members as to what is meant. I hope they will leave the Crown tenants alone, but if they are going to include them in the Bill, let them it quite clear so that we may know exexplanation ? actly where we are.",20
60,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,"North Sydney) [11.16] - There are in New South Wales large number of persons who hold land lease from a large proprietary, which would have to pay very heavily under this tax, and any tax imposed will have ultimately to be paid by the tenants. Some of provides"". these estates are well known, notably the Cooper estate. In that case, addition to the. ordinary difficulty exr perienced, there is the difficulty that the owner is an absentee, and ' would clause 4. pay under this Bill an increased amount of tax. The leaseholders who will pay the tax are in many cases occupying very small allotments on which they have built a villa or cottage. They will constrained to return to the owner of Cooper estate, not.only the tax that'would ordinarily be imposed if he were in tralia, but the double tax - imposed upon the House might adopt it. absentees. This will be a very great hardmeans ship on tliese people, which ho Government should ever propose to inflict, but under provisions of this measure, so far as I been able to assimilate it, these people will unamended. be called upon to pay the absentee tax, ancl under the law there will be no means for them to evade it.

68,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"Franklin) [ n . 2 6 ] . - On the last occasion I pointed out the effect of the present condition of the sugar industry on the. kindred fruit industries. Since I began to take an interest in the subject, it has always been my desire to bring the fruit-growers, on the one hand, and the sugar-growers, .on the other, into more complete union than at present. It will be seen that by far.the best customer to the cane-grower is the fruit-grower. If a man in Tasmania or Victoria plants out x acre of quinces, or other fruit, to be made into preserves, some one in Queensland tins to plant out 2 acres of cane to furnish the sugar to convert that fruit into jam. The present condition of affairs is simply impossible. A very interesting report was prepared some time ago, showing how closely allied the'two industries really are. It was read as a paper before a conference of fruit-growers in Victoria two or three years ago. I have laid the figures contained in it before fruit-grower's in my own State, and they consider that, if any thing, they are under-estimated so far as Tasmania is concerned. It is stated that in plums the fruit-grower' usually plants out 120 trees to the acre, the average produce of which is one and a half cases; or 60 lbs., per tree. The average yield per acre, therefore, is 7,200 lbs. of fruit, which, at Jd. a lb., or about' 2s. 6d._ a case, rather more .than the average price now receivable, gives a return of £ 1 5 an acre. To transform that fruit into jam requires an equal quantity of sugar, or 7,200 'lbs., the duty on which, at £ 6 a ton, is one and a half times the total, value of the fruit produced. The growergets £ 4 per ton for his fruit, and the duty on the sugar alone is £ 6 per ton. The same thing applies to apricots, which are now being grown very largely. We are sending apricots to the jam factory, at about 2s. 6d. a bushel. The duty on the sugar is £.6 per ton, and the value of the fruit is only ^ 4 . . Mr HIGGS - Has the honourable memjam ber calculated the duty per ton on jam? . Mr MCWILLIAMS - That is in prefruit cisely the same position as the duty on is sugar was in Queensland prior to Federathe tion. Directly exportation commences and production exceeds the local demand, a duty i j practically worthless. I am sure that I voice the opinion of every fruit-grower in Victoria and Tasmania when I say that if the duty on sugar were reduced by £ 3 a ton the duty on jams could be removed altogether.",21
69,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,Would the fruitgrower get more for his fruit if the duty 011 sugar werereduced ?,21
70,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"Certainly . Prior to Federation, when Queensland sugar had to compete in the markets of the other States with that from Java, Fiji,, and Mauritius, its local price was only £ 1 3 a ton. The State was then producing more than sufficient for its own requirements,plums' or and its sugar manufacturers were .in the position of the jam manufacturers of Australia today - Replying to - the interjection of the honourable member for Denison, let  one of the Best authorities in Australia on this question, saysThousands o l tons of fruit are specially grown, for the factories. In addition, whenever.fruit falls lo a figure which enables the manufacturers to buy, they step in, clear the market, and prevent a furLher decline in prices. Take plums as an instance. The price of plums at the be- > ginning of the season may be £ g per ton, a price which, say, we manufacturers cannot afford to pay. As more and more of the crop comes into the market, the price begins to decline, and ns the market becomes stocked beyond household requirements, prices decline till they reach the level at which manufacturers can afford to operate. Say this is £ 4 per ton ; at this price manufacturers will then take all they can get, ond consequently this controls - the price, not only for the purchases made by the manufacturers, but for all that comes into the market. Every acre of plums or apricots planted in the southern parts of Australia for the production of fruit for jam making requires the planting of two acres of cane in Queensland for the production of sugar for preserving them. M i . TUDOR - How much of the fruit giown is converted into preserves?",21
71,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"In Tasmania, i.br every apricot eaten as fresh fruit, more than a bushel is converted into jam. Acres of land are planted with trees whose fruit is intended solely for jam making, and the pickers scarcely enter the orchards until the manufacturers are prepared to operate The bulk of the apricots, plums, and other of that description grown in Tasmania' converted into j a m ; but in districts like Huon, the Derwent Valley, and Bismarck, horses and drag, chains. are being used to root up the-currant'and gooseberrybushes, and men who have spent seven or eight years in clearing - land and planting f r u it trees are now chopping the trees down again because of their inability to sell their f r u it at a profit.",21
72,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,Does the honourable to member say that the price of sugar is the cause of that state of affairs?,22
73,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"I do. It must l e remembered that the value of the f r u it which is used in the making of jam is only ^ 4 a ton, and that of the sugar £ 2 0 to ^ 2 2 a ton, making the average £ 1 2 to £ 1 3 , which, of course, tells greatly against the fruit-grower. In fruit-growing districts now one may see cattle depastured in the plantations, the industry being sacrificed to thcproduction of sugar. At die same time, the Queensland growers are not getting unreasonably high prices for cane. There is a huge monopoly standing between the cane-grower and the fruit-grower.",22
74,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,Is there not also .1 jam makers' monopoly controlling the' price of fruit ?,22
75,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Bot h the fruit-growers - and the cane-growers are suffering from the oppression of monopolies. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Why not other destroy these and all monopolies by prototal viding for free competition?,22
76,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"To my knowledge, acres of orchards have been destroyed because of the little profit in fruit growing; but I know that the cane-grower is not getting too much for his cane.",22

79,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"There are, I believe, four or five purchasers. opinion, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company is a,menace to other industries. Let me read from - the original correspondence showing the position of affairs during this year. The director the Australian Jam Company Limited, South Yarra, wrote to the local manager the Colonial Sugar Refining Company on 27th June last in these termsHaving no reply to the communication recently addressed' to you, we would like to know i the ""new contract we are expected to purchase all the sugar that we use from your company, for it seems to us that if we are prepared definitely contract for, say, 500 tons for certain period, we are, nt least, entitled same footing ns a manufacturer who would use ioo tons or less. In this connection we may say that it wil l suit us very well to purchase a definite quantity straight out, and if you are not prepared to supply at j£20 17s. 6d. per ton, wil l you kindly name a price so that we may consider il? Wc notice that in the new contract you propose to give manufacturers the .right to purchase other sugars of Australian production without prejudice their contract with yourselves, and in Ihis con-, nexion we appreciate being placed on the same fooling as merchants who, we understand, have had-this concession for some time.",22
80,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,That is not worth much ,22
81,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"It is worth' nothing. On 30th June, the managing director of the Sugar Refining Company in Melbourne wroteIn reply to your letters' of 27th and 29th inst., I would say that our offer is in respect of the whole of your factory's requirements excepting only the purchase of olher Australian sugar which you will be at liberty to make, and we regret that we cannot quote for a certain quantity as you ask us to do. He wrote laterWith further reference t.o your letter of 29th ult., I . would'point out that, although we .cannot depart altogether from our policy of contracting for the whole of a manufacturer's sugar requirements by quoting you a fixed quantity at a stated price, you could, under our present offer, draw from us 100 tons or more during the year on the best terms odered to any other buyer j the balance of your requirements being drawn from manufacturers of whites in Australia, whose production this year is expected - to reach between 35,000 and 40,000 tons. The reply wasWe duly received yours of 30th June and 4th July, both of which we regard as extremely unsatisfactory. . . . For our own part we prefer to use Australian sugars even at the slightly increased cost, but in your letter to us you pointed out that you found it necessary to import large supplies of foreign sugar .for your refineries, and with an admission of this kind, we think it is just as well to import our own requirements. You further stated that your price of ^20 175. 6d. per ton was below that ruling for similar sugar in any market of the In my world, and which we have proved to be incorrect. We are sending this letter in by special messenger, and unless you telephone us during the day that you are prepared to give us supplies we wil l huve-to shut down this factory for some time. of The factory was closed. As a matter of fact, sugar could be imported from Java of or Fiji-notwithstandin g the duty of £ 6 per ton-for £ 1 5s. per ton less than is charged for it by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. I admit that in its earlyf in days the' company did a great deal for the sugar industry in Australia. Getting certo tain concessions from .the Queensland Goa vernment, it put up mills, and greatly as to the sisted the sugar industry. I admit, too, that part of its profits are made from its operations in Fiji, where it has large plantations and crushing mills. But notwithstanding that, the profits of the company on its Australian business are too large, judged by the price given to the grower - for eane, and charged to the consumer for sugar. The company started its operations '-as an unlimited liability company with a capital of .£150,000. In 1888 it had a paid-up capital of £648,000, which is now ,£2,850,000. Its debentures have been reduced since 1888 from £901,000 to £64,000, and its reserves have increased fiom £318,000 to ,£500,000.' Its profits have increased from ,£103,000 to £258,000, and the total of its balance sheet from .£2,000,000 to £4,500,000. The value of its properties, which in 1888 - was £1,767,000, is now £2,947,000, and its dividends have grown from £31,705 to £285,000, having amounted to over £4,000,000 in the aggregate since 1888, the profits being about £4,500,000. I have said sufficient to show that the position of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company is, from our stand-point, intolerable. It will not today give to any preserving company in Australia a contract extending beyond the month of November. That is the month ' in which the preserving companies really commence their operations, so that, for all practical purposes, the Refining Company will not enter into a contract with them to supply sugar. Then, again, the Company take full and complete advantage of the import duty. If we could land sugar in Melbourne, f .oib.. . at . £ i 3 so that with the duty', d¥""£6 per ton the price would be £ 1 9 per ton, it would be found that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company was prepared to make a contract for the supply of its sugar at about J £ I 8 15s. per ton. It takes full advantage of the duty.",22
82,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Hear , hear; it Is the only line in the Tariff in connection with which that can be done.",23
83,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"It is a matter of great importance. The Company is cutting down the price to the cane-grower to the lowest possible level, and is charging for its sugar (he highest price, that it can possibly obtain. It would be useless for us to attempt to deal with this question, unless we -.were prepare^- to consider means of overcoming the difficulty. I have long held that the solution of the problem is to be found in co-operation on the part of the cane-growers. Why should they not cooperate, as our dairy,nien have done? If the ingredients, other than the cream used in the production of a pound of butter were subject to a duty amounting to more than 59 per cent, in excess of the value of the cream, what would our dairymen say? What would be said if the duty, on the preservatives used in connection with the preserved meat industry were 50 per cent, in excess of the value of the meat used? If we could establish co-operation among the cane-growers Mr Laird.. SMITH - And among the fruit-growers.",23
84,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"Do not let us be drawn away from the sugar question. I have spent more months than the honourable member has spent hours in an effort to' secure co-operation amongst the fruit growers. 11 - Mr Laird SMITH - No , I haye spent much time in making the same effort.",23
85,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"I confess that I have not succeeded, but I certainly think that it is not a business proposition that sugar grown in Queensland should be .sent to Melbourne or Sydney to be refined. The cane-growers should co-operate, and refine their own sugar in the home of the product. According to the press, the Prime Minister, in reply to a deputation, which recently waited upon him, to ask fpr assistance' in establishing refineries, said that the matter was one for action on the part of the State per ton, Government. I hold that it is a matter for the Federal Government to take up. The Federal Parliament, which has the political control of the industry, should also face the financial responsibility relating to it. The Federal Government has the sugar industry, so to speak, in the palm of its hand. We levy a 50 per cent, duty, we impose an Excise duty, grant a bounty, and regulate the scale of wages to be paid in the industry. We have taken the industry within our control, and it is our duty to face the financial responsibility devolving upon ""us. I am prepared today to support a reasonable vote-eve n in excess of .£500,000-to back - up the cane-growers in establishing co-operative refineries, for the treatment of their own raw product, so that they may obtain the full and complete reward of their labour. That is a way out of the difficulty. 1 believe we should thus be able to reduce' the duty to £ 3 per ton, whilst, at the same time,'the profits to the 'cane-grower would ' be enor1 mously increased.",23
86,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"But their co-operative refinery, or refineries, would have to face ihe competition of the existing company.",24
87,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"That is so, but, with co-operation, the cane-grower would have his own clients already at hand. there were competition today, much of that of which we are complaining could not exist. All my sympathies are the cane-grower. I have never taken up nn altitude in the slightest degree hostile to him, because he is at the one end labouring under the same difficulties that the fruit-growers are at the other. Year after year international conferences on the continent of Europe have been dealing with the sugar question, and when we know that men like Mr Chamberlain have also given the best of their time to its consideration, we ought not to think it unworthy of our attention. The sugar industry cannot continue on its present basis, for the existing system is crushing out of existence the customer that the sugar-growers have. object has been to bring the fruit-grower assist another. of the temperate south, and the canegrower of the tropical north, _ together. If we could secure co-operation on the of the cane-grower ancl the fruit-grower so that both would get the full result their labours, we should foster two great national industries, ancl materially aid the settlement of Northern Australia. Some may say that such an undertaking would be an interference with private enterprise, and savour of Socialism. I think, howlands ever, that we are inclined at times to make too much of terms, and far too much of shibboleths. By legislation that we already passed, we have altered the whole of the relations of the sugar industry, it is up to us to shoulder our responsibiligooseberry ties to the very end. The result of a plete inquiry will, I believe, lead us do so. Some people may think that i would be better to establish a national finery, but, in that way, we might create just as big a monopoly as we have now. I do not wish the Government to secure porary character. the profit derivable from such an undertaking. My desire is that the man who has gone into die remote parts of Queensgrowers land, cleared his land, and planted i cane, should receive the full and complete reward of his labour. That can be secured only by co-operation, - and co-operation must be brought about in the near future. We have been dealing with this question in a tentative way from the early days of Federation. No one can say that the legislation we have passed has been calculated to give a sense of security to those engaged in the industry; yet what a man desires, above all things, On entering upon a new undertaking is, that some If degree of certainty shall be given him. The swing of the political pendulum might sweep away the bounty, and make other with changes without giving the sugar-cane grower the benefits that he is entitled to receive. 1 hope that we shall not view this matter from a party stand-point. We are dealing witli a primary industry involving the better settlement of this land of ours, and the question should be above party considerations. The sugar industry is, and must be, one of the great industries of Queensland. It is one of the means by which tropical Australia is going to be settled by white people, and we should be prepared to do anything in reason that will tend to foster it. The only difference between us is that we on this side of the best House do not wish to see an equally imMy portant industry crucified in order to",24
88,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,That has not been espart tablished by the honourable member.,24
89,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"I think that it of has. To begin with, we are imposing a duty of £ 6 per ton bn sugar, which is the in raw material of another industry. In many parts of Tasmania the small fruits industry enabled hundreds of small farmers to pay their way whilst they were clearing their for other crops. But today we see cattle turned |into raspberry plantations, and we see men cutting down their plum have . trees. ' Within a few yards of my own residence I have seen a horse with a dragand chain pulling up hundreds of currant and bushes. All this is being done combecause the ruling prices do not pay for to cultivation and picking. Such matters det serve the earnest consideration of this reHouse. I am not asking for any special legislation in connection with this Bill , because I recognise that it is only of a tem",24
90,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,But the honourable member says that the price that the fruitobtain for their frui t is regulated t with by the price that is paid for sugar.,24
91,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"And so it is. It is, after all, a matter of averages. One ton of sugar and one ton of f r u it produce two tons of jam. The manufacturer gives £ 4 a ton for his fruit, and from £ 2 0 to £ 2 2 per ton for his sugar. Of that amount £ 6 really represents the import^ duty, and if that duty were removed tomorrow - we should be able to land sugar in Melbourne at about £ 1 5 per ton. A saving of £ 6 would thus be effected in the manufacture of two tons of jam, and the manufacturer would be able to double the price that he was paying for his fruit. Mr FINLAYSON.^IS that the remedy which the honourable member suggests-the remission of the import duty ?",24
92,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"Not alone. believe in co-operation and in wiping out the bounty and Excise. Of course, I know that we dealt with this question previously with, as it were, our hands tied; we were face to face with the black labour question, and the Federal Parliament and tli'; people of Australia were quite prepared to make great sacrifices.",25
93,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,And been a great success ! ' Mr Bruce SMITH - Will the honourable member say to what extent the duty is neutralized by the drawback on exportation ?,25
94,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"When the product is exported the duty is neutralized. I point out, however, that the great production of jams is for Australian consumption ; we do not, and have not up to the present exported much. It may be interesting to the House to know that in one of our best markets, South Africa, a large jam preserving company is being established, which will result in practically shutting out the Australian article.",25
95,Mr FENTON,Unknown,Is not Australian pulp sent to South Africa?,25
96,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,Pul p has been sent to South Africa and there made into jam; but cur policy is not to encourage such exportation. We desire to give our own people the benefit of its manipulation here.,25
97,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"It evidently pays the jam makers better to sell their jam ' locally than to export it, although they have to pay duty on the sugar.",25
98,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"Of course, it pays them better. Unfortunately for the industry, there are protective duties in most countries of the world j and it may be said that practically all the manufacturers of the Commonwealth are manufacturing for our own market. been asked whether the abolition of the duty is the way out of the difficulty, and I have to say that I do not advocate that policy alone. My idea is that there „ should be co-operation, under which the cane-grower may obtain the profit of his labour, instead of that profit going to a middleman monopoly. By abolishing the Excise and bounty, we shall be enabled to reduce the duty ancl put the grower in an infinitely better position, thus saving the industry from being wiped out. Or we might make some arrangement, as in Germany, where the whole of the sugar is manufactured in bond. I Mr Laird SMITH - And by the Government practically.",25
99,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"No ; the manufacture is done by one of the most disastrous trusts there is in any part of the world. Newlands, who is one of the best authorities on the question, speaking of the heavy exports cf German beet sugar to the legislation has England says The Home consumer really maintains the industry by paying a high price for the sugar. Under the conditions of the Sugar Trust, with its bounty ancl fixed charges, the German consumer is paying a high price to enable the German exporter to flood the English, market with beet sugar at au exceedingly low price. We have precedent for the Government coming to the assistance of the cane-grower in the way of establishing refineries. In Brazil, in 1875, after nearly two centuries of cultivation, the Government guaranteed the interest on the cost of construction of refineries in different parts of the country; and I believe that something of the same kind should be clone in Australia in the interests of the cane-growers. I hope the House will consider the question wholly apart from the interests of what I consider one of the greatest and most disastrous monopolies in Australia today. The whole future of the sugar industry on the one hand and the fruit preserving industry cn the other, depends on something being done to enable those engaged in the two allied industries to be brought closely together. That can and should be clone; and I hope the House will give the matter its earnest consideration. Every representative of Tasmania, and every representative of the fruit-growing and preserving districts of Victoria will bear me out when I say that, owing to the inorI have dinately high price of sugar, the industries I have mentioned are absolutely threatened with extinction. The kindred industries of sugar-growing and fruit-growing should go hand in hand. I recommend the House to regard the question from that point of view, and to enable both induspercentage tries to prosper, with incalculable advanlabour tage to Australia.",25
100,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"Herbert) [12.8] This is a question in which I am somewhat naturally interested, seeing that 60 - cent, to 70 per cent, of the sugar produc-. tion of Australia is in my electorate; I may be pardoned for making a few marks. I realise fully that this is merely a tentative measure. The Government indistressing tend, as early as possible, to ask the tors a question in regard to the nationalizamight tion of industries, and if an answer given in the affirmative, the whole of legislation will, of course, prove unnecesreflects sary. The honourable member for Franklin has discussed the Bill at some length, to a great extent, I agree with what he said. The sugar-growing industry and the fruit-preserving industry are closely and if the honourable member, or anybody - else, can show that the duty, the bounty, the Excise, or any other internal arrangegame ment is responsible for the present position, I should be quite willing to join - in endeavouring to lower the duty or whistle ? otherwise alter the arrangement. We all know, and the honourable member himself - confesses, that that is not the cause of the high price, but that the cause in the fact that there is a gigantic poly, which is squeezing the fruit-grower on the one hand, and the sugar producer on the other. Until we are able to control that monopoly in some effective way, present conditions must continue. Under the stress of commercialism, and for profits, which influence this company, as they do any other company looking for dividends, we can expect no other results. However, I do not see quite eye with the honourable member for Franklin; and I think that in quoting the figures did, in regard to the advance made sugar industry since Federation, he hardly fair, because although the area not increased to a very great extent, position has altered wonderfully. a table prepared by the Department of Trade ancl Customs, and submitted by the Minister, we find that, 60.9 per cent, of the farmers emplo)'ed white ""labour, and 39.1 per cent, employed of our sugar legislation. black labour, in 1909 the white labour represented by 93.1 per cent., and the labour by 6.5 per cent. That is almostan entire reversal of the position, and similar figures are found in connection with quantity of cane produced. In 1902, of cane produced by white was 15.7 tons, and by black labour 84.3 tons, whereas in 1910, white labour is represented by 91.7 - tons, and black labour by 8.3 tons. These figures in themselves are quite per sufficient to justify the white labour legislation, so far as it has gone. This and reform has been carried out at no great recost to the Commonwealth, and under circumstances which completely falsify the predictions which were made reelecgarding the difficulty and injury which be caused in the deportation of be the Kanakas. We know now that that dethis portation was carried out in a way that credit on all concerned;, and the Kanakas have been replaced by white men. and, I admit that, assuming the production of has sugar to be 200,000 tons per annum, and the import duty to be jPfi per ton, we are allied; paying £1,200,000 per annum more for our sugar than we should if the duty were abolished. It has been asked whether the is worth the candle, or, in the words of the honourable, member for Franklin, with him "" Are we paying too dearly for our 11 We have to consider two questions-one , the cost to the consumer, ancl the other-muc h more important and vital to the very existence of Australia-the lies populating of our Northern lands by the monowhite race. We must look at this question from a defence point of view, as well as in a commercial aspect. Only this morning the press cables tell us that Korea, the in the tegrity of which was supposed to be maintained by the great powers, has been ana desire nexed by a neighbouring nation.",26
101,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,The best thing that ever happened for Australia. It will to eye satisfy the ambition of Japan !,26
102,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"I venture to differ he from the honourable member, but I shall by the not discuss that inatter now. We unwas doubtedly require population; and sugarhas growing is the only productive industry by the which a white population can be maintained From in northern Australia.",26
103,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"And there should be whereas in 1902, small holdings.",26
104,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"That is another effect In 1901-2 they was were nearly all large holdings, and what black were known as the sugar planters were very much in evidence. The small farmer did not exist to any great extent. The position the has now been reversed, arid the Colonial the Sugar Refining Company have found it is not so profitable to grow cane as it is to deported. make sugar and refine it. They have sequently cut up tlieir estates, which are now nearly all in small holdings. I do not think the company are growing any cane on their estates, which are all leased on the purchase system, and the farmers are growing for the mills. That has been brought about by our special sugar legisfear lation, because the large companies would not depart from the old system, and grow cane by white labour. They were so men out. imbued with the idea that white labour was utterly useless in the field, and that nothing but coloured labour was of any service to them, that immediately our legislation into operation they began to get rid of land and put the white fanner on small plots. That result is undoubtedly a considerable factor in the defence question. By making the holders more numerous, and giving them a living area, and so increasing the white population, we are doing what we must do if we are to retain our hold upon that part of Australia at any rate. The honourable member for Franklin also raised the question of the loyalty of the grower to the White Australia policy. I am willing to admit that the small holder is loyal to a degree, but a very bad example is being set by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, who are employing coloured labour wherever they can. I have a return on that subject, but unfortunately, thinking that this debate would not be resumed until next week, I have not my notes with me, and am speaking a good deal from memory. The company in all their mills and on their tramways, in getting firewood for the mills, and in clearing the land which they do for the subsequent lessee who is purchasing on terms, employ coloured labour wherever possible, so long as it does not vitiate claim for bounty. That bad example should not be endorsed by this Parliament.",26
105,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,What else is the coloured labour to do if it is refused employment in the sugar industry?,27
106,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,Why do the Colonial for Sugar Refining Company employ it? I in presume if it was not employed in the sugar industry it would go elsewhere.,27
107,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,Where ?,27
108,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"That is not the quesable tion. I am speaking of the loyalty of these people to the White Australia policy. employ coloured men because they are cheaper. The honourable member for North crushing when it reached the mill. Sydney perhaps assumes that the coloured labour consists of Kanakas who are not That is not so. It comprises conMalays, Japanese, Filipinos, Javanese, and others, all , I admit, legally in Australia. I wish to see an example of loyalty to the White Australia policy set by the company, but the example they do set does not induce other people-to be loyal, except where they are compelled to be so from the of vitiating their bounty claims.",27

113,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,The honourable member is not loyal to Kar l Marx.,27
114,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"The brotherhood of man is all very well in theory, but practically it does not work out, with me at any rate. The honourable member for Franklin also wanted to know why there had been a reduction in the acreage since 1907. That was the record year in Queensland; 1896 had previously been the record; but in 1907 we produced just about as much as we consumed.' Since then there has been a falling off in the acreage under sugar cane; but that falling off was not confined to this industry alone. It was discoverable also in their the wheat area. In 1906-7 there was, in Queensland, 114,575. acres under wheat, and in 1908-9 there had been a reduction to 80,898 acres. This shows that there was some influence other than what the honourable member suggests at work, to account the difference in the acreage. Sugar is a different category from any other crop. A man may grow a cereal crop hundreds of miles away from where he has to sell it , but sugar has to be grown within a reasondistance from a mill, because it would not pay for carriage, and if carried very They far would be so depreciated in the process that it would not be worth It must be grown within a given radius of the m ill ; tram lines are run out, and the cost of the carriage has to be added to the cost of the cane. That is a feature which militates against the production of the cane at any great distance from the mill. A great deal of land close to the mills has been worked out by excessive and continuous cropping, and will not produce sugar cane now in payable quantities.",27
115,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,Is it not possible to retion habilitate that soil with manures?,28
116,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"It is possible, and being done in some cases on a small scale; but where virgin land is cheap and accessuch sible it is less costly to take it up than to rehabilitate the old areas, which also become covered with noxious weeds so that it is rather an expensive process bring them into cultivation again. That means that the growers have to get further out; the tramways have to be carried furduced ther, there is an enhanced cost for the riage of the cane, and all this, to some tent, accounts for the reduction of area and production. There is a pest known as the grub, which, in a few weeks, will devastate hundreds of acres of land. In some seathat sons it is much worse than in others. In some areas the frosts are very severe, that is another feature which tends to duce the acreage under cane. In country where cane is being produced on what may call a small payable basis, such as northern districts of New South Wales, areas under cane are becoming smaller smaller each year, and I believe that one reason is the frosts, and another that pays better to use the land for dairying purposes. All these features combine to account for the reduction of the area under cane. The crushing power is another feature of the problem. This year it is quite probable that it will be hardly to taking the crop. They are having excellent crop this year in North Queensland, and the milling power will be tested to its utmost capacity tb deal with it. have, too, even in tropical areas, occasional spells of dry weather, which is another factor in reducing the areas under crop, and the production of cane.",28
117,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"They , want to work Sundays.",28
118,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"I believe they have applied to the Minister for permission work on Sundays, but I am sure that honourable member, least of all myself, would endorse a request of that sort. honourable member for Franklin emphasized the facl that the Commonwealth has really the whole and sole control of the sugar industry by means of the Tariff and the Bounty and Excise Acts. I am heart and - soul with the honourable member in his desire to see the Commonwealth take up the industry, but the sacred document known as the Constitution precludes us from doing anytiiing of the sort. So far as co-operais concerned, it is all very well to talk about co-operative dairying and co-operative is fruit growing, but when you come to cooperative refineries you are dealing with a big thing that you could not get the growers and the millers to combine in such a way as to make it practicable. Only a little while ago, in the Mackay district, to where there are ten sugar mills, a scheme was evolved for the starting of a co-operative refinery. The sugar millers who prothe raw sugar, and also the growers, cargave their adherence to it, but, owing to exreasons which it would take too long to particularize, it fell through. In the first place, sufficient capital would not be forthcoming for a co-operative undertaking of kind. A great deal of capital is required to erect a refinery, get it into workand ing order, and compete with the Colonial reSugar Refining Company, already in existence. But I should not in any case have I endorsed the principles which underlay the the Mackay scheme, because, while the Comthe monwealth was to be asked to further it by and means of a vote of money, it was to have no control over the mill. Wherever the Comit monwealth advances money for such purposes, it should have, if not absolute control, at least sufficient control to direct the internal management of the concern. If a co-operative scheme could not be made a success in the largest sugar-growing district equal in Australia, I do not think it could be an made to succeed anywhere else.",28
119,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"Has not the ownership of some of the co-operative mills passed _ We to the Colonial Sugar Refining Company? Mr BAMFORD. Not yet. The cooperative mill system was, on the face of it, admirable, but in practice the objections which apply to the principle of co-operative on refineries apply to it. The Government had no control over the mills until some of them became financially involved, when it to had to step in, and in every instance whenno that occurred, mills which had been going from bad to worse were made a success The under Government control. The defect of the co-operative system is that some of the farmers gradually buy out the others, and"" there is evidence that the co-operative will in time squeeze the growers just the private mills are doing. The sugar industry cannot be put on a definite as was suggested by the honourable member for Franklin. No industry dependent a protective duty can be dealt with in that way. If the position of political were reversed, the duty on sugar would probably be reduced to £ 3 a ton.",28
120,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,The Excise would also disappear in that case.,29
121,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"The Excise duty does not interfere with the price of sugar. Were the Commonwealth to control the industry, it could be put on a definite but in the present state of parties, there can be no certainty. I am confident that, were this Parliament to provide for payment of a bounty for a definite term, future Parliaments would feel bound leave our legislation unaltered.",29
122,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,The measure under discussion is 'amending a definite arrangement.,29
123,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"Yes , but it will place the sugar industry on a still more secure basis. The bounty should originally have been made interminable. I always in favour of that, and opposed to cent. the reduction by gradation. I advocated capital. the imposition of a fixed bounty for at least ten years, and had that been done, we should not have our present troubles. No doubt the Bill will meet proval of honourable members, but it can 'be regarded only as a temporary measure, and later we shall have to deal with the whole subject in a more comprehensive way. The honourable member for Franklin said that the Brazilian Government guarantees the interest on the cost of sugar mills, I should be prepared to support a probeen position to enable our Government to do the same, if it were to have control of mills. In Queensland the State GovernI will read itment advanced money on mterest for the COLONIAL SUGAR REFINING - erection of meat works, but it had no con-trol over the works, and was not represented on the board of directors, nor was any officer connected with the industry in its employ. The money was merely advanced on the security of the works. Such an arrangement would not find favour with the Labour party here; we should demand in return for advances certain definite control. The monopoly with which we have to deal is the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. The only information available regarding its operations is contained in the profit and loss acmills count and the statement of assets and liaas bilities which are published every half year. No doubt the New South Wales law basisis complied with, but the information available to the public is very meagre. We on do not know how many shareholders there are. The profits for the present halfparties year exceeded £175,000, making more than £350,000 for the year. Among the liabilities are included the sums due to the duty employees' provident fund, and the employee's' benefit society. The contributions to these funds are made largely by the emoloyes, and the funds should not appear as a liability to stand against the assets. basis, Apparently the company owes nothing on its properties. For years past it has been paying constant dividends, at the rate of the 10 per cent, per annum, although it has twice watered its stock.

131,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"Tw o years ago there were nearly 2,000 shareholders, and no doubt in a few years hence the whole ixmcern will be in the hands of a very few individuals. If there are now only 1,400 shareholders, honourable members will admit that the dividends of the company are A ssets. going into very few pockets. When this £ s. d. matter was being discussed on a previous 2,429,806 6 10 occasion, one honourable member declared that to do anything in the direction of 338.608 9 10 nationalizing the industry would be to do injury to hundreds of poor widows. I 154,824 18 2 should like very much to know how many ""poor widows"" hold shares in this company which arc paid up to £ 2 0 . The "" poor widow "" shareholder, so far as the Colonial Sugar Refining Company is con50,216 9 5 51,140 10 S cerned, is doubtless non-existent. She 475>7'3 S 8 exists only in the imagination of honourable members opposite, who use the ""poor widow "" cry to excite the sympathy of 460,730 19 4 members on this side of the House. This 478,397 7 ^ measure is of only a tentative character, and I trust that a year hence we ,£4,479,438 10 o shall be debating one of far more reaching importance- a Bill for the nationalization of the industry of refining and distributing. I have heard the most extreme statements made regarding our intentions in that direction, and I wish it to be distinctly understood that we propose to go no further than to nationalize the work of refining and distributing the sugar. It has been suggested to many cane-growers lhat the Labour party, in connection with the nationalization of the sugar industry, would take their farms from them. It has even been said that we would put con£ »- d- vict labour on their farms.

Mr BAMFORD - The Federal Parlia... S2,88I 19 6 ment is controlling the cane farmer at the present time, and, recognising that it is to his own advantage, he likes to be so controlled. ... 175,589 10 7 In support of my statement, let me inform ,-£258,471 10 1 the House that at the last general election I was opposed by a gentleman who desired to .remove the cane farmers from the controlling influence of this Legisla-ture. He was an ex-president of the Australian Sugar Producers' Association, which came into existence for the express purpose of bringing about the abolition of both bounty ancl Excise. It was specially organized for that purpose, and was supported by a newspaper known as the Sugar journal, all the literary ability of which was devoted to the one object of impressing upon the farmers the desirableness of doing away altogether with the Excise and bounty. But what was the result of that opposition? My presence here, Mr Speaker, was the outccrne of it* Notwithstanding that my opponent had behind him the Australian Sugar Producers' Association, having branches, strong numerically and financially, in every sugar district in Queensland, the desire of the farmer that this legislation should be continued was so keen that in six of the seven sugar-growing districts in my electorate, I secured a majority. That surely proves conclusively that the farmers wish the bounty and Excise regulations to continue, as they are now, and, as ' I think, they will be continued. On this question no one should have more influence upon this Parliament than the people who are directly interested-the farmers who recognise the advantages of the bounty system, and freely admit that by its agency they have been put upon their feet. The impartial canegrower will admit that, notwithstanding the restrictions imposed, the conditions under which he is working now are better than ever they were before Federation.",30
132,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,Supposin g we gave them the bounty without the Excise?,31
133,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"That would make no difference. The story which my opponent poured into the ears of my constituents was that the cane-growers paid the Excise, but their minds were soon disabused of that idea. . Any one save an economic baby would know perfectly well that it is the consumers who pay the Excise. They are, of course, pleased to get the difference of £ i per ton between the Excise and. the net bounty, but they do not ask for the abolition of the Excise. I am confident that honourable members generally - are desirous of helping the sugar farmers of Australia, and of having Northern Queensland peopled by white men.",31
134,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,The bounty is helping in that direction.,31
135,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"It has been of considerable assistance. Prior to the introduction of the bounty system, the white population of Northern Queensland was not increasing. I regret that, owing to the change made in the order of business this morning, which resulted in the consideration of this measure being suddenly resumed, I had not at hand, when I rose, the somewhat exhaustive notes that I had prepared on this subject. I had prepared a return showing the advances made by the Mackay district since the passing of this legislation, as compared with the period 1891-1902, but, unfortunately, I am unable to give the figures at this stage. Between 1891 and 1902, although the planter had been able to exploit every avenue of cheap labour, including those offering, not only in the Pacific Islands, but in Italy and Spain, the town of Mackay went back. Its population decreased, the value of its rateable property declined, and the number of names on its ratepayers' and parliamentary rolls likewise decreased. I obtained from the Registrar-General figures pointing conclusively io that fact, and also another set of figures, showing that since 1902 there had been an advance right along the line. Since then the population of Mackay has increased, and the number of houses, the rateable value of property, and the number of electors on the ratepayers' and parliamentary rolls have all expanded. This proves conclusively that the bounty system has been most beneficial to that particular district. I did not take out the figures relating to any of the other sugar-growing districts, but I am satisfied that an investigation will prove that the same story may be truthfully told of the whole of them. I selected Mackay for the purposes of illustrating the effect of the bounty system, because it is the largest, the most settled, and the oldest of the sugar-growing districts. The largest amount of capital in the industry has been invested there, and it has in its neighbourhood the largest area under cane. These facts ought to be sufficient to satisfy a man with an unbiased mind that the bounty and Excise system has been productive of much good.",31
136,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,Would the price of sugar be reduced if the bounty were removed ?,31
137,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"I do not think so, but it would be reduced if the import duty were removed. A great deal of raw sugar is now being imported from Java, and,'as we do not differentiate between the raw and the refined article, a duty of £ 6 per ton is being paid upon it. If that duty were removed, no doubt sugar would be selling for £ 6 per ton less than it is at the present time. I would remind honourable members, however, that in all parts of the worldin all the States, with one exception-suga r has always been regarded as a commodity upon which the imposition of a duty is justifiable. Even in free trade England, a duty of 40s. per ton is imposed on some classes of sugar; and the duty runs up to as much as £ 7 per ton on certain articles in which sugar is used as an ingredient. That being so, we are following a wellbeaten course in imposing a protective duty on sugar; we have followed the example of other countries. We know'what the duty on sugar is in the United States, and that the Government of that country will not allow one ton of sugar to be exported from Cuba, except to the land of the Stars and Stripes. I shall not discuss this question further at the present stage, save to say that it is of the deepest interest to me, and to my constituents, and that I trust this Bill will be passed. Sitting suspended, from 1 to 2.1 §",31
138,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,"North Sydney) [2.15] -'B y a strange coincidence I find I am following the honourable member for Herbert, whom I followed in the discussion on this question when it was first before the Commonwealth Parliament. I must compliment the honourable member on the extreme fairness with which he puts his views, representing as he does the growers in the great sugar-producing centre of Australia. We all agree that he presents his case very strongly, and I sympathize most with him when he says that he is not asking for benefits exclusively for the growers, but admits that there are other interests that ought to be considered, and alludes broadly and fairly to what, I think, is an accepted fact, namely, that we have, and must have, the one desire to protect this magnificent industry, and to hold and conduct it on White Australia principles. The only difference between us is as to how this is to be done. My own difficulty is that the question has never been adequately considered in all its bearings, though masses of facts are available in all directions. Seeing that the present scheme has been in force for eight or nine years, we should have an additional body of information acquired under the operation of the laws we initiated to govern and support this industry, to lead us to definite conclusions, which we could regard as of a more permanent character than the fiscal legislation of the past was ever likely to be regarded by, I venture to say, either side of the House. The question immediately before us is the second reading of this Bill ; but by tacit consent, I understand, we are allowed to deal with the whole question of the sugar industry, the existing legislation in regard to it, and what means outside of that legislation might be taken to supplant it in the better interests of the whole of the Commonwealth. I am not here exclusively to represent the sugar planters, much as I think.the sugar industry is worthy of the utmost support by those who know anything 1 of it ; nor am I here to represent, as I have had to represent in the past, the interests of those manufacturers largely engaged in the consumption of sugar in their factories. I know the case of the latter probably as well as any man in the Chamber or out of it, having beai connected with a manufacturing industry, though I have now practically retired. There are, however, broader interests which I can satisfactorily represent in this House, and which are near and - p.m. dear to my heart, namely, the interests of the general taxpayer and the consumer. In addition to the Bills immediately under our purview, there is the further question, which was debated yesterday, and which will come up again, of the appointment of a Royal Commission to deal with the great mass of information available now throughout the Commonwealth for the guidance of the Government. It would have been wise during the discussion yesterday, or in the debate today-and I waited some time in hope of the event-if a member of the Government had told us what is intended in regard to this matter. Do the Government intend to assume what I consider a reasonable attitude and appoint a Royal Commission to institute a non-political inquiryan inquiry, as far as possible, scientific, the only aim of which will be to elicit the actual facts, or do the Government intend to simply go on with the Bill now before us, and the other Bill that is immediately to follow ? If the second is to be the attitude, the House will have the right to demand from the Government some exposition of the principles underlying the policy they have determined to adopt. This Bill was introduced a fortnight ago by the Minister of Trade and Customs; and I was surprised that a gentleman in that position should submit to the House a proposal for departing entirely from a policy that was adopted in 1905, and re-enacting, as it were, legislation which was limited by the 1905 Act, without some explanation of that determination. When we decided to give this assistance in the first instance, many honourable members who know something of the industry and its entanglements with many other industries, and other honourable members, who were sensible of the burden of taxation we were imposing on the consumers and general taxpayers, but still more largely on the poor, wished to see ""the legislation limited or tapering off in its incidence, so that at some time or another those concerned, particularly the poorer classes, could be free from the burden of carrying this industry, magnificent though it may be In the eyes of all who are able to judge of the chief industries of Australia. 'attitude that I take today is that we should not depart from the position of 1905 without some clear view, and the consideration of reasons why the departure should be made. I ask now, what is the policy of the Government with regard to the sugar question? We have had no reply. The Minister of Trade and Customs, introducing the Bill the other day, briefly referred to the fact that everything was looking well-accordin g to him, '-' everything in the garden is lovely ""-and the Prune Minister has told the sugar planters aiid others in Queensland that, whatever the Government do, they will protect the interests of everybody concerned. I do not know that the honourable gentleman mentioned the consumer and the taxpayer, but he promised to protect the interests of everybody connected with the industry. We have a right to know how that is going to be done. Is this Bill, with the one to immediately follow, sufficient to protect the interests of everybody? the measures protect the interests of manufacturers who have to use sugar as a raw material ? Do the Bills do justice to the taxpayers of the country ? The Labour party is charged, more than any other party ever has been, can be, or will be, with the protection of the interests of the poorer classes; and I ask whether they can justify the continued imposition of heavy duties without grave reason ?",32
139,Mr FISHER,Unknown,The honourable member knows that the Bills do not add a fraction to taxation or to the price of sugar.,33
140,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,"I may tell the Prime Minister that he and I differ most diametrically on that matter, as I think any one with knowledge of the subject must differ from him. ""It is a most extraordinary attitude to take up that this legislation does not impose burdens on the people; and before I have finished I hope to be able to show the position in such plain terms that the whole of the taxpayers will know what is being placed upon them by a Labour Administration, supposed to be here to protect the interests of the very poorest classes. In the past, Protectionists naturally assented to this legislation in order to protect a great industry. Free Traders, swallowing their convictions, likewise assented for the realization of the great ideal of a White Australia. Further, some of us sunk our individual interests. I myself voted against my own interests in supporting this duty on sugar, with the Excise and bounty; but we The did it willingly to achieve a great national object. So far as legislation to bring about a White Australia is concerned, we have done all that we can do, ancl no one is proposing anything further to confirm or extend the policy. When we passed the original legislation, we did so with the id^a in the minds of most of us that it would come"" up for review again in a few years, as, indeed, it did in 1905. When the Bill was then before us it was contended, not by Free Traders or Protectionists, but by a combination of both, with extreme Labour men, acting in the interests of the consumers and taxpayers, that there ought to be some tapering off policy with regard to the duties, Excise, and bounty. That was a policy that I enunciated at an early stage of the legislation. I contended that whatever we did, if we guaranteed a bounty of £ 3 or £ 4 , and an Excise duty of a somewhat similar amount, we should not fix it for all time or leave the matter open, but should let those Do interested in the industry know that there would be a tapering off side by side with a constant diminution of the Customs revenue. I admitted even then, as a Free Trader, that some measure of Protection was absolutely necessary to support a tropical industry like this under white labour conditions in Australia; but I contend that a duty of £ 6 is not, and never was required. If we, for other purposes of the legislation, had to impose an Excise duty in order to pay the bounty, or rebate as it was called in the first instance, tliere was a logical conclusion in our minds that the legislation should be based in a tapering-off policy, by which we should reduce the Customs duties and the Excise and bounty until they were cleared away altogether. In 1905, when the measure came on for reconsideration, Mr MCCay, who then represented Corinella, proposed, as the basis of the Bill we are now asked to repeal, that the duties should diminish in a certain number of years to two-thirds, and subsequently to one-third, finally passing out of existence. That proposal was supported by members of all three parties-Fre e Traders, Protectionists, and Labourites. It was brought forward by a Protectionist, rupported by me, a Free Trader, and supported also by two members of the present Administration. The present Minister of External Affairs proposed the mbtion, in the absence of Mr MCCay, and the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, now an honorary Minister, seconded it. show that the present Minister of Trade and Customs was not so very much opposed to this way of looking at the question, he held the view that it was possible to make the Excise greater and greater, until it got up to the point of the Customs duty, showing that he did not, at that time, consider that the industry was entitled for all time to the high protection then proposed. What should be the attitude of the Labour party on the financial and fiscal operations of this measure? I take it that the members of the party have full freedom to deal with all questions affecting cal beliefs, but no Labour, man is free, and I am not free, to act unjustly to the taxpayers of this country. No Labour member is free to heap the burdens of a measure of high policy upon the shoulders of the labouring class. Yet that is what we are doing with the taxation at present before us. In this measure we are recognising that it takes £300,000 or £400,000 a year to support the policy of a White Australia, and we place that measure of taxation mainly on the shoulders of the poor. We go further than that. We not only get that amount paid in the form of. revenue, but we put another burden of £600,000 or £700,000 on to the shoulders of the poor, by reason of the fact that we have enhanced the price of sugar, without getting any equivalent into the Treasury of the State. I shall endeavour to explain that that must operate as a fixed law.",33
141,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,Would the poor be any better off if they could get black labour sugar from Java?,34
142,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,"They would be better off if they got sugar die price of which was regulated by a lower Customs duty than we now impose. All the measures that we took for securing a White Australia were in the direction of ceasing to receive coloured aliens for labour in our tropical industries, and deporting those we had already brought in for that purpose. We stopped the arrival of coloured aliens, and deported all we could legally deport. No member of the House, ancl no political organization outside, has ever proposed to go further. We all looked upon this policy as absolutelyfinishedwhen we had done those two things; yet, what are we doing ? Some sort of ethical conviction should be at the base of the politics of any party, but we now say to the coloured aliens who are in our midst, and cannot be legally deported, To some of them having been here for a long time, and married, and settled down"" We decree, by our fiscal legislation, and by no other law, that you shall not work in the sugar cane fields of Australia."" For what good.purpose is that done? Let us look dispassionately at the question. The honourable member for Herbert said, today, that if he had his way, and could roll all the coloured aliens into one, he would gladly get them collectively by the scruff of the neck and pitch them into the Pacific. I hope, for the honourable member's own sake, that he meant he would put them on their fis- to an island in the Pacific.",34
143,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"I meant it figuratively, of course.",34
144,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,"That is not an attitude that could possibly be adopted by this House, or any body of humane persons. We have never considered, much' less passed, any legislation for getting rid of those men, and in the name of humanity, we have no right to forbid them to labour in that particular line of work to which they are most used, and to do which many of them were brought here. If we had that right, and if it were not as inhuman and disgraceful as it is to stop these men labouring in the sugar-fields, on what grounds of reason or common-sense could we def end it ? What good is effected in the interests of the white labourers themselves? We are not here to legislate in the interests of any particular body of workers, such as the labourers in the canefields, as opposed to the labourers in the maize-fields or the mines or the workshops. We are here to look after the interests of labour generally all over the Commonwealth. If these men are forbidden, or prevented by our fiscal legislation, which is th* same thing, from labouring in the sugar industry, they must work elsewhere, or thieve, if they are going to live. If we force them away from one class of work they must seek it in other directions, ancl to the extent to which they succeed in getting it elsewhere, they must interfere with' other white labourers. On grounds of reason and common-sense those who advocate this policy would be beaten at every point of the argument, and driven back to the inhuman conclusion that these people who are allowed to be amongst us, shall not be allowed to work to earn their living. That is a sad commentary upon the Labour .party's attitude with regard, not only to ethics, but also to common-sense and reason in these matters. If it is requisite to protect the white labourer against the possible competition of the black in the sugar 01 any otiier industry, take some steps to do it, but do not take the inhuman, unreasonable attitude of saying that men who are allowed to stay here by our own act shall be prevented from earning their living. The position in which we put diem today is a sort of theological hell, an eternal punishment, without cause or reason, ancl without effecting any good purpose. There must come a time when the conscience of our young nation will awaken to the fact that we cannot afford to be guilty of an action of that sort in the interests of any body of people-leas t of all ii: the interests of the workers of Australia. You must have absolute justice at the bottom of everything you do, and humanity under that; but this course is neither just nor 'humane.",34
145,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,What does the honourable member suggest?,35
146,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,"I shall endeavour to show the honourable member what I suggest, but neither he nor I would undertake to pronounce straight off how the problem is to be dealt with. All I can do now is to suggest certain avenues of thought and directions for looking for information. Anything is better than the policy of drift which the Ministry are inviting us to follow. I have heard it said here many a time that Protection does not raise the price of commodities, that it may in the first instance cause a rise in price, but that as soon as the industry becomes established competition for possession of the home market will so regulate prices that they will come down even a little below the old level. The Minister of Trade and Customs, however, admits today that this policy had been a conspicuous failure in regard to the sugar industry. object in dealing with the matter was to benefit the people, but if we cannot create competition by our legislation we have no right to retain a fiscal regulation, which, by the admissions of honourable members opposite, simply plays into the hands of a gigantic monopoly. Ministers who are putting forward this legislation cannot show us that it is in the interests of anybody but thei capitalists-the Colonial Sugar Reriing Company and the sugar millers.",35
147,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,The Colonial Sugar Refining Company do not want this legislation.,35
148,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,"The Colonial Sugar Refining Company have never wanted anything. Years ago, at this table, I pointed to the fact diat every time this question came up, the company used to state, through its officials and at its public meetings, that Federation meant the ruin of the sugar industry. Yet I have shown - that at each important epoch which brought Federation nearer, up went the price of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company's shares, ancl that they still rose after Federation was accomplished, showing that Federation certainly did not ruin the industry.",35
149,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"But Protection will keep the money in the country, and enable us to deal with any monopoly, which we could not do before. - Mr GB EDWARDS - I have heard of that argument, and of Adam and Noah and other ancient people. I differ from the honourable member, for I do not want the money in the country. So long as we have happiness and comfort and wealth in the country, the money can go where it likes. The honourable member is not awake if he thinks a country is to be made prosperous by keeping the money in it. We must have something more than money in it. At a'time when Spain had more money pei head of the people in its coffers than had any other nation, it was the poorest country on the face of God's earth. It is only in the diffusion of wealth and comfort throughout a people that you will find prosperity. But there is another aspect of the question. The world's price of sugar has gone up during the period that our legislation has been in operation.",35
150,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,It has gone up in Australia because of the monopoly.,35
151,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,"The price of sugar in Australia has also gone up all the Our time.' The honourable member for Hume says it is on account of the monopoly here, but I say it is on account of no such thing. If we had had three refineries in Australia during all that time the price of sugar would have been precisely the same. But what honourable members opposite are wanting to bring about would have happened-the growers would have received a better price for their raw material.

157,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,"Manufacturer and wholesale grocers dealing with sugar. The market price of sugar to them last Saturday was £ 2 1 19s. 4^d., figures, £ 2 2 a ton. On the same day the London market quotation for German raw beet sugar, 88 degrees, was 14s. n d . cwt. The German beet there referred to a thick liquid, which is exported to England to be refined there, and at 100 per cent, would be worth, roughly, about 17s. The German sugar most nearly approaching in quality our IX sugar is known as the "" first marks granulated,"" and was quoted at 17s. 6d. a cwt. Sugars vary so much that in a cargo of 100 tons there might be fifty different samples. But at present quotations the value of the foreign sugar most closely approaching in quality our IX is 17s. 6d. a cwt., or £ 1 7 ios. a ton. There is now an actual difference of £ 5 2s. 6d. a ton between the net price of the Australian and that of the foreign sugar. It is notorious that sugar is dearer do not care today in the world's market than it has been for some time past. The reasons for that I need not inquire now. It is enough to know that it has not been so lvgh since the operation of the duties imposed to meet the war tax.

161,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,"I have shown that the world's price for sugar is higher now than it has been for some time preIts viously; the Colonial Sugar Refining Company increased its price in conformity with It is the price of be sugar in the world's markets that regulates net what we have to pay for it here. If there ivere three refineries in Australia, the price IX of sugar would still be what it is, because per it would still be governed by the world's prices, and would be dearer in Australia by the amount of the duty. The price of s Australian sugar is always kept about £ 6 higher than that of the world's sugar.",36
162,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The difference is jgeneor, in round rally about £5.",36
163,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,"I have shown that at present it is £ 5 2s. 6d., but my per personal experience is that the difference is has been more often £ 6 than a smaller sum.",36
164,Mr MAHON,Unknown,Has the cane-grower received more for his cane as the result of a cwt. the increase in the price of sugar?,36
165,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,"I shall not conclude my speech within a reasonable time if I answer all the questions that are addressed to me. My object is to inform my honourable friends of the Labour party of the facts of the case. The working people of Australia are being unduly and inequitably taxed to support the sugar industry. The only thing that would reduce the price of sugar to the consumers of Australia would be the reduction of the import duty. Nothing else would effect that end. I admit that if there were competition in the refining business the growers might get a better price for their cane, but I do not .admit that the consumers would get cheaper sugar; because the price of sugar is regulated abroad.",36
166,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"The Colonial Sugar Refining Company has increased the price of its sugar by £ 2 a ton, although the cost of production has not increased.",37
167,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,"If the honourable member buys an article for £ 1 0 he does not sell it for £ 1 1 when he can get £15 for it. Similarly the Colonial Sugar Refining Company charges for its sugar what it can get, and it can always.get, in Australia, the world's price, plus our import duty of £ 6 per ton.",37
168,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,The profits might be more equitably divided with the consumers and the growers.,37
169,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,"I am greatly in favour of the division of profits, but how can it be brought about in this case? I wish to draw the attention of honourable members to the statistics relating to the use of sugar in the Commonwealth for the years 1902-3 to 1909-10, and the estimate for the present year, 1910-11. The quantity of sugar on which import duty was paid in those years, less drawbacks and refund on quantities exported, was 377,142 tons, while the Australian grown sugar amounted to 1,382,112 tons, making the local consumption 1,759,254 tons, exclusive of the sugar used in manufactures exported to other countries. If I am right in assuming-and no one has shown me that I am wrong-that Australian consumers Py a Per ton more for their sugar thau they would have had to pay if there were no duty, the extra cost of sugar to them during the period with which I am dealing has been £10,555,524. During the same period the Treasury has received in Customs revenue £2,470,840, and in Excise revenue £4,837,010, of, in all, £7,3° »75°We have to deduct from the Customs and Excise collections the cost of the deportation of Kanakas, which was £13,903, the bounty and its expenses £2,831,915, and 3 per cent.j which is the cost of collection",37
170,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,That is about 2.12 per cent.,37
171,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,"For the purposes of my comparison, I do not think I shall be far out in taking it at 3 per cent., or £219,262, making the total deductions £3,065,080, and bringing the net receipts of the Treasury to £4,243,670. Deducting the Treasury receipts from the extra sum paid by the public, we have left £6,311,854. The people must pay taxes of some kind, and the net amount which has been received by the Treasury must be deducted from the extra cost which I have mentioned to show the net extra cost to the taxpayers, which is £6,311,854, or about £800,000 a year. That is what it costs to uphold the White Australia policy, and it is not a halfpenny too much; but the wrong persons are paying. Why should the cost of the White Australia policy be tome mainly by the poor? Should not the rich pay more towards it than they do, and the tax be made proportionate to means to pay? Why select an article like sugar to pay for this necessary national policy? To check the figures which I have given, let us now deal only with the estimates of the Treasurer for the present year. It is estimated that receipts from Customs duties for 1910-11 will be £286,628, ancl ifToni Excise duties £676,558, a total of £963,186. From that must be deducted for bounty £573,102, for expenses in connection with the payment of the bounty £6,031, and for the collection of the excise and import duties £28,905, a total of £608,038. This leaves the net gain to the Treasury from this heavy taxation of the people of £355,148. The extra price paid by the consumers for the sugar consumed in the current year may be estimated at £1,269,288, being £ 6 a ton on 211,548 tons. I admit that sugar should bear some taxation, but not the excessively heavy burden that we have imposed upon it. It is true, as the honourable member for Herbert said this morning, that it has been, and still is, taxed in most countries; but the honourable member did not tell us that in only one State was a duty of £ 6 per ton imposed prior to Federation. In New South Wales, a sugar manufacturing State, 8 the duty was only £ 3 per ton.",37
172,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,It had been £ 6 per ton.,37
173,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,"-For four or five years immediately preceding Federation it was only £ 3 per ton; yet the. sugar industry there did not pass out of existence. There is the further curious anomaly that sugar growers in New South Wales, who did not employ black labour to any extent, and who, prior to Federation, had a protective duty of only £ 3 per ton, under our wise system of legislation received not only the increased protection of a duty of £ 6 per ton, but a net bounty of £ i per ton j although they never required that assistance, and never asked for it.",37
174,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"Still , land there is going out of sugar cultivation.",38
175,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,"We have to consider. this question in all its bearings. The sugar industry is undoubtedly a magnificent one, and it is essential that we - should buttress it up, not only because of its own value and importance, but in order that we may have the tropical north settled and peopled by white races, who will be ready to defend it in the hour of danger. But do not let us work blindly, and without any system. Let us get at the facts. Let us see whether there is not some other way of carrying out our object than that of placing the whole burden on the shoulders of the poor. The latest figures I have given show that, deducting £355,148, the amount that reaches the Treasury, the amount that the people have to pay in excess of the world's price, is £914,000 per annum. That enormous sum is annually paid more by the poor than by the rich j more by the young than by the aged; more by women than by men, in violation of every canon of taxation that has ever been enunciated. A proposition for a polltax, coming from either side of the House, would be regarded as most extraordinary; but, after all, what is this legislation a poll-tax? Is it not, indeed, worse than a poll-tax ? A poll-tax, if it were imposed for war purposes, would give the poor the satisfaction of knowing that they were paying no more than the rich. The burden of our White Australia policy, however, is thrown upon the poor, and if they pause to think, they must know that, although the average burden placed upon them is 6s. each, they are probably actually paying 7 s.; while the richer classes are paying only 5s. per head. I ask honourable members opposite who, like myself, are supposed to be, and, I hope, are here to protect, mainly, in the first instance, the and the struggling, if we should not consider whether it is worthwhile continuing this legislation, which does so grave an injustice to those least able to bear it. have been asked how I would approacli the solution of the problem. I confess that I am not omniscient on the subject of sugar, or anything else. I am further ready to confess that the difficulties which perplex any one who tries to deal with the sugar question are greater than are those which confront one in dealing witli almost any other subject of which I know. The difficulties of the money problem with which we were dealing recently seemed great, and I dare say that we were all surprised to find how little we really knew of the question when we were brought face to face with it, and bound to arrive at a determination. But this problem of the sugar industry, although it may seem much simpler, is, to my mind, almost as complex as is the money and paper currency question. The net revenue from sugar to be received by the Treasurer during the current year is estimated at £355,148, and the estimated revenue from the import duty at £286,628. If we reduced the import duty to £ 3 per ton, abolished the Excise, paid, a bounty of £ 1 per ton on the sugar contents of the cane, direct to 'the growers, and made it a condition of the payment of the bounty that fair wages should be paid, and free employment given to everybody, irrespective of colour, race, and origin, we should bring about two important changes. I say that free employment should be given to everybody, irrespective cf colour, origin, or race, because, as we have allowed coloured people to remain amongst us, that is the only course that we can fairly take in regard to them, but we must bring them up to our wages standard. By these changes we should but tend to satisfy the grower and the labourer. So far as I know, under present conditions, the other party concerned in the industry does not want looking after. The Colonial Sugar Refining Company has been gaining money under our legislation. Honourable members who have been buttressing up that company by legislation have been doing nothing for the labourers, and nothing for the planters. They have been putting everything into the pockets of this already rich and wealthy corporation, and the only way to prevent it making more than it ought to make is to reduce the import duty to £ 3 poor per ton. Let us abolish the Excise altogether; ancl if the planters must be assisted, assist them by a direct bounty, making it a condition that fair wages shall I be paid. If the import duty were reduced to £ 3 per ton, it would, of course, make some difference in the amount of Customs duty collected during this year. A certain amount of duty would be collected; but, if my theory were put into practice, and were successful, it would be so little that it could be treated as a negligible quantity.",38
176,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,And our people would be exposed to the products of the cheap labour of Fiji.,39
177,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,A duty of £ 3 per ton was considered enough in New South Wales when the honourable member was a member of the State Legislature.,39
178,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"It was the honourable member's leader, Sir George Reid, who reduced the duty from £ 6 to £ 3 per ton.",39
179,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,"The honourable member was then in the State Legislature, and he knows that the reduction of the duty did not wipe out the industry there. It still exists, and receives the ral bounty.",39
180,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Si r George Reid said that if the industry could not maintain itself on a duty of £ 3 per ton, the sugar-cane lands in New South Wales ought to be devoted to dairy farming.",39
181,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,"That is being done, and the people would do much better by devoting that land to dairy farming. In Northern Queensland the position is different. What I complain of is the want of thought given to our legislation, as shown by the fact that we absolutely made a present of the bounty to sugar-cane growers in New South Wales who were not employing black labour, and who had previously carried on their industry with a duty of only £ 3 per ton. The honourable member for Hume says that to admit sugar under a duty of only £ 3 per ton would be to expose our growers to the competition of the black labour of the world.",39
182,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Of Fij i and Java.,39
183,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,"Did not the gentlemen who represented the sugar growing districts in this House in the first instance tell us, time after time, that the difference between the cost of white and of black labour was £ 2 per ton? That statement is to be found again and again in Flansard. It appears in Dr Maxwell's report, and also in reports of meetings of cane-growers and others. I think that the cane-growers say that the difference is £ 2 4s. per ton; but, roughly speaking, the difference in the cost of growing sugar by white and black labour was taken in the first Parliament to be £ 2 per ton.",39
184,Mr FENTON,Unknown,That is in Australia.,39
185,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,It does not matter materially where it is.,39
186,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,It certainly does.,39
187,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,Then what were the wages paid to black labour on the cane-fields ?,39
188,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"£ 6 a year, and their keep.",39
189,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,"If we add that to the total, what difference does it make? The men could not labour for nothing, so that, even if we take ""all these considerations into account, they do not, materially alter the main proposition, that it costs £ 2 per ton more to produce sugar by white labour than it does to produce it by black. Then, again, we have to take into account freights, insurance, and the cost of handling, in connection with the imFedeportation of sugar from Fiji, which constitute a further protection. I admit that, with a duty of £ 3 per ton, we should not have such a measure of protection as wouia enable a colossal institution like that of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company to be built up; but we should at least be able to establish the industry on such a basis that manufacturers could make an honest 7 per cent, or 8 per cent, out of it. Manufacturers who entered into an industry carried on upon a large scale, and returning 7 per cent, or 8 per cent., would be in a very satisfactory position. It was generally considered that the original' system of granting a rebate direct to the growers was the most satisfactory; but it was unconstitutional, and we had to substitute for it the payment of a bounty, which would come within the ambit of the Constitution. With the expiration of the Braddon section, however, we shall be able to pay the bounty direct to the grower of the cane, and so make sure that he receives it, and that at the same time he pays a reasonable wage. Supposing that we paid a' bounty of £ 1 per ton on sugar",39
190,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,What for?,39
191,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,"To support the industry. If we did that, abolished the Excise, and lowered the duty to £ 3 per ton, we should reduce the cost to the taxpayers. If the legislation which I suggest were successful, we should get no revenue from the import duty, because Australia must shortly produce the 200,000 tons per annum which she requires for her own consumption. Thus a bounty of £ t per ton would mean £200,000 per annum paid direct to the growers, or a total loss to the State-sinc e it would have to give up its present Customs revenue - of £500,000. That would be the total cost to the State of putting the sugar industry on a sound footing. At present the taxpayers and consumers are charged £1,000,000 a year, but under the system suggested the cost would only be £500,000, and probably the rich would pay more than they do at present.",39
192,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,Does the honourable meinber think that sugar would be cheaper under such conditions?,40
193,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,"I am absolutely certain of it. We should not be governed by a monopoly then, and a manufacturer or wholesale merchant could send to Java, China, the Mauritius, or England for sugar at the world's price, subject to a duty of £ 3 instead of £ 6 , and the company would be compelled to reduce their price accordingly. This company, gigantic monopoly as it is, is one of the finest mercantile institutions south of the Equator. It has been built up by indomitable pluck, wonderful perseverance, great ingenuity, and by the most careful management that could be exhibited. In the early stages, it was doubtful whether the shareholders would not lose every penny they had invested, and at certain periods they were in dire straits; but they conquered without help, and made fortunes, which, by our legislation, have been doubled. Under all the circumstances, we can certainly extend our respect to the institution; but we have now to consider whether it is wise for us to continue legislation which pours gold into their coffers, or whether we shall adopt some other system, resulting in less profit to the company, but relieving the poor and the taxpayers of this country from the very heavy burden they have now to bear. We can relieve the poor only by reducing the Customs duties, the grower only by a bounty, and the labourer only by insisting that he shall have fair wages and conditions. If these latter conditions be attained, the meanest amongst us can afford to be just ancl humane to the few thousands of coloured aliens we have here by giving them a fair field in which to earn their living where they can best find it.

Under the first part of the clause provision is made for the investment of the money until exthe pended, and sub-clause 4 gives the Treasurer power to expend it only in the redemption of notes and the payment of the expenses of the administration of the Act. The clause gives two powers, one to invest and the other to expend, and under the operation of the Surplus Revenue Act the Treasurer cannot expend the money on anything else.",42
223,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"That is what I wanted to convey. Mr G. B. EDWAR DS (North Sydney) [3-39]-- I heartily congratulate the Treasurer on accepting the suggestions of the Opposition, particularly that of the honourable member for Angas, to place this money in trust. Apart from the reason that it would rescue the money from a possible claim on the part of the States, it was the right thing to do to constitute a Trust Fund of some sort, so that we could have some feeling that the money would be respected, and applied to the purposes intended. I wish the Treasurer had been able to go further, and agree to have the fund removed as far as possible from the action of future Parliaments. We have demonstrated that the Opposition has a useful function to perform.",42

The Treasurer undertook toconsider it, but, apparently, he has decided that it is not worth adopting. I cannot see what objection there is to it. It would have prevented the fund being made use of to meet mere temporary emergencies.: The Treasurer, in his official position, has authority over the fun d by his power to sell debentures or Treasury bonds, in which the moneys could be invested. If we had removed the fund as far as we could fro m the control of Parliament, we should have put some sort of sacred segis over it , and have protected it from being touched except after the most careful consideration by Parliament.",42

On the second reading I urged that, at any rate until the reputation of the note issue had been firmly established, the reserve should be the kept at half the value of the issue. As may that was rejected I now ask that it be it made at least one-third the value of the issue. A reserve of one-fourth is about the lowest for which there is precedent.",43
235,Mr FISHER,Unknown,No .,43

Amendment (by Mr DEAKIN) proposed - That the word "" f o u r t h "" be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the word "" third.""",43
241,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Wide Bay-Treasurer ) [3-54]-- I make no complaint about the action of the Leader of the Opposition in this matter, but he will find no authorities worthy of the name who say that a reserve of a third, or anything like it, is needed for a note issue of this kind. who has had more experience than any other living person in Australia in connection with a Government note issue, the general manager of the Queensland National Bank, which has dealt with over £ 3 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 worth of Queensland State notes during the last seventeen years, without ever presenting a note to the Treasury for payment, says that that issue, with its reserve of 25 per cent, is the strongest paper currency in the world. He has not hesitated to make that statement publicly. I amended this clause, and strengthened it, when the Bill was last in Committee. To say that the reserve should not be less than one-fourth practically means that the Treasury would have to hold one-half of the gold received for the notes. I want honourable members to keep in mind the meaning of the words "" not less than."" They mean, for instance, that if there were £ 6 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 of Australian notes in circulation, and the Treasurer had in his possession only £ 1 , 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 in gold, he could not legally cash the first £ 1 note presented over the counter. Honourable members will recognise, therefore, the enormous gold reserve for which provision is made when we say that it shall be not less than one-fourth of the note issue. The Treasurer must keep a margin above one-fourth to meet any emergency, so that he could not cash a £ 5 note if he had in his possession a gold reserve only £ 4 in excess of the minimum of 25 per cent. I mention these illustrations to show the honourable member for Ballarat that, by having behind this note issue the larger gold reserve that he suggests, we should really defeat the purpose that we have in view. I remind him, too, that we have laid down the principle that no Government shall gain a single penny towards its annual income or expenditure from this system. He would, therefore, defeat the object that we have in view, namely, that of making legitimate use of the balance of the gold reserve which can be properly invested. Legitimately incountry of importance. vested, it will yield a return that will go to a sinking fund that will, I hope, be not only used in years to come for the protection of this currency, but will prove such a - financial backing, that it will be unnecessary to have unsigned Australian bills held over as a double currency, With great respect, therefore, to the honourable member's opinion, I cannot accept his motion.",44
242,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Parramatta) [3-58]--We are very glad of what the The man Prime Minister has already done in tightening up this issue, but I would point out to him that his closing remarks related to something foreign altogether to the purposes of this Bill . I hope that he will not shut his mind altogether to this proposal, notwithstanding the optimistic report of the manager of the Queensland National Bank. There are other bankers in Australia who take another view.",44
243,Mr FISHER,Unknown,The banks have never had anything against these notes.,44
244,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"There are in other parts of the world Treasuries which have gold against their notes. In Canada, for instance, they have from 66 per cent, to 70 per cent, of gold coin and bullion as against their Dominion notes, and they have in addition 60 per cent, of guaranteed securities. Mr A. B. Stewart, a Sydney bank manager, in a very excellent paper on the question of currency, some time ago made that statement. I do not wish to say more at this stage, but I think that the Prime Minister would strengthen his Bill immensely if he agreed to the substitution of the words "" one-third "" for the words "" one-fourth."" I should like to explain that we make this proposal today because we had no opportunity to submit it when the measure was last before us. We had intended to put it before the Committee, but the amendment moved by the honourable member for Lang providing for a reserve of 50 per cent, was put in such a form and so worded that we could not do so. I strongly iurge the Treasurer to consider these further points, and to tighten up the issue in the way we propose.",44
245,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"Wimmera) [ 4 . 2 ] - I regret that the Treasurer has not seen fit to accept the very reasonable proposal made by the Leader of the Opposition. His own figures as published in Hansard show that this paper currency will be backed up by a gold reserve lower than that of any The honourable gentleman has referred this afternoon to a gentleman from Queensland, who, no doubt, is a very eminent authority, but if I remember rightly, the joint letter forwarfled to the Treasurer from the leading bankers of Australia laid special emphasis on the fact that the proposed gold reserve was far too low. The Treasurer's own figures show that it is altogether inadequate in the light of what is done by older and more experienced countries. The honourable gentleman quoted figures showing that the percentages of reserves in other countries were as follows :-Ban k of England, 108 per cent.; Scotland, 76 per cent.; Ireland, 47 per cent.; France, 82 per cent.; Germany, 87 per cent.",44
246,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,As against what ?,45
247,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"As against the notes issued. Russia has a reserve of 136 per cent., Austria 80 per cent., and Switzerland 50 per cent. Switzerland has a Government note issue, and although it may be said that the law of Austria-wher e there is a purely Government issue-pro vides for a gold reserve of 40 per cent., the experience of that nation is that there is usually a reserve of 80 per cent.  member is including deposits on call.",45
248,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"No . Austria has a purely Government issue, Austrian Bank has the exclusive right to issue Government notes, I scarcely think that Australia is in a position to set up a standard of her own against the teachings of every nation in the world. I have always been sympathetic towards the Government controlling the national currency, but we cannot ignore those plain fundamental principles which mark the only path of safety. I am sorry that the Treasurer cannot accept the amendment.",45
249,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"Melbourne) [4.6] - ! desire to make only one quotation to show how reliable the statements of the honourable member for Parramatta are. It is ridiculous for that honourable member to say that Canada has a gold reserve of 60 per cent, for notes, as is made plain from the following quotation from the Dominion Banking Act. . . the Minister of Finance ancl ReceiveiGeneral shall always hold, for securing the redemption of such notes issued and outstanding, an amount in gold or Canada securities, guaranteed by the Government of the United Kingdom, equal to not less than 25 per cent, of such notes, at least 15 per cent, of the total amount of such notes being held in gold; and provided, also, that the said Minister shall always hold for the redemption of such notes an amount equal to the remaining 75 per cent, of the total amount thereof in Dominion Debentures issued by authority of Parliament.",45
250,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Parramatta) [4.7] - The honourable member for Melbourne is fond of using the word "" ridiculous,"" but if anything is ridiculous it is the language he has just used. His figures show nothing, except that in Canada the banks are compelled by law to hold an irreducible minimum, whereas I quoted the actual coin held against the note issue.",45
251,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"Richmond) [4.8] - I admit that the provision mentioned by the Treasurer materially strengthens the position ; and, further, that, after a few years, we might be safe with a gold reserve of 25 per cent. For a few years, however, we do not know what may happen j and it would be just as well to accept the suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition. With the fund that is being built up, provided that Parliament does not touch it in any way-and as to that we have no guarantee - w e may, as I say, in a few years find a gold reserve of 25 per cent, sufficient.",45
252,Mr FISHER,Unknown,There will be the same guarantee of the honesty of representatives that there is now. and the Mr MASSYGREENE - I am not casting any aspersion on the honesty of representatives; but emergencies may arise and induce Parliament to do what it would not do if the opportunity were not there. I would sooner see the whole matter free from the atmosphere of politics.,45
253,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Ballarat) [4.10] - I do not propose to further argue this question. If honourable members will be good enough to refer to the argument I endeavoured to follow on the second reading, they will understand why I am now advocating a gold reserve of one-third, since a reserve of one-half is not obtainable. I have not altered the opinion that a much' smaller reserve would do, and more than do, in ordinary periods; but the panic test which has ruined every paper currency that has been ruined, and there have been many, should be provided against. We can afford to put aside such a reserve, and thus place our issue beyond, all suspicion or doubt, and create an impression which will stand us in good stead, not only in tiiis country, but outside. This reserve would really cost us nothing, and call for no sacrifice worth mentioning. We can well afford it, and it would be to the permanent gain of .the reputation of Austialia.. As to the Queensland currency, it has never had fo stand the panic test, or any test, since the notes were issued.",45
254,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Wide Bay-Treasurer ) [4.12] - I desire to express my appreciation of the manner in which this question has been dealt with. The responsibility, of course, rests with the Government.",46
255,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,But we have a responsibility.,46
256,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I quite admit that. I feel my responsibility, and I venture to repeat what I said on the second reading: that this is a measure which errs on the side of caution, rather than on the side' of recklessness.",46
257,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"In ordinary times, yes.",46
258,Mr FISHER,Unknown,On no occasion in Queensland has there been a demand in excess of 11 per cent.,46
259,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,But there has never been the slightest suspicion of a panic.,46
260,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I know; but I venture to make the forecast that in the most extreme panic in Australia there will never be a demand that will bring the reserve under 25 per cent., or doubtfully near 25 per cent.; for, obviously, a gold reserve of 25 per cent, means from 25 per cent, to one-third. I admit freely that there is no special providence watching over Australia, and we can look for no special exemption from financial crises, which do, and will, occur. But strong as the Northern State note issue is, with a reserve of 25 per cent.,, a Commonwealth issue, with the same reserve, will, for obvious reasons, be doubly strong. I am sorry that I cannot accept - the amendment, which I regard, of course, as intended to make assurance doubly sure. Question-That the word proposed to be left out stand part of the clause-put .
