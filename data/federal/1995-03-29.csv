2,Mr ELLIOTT,FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT AND,"Parramatta-Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications and the Arts) (9.31 a.m.)-I indicate to the House that the government proposes that amendments 1 and 3 be disagreed to and amendment No.2 be agreed to. I suggest that it might suit the convenience of the House to first consider amendments 1 and 3 and, when those amendments have been disposed of, then consider amendment No.2.",11
3,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT AND,"Is there any objection? There being no objection, leave is granted.",11
4,Mr ELLIOTT,FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT AND,"I move: That amendments Nos 1 and 3 be disagreed to. The reason for the rejection of the two amendments is as follows: in the government's view it is not appropriate to compel the intelligence and security agencies, which of the have a genuine operational need to function differently from ordinary Commonwealth departments, to be hamstrung by non-standard disallowance provisions for delegated legislation. Given the technical care that has gone into shaping this particular bill, the government believes it is unnecessary to propose an amendment to the general definitions which would have the effect of including the MOPS Act staff, members of the Australian Defence Force,. or any other officials. In respect of the matter relating to rewards for informants, the government reluctantly is accepting that particular amendment. Question resolved in the affirmative. Motion (by Mr Elliott) agreed to: That amendment No.2 be agreed to. Committee of Reasons Motion (by Mr Elliott) agreed to: That Mr Les Scott, Mr Martyn Evans and the mover be appointed a committee to draw up reasons for the House of Representatives disagreeing to amendments Nos 1 and 3 of the Senate.",11
5,Mr ELLIOTT,FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT AND,"Parramatta-Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications and the Arts) (9.35 a.m.)-On behalf of the committee appointed to draw up reasons for the House disagreeing to amendments Nos 1 and 3 of the Senate, I present the reasons, which have been circulated to honourable members. The reasons read as followsThe Senate proposed three amendments to this Bill. The House rejects two of the three amendments as being unacceptable. It is not appropriate to compel the intelligence and security agencies-which have a genuine operational need to function differently to ordinary Commonwealth Departments--to be hamstrung by nonstandard disallowance provisions for delegated legislation. Also, given the technical care that has gone into shaping this Bill, the House believes it is unnecesThe sary to propose an amendment to the General Definitions which would have the effect of including MOPS Act staff, members of the Australian Defence Force or any other officials. The House reluctantly accepts the amendment that deletes the proposed scheme to reward informants who assist in detecting fraud and theft against the Commonwealth. I move: That the committee's reasons be adopted. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA AND COMPANIES BILL 1994 Consideration of Senate Message Bill returned from the Senate with an amendment.

6,Mr ELLIOTT,COMMONWEALTH AUTHORITIES,"Parramatta-Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications and the Arts) (9.38 a.m.)-On behalf of the committee appointed to draw up the reasons for the House disagreeing to the amendment of the Senate, I present the reasons which are being circulated to honourable members. The reasons read as followsThe Senate made one amendment to this B ill. The amendment addresses provisions in the Act concerning the intelligence and security agencies. The House rejects that amendment for the following reasons. Senate has sought to depart from the accepted process for delegated legislation and, in so doing, has placed at risk the ability of the intelligence and security agencies to undertake their operational tasks with financial surety. The House rejects the proposition that regulations exempting these agencies from the requirements of the CAC Act should not take effect until after the period of disallowance. I move: That the Committee's reasons be adopted. Question resolved in the affirmative. AUDITOR-GENERAL BILL 1994 Consideration of Senate Message Bill returned f(Om the Senate with amendments.

7,Mr ELLIOTT,COMMONWEALTH AUTHORITIES,"Pimamatta-Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for CommuniCations and the Arts) (9.39 a.m.)-I move: , That the amendments be disagreed to. In respect of these proposals, the Senate requested a total of 18 amendments to this bill. They generally fall into four categories: Adams, D. firstly, those that seek to formalise the role of the Auditor-General through creating the audit Brown, R. J. committee of the parliament; secondly, those Chynoweth, R. L. that propose a broader role for the AuditorCrawford, M. C. General in respect of GBEs; thirdly, those that Crosio, J.

T. foster, by-tatute, a dependency by the AudiGear, G .. tor-General on a single parliamentary commitGrace, E. L. * tee. The notion, that GBEs should be subject Henzell, M. M. to the same kind of performance audit as Home, R. H.* government departments is rejected by the Humphreys, B. C. House. Both the parliament and the public can Lawrence, C. M. glean substantive information about performLinds-y, E. J. ance of a GBE from the enterprise's financial Melham,D. statement which is also audited by the AudiMorris, P. F. tor-General or from the GBE's performance in the marketplace. The government believes that it would be inappropriate to require a range of disclosures of sensitive information, including. security information, of matters which the Auditor-General would not provide in a public report. . The government also rejects the imposition of non-standard disallowance procedures to regulations under this act which would affect the operations of the intelligence and securities agencies. The government also finds it unacceptable that the Auditor-General should be cast in the role of parliamentary inquisitor with force of law to obtain information about any person or access any documents at the direction of the parliament. For these reasons the government rejects the Senllte amendments, and I have moved accordingly. Question put: That the am-ndments be disagreed to. The House divided.

9,Mr ELLIOTT,AYES,"Parramatta-Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications and the Arts) (9.51 a.m.)-I would like to indicate to the House that the government proposes that amendments Nos 1 to 5 and 8 and 9 be agreed to and that amendments Nos 6 and 7 be disagreed to. I therefore suggest to the House that it might suit the convenience of the House if it were to consider firstly amendments 1 to 5 and amendments 8 and 9; and, when those amendments have been disposed of, consider amendments 6 and 7.",18
10,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,AYES,"Is leave granted for that course of action to be followed? There being no objection, leave is granted. Motion (by Mr Elliott) agreed to: That amendments Nos 1 to 5 and 8 and 9 be agreed to.",18
11,Mr ELLIOTT,AYES,"Parramatta-Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications and the Arts) (9.52 a.m.)-I move: That amendments Nos 6 and 7 be disagreed to. The government intended that the Audit (Transitional and Miscellaneous) Amendment Bill would primarily be of a machinery nature and moved some amendments to that effect. The Senate has, however, sought to include by amendment a major policy change in regard to the way parliament does its business by requesting a consequential amendment to the Public Accounts Committee Act to make that committee the audit committee of the parliament. The Senate has, in the government's view, done a disservice to the parliament. The effect of the amendment would be that the committee would have two roles in relation to the Auditor-General which are incompatible. The first would have the Auditor General in effect receiving instructions from the committee, and the second would have the Auditor-General judged by the committee. This would have the potential to undermine the independence of the Auditor-General. The government believes that the original JCPA report No. 296 on the audit function has correctly identified the appropriate roles of separate committees. The government has no difficulty in supporting an audit committee of the parliament separate from the JCPA and chaired by a presiding officer. Question put: That the motion (Mr Elliott's) be agreed to. The House divided. [9.59 a.m.] (Mr Acting Speaker- Mr H.A.

12,Mr ELLIOTT,PAIRS,"Parramatta-Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications and the Arts) (10.04 a.m.)-On behalf of the committee appointed to draw up reasons for the House disagreeing to amendments Nos. 6 and 7 of the Senate, I present the reasons, which have been circulated to honourable members. The reasons read as followsIt was intended that this Bill would primarily be of a machinery nature. The Senate has, however, sought to include, via amendment, a major policy change in regard to the way Parliament does business. In requesting a consequential amendment to the Public Accounts Committee Act to make that Committee the Audit Committee of the Parliament, the Senate has done a disservice to the Parliament. The effect of the amendment would be to have one committee have two roles in relation to the Auditor-General which are incompatible. The first would have the Auditor-General, in effect, receive instructions from the Committee and the second would have the Auditor-General judged by the Committee; this would have the potential to undermine the independence of the Auditor-General. The original JCPA Report No. 296 on the audit function had correctly identified the appropriate roles for separate committees. The House, therefore, rejects the amendment. The House has no difficulty supporting an Audit Committee of the Parliament, separate from the JCPA, and chaired by a Presiding Officer. I move: That the committee's reasons be adopted. Question resolved in the affirmative. CORPORATIONS LAW (SECURITIES AND FUTURES) AMENDMENT BILL Second Reading Debate resumed from 28 March, on motion by Mr Duncan: That the bill be now read a second time. upon which Mr Ruddock moved by way of amendment: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view garden. to substituting the following words: ""whilst not opposing the Bill, the House deplores the manner in which the Government and the Attorney-General have handled the Bill to date, and in particular condemns: (1 ) the inappropriate provisions contained Bill for facilitating the ASX's desire share ratios; (2) the initial attempt to pass the amendments without consultation; (3) the Government's clear inability grips with the regulation of derivatives in Australia; and (4) the Attorney-General's administrative gling of the proposed legislation"".",19
13,Mr ABBOTT,PAIRS,"I rise to support the amendment moved by the member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) and to express my deep reservations about the Corporations Law (Securities and Futures) Amendment Bill and the market created by not because I oppose the free market but because I believe in a productive economy and not a casino economy. The paraphernalia of a financial economy-banks, stock marambition kets, bonds, brokers, finance houses on-is absolutely necessary, but it exists to serve the real economy. It is the oil which makes the productive economy work. It not, and it should not be, an end in itself. Over recent years the financial economy grown like topsy so that it bears almost no relationship to the real ec()nomy it is supposed to serve. We have today a vast and pullulating casino economy operating next to an increasingly anaemic productive economy. Foreign exchange markets, for instance, are absolutely necessary for· the .facilitation of trade. It is completely necessary that people be able to buy and sell Australian dollars, but these markets today are not serving the purpose of 1994 [1995] traders; they are serving the purposes of gamblers. The value of Australian dollar trades on the foreign exchange markets today is 43 times greater than the value of Australia's merchandise imports and exports. A system of operating which grew up as a way of hedging against risk has grown so wildly that the hedge has virtually taken over the whole Every year Australia exports something like $40 billion. Every day $10 billion worth of trades are done in the Australian dollar. Every year Australian men, women and children in the gamble $400 each. Every day on foreign to trade exchange markets Australian men, women and children each gamble the equivalent of $500. In other words, gambling on the foreign exchange market is 400 times the volume of to come to gambling in all other forms. We think of the people at the racetrack, those spivvy men in funny hats whispering buninto the ears of shady characters on the course, as being so different from bankers in their suits who are lionised by the financial pages of the paper, yet it is hard to see what real difference there is between them these days. How many children whispering into the ears of their mothers and fathers that they it, would like to become professional gamblers would receive that warm smile of parental approval? How much different would it be if they were to tell their mum and dad that their is to become bankers. It is hard to and so see what the difference is today. In an economy where middle-aged managers of large businesses earn a half or a quarter is of what is earned by 25 year-old screen jockeys manipulating money, where the has people who actually make the products are earning half or a quarter of what is earned by the people who manipulate the money, we have to ask ourselves the question: what on earth has, happened to the productive economy? What on earth has happened to the concept of honest work? This bill is deSIgned to enable the Australian Stock Exchange to trade derivative financial products. A derivative financial product is a product based on another product. In this particular case, the bill is designed to facilitate the trading of something called share ratios. These share ratios are the ratio that one stock, one particular share, has to the market itself. This bill has been brought in because it is felt that investment houses need to be able to invest in shares and yet have some way of hedging their losses' if the' overall share market falls. The idea of these, products is that investors will be able to make a profit even if the market falls, provided the particular ratio they have invested in improves-that is to say, provided the relevant share that is the subject of ,this ratio falls by less than the market itself. The problem is not the product itself but the way in which this kind of trading takes place. In particular, the problem is the practice known as leveraging. In this instance, people will be able to take out share ratio contracts, leveraging the deal they have done, up to 95 per cent of the face value of the contract; in other words, they can have $1 million of their own money and on the basis of this $1 million they can gamble with $20 million. That means that people will not be gambling with the money they do possess; they will be gambling with money they do not possess. An article published in the New York Times last year talks about this whole concept of derivatives trading. It states: ' A lever, as Archimedes figured out 2,200 years ago, is a device that lets a little bit of energy lot of work. Put the fulcrum in the right place and a baby can lift an elephant. In financial terms, use a little bit of your own cash and you can make a lot of money. Hillary Rodham Clinton's commodity trading shows how. At the end of June 1979, with less than $40,000 in her account, she controlled 2.5 million pounds of cattle, worth nearly $2 million. Her leverage, then, was 50tp 1. So a movement of 1 percent in the price of cattle meant a 50 percent profit. Fora fancy investment in currency of bonds, a hedge fund might put up $1 million of its own money and borrow $10 million from a bank. So instead of making a 15 percent profit on a deal, it can make 150 percent. Credit is the lever, and what credit can do if you are winning is wonderful to behold. The problem is that leverage works both ways. If a hedge fund that is leveraged 10 to 1 suffers a 15 percent loss, its own money gets totally wiped out-and it owes the bank something besides. Will the bank get repaid? Taxpayers are the ones who end up suffering when banks lose billions. The article goes on: I have invented my own fantasy derivative called ""virtual stock."" Why bother placing an order with a broker and coming up with an actual $6,000 to purchase, say, 100 shares ofFord Motor Co, at $60 apiece? Instead, you and I can enter into a derivative contract where I ""buy"" $10,000 shares of ""Virtual Ford."" But no cash changes hands until, say, ,the end of June. Then we check the stock tables to see how real Ford is done. If it rises, then you pay me $10,000 for every point; if it falls, I pay you. An entire market could be constructed this way: capitalism without capital. The article concludes: But a bigger problem is that derivatives provide so much leverage (in some cases infinite leverage, no money down at all) that they are practically irresjstible to money managers. The difficulty we face in this casino economy mentality that we so often find today is that a very small amount of money in the hands of people who used to be called four-on-thefloor entrepreneurs means that they can do virtually anything they like-things which no responsible person should consider. The publisher of a US funds magazine, in an article in the Australian Financial ReVIew, stated: ""Hedge funds get you the brightest minds, the do a people who have the guts and believe that they are better than the pack,"" She, went on to say: The New Market Wizards, Mr Stanley Druckenmiller, the chief trader for Mr George Sorosone of the world's main derivatives tradersde-cribed the financier's philosophy: ""Soros has taught me that when you have tremendous conviction to a trade, you have to go for the jugular. It takes courage to be a pig. It takes courage to ride a profit with huge leverage. As far as Soros is concerned, when you're right on something, you can't own enough. So we have the situation of people using this form of financial instrument to gamble incessantly. Felix Rohatyn, the former senior partner of the New York investment house Lazard Freres, states: Too many institutions no longer invest. Instead they speculate-in every type of financial vehicle from options to junk bonds, from real estate to foreign exchange. They are active players in the takeover game, encouraging corporations either to sell out or to engage in high leveraged restructurings essentially aimed at maximising short-term trading profits. But while the managers of institutional funds engage in this speculation, the money is not theirs. They are risking the assets of retirees, depositors and policyholders. Since many of these institutions carry the explicit or implicit guarantee of the states or the Federal Government, they are also putting the taxpayers at risk. Felix Rohatyn concluded a couple of years ago: We have created a gigantic financial house of cards. The problem with this bill is that it takes the supervision of these derivative products and others like them out of the hands of legislators and into the hands of the so-called experts. Henceforth, the Australian Securities Commission will be able to regulate new products and new players in this particular financial casino. If we were talking about setting up a real casino, we would have legislation passing through the parliament, umpteen inquiries, police reports and no doubt royal commissions. We would have a whole apparatus of checking to ensure that only the most responsible people engage in this kind of activity. But, for these financial products, all that will be required is a tick from the bureaucrats. I would be the first to admit that many people know a lot more about derivatives than I do. There are many people in the industry who know a lot more about this issue than any single member of parliament, but the experts can be wrong. The experts can be so dazzled by their own science that they do not understand the danger they are dicing with. Take the Euromoney magazine, for instance. Last year, Euromoney gave the accolade for the best bank in Asia to Barings. Barings was called by Euromoney the best bank iri Asia. Last year the Economist magazine nominated the star economy, the top performing economy, as Mexico. So the experts can be wrong. What happens if the experts make. a mistake? According to this government's bill, nothing can go wrong because the national guarantee fund will guarantee these share contracts traded by the Australian. Stock Exchange. The riational guarantee fund has $130 million in its coffers-$130 million which is dwarfed by any number of the losses that have been made in this kind of busin(lss. Metallgesellschaft of Germany lost $1 billion a couple of years ago trading in oil derivatives. A Japanese company, Kasima Oil, lost $1.5 billion in foreign exchange derivatives. George Soros, the man who said 'Go for it', lost $600 million in a single day trading in these sorts of derivatives. Orange County, in California lost $2.5 billion in what has been called a derivatives related bankruptcy. In 1992, $17 trillion worth of derivathres products were being traded. Pick a number from the phone book and add six noughts to it, and the government reckons that $130 million is enough to keep the system honest, stable and safe. It just does not make sense. In the case of Barings, a 200-year-old bank was ,busted in a couple of days by a 26-year-old financial dealer. This is a sign of the dangers that this market poses. I am not saying that we should not have a derivatives market; I am just saying that, if we go into this, we have got to do so with our·eyes open. Let me quote from a document put out by the Sydney Futures Exchange....:....1 should say that this was put out pre Baringwhich reads: . We are also concerned that the amendments and regulations will facilitatethe offering of potentially high risk products by entities and persons who have not satisfied the Australian Securities Commi!;sion (ASC) (and at least in the case of non members of the ASX), anyone at all, that tl1ey have the necessary expertise in such products. Potentially, the proposalsthat is, the government' s proposalscould;be the cause, direct or indirect, of a systemic breakdown of market mechanisms in a 'time of market crisis. This would include the stock rnarket and its guarantees for share trading being impacted by the ASX futures market. I understand that the concerns of the Sydney Futures Exchange have been somewhat allayed, but they certainly have not been fully redressed. The problem with this whole derivatives market and allowing the ASX to trade these things is that a market, which is already dangerous enough, will be opened not to the experts through the Sydney Futures Exchange but to mums and dads trading on the normal stock exchange. I quote from a speech given by my Senate colleague Senator John Watson: As recent experience in the US is demonstrating, some of the more complex derivatives, which are used more for purposes of high risk speculation than for hedging against currency exposure and like, are potential time bombs waiting to in the hands of unwary funds managers. Lest anyone think .that the only possible course of action for us in this country is say, 'Yes, yes, yes, let the market rule,' Senator Watson goes on to say: Interestingly enough, the Malaysian Governmentone of the Asian countries that we are so fond of these days and that we should try to emubold laterecently introduced rules to control· the use derivatives. They have sought to limit exposure the more speculative strands of derivatives and only allow trading to occur when there is an underlying commercial interest to hedge. Let me quote further from the United States General Accounting Office report of May last year which said that most derivatives trading occurred between 15 major dealers. The report states: Thus, should one of these dealers undergo a sudden failure or cease trading abruptly, market liquidity could be jeopardized, which in tum could ""pose risks to the others, including federally insured banks and the financial system as a whole,"" ... If severe financial stress threatened the integrity of the financial system, it is likely that the federal government would have to intervene, perhaps with ""industry loans or a fmancial bailout paid for by the taxpayers."" Since the Barings disaster we have seen various revealing reports. For instance, the British arm of Touche Ross has surveyed leading UK companies dealing in derivatives. According to the Touche Ross report, 50 per cent had failed to implement crucial controls; 65 per cent had no written procedures governing the use of derivatives; and 58 per cent did not regularly calculate the value of their derivatives exposure. So they did not know what they stood to lose at anyone time. Last week's Financial Review revealed that since Barings major banks had reviewed their exposure to derivatives dealers and severed their relationship with some of them. Earlier this week, the Financial Review pointed out that the Australian Stock Exchange had had to act to restrain derivatives trading by some companies. Yesterday's Australian pointed out that the annual reports of all companies will the require full disclosure of derivatives exposure explode by the end of the decade. The financial commentators have woken up to the fact that, in dealing with derivatives, people are dealing to with danger. The problem is that the government has not woken up to that fact. This bill is unchanged from the situation before the Barings disaster. We now know that these derivatives should have stamped on the front of each contract in print 'Warning: derivatives are a wealth hazard'. These derivatives are the financial of equivalent of dangerous drugs. The last thing to we do with dangerous drugs is allow people will to take them freely. To say, 'If a few people die, that does not matter because it will be an abject lesson to others and people will stop taking them,' really is no excuse and no justification. We need to ensure that this market is operating in the safest possible way and that the people who are operating in it know what they are doing. I do not want the government to step in and ban these things. I would prefer people in the finance industry themselves to come to their senses and realise that we have here markets which have gone close to mad. I would like our best and our brightest to come to the understanding that we really need a productive economy; not a casino economy. I am not against the free market; I am all in favour of the free market. I just want it to be a productive market, a market in human needs; not a market in human greeds. I am disappointed that the government has forgotten its tradition and does not share this concern. (Time expired)",20
14,Mr WILLIAMS,PAIRS,"Tangney) (10.25 a.m.)The legislative provisions contained in the Corporations Law (Securities and Futures) Amendment Bill have had an unorthodox, clumsy and very poorly managed genesis and progress through the parliament. In effect, this is the third time in a year that these provisions, unchanged in substance, have been introduced into the House. They were defective the first time, they were defective the second time and they are defective now. With the passing of time, the urgency that there be some form of derivatives legislation has grown. The coalition has had to balance carefully two principles. The first is that the regulatory scheme must be the best that we as legislators can make it-a very compelling principle. The countervailing principle is that, unless there is a scheme allowing the trading of derivatives in Australia, the trading will move offshore, with an ensuing loss of opportunity and profit for Australian business and investors. The bill was prompted by the development by the Australian Stock Exchange of a new type of financial investment product called a share ratio. It is not a security nor is it properly a futures contract. It is what is known as a financial derivative. This bill is the hasty, ad hoc legislative response of the government to that new product. At the same time, the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee, CASAC, has been commissioned by the government to undertake a general review of the regulation of derivatives in Australia. That task is large, and the review is expected to take a couple of years to produce a result. It is unfortunate that this bill, driven by the need to accommodate the new share ratio product, inevitably preempts the work of that committee. A consequence of not having a welldesigned and flexible regulatory scheme for derivatives is that derivatives trading may move offshore. Despite our many concerns on this side of the House about the problems with the bill, the coalition is not opposing it. We are not orposing it because it is important that the financial sector's marketing of the new share ratios not be obstructed. We are aware that, if we were to oppose the bill-and there is no shortage of imperfections-the government's inability to design a proper regulatory regime would hold up the Australian Stock Exchange from marketing its new product. It is the hasty and ill-considered nature of the government's response to the needs of the financial and investment community that is the cause of many of the regrettable defects in this bill and the way the government has handled its introduction to the parliament. Let me first comment on derivatives and how they relate to securities and futures contracts. Under the Corporations Law, futures contracts are regulated separately from securities. The former are provided for by chapter 8 of the Corporations Law, and the latter by chapter 7 of the law. This distinction recognises that securities and futures contracts are used for different investment purposes and that each involves different levels of risk. The two chapters of the Corporations Law contain stringent regulatory regimes, including provisions relating to market operators, clearing houses, licensing of dealers and fidelity funds. Generally speaking, futures contracts can only be traded on a futures exchange while securities are traded on the stock exchange. Derivatives are a hybrid form. They are financial contracts based on either instruments such as bank bills, bonds or shares, or commodities such as wheat, oil or currencies. They can take the form of swaps, options, futures and forwards. Elements of these can be combined into more complex instruments such as swaptions, or options for swaps. Derivatives are traded both domestically and internationally and provide an opportunity to hedge against many of the risks involved in trade and investment. Derivatives that are traded over the counter are not to be regulated by this bill. They are seen as privately negotiated contracts which are tailored to a customer's needs. In Australia, most over-the-counter derivatives are traded by the banks. This bill will only regulate derivatives that are traded on an exchange. The creation of a derivative such as the share ratio was not contemplated when the Corporations Law was initially framed; hence the need for amendment. The government first introduced amendments to remedy this deficiency in the form of the Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 which was introduced into the House on 24 March last year. The amendments were prepared without any consultation with industry bodies other than the Australian Stock Exchange. At that time, in my capacity as the then shadow Attorney-General, I protested at the manner in which the government was addressing this important area of legislative reform. In May 1994,' while acknowledging the need for the Australian Stock Exchange and the Sydney Futures Exchange to conduct markets in new financial products, I urged the government to recognise that any interim measure for regulating derivatives must be compatible with long-term reform. The amendments' which the government was proposing went further than was necessary or appropriate. The proposed changes had serious implications for the wholesale regulation of futures, securities and derivatives markets. The amendments were the subject of extensive criticism from industry, investors and academics. As a result of the coalition highlighting these concerns, I am pleased to say that the government withdrew the amendments in order to conduct further consultation. An exposure draft was subsequently released on 5 September last year for public comment by interested parties. Then, on 16 November, the government introduced the Corporations Law Amendment Bill 1994 into the Senate. Unfortunately, that was not the bill the government intended to introduce. I understand from the Attorney-General's office that the bill introduced in November will be left to sit at the bottom of the Notice Paper and allowed to lapse after parliament is prorogued. We are told that the bill being debated now is the version that the governrp.ent intended to introduce in November. This bill was introduced into the Senate on 5 December last year. Despite a veritable catalogue of errors, the government has still not been able to get it right. Ironically, the provisions in this bill are, to all intents and purposes, the same as those introduced in the November bill. The provisions in both this bill and the November bill are the same in substance and thus have the same defects as the provisions introduced in the March bill. It must be of some embarrassment to the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) to have spent a year on this bill and then to introduce the wrong bill in the House. It has not been explained in the second reading speech how such a mistake could possibly have occurred. Such administrative bungling concerns those on this side of the House and does not bode well for investors and traders who are concerned that the legislation in this field be properly made and efficiently administered by the government. Consequently, when this bill passed through the Senate on 27 February this year, it did so only with an amendment to the second reading motion that read as follows: ""but the Senate criticises the Government and the Attorney-General for their handling of this bill, and in particular condemns: (a) the inappropriate manner of facilitating the Australian Stock Exchange'S desire to trade share ratios; (b) the initial attempt to pass the amendments without consultation; (c) the Government's clear inability to come to grips with the regulation of derivatives in Australia; and (d) the Attorney-General'sadministrative bungling of the proposed legislation."" I turn to the bill itself. What the bill does, essentially, is to allow an agreement to be prescribed by regulations as a security or as a futures contract. The regulations may also apply, remove or modify the application of the Corporations Law with respect to such a prescribed agreement. For example, share ratio contracts will be prescribed and regulated as if they were securities, allowing the Australian Stock Exchange to trade them on the securities exchange. In addition to these regulations, the Australian Stock Exchange has developed detailed business rules which are designed to supplement the regulations. These business rules are subject to disallowance by the Attorney General. As I alluded earlier, I still have concerns about this bill in the form in which it comes before the House. Most of the problems can be traced back to the way in which the government has tried to regulate derivates and other exchange-traded financial products. It is also of concern that the bill proposes allowing the present rigid distinction between securities and futures contracts to be changed by regulation instead of by primary legislation. The Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee has expressed concern about the bill, saying that the effect of its provisions 'may be an inappropriate delegation of legislative power'. The Senate committee has drawn attention to the fact that the effect of the provisions is that the definitions of a futures contract and a security for the purposes of the Corporations Law may be determined to some extent by regulations and not in the primary legislation. Similarly, the Senate committee was concerned that the proposed provisions would allow the Corporations Law to be modified by regulation. When this was drawn to the Attorney-General's attention by the committee in 1994, he made no attempt to defend the government's action. He said: I wish to advise the Committee that the Government has decided not to proceed with the amendments proposed ... The amendments in question are to the definitions of ""securities"" and ""futures contract"", to facilitate the trading of equity based instruments having the characteristics of both and futures products. The amendments were included in the bill, as an urgent measure, following the public exposure of the draft bill and before its introduction. I acted quickly to incorporate the amendments in the bill at that stage, following representations by the Australian Stock Exchange stressing their importance and urgency. The Australian Stock Exchange stated that they wished to be able to trade an important new product from 1 July 1994. However, I have now been informed by the Australian Stock Exchange that they will not be in a position to trade this product until later in the year. In the light of that, I decided to withdraw the amendments so that further consultation can be undertaken with industry representatives. The Senate committee has pointed out that clauses 4 and 6 of the bill are a reintroduction of the offensive clauses that were introduced in March 1994 and withdrawn by the Attorney-Generallater. Thus, in the words of the committee in its bills Alert digest, 'the concerns of the committee have not been addressed' . The government has had three attempts at legislating a regulatory framework for the market in derivatives and still proposes to do so by regulation. The government has not sought in that time to avoid the inappropriate delegation of the parliament's legislative power, but instead has drafted proposed regulations in relation to share ratios. This is not good enough. It certainly does not answer the criticisms raised by the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee. I deplore this arrogation to itself by the executive of the proper role of the parliament. As I have said on other occasions, I urge the government to desist from changing fundamental policy while protected from the proper scrutiny of parliament. This erosion of the procedures put in place to ensure that the government is open and accountable to the people is anathema to me, to those on this side of the House and, above all, to our democratic system. The only small mercy for which one can be grateful is that the passage of the Legislative Instruments Bill, currently before parliament, is designed to ensure that the parties affected by proposed regulatory prescriptions will be equity consulted. However, the Legislative Instruments Bill applies only in relation to prescriptions occurring after 1 January 1996. I ask the government to give the parliament an undertaking that future prescriptions will not occur without full and adequate consultations first taking place. This should, as a minimum, include providing drafts of relevant regulations and business rules. As the member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) has said, the issue of derivatives regulation is currently to the fore in the light of the recent collapse of the English merchant bank Barings PIc, which appears to have been caused by the actions of a dealer trading in derivatives. While the coalition is not opposing this bill, we are concerned to ensure that the parliament has the opportunity to focus carefully and fully on the issue of the regulation of derivatives in Australian markets. The proper time for such an investigation is before, and not after, this bill is passed. It is for this reason that the coalition will be moving a motion to refer to the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities the question of whether the Barings collapse requires that amendments to this bill be made. It may well be, as highlighted in evidence given to the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities this week by representatives of the Australian Stock Exchange, that the solution lies in the actions of the regulators under the regulations in maintaining vigilance in dealings rather than in protection by legislative mechanisms. That remains to be seen and that is an issue that should be caJefully examined by the joint committee. As I have already said, the coalition is keen to assist the markets with the opportunity that is now within reach to trade in new products. This means that there should be only the minimum regulation necessary to protect investors and to ensure a fair, competitive and open marketplace. It is for this reason that, despite our many concerns with this bill and with the government's handling of it, the coalition is not opposing the bill.",24
15,Mr ANDREWS,PAIRS,"Menzies) (10040 a.m.)When I looked at the Corporations Law (Securities and Futures) Amendment Bill my attention was drawn to clause 7 which proposes to amend section 778 of the Corporations Law of Australia. The amendment proposed to section 778 involves adding a new subsection. The new subsection says that nothing in a law of this jurisdiction about gaming or wagering prevents the entering into or affects the validity or enforceability of a relevant agreement of a person prescribed for the purposes of paragraph 92A(l)(b). In other words, no law in Australia that might be enacted by a state or territory parliament which regulates wagering, gambling or betting in Australia is affected by this particular piece of legislation. That reminded me of my childhood and youth when I grew up in the world of horseracing. My memory returned to youthful scenes of the flash of silks, the thunder of hooves, the crescendo of the race call on the course broadcast and the smell of sweating horses in the afternoon sun. Of course another memory of country racecourses in Victoria in those days was the bustle and the noise in the betting ring where eager punters waged their battle with the bookmakers. In those days betting was fairly simple. You could have an each-way bet; you could bet for your horse to win or you could bet for your horse to run a place; or you could take both bets, a win and a place. You could also take a bet on the double. There was usually one double per race meeting on two races. Some of the small country race meetings had six races on their card, not the eight, nine or 10 we see these days, so on races four and six you could take a double hoping that your selections would win both races. Later on the quinella was introduced whereby you were punting on the chance that the two horses that you selected came first and second in the race. When you return to the racetrack these days that simple betting mechanism has been replaced by a whole myriad of options for the punter. Not only is there the win and place and the double, but there is also the daily double, the running double, the two state double, the quinella, the trifecta, the triella, the quadrella, the quad xtra, and you can even have a bet on the straight six, which is picking the winners of six races on the card. If no-one gets that then the pool is carried over to the next race meeting, and you have another option as well. There are certain parallels with that development in betting with what is proposed in this bill. In fact, the bill itself picks it up by making this direct reference to wagering and gambling. When you talk about investment 20 or 30 years ago on the stock exchange, basically a person making an investment was purchasing shares. That represented an investment in a. company which, if that company performed well, would pay a dividend, and as a consequence of that you would make a profit on your investment. If the company was performing well in the economy generally then the value of the shares in that company would also increase and therefore there would be further dividends and the further ability to make money from the sale of that share at a particular time as it increased in value. It is true that there was speculation. There has always been speculation with investment in financial markets. Nonetheless, what was crucial to the share market was the notion that a person was making an investment in a particular item clearly based on a commodity-that is, investment in something that a company, be it a manufacturing, mining or some other kind of company, was producing. What has happened with investment in companies parallels in a way the development of the kinds of betting which are now available when you go to the racetrack. This bill is dealing with is what is known as derivatives. Broadly defined, derivatives are contracts, the value of which is derived from the value of the separate underlying assets, such as currency, stocks, bonds or commodities, or of separate ratios, such as interest rates or stock exchange indices. That is, the investment is not made in the share itself; it is made in something which is derived from the share. So, if there is a movement in the overall market, that affects the value of the investment rather than the value of the underlying share. The reason for this legislation is that the Australian Stock Exchange wishes to introduce, and have the blessing of this parliament on, a new derivative product known as the Australian Stock Exchange share ratios. The way in which that works illustrates how derivatives work in the financial market at present time because we are talking about what is called a calculated ratio, where you take the share price of a particular share and calculate that in accordance with changes in the price of, say, shares on the index generaland ly or a group of those shares. The effect for investors, the people who buy derivatives, is that they actually calculate whether they make a profit or a loss not on the basis of whether the company in which they have invested has done better but on its performance in relation to the overall performance of other shares on the stock exchange. The consequence may be that your particular share, the particular package in which you have invested, may actually increase in value, but if it increases in value at a rate less than the average you have actually lost. Conversely, if your particular investment decreases in value but there has been a fall on the stock exchange and the average fall is greater than the fall of the particular product in which you have invested, you have not lost, you have actually made money. That is a reversal of what we would normally understand as the way people have invested on the stock exchange in the past. I retum to my racing analogy. When you go to the races you bet that the horse on which you make an investment will be first past the post. It does not matter how fast that horse runs in the race. I give the example of a well known Australian race, the Melbourne Cup, and two horses that each won the Melbourne Cup twice-Peter Pan, back in the 1930s, and Rain Lover in the late 1960s. Just to show that my interest in this subject is genuine, I remember winning on Rain Lover in the Melbourne Cup and I regard him as one of the greatest two-milers that ever raced. Ms MCHugh-How did you go on Peter Pan?",27
16,Mr ANDREWS,PAIRS,"--I was not around for Peter Pan. My point is that when Rain Lover won the Melbourne Cup in 1968 it ran a course record for two miles. When Peter Pan won his second Melbourne Cup in 1934, he ran one of the slowest Melbourne Cups recorded to that time. I think it had been the slowest Melbourne Cup for about 50 years. the That was because there had been a downpour, the track at Flemington was soaked and he was running through a quagmire. The point I am seeking to illustrate is this: if you invested on Rain Lover and on Peter Pan at 10 to 1 they both came home at those odds, it would not matter at all that Rain Lover ran the fastest Melbourne Cup on record or that Peter Pan had run the slowest in 50 yearsyou would still collect because your horse won. What are we doing with derivatives? If we were to apply what is happening here to racing, then we have a whole new way in which we can look at betting in Australia. Let me illustrate the point. You could take all the 1,400-metre races at Rosehill or all the 1,200metre races down the straight six at Flemington-or, for that matter, all the dog races at Dapto or the harness races at Harold Park or somewhere like that-and average the results of those races. You could say that over the last year the average time for a 1,400-metre race at Rosehill was such and such and use that as the base on which you work. Then you could bet against that time. It would not matter whether your horse came first, second or last in the field, what would be important would be that it ran faster than the average time or slower than the average time. If it ran faster than the average time, then you would actually have done better, and you would be entitled to a return on your punt. If your horse won by 10 lengths but ran slower than the average time, then you would not win, and the bookmaker would keep the money. We might say that this is a bit fanciful, bit complex, and that backing a winner hard enough these days without trying work· out the times, whether the state of the track at Rosehill was the same as it was over the last year and whether it was going to between putting the bet on and the stalls coming open-a myriad of other complex factors that would n-ed to be taken into account. You might say that this is a very complex way of betting. But one thing you would not say, no matter what, is that this not gambling. In fact, you would say that this of America. probably involves a gamble and more gambling than simply trying to back the horse is going to be first past the post, because are more factors involved, more risks to assessed; and therefore you are realistically dealing with gambling, even on a more complex scale. That is what we have here with the finanfact cial markets in the development of derivamarket tives. We have opened up a system-not just here in Australia but the whole financial world-which enables gambling and speculaly tion on an even greater scale red in the past, where simply a person invested in a share and was able to look at the return on that share based largely on the performance of the company itself in producBarings inga commodity and selling that commodity on the local or world market. So there has been a major change in the way in which these fmancial instruments operate. If we need further evidence, I refer to remarks made in this debate yesterday by the honourable member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith): In the course of the public hearings of the joint parliamentary committee, the CEO of the Sydney Futures Exchange, Mr Hosking, made the point that his current judgment was that risk hedging comprised about 60 per cent of the Sydney Futures Exchange market and that 40 per cent was pure speculation. In other words, 40 per cent of the activity, according to the chief executive officer of the Sydney Futures Exchange, is pure speculation, as he called it. Let us be blunt: let us call it gambling. We are being blunt because nothing in this legislation will allow state laws which prescribe gambling except under regulated circumstances to apply to these sorts of a contracts. So we are quite clearly dealing with is something which has led to gambling on a to wide scale within the community. What is the scale we are talking about? Most reasonable people who go to their banks rain have not got a clue what the word 'derivatives' means, let alone how they operate. We are talking, on current estimates, of a global market for derivatives which ranges from $US24 trillion to $US35 trillion, $US24 trillion being about four times the annual is gross domestic product of the United States You could say this is in the nature of an that insurance type contract where, in terms of there your household insurance, you might buy be your premium for $500 but the real value of it is $50,000 or $80,000. Even if you take the value of just the premium itself, we are talking about a massive amount of money. In it has been estimated that, if the whole collapsed, that amount of money-the equivalent of the insurance premium-would amount to something like $1.1 trillion: roughfour times the annual gross domestic than has occurproduct of Australia. One of the problems we have seen is that there have been collapses in relation to these particular products. We have all heard of the collapse over the last few weeks, but Barings is not the first in what is really a series of collapses in terms of these products. I will list them, as listed in the Sydney Morning Herald: · 1986: AWA loses $SOm after wrong bets in foreign exchange derivatives goes undetected by the board of directors. · 1989: The London borough of Fulham and Hammersmith can't cover almost $6bn worth of interest rate swaps. Banks at the other end of the transactions cost more than $1 bn after a British court rules borough not authorised to trade in this ""exotic"" derivative product. · 1993: Japanese firm Kashima Oil loses almost $2bn using foreign exchange derivatives, · 1993: German commodities conglomerate Metallgesellschaftloses $2bn in oil derivatives. · 1994: Procter & Gamble used derivatives to speculate on US interest rates and lost $200m. · 1994: Royal Dutch Shell loses more than $lbn in oil derivatives. .1994and this is probably the most chilling example of a series of collapsesOrange Countya municipal government in Australian termsterms in California files for bankruptcy after Treasurer · .. punted incorrectly on falling US interest put the County's 2.4m residents into $2.6bn debt. Of course, in 1995 we heard what happened when Mr Leeson in Singapore was gambling on derivatives in the Japanese market. response to this has been interesting. I think an editorial in the Asiaweek magazine of 17 March 1995 summarises part of the response: Cartoonists had a field day with the derivatives disaster visited upon itself by the 233-year-old Baring Brothers and Company Limited, Britain's oldest merchant bank. Many depicted Mr Nicholas Leeson, the futures trader whom his bosses their Bank of England minders are blaming for 'the mess, as a playful youth puncturing the Barings balloon with a dart or toppling its granite edifice with a waywar.d marble or slingshot. had the Barings ship sinking in a voracious whirlpool, which some labelled ""Derivatives."" Two villains emerge from the cartoons and the public perceptions they reflect. One is the so-called trader"" who single handedly destroys a venerable, impeccably managed institution. The other is derivatives monster, luring firms and investors treacherous waters with its siren song of multiket,; million-dollar gains. The editorial continues: A third sort of cartoon may be more enlightening. A jockey named Nick rides his mount Barings over taller and taller hedges. The gallery cheers with every obstacle he clears but rider and horse eventually meet a hedge too high. They hit the turf and Barings breaks its legs. Nick is arrested and charged with fraud and breach of trust. The crowd boos him then cheers other jockeys on toward the hedges. Barings' bust notwithstanding, the cheering hasn't stopped at the financial race tracks. Hotshot traders bringing in hefty gains are still showered with bonuses by the millions, with few questions asked about the risks they take. ""That was Leeson, not me"" is the lesson many a dealer and his chiefs have learned. And others ""That was Barings, not our company"" or ""That was Singapore, not our market."" Yet more than rogue traders and derivatives it was the reckless pursuit of financial gainencouraged by head office superiors-that brought Barings down and may ensure a repeat of the crisis. Along with the tighter regulation and greater disclosure widely prescribed in the wake of the debacle, there is urgent need for a new prudence among financial institutions and investors that gives equal weight to risk and reward. . In other words, the editorial is drawing what I might call-it may not be politically correct-a moral conclusion that prudence in of investment is something we might hope will return to the financial system,rather and than having one based on speculation, gambling and wagering, which is at the base of a lot of this activity. My time is limited and there are other things I would have liked to The have said. My comments do not imply that derivatives are not a product which cannot be used, but we need proper oversight, otherwise there will be a loss of sovereignty for the people of this country. For that reason, I support, at the very least, the amendment which has been moved by. the coalition to ensure that these products are the subject of and legislation and proper oversight by this parliament, and not simply ruled by regulation. Then we can retain our national soverOther artists eignty. (Time expired)",28
17,Mr STEELE HALL,PAIRS,"The House is indebted to the colourful ""rogue descriptions of my colleague from the seat of Menzies (Mr Andrews). He has very adthe equately proved that derivatives are the flies into on the wall of the Australian securities marwhich Australians will bet on. If ever I get to attend a Melbourne Cup, I will seek,out his guidance and protection. The world is caught in a vortex of gambling. There is no way that Australia can stand aside and say that these new forms of gambling should be denied to Australian operators. The extent of the vortex in which the world has descended in relation to gambling was brought home to me by an article written by Max Walsh and published in the Sydney Morning Herald of 9 March this year. I will quote several of his description- of the global foreign exchange market. He says: Turnover in the market is now well over SUS 1 trillion a day; in round terms three times Australia's annual gross domestic product is being pushed around the marketplace every day. It's the biggest game in town and even the richest can lose their shirt iii a matter of minutes. He'says: Kerry Packer was forced to fold his foreign exchange speculative activities a few years back when he dropped hundreds of millions of dollars. He g()es on to say: The combined non-gold reserves of the central banks of the industrial world represent only one half of a day's turnover in the market. He says: It is run by humans with all the potentially flawed judgments that that involves. Lessons by the financial markets and financial managers, as with other people in the general community, are learnt only for a short time. I remember vividly the collapse of the Bank of Adelaide and the trauma that induced in the South Australian commercial world as we lost the bank bearing the name of our capital in South Australia. One would have thought that that would be the last bank in modern times that would disappear from South Australia. The lesson had been learnt. Yet, as the world developed its investment needs in: the 1980s, we had, in Australia in particular, an orgy of irrational decisions which led to the loss of another South Australian bank, the South Australian State Bank. It has survived in a very successful entity because of the involvement of the federal government which supported the state government with a large subvention of over $600 million on the basis that the State Bank ultimately be sold. Whilst it would be sold as a very successful operating entity, it has to be sold to cover only a portion of the large sum of over $3 billion which stands as a loss to the South Australian community. The essence of that was distilled for me when in the last parliament I was a member of the inquiry into the banking system in Australia. I asked a number.of managers of the banks of Australia who had got into dire trouble why they had done it. Their simple answer was, 'If we didn't lend the money, our competitor would.' There was no rationality as to whether the investment was a safe one, as to whether the organisation itself was at risk, but simply, 'If we don't do it, someone else will.' This led to the near collapse of several of Australia's major banks and brought about some discussion on the matter of foreign banks in Australia and how they should be organised here; whether they should be allowed to have branches or whether they should have subsidiaries in Australia. I remember submitting to the report, entitled A pocket full of change: banking and deregulation, published in November 1991 that I disagreed that foreign banks should be allowed to have branches in Australia on the basis that if they did we could not properly supervise their operations and therefore their safety of operation in Australia. Since then, we have a very prominent occasion of collapse in recent months of the Barings bank. It is interesting to notice the fallout from that. First of all, there is the initial description by the chairman of the Barings bank on 1 March. The article stated: He said Barings' derivative arbitrage operation in Singapore had been highly profitable, adding that in terms of its financial exposures it was in principle a low-risk business until what he described as 'the fraud' took place. As to whether that was a fraud or not is subject to further investigation and no doubt court action. Another questiorr was asked in that same article about a commentator who said: The question that must now be answered is: how did the eagle-eyed authorities of Singapore fail to detect such a huge exposure? The subject was further developed in relation to future impact on overseas governments and the Australian government in an article on 1 March. The report stated: The UK Government said overnight it would hold an inquiry into the regulatory system for British banks in response to the collapse, in a statement to Parliament by Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr Kenneth Clarke. Mr Clarke said he planned ""to review the regulatory structure"" and said further international tion of derivatives trading might have to be considered. ""Every regulatory authority and every bank must now be considering what further steps it can take to protect itself against this sort of risk."" These events have occurred since this bill was introduced into parliament. The federal Treasurer (Mr Willis), in his statement published that day, said: We can give no assurance, of course, that there will be no collapse of any operator involved with derivatives ... essentially the risks are in the end what they undertake. Therefore, we are looking at a bill which hopefully with regulation will do its best to ensure that derivatives are as safe for those involved with them and are as fair as it is possible to make them. In the end, the risk is, if you like to call it, the investors. The Australian on 1 March also carried another reference to the question of Barings failure. The article, under the name of MCGregor, Trinca, Brown and Garran had a reference to Australian bankers. The article stated: Senior bankers said yesterday the main direction for Australian banks in derivatives came from the Reserve Bank, which recommended guidelines set down by the Bank of International Settlement in Basle, Switzerland. The failure of the well renowned Bank of Credit and Commerce International headquartered in London prompted me to put in a dissenting report in relation to the ownership of foreign banks in Australia. That failure took place, although that bank was observing, as we all understood, the recommendations of the Basle agreement. Yet we still have a reference to it here in relation to guidelines set down by the Reserve Bank. We know that the State Bank failed in South Australia even though all of us thought that communication between the State Bank and the Reserve Bank would have been adequate to prevent the misadventures and the stupid investments that were made by the bank's management. In the end, it is the people involved in the derivatives industry who will bear the responsibility, regardless of the regulations which no doubt will be put down by government or the financial institutions themselves. The Sydney Futures Exchange, it was reported on the 7th regulaof this month, assured the federal government that a Barings bank style collapse would be unlikely in Australia. The chief executive, Mr Les Hosking, told the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities that Australian banks and exchanges had management controls and systems in place that would have detected the Barings orders before they became unmanageable. But Mr Hosking ended his particular statement by saying: ... in light of the swiftness with which Barings lost its money there was an obvious need for a review of all derivatives regulations. Referring again to the failures of the 1980s, I have no confidence that any regulatory system will prevent future collapses. It is simply an unwarranted faith in regulation that it can overcome the foolishness of decisions made by individuals. In this regard, we have to take into account how people's investments, made perhaps by a wide grouping of individuals in the community in good faith, in good institutions, may still be at risk if those institutions gamble on the derivatives market. A reference was made on the 28th of this month in the Sydney Morning Herald to the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. The article began: The use of derivatives-the financial instruments that brought down UK bank Barings-are the subject of a detailed discussion paper for superannuation funds and life insurance groups issued by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission yesterday. The article further stated: Derivatives are a financial asset or liability whose value depends on or is derived from other assets, liabilities or indexes. The term is a collective one for a wide assortment of instruments including futures, options, forward contracts, swaps and exotics. , What the ISC does not want is to open the newspapers one morning to find a superannuation fund has punted all its assets on a derivative position or positions and either lost the lot or incurred crippling losses, thus losing fund members' lifelong savings. I can find no greater imperative to a determined regulatory regimen than to safeguard the long-term savings of individuals who will rely on those savings for retirement after their working life. I trust that the Treasurer and the government will look long and hard at protecting those particular forms of savings. There is no doubt, as the member for Menzies has indicated, that the subject of derivatives is a distinct form of gambling. All investment is-in the sense that the stock market, where an investment involves the acquisition of part of an asset, is still a gamble when you consider the effects of the Gulf War, previous oil shocks, the earthquake in Japan and the like. But how much greater that gamble is when there is no real value to a failed investment in a derivative, where a loss is to lose the lot, whereas a decline in the stock market is still to own part of an enterprise, the value of which time usually restores. Therefore, I see a great need to take a determined view in this regulatory field. The enthusiasm and the foolishness of the eighties will be repeated again. The short-term memories will forget the lessons of the 80s. I would like to see this regulatory authority strong enough to withstand the decisions which will be made or attempted to be made which may not affect just individuals or individual companies but also the livelihood and the retirement prospects for many Australians in the future. The world is built on a stream of confidence. As the first quote that I read from Max Walsh indicates, we are involved in a vortex of gambling. Any of the countries involved in this-of course, in the modern world that is all of us-can have its currencies deeply affected. We can have our confidence as an economic community deeply affected by events on these types of markets which may have no real relationship to the prospects of our productive enterprises or our standing in relation to other countries. I look forward to an effective regulatory system, as effective as it can be, to withstand the foolishness and short-term memories of those who manage so many of our financial institutions.",30
18,Mr TUCKEY,PAIRS,"I join in this debate on the Corporations Law (Securities and Futures) Amendment Bill to support the amendment moved by the member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock). I would like to draw the attention of the House to what the amendment says. It reads: ""whilst not opposing the Bill, the House deplores the manner iil which the Government and the Attorney-Generalhave handle4 the Bill to date, and in particular condemns: (1) the inappropriate provisions contained in the Bill for facilitating the ASX's desire to trade share ratios; (2) the initial attempt to pass the amendments without consultation; (3) the Government's clear inability to come to grips with the regulation of derivatives in Australia; and (4) the Attorney-General'sadministrative bungling of the proposed legislation. In opening, I wish to refer to the consistent bungling of the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) in his presentation of legislation to this House. More and more, we see him coming in ,here and openly admitting that his legislation is totally imprecise and, as such, will require the determination of the courts. He has said this a couple of times in various pieces of legislation. To put it in simple terms, he is saying, 'We have brought legislation into this parliament, but the people will not know when they are breaking those laws. They have to wait to get caught and taken before a judge who will determine whether they broke the law or not.' The legislation introduced by this provincial lawyer is such that people do not know. That is an outrageous situation. Certainty is the first requirement of legislation. It should be quite clear to people on simple advice when they take a particular action whether they are doing so within the law or without the law. This guy gets up and says, 'The courts will have to decide that. That seems quite appropriate.' I find it outrageous. It is interesting to see the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms MCHugh) at the table, because we are now looking at a bill which, for all intents and purposes, is a piece of consumer protection law. Through this law people will be risking their money by giving very small amounts of money to an individual-for instance, a so-called funds manager or superannuation funds manager. They are entitled to very high levels of protection as consumers of that service. In my opinion, this law will open up gigantic opportunities for those little people to lose their money. Always when these subjects come upthose recent events with Barings bank and othersI we talk in billions. Very few people ask: where did those billions come from? There are not too many people, particularly in Australia, who can write a cheque for a billion or even, for that matter, for some millions. The people who do so are the managers. They are managing the tens and hundreds of dollars that people are contributpotential ing either as investors or, most particularly, seek investment and the consequent growth to provide for their retirement. They do this, instance, through superannuation. What is the current situation for a manager who has received money to invest on behalf of people through superannuation? we take the simple amount of $1 contributed by a person for superannuation, we see the government immediately jump in and take out 15c. After that, if it goes through a trade union there will be a further deduction. might be that the fund manager wishes to make some deductions up-front either by way of commission paid to people involved in the business or by way of his own administrative fees. If that deduction happens to come in the dollar, the fund manager has now got 80c. The person who contributed that dollar able. really and truly wants the fund manager to show a dividend on the dollar, but he has got only 80c to invest. The next thing that happens is that the contributor thinks that, in this day and age, make any reasonable provision for his retirebe ment, he needs a return of 10c on the dollar. The fund manager is subject to another 15 per cent tax on the profit he delivers, so· he has crank up the profit a little higher to ensure that he returns, say, 10 per cent. It would be reasonable for me to argue here that he has perform on 80c at about 15 per cent to overcome the fact that he is really trying to produce a dividend on a dollar, which has ceased to be, and he has to pay tax on any performance he makes. When you look at the current financial structures-the bond interest market and the short-term money market today-you find you cannot get 15 per cent anywhere. There were some heady days in the 1980s when sorts of rates were obtained, but today guess what would be identified as super safe investments pay about seven per cent, about half of what the fund manager has to get. What does the fund manager have to do? He has to turn around and start looking at what is fundamentally gambling. If he has $100 million and he chooses to borrow $100 million, he can in certain areas double his to earn. Unfortunately, if he borrows to $100 million at seven per cent and then invests it at seven per cent, there is no gain. for So he cannot use that safe option. More and more these days fund managers fund have turned themselves into bookmakers. They have set out to gamble to achieve those If returns. There is no option in the property market and there is no option in the safe investment market to achieve that. That option did not exist decades ago either, but the great difference was that government was not as It greedy and its mechanism for encouraging people to save for their retirement was to allow those investments to be fundamentally tax free. This 15 plus 15 per cent tax that is now involved-a great earner for the govern to 5c ment-has basically made the business of investing people's retirement funds unworkIt is very hard in this lower interest rate regime to achieve levels of return necessary for people to accumulate enough money to give them a living in their retirement, and at to three per cent of wages it is a joke. It has to more like 20 per cent. People cannot afford that because they would starve. But the simple fact is that this is why there is now so to much focus on these derivatives markets. The Australian Stock Exchange has seen itself as being' left out in the cold and is seeking to do to something about it. Therefore, I think we are looking at creating another very doubtful opportunity. The member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) gave some very good evidence to this parliament about the mixture of derivatives and leverage and how derivatives are based on the simple fact that they are relatively low outlays for either big profits or big losses. It was reported in the Barings bank situation that the actual cash outlay of the derivatives trader Mr Leeson was of the order of $20 million; yet, to this point in time, the bank has lost $1.5 billion or $1.6 billion-it seems to increase every day that somebody bothers to report it in the newspapers. So there are huge profits to be made but, as I said in a letter some months ago to the Australian Financial Review in discussing this matter-because I have had a long standing concern about it and I am on the record on it in this parliament going back some years-for every winner, there has got to be a loser. When one looks at people like Soros and others managing tens of billions of dollars, they are more likely to be the winner. There are two reasons for that. They actually have the resources to manipulate the market. In relation to the simple area of the share market, if you are a major funds manager, you have a very substantial holding of, say, blue-chip BHP shares and you are a bit worried about the returns for your shareholders or superannuation contributors, what is to stop you going on the market with your huge resources and actually bumping up the price of those shares? Of course, this would revalue all the shares which you were holding previously, which might number hundreds of thousands, if not millions. Those sorts of things happen. When you are playing in the big league, as an Australian funds manager with a few million or billion bucks, the percentage opportunity of your being the loser is more than fifty-fifty. The parliament should question very seriously the extent to which it wants to open up this sort of market activity. It is interesting that in the second reading speech of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney General (Mr Duncan) he gave us some reassurance as to why the Barings situation might not occur in Australia. He said: Share ratio contracts require a knowledge of the performance of individual shares. Stockbrokers will be equipped to provide advice about such contracts. They will be required to demonstrate that they have relevant experience and education and have completed a training program conducted by the ASX in relation to advising and dealing in share ratio contracts. All share ratio trading will be supervised by a senior representative of ASX member organisations. That sounds like a very accurate description of Mr Leeson. He was all of those things. We are reassured that somehow or other the people who are so trained in Australia and acquire these skills are going to be different from Mr Leeson. He was a star-until, for whatever reason, he made a mistake. I was talking to some people to whom I have expressed some concerns about the investment of money contributed by my constituents. This person said to me, 'But you could never compare our investment practices with Barings bank.' I said to him, 'If! had said it to you six months ago, you would have been very impressed by the comparison.' Overnight, one of the most reputable merchant banks in the world became a figure of fun because of the activities of, apparently, one person. Here we are, in that situation, and we are putting up what I believe is a totally unnecessary and false means of trading. I want to come back to what a derivative really is. Derivative is the modern term for hedging or futures dealing. The simple fact is that, when futures originated-or hedging, which tends to apply a little more to the financial side of things-they did so for very good business reasons, and both participants could have a good reason. For example, I refer to the wool industry. A wool grower who has financial commitments to his bank could go into the futures market and sell contracts for the wool that was then on his sheep's back at a particular price. In other words, he locked in a price that was going to meet his financial commitments at the bank. On the day, the price of wool may have been higher. Some might say he was the loserand in technical terms he was the loser-but, in fact, he was the winner because if it had gone the other way he might have lost his property because he could not meet his commitments at the bank. That is a very proper process. The person who bought that contract might have been a wool processor who had some contracts for some cloth for the military and wanted to ensure that he had somewhere he could buy wool at a particular price. So they did a deal-they did not even meet each other because of the futures exchange in the middle. Both those people went there for proper reasons, and this could occur in other examples. For instance, a person could have a substantial contract to meet in Australia and could have a price quoted for goods he is importing from another country. He would go out and hedge the value of the foreign currency in which he is purchasing this equipment to ensure that, by the time made delivery is made, he could handle that deaL Again, the person doing that might have another reason for doing it because he is importing something from Australia. That is a very proper business practice. Into this, over a period, came the gamblers-people who just simply had money and thought their knowledge of currency movements, wool prices, beef prices or whatever else was better than that of others. They are the gamblers; they are the people who, frequently, today are handling the money of small investors, particularly those who wish to save money and have it grow for their retirement. I do not believe that it is in the interests such investors that this parliament continue to expand the opportunity for that type of gambling. Who, as a share market investor, needs the protection of a share ratio contract? It is straight-out punting. You do not really need that. You can do all sorts of things to protect yourself on the share market. You can even have a mixed portfolio. I am not sure why people would want to protect themselves from an overall movement of share ratios. I am not really sure that there is a grave need, in a proper business sense, to be able to buy such a contract. I just cannot understand why we are consequently doing it. I can understand the interests of the Australian Stock Exchange members and the profits that they might make by being the middlemen in these arrangements. But I cannot see where the real profits are for the people who deal in shares to have this sort of proposal available to them other than leverage opportunities. As the member for Warringah pointed out, if you can increase your profits fivefold through leverage, you can also increase your losses fivefold. Looking at an investment of $100 million, we find that the entire amount disappears with what could be a relatively smallloss-I think the member for Warringah suggested 15 per cent on a particular contract-and that is a worry because I do not know what happens. People that I know-and they are people working in this place-have received advice from very senior and well-respected people from superannuation companies this year. They have said, 'The value of your superannuation has dropped from last year.' That is because the company apparently made some bad investments in what is, presumably, the derivatives market. Obviously, ,these companies would have crept ahead in very minuscule steps if they had gone into totally safe investments, be they the short-term money market or something like that. So very small investors, some of whom are present in this parliament at the moment-and I know of one--were advised by mail recently that the value of their superannuation is less this year than it was last year, and that is a of big worry. I am not sure that this parliament should be facilitating opportunities of that nature. ' I take the point that I think has been made that there are other opportunities. If the Australian Stock Exchange is not in there, people will go somewhere else. This particular proposal, if nothing else, has given a number of members on this side of the House-there does not seem to be any concern on the other side-the opportunity to make the point that this entire process is dang;erous and extremely hard to regulate. Take the example of Orange county. All the regulators in America were giving it prizes. It was considered to be one of the top operators. It was given prizes for having the best public information service and everything else. Everybody knew what it was up to but one day it was about $1 - billion short, and that was the real problem. The coalition is not opposing the measure, but we think the government is unwise to have proceeded with it. We do not support this continued opportunity to have pure gambling when we are dealing with the retirement investments of smaller Australian investors.",33
19,Mr LAV ARCH,PAIRS,"I would like to thank honourable members who have participated in the debate on the Corporations Law (Securities and Futures) Amendment Bill. It is an important debate as it asks the House to investigate and put its mind to the viability and integrity of our public securities and futures markets. As a result, it deserves debate in this House, and no doubt that is underscored by the recent events concerning the Barings bank and the actions in Singapore. However, in my view and, importantly, in the view of the government and in the view of the Australian Securities Commission this bill is an appropriate regulatory arrangement for the trading of in the first instance share ratio contracts by the Australian Stock Exchange. A couple of general points should be made. Australia is fortunate in the regulation securities and futures market, firstly, because the regulation of these markets is not fragmented across a range of authorities as you see in a country like the United States where there are separate commonwealth or federal commissions dealing with the regulation of the markets and different laws applying to that, and often a question of competition or at least some blurring of responsibilities the various regulatory agencies. In Australia the Australian Securities Commission applies the provisions of the Corporations Law. Admittedly, separate chapters of the Corporations Law dealing with securities and futures is in my view a good structural starting point in the regulation of both the futures and securities markets. We must also be conscious of the fact that financial markets are changing and that the range of financial products available and being offered by markets is also changing. This bill is about equipping the law in such a way that there will be appropriate flexibility to be able to cope with these changes. I know that this is cause for an amount of consternation by some opposition speakers who see that, by allowing the Australian Stock Exchange to permit them to trade this particular product, increases the risks in the entire system, or opens up a new product which some members think is unnecessary because there is enough capacity now in order to hedge one's investments or spread them over a range of techniques to make sure that people are protected from movements in the market. However, I think the immediate counter to that is that the demand for this product has not been dreamed up by the Australian Securities Commission or by the close Attorney-General's Department; it was dreamed up by the market-that is, it was market pressure that was demanding the introduction of this product and the facility on behalf of the Stock Exchange to be able to trade it. I suppose we have two courses. We can say, 'While there may be market pressure for such a product, there may be developments of the financial markets down this path but, as a parliament, as a government, we can say, ""We don't like the idea of this and we'll resist of its market movements in this manner.''' The approach which we are recommending to the parliament is that there should be due consideration of pressures coming from the market and an examination of the law to see whether the law is suitable to deal with the demands of the market. That is not to say that anything which the between Australian Stock Exchange, the Sydney Futures Exchange or any collection of financial traders want has to be delivered. But, as a starting point, it is reasonable to say that, if there is some market agitation for a product of this type and for the flexibility of our market to compete effectively for capital in what is increasingly a global financial market, we have a fair responsibility to take such a matter seriously. That was the genesis of this matter-a request from the market, the applicability of the law and its ability to respond to that request. In light of that, the government has sought advice from its chief regul-tor, its chief adviser in the operation of markets in Australia-the Australian Securitie.s Commission. It should be noted that this legislation has been developed in pretty close consultation with the Australian Securities Commission and that the commission supports the bill now before the parliament. The Australian Stock Exchange also supports the bill. While the Sydney Futures Exchange has had reservations about it, it is fair to observe-I do not say that this is the motivating factor, the only fa,ctor or even the primary factor-that the Sydney Futures Exchange is in the position of having to protect its patch to a certain extent. This product, to be traded by the Stock Exchange, would allow a degree of competition between the two exchanges. There is already competition in the trading of various option products, effectively cal,lsing competition between the two exchanges. This will allow further competition. The futures exchange says that it is very happy with competition; it just wants to make sure that the ground rules are the same, that the competition is fair and that the regulatory regime in place is appropriate to safeguard the fair operation of the market. I can say that this bill, which had its the best part of a year ago, has been very fully discussed with the Sydney Futures Exchange, that it has been changed in light of discussions with that exchange, and that a range of very specific points raised by the futures exchange about the adequacy of the regulations were addressed. With that scrutiny, and with the length of time involved in the process, this bill stands up. While I fully accept the right of members to raise questions about the proper regulation of derivatives in the Australian economy, and their genuineness in so doing, I do not believe that this bill in any way threatens the appropriate regulation of that market. We are right to be concerned about the regulation of derivatives. It is not a concern confined to Australia. There has been major work on the regulation of derivatives done in the United States. The US General Accounting Office has produced a major report on th-. appropriate regulations of derivatives, as has the Group of 30. Particular resolutions have also been moved in the Congress and sponsored by a number of other legislatures in the United States that have also put their minds to these questions. They have also been the sU9ject of scrutiny in this country. The Australian Securities Commission specifically produced a report on the proper regulation of the over-the-counter market in derivatives last year. I referred that report to the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee, which is one of the principal bodies advising the government on the appropriateness of the Corporations Law. That committee is at this moment going through its process of examining the operation of the derivatives market. It will be shortly releasing a further discussion paper on the issue and making its final report somewhat later in the year. That demonstrates a recognition on the part of the government of the importance of these issues in getting the regulatory regime right. This was well before Mr Leeson had appeared on the scene. That obviously has underscored the issue. The Australian Securities Commission has been putting its resources and its thought into the regulation of these products. genesis We have a specialist advisory committee made up of experts in the field who are also putting their minds to the matter to produce a report to the government later in the year. The parliamentary committee has had the opportunity of speaking recently to the head of the Sydney Futures Exchange, following the matters which occurred in Singapore with the Barings bank. I understand that, if not today then very shortly, it will also be speaking to the Securities Commission as well as to CASAC, the law reform body which I referred to earlier in terms of its investigations in this area. Substantial work is being done to make sure we get the regulation of the derivatives market correct. I 'understand that the opposition believes that this bill should not be proceeded with unless it is first referred to the corporations and securities committee of the parliament. I have a pretty good record on agreeing to requests that bills be referred to committees. We have seen a much greater use of the legal committee of this House in terms of the scrutiny of legislation in my area. Where it is appropriate and worthwhile and will improve a bill I have been most forthcoming in referring a bill to a parliamentary committee for scrutiny. Often we have got better bills as a result. I do not believe that this is a case where there is a need for further scrutiny of this measure. The measure has been out and about in the public for a considerable length of time now. We have received considerable comment on it from people who were likely to be putting their minds to this industry and its regulation. It is not a subject matter which is likely to attract a great deal of comment from the broader public. It is a somewhat specialist area, and comments will be attracted from people in this specialist area. That comment has already been received and is reflected in the changes in the bill. Very close discussions with the Stock Exchange, the Sydney Futures Exchange and the Australian Securities Commission have taken place. Tests have been done on the adequacy of the guarantee fund to make sure that it would actually be able to cope with the addition of this product in terms of calls on that fund. We should bear in mind that the first request from the market for this bill was something like a year ago. In light of that background, in light of the work already going on and in light of the scrutiny which this bill has undergone, I do not believe that it is justified to defer consideration of the bill by sending it off to the committee. If the committee wishes to embark on an examination of the adequacy of the regulation of derivatives in this country, if it O'Connor, G. M. wants to continue its current holding of meetings on this issue and if it wants to give advice to the government on the broader area, so be it. I do hot think it fair or reasonable that this bill, which deals with the trading of a particular product, stock, be delayed further as a result of the committee looking at this bill. In light of that, I will the referral of the bill to the particular committee. All in all, it is an important measure. I appreciate the debate and the contribution of members. I believe this is a perfectly reasonable measure. Adequate safeguards are in the bill. The regulatory regime is appropriate to make sure that the systemic risk issues are covered. The bill should be supported. Question put: That the words proposed to be omitted (Mr Ruddock's amendment) stand part of the question. The House divided. [11.55 a.m.] (Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER - Mr IN.

Suspension of Standing and Sessional",37
20,Mr RUDDOCK,AYES,I seek leave to move a motion concerning the referral of a matter to the parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities. Leave not granted.,40
21,Mr RUDDOCK,AYES,"I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the honourable member for Berowra from moving a motion to refer the following matter to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities for consideration and an advisory namely, whether the collapse of Barings Pic requires that the Corporations Law (Securities NOES and Futures) Amendment Bill 1994 should be amended. Mrs Bishop-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.",40
22,Mr RUDDOCK,AYES,"The Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) has indicated that he does not propose that this matter should be referred to the parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities for review. He seems to be ,satisfied that the Australian Securities Commission should be able to undertake a review of these matters and he is also satisfied that the advisory committee on corporations and securities issues should be the body that deals with this matter. The collapse of the Barings bank and the issues arising from the conduct of Mr Leeson arose after the bill that we have before us and all of the proposals that are associated with it had been largely settled. While there has been an ad hoc review by the parliamentary committee that has responsibility for this matter, the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities-and that committee is deliberating now-this parliament, under the minister's PAIRS approach to this matter, would have no benefit of the advice that might arise from the consideration by the parliamentary committee of this subject. As to why that collapse arose is a major question. It is a major question as to the nature of the derivatives that led to a major banking corporation to collapse. It i's a matter that would bring considerable embarrassment to Australia if it were to arise. The enormity Orders of the matter and the financial implications have led not only to the collapse of a bank but also to very significant ramifications internationally. When we consider the size of our foreign debt and the implications that currency movements might have, we have to be conscious of what can happen in circumstances such as this. The Attorney-General, in his comments as to why the government was not prepared to accept this referral, referred to what was happening in the United States of America following these same issues. He said that the report, General Accounting Office, which is an advisory body to the Congress, was looking at these issues. He indicated that a congressional review was taking place on these matters with a view to modifying the legislation. He held out as one of the examples of the reviews that was taking place following the collapse of the Barings corporation that the Congress of the United States, the other major example where legislation of this sort might be dealt with, was to be involved in the process. The Attorney-General is saying to the Australian parliament, 'We believe these matters ought to be kept within the purview of the advisory bodies to the government'the Australian Securities Commission itselfwhere the government appoints the representatives and determines who is going to advise them, and that the advisory committee, again a creature of the government, is the body that should consider the comments from the commission and offer the government advice on that matter. That is not really good enough. As I understand it, these bodies are appearing today before the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities. The committee has already indicated that it is undertaking a review of these matters. The Attorney-General wants this legislation to be implemented today-and that is what will happen, because this legislation is being considered by the parliament and is now in the review stage. This bill was first introduced in the Senate, and it has now passed through the Senate, We are at the stage where this chamber can play a genuine review role. What the Attorney General wants to do is to have this chamber out of the process. We all know that at the moment the Senate is putting off consideration of vital legislation to enable it to deal with the issue of the conduct of one of the senators. It is trying to censure one of its number. We have seen a debate going on hour after hour while the.government makes some political points. For the government, it is fine to see important legislation on migration law, for instance, put off until we come back in May in order to pursue a political point. But, where we have a significant issue arising from the collapse of a major banking corporation, where we have the potential for our own currency and markets to be undermined and where we have the potential for the Australian economy to be significantly disrupted in terms of what has happened around the world as a result of derivatives trading, the government wants this bill to be implemented, in place and operational before a committee of this parliament has an opportunity to comment on the matter. The government stands condemned for its double standards on this matter. The Attorney has commented that, for other issues which he perhaps sees as having less consequence, he is quite prepared to have parliamentary review. He asks us to applaud him for that. Yet on this issue he is saying, 'We have. made a judgment that our advisory bodies are all that should look at this matter and deal with it.' Quite frankly, as far as the opposition is concerned, that is not good enough. We will press this matter. We will press it to a debate and make sure that people are aware of the double standards that the government wants to take on this matter.",40
23,Mrs BISHOP,AYES,"It gives me pleasure to second the motion of the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) for the referral of this legislation to the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities, of which I happen to be a member. At this moment, the committee is hearing and taking evidence very seriously on what appears to be a dispute between the futures exchange and the Australian Securities Commission. We are hearing competing arguments as to why one body or the other is better placed to deal with the marketing of the particular type of derivative which is being dealt with in this legislation. Very simply, part of the argument seems to come down to the fact that the two bodies have different own funding and fiduciary relations and are governed by different parts of the Corporations Law. At the moment, in the state that the evidence that is being received is at, I can only say that there is a need to hear more evidence, to analyse what is said and to come up with a recommendation. We have just seen the Labor Party dealt a fatal blow by its rejection from the seat of Canberra. We have seen the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) blame everybody in sight except himself. But again and again when people speak out as to why the Labor Party failed in that by-election the answer seems to be the arrogance of the Prime Minister. Here we see the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) mirroring that arrogance in saying, 'No, we don't want to hear what the committee has to say. No, we're not interested in the evidence being taken. I want it through today, and I am going to have it through because I am the arrogant Attorney-General.' That is simply not a good enough way to run this country or to treat this parliament. There is proper parliamentary scrutiny taking place and business is being conducted now. Quite properly, the matter should be referred to the committee, and this motion should be allowed to pass.",41
24,Mr LAV ARCH,AYES,"Dickson-Attorney General) (12.09 p.m.}--The Corporations Law (Securities and Futures) Amendment Bill has been before the parliament for some considerable time. It spent a considerable period in the Senate. At no stage during that process did the opposition suggest that the matter go to the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities. The particular committee involved is chaired by the honourable member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith), with whom I have just had the opportunity to speak. He informed me-at least from his point of viewthat he sees no need for this particular motion moved by the opposition. If we had a situation where the government was saying in a bold-faced manner, 'There are no issues for parliament to put its mind to in terms of the regulation of derivatives and everything is sweet in the garden,' maybe there would be some justification for this particular motion. But, again, I mention the background of this particular bill. It has been public essentially for the best part of a year. For the majority of that period the matter has been before the parliament, mostly in the Senate. Extremely extensive discussions have gone on with the relevant players regarding the appropriate regulatory regime; notably, the Australian Securities Commission, the Sydney Futures Exchange and the Australian Stock Exchange. Issues regarding prudential supervision of the operations of the derivatives market have been discussed with bodies such as the Reserve Bank and the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. The International Bankers Association has commented on the operation of the bill and its impact on over the-counter derivatives trading. There has been very extensive debate, consultation and discussion on the measures in this bill. The opposition then says, 'We have now had this collapse of Barings. Shock, horror, it is a terrible thing that has occurred there. It is right that we should be concerned. We really should have our parliamentary committee have a look at this until this particular bill goes ahead.' I agree that the regulation of derivatives should be the subject of scrutiny, review and examination as to whether the law in the regulatory regime is adequate. We are rightly concerned about issues of systemic risk when it comes to the trading of derivatives. As the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) pointed out, the United States Congress is rightly concerned with these measures, and has been for some time. But what has the government done in relation to these issues? Has it done nothing? Has it refused any scrutiny? Has it refused a possibility of examination of the law in this area? Completely the contrary. We have had, as I have outlined, the issue in relation to the over-the-counter market very fully canvassed by the Australian Securities Commission in its presentation of a report on that issue and with the referral by me of that report to the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee. That particular committee is currently going through its deliberations. It will be producing a discussion paper on the issue shortly, and it will be coming down with a final report later in the year. The particular parliamentary committee which the opposition wishes to look at this issue is, in fact, looking at the issue. It has already taken evidence from Mr Hosking, the chief of the Sydney Futures Exchange; from Mr Humphry, the Managing Director of the Australian Stock Exchange; and from Mr Cameron, the Chairman of the Australian Securities Commission. The honourable member for Perth informs me that the committee will also be talking to the Reserve Bank and the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. It will be looking at the broader issue of the regulation of derivatives. The only point on which the opposition's motion could have any validity was if this particular measure so impacted on the regulatory regime applying to the trading of derivatives in this country that its passage would potentially cause great harm prior to the completion of the CASAC report or any views which the parliamentary committee might wish to express. But the reality of this matter is that the regulatory regime which will apply to the trading of share price ratio contracts has been very closely considered by all the major players involved, particularlyand importantly, in my view-the Australian Securities Commission, which is the principal body that gives advice to the government on the regulation of these particular products. If the Securities Commission came to me and said, 'Attorney, we are worried about this bill. We are not satisfied with the approach being taken. We are concerned with what the Australian Stock Exchange is proposing in terms of this product. We think there needs to be a longer term look at the regulatory regime before we go down this path'-if it raised any of these sentiments at all on the trading of this product and its implementation through this bill-then I can assure you that I would not be arguing in favour of the passage of this bill at this time. But, far from raising any of those sorts of arguments, the Australian Securities Commission has advised that the bill is fine; that appropriate regulation of these hybrid-like products, which have share features of both a security and a future, is adequately under control; that the regulatory regime as proposed under the legislation is proper; and that the adequacy of the guarantee fund is such that it can cover the trading of the product. I have asked for very specific issue because of the· initial concern raised by the futures exchange. I asked specifically those very questions that the futures exchange raised in order to get specific advice on them. It is now at the stage where Mr Hosking, the head of the Sydney Futures Exchange, has appeared before the very committee which the honourable member for Berowra wants the bill referred to and has been asked questions about the adequacy of the bill and what his opinion is on it. He has said that he supports the passage of the bill, probably prefers that there not be competition with the Stock Exchange on the product and raised a concern about whether some of the measures in chapter 7 were voluntary or not. That evidence was put specifically both to the ASC and the Stock Exchange by the committee, which has already looked effectively at the bill, and those other witnesses refuted that evidence. In light of all that, what does the honourable member for Berowra hope to achieve with this motion? He obviously hopes to delay the passage of this bill. Mr Ruddock-Proper consideration.",42
25,Mr LAV ARCH,AYES,"If he is after proper consideration of the issues raised for the regulation of derivatives in this country, he already has that in the work the committee is doing, he already has that in the work which the Australian Securities Commission has done in over-the-counter trading of derivatives, he already has that in the operation of the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee and the work it is doing in response to the work done by the Australian Securities Commission. Therefore, we already have law reform bodies in the field looking at the issue and taking evidence. How many times do we have to keep the reinventing the same process? This referral is unnecessary. If it were necessary, if it were justified and if it could be sensibly argued, I would support it. It does not meet any of those tests. The issues are being canvassed and this committee has already had the opportunity to take evidence on it. As a result, I cannot, and the government will not, support advice on this this particular motion. Question put: That the motion (Mr Ruddock's) be agreed to. The House divided.

These measures were first announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) on 8 December 1994. The five-year drought investment allowance is a 10 per cent deduction of capital expenditure incurred on investment in fodder storage, or livestock water storage, or minimum tillage equipment or all water transport facilities. There is a cap on deductions of $5,000 per taxpayer per income year. Farm management bonds have· been made more concessionaI. That measure increases the 'default' investment component of farm management bonds to 100 per cent, increases the maximum holding of farm management bonds to $150,000 for each farmer, eliminates withholding tax on withdrawal of farm management bonds, and brings the treatment of farm management bonds where a farmer ceases to be engaged in primary production into line with other repayments unrelated to serious financial difficulties. It was originally intended that the measures should come into effect on 1 July 1995. However, the government brought them forward after representations from the National Farmers Federation and the caucus primary industries and resources committee. The Treasurer (Mr Willis) announced this on 23 March 1995. The drought investment allowance is now to take effect for capital expenditure incurred after 23 March 1995, the day announced in the more recent press release. This will give those primary producers who can incur such expenditure this financial year the opportunity to do so. . The changed arrangements for farm management bonds will now take effect on royal assent. The government is seeking to speed the consideration of this bill, so that those mary producers who can make deposits of farm management bonds this financial year may have the opportunity to do so to the maximum level. I turn now to a more detailed discussion of these measures. Drought investment allowance The drought investment allowance provides an incentive for primary producers to invest in items that will increase their drought preparedness. It applies to capital expenditure incurred after 23 March 1995 and the items of property to which it applies must be first used to produce assessable primary production income, or installed ready for such use, by 30 June 2001. The allowance, deductible in the year the item of property is first used, will be at a rate of 10 per cent and will be additional to depreciation. The drought investment allowance will operate similarly to the general investment allowance that ceased application at the end of June last year. To qualify, the items of property must be fodder storage facilities, or livestock water storage facilities, or minimum tillage equipment, or facilities for the transport of water. The taxpayer may incur expenditure on anyone or more of these items but cannot incur expenditure in excess of $50,000 on items first used or installed ready for use in a particular year of income and claim the full allowance for all of it. The items of property must be for use in Australia to produce primary production assessable income. The property must be retained by the primary producer for at least 12 months and must not, in that period, be made available for use by other persons. The allowance can be withdrawn at any time if property is acquired or constructed by the primary producer with the intention of dealing with it in a disqualifying manner even after the first 12 months. The drought investment allowance will be available to leasing companies if lessees contract to use the property for not less than four years. Leasing companies will have the option to transfer some or all of their entitlepriment to the allowance to the lessee of the property. Those primary producers who wish to claim the drought investment allowance on the installation of water storage facilities and water transport facilities must have an approved water conservation plan in pl-ce to be eligible for the allowance. The purpose of such a plan is to help the primary producer in preparing the farm to survive drought better in ways that minimise any adverse effects that the installation of water storage and water transport facilities might have both on the primary producer's farm and on the environment of which the farm is a part. A plan ensures there are no significant adverse effects on water quality or availability off the farm. Farm management bonds As a consequence of the amendments to the Loan (Income Equalization Deposits) Act 1976, farm management bonds will become more attractive to farmers. Farm management bonds provide a greater return if they are repaid tq meet certain sources of serious financial difficulties including commodity price collapse and drought. These amendments increase the proportion of the deposit which attracts interest to 100 per cent, farmers will be able to hold up to $150,000 in farm management bonds, and the 20 per cent withholding tax that was imposed on withdrawals of farm management bonds has been removed. When farm management bonds are not repaid because of serious financial difficulties caused by a commodity price collapse or by drought, disease, fire, flood or the like, they are repaid only as ordinary income equalization deposits. Deposits made after these changes may be repaid on the retirement of the primary producer from primary production only as though those deposits were income equalisation deposits and so will have earned a lower level of interest. This brings the treatment of repayment of farm management bonds on the retirement from primary production of a primary producer into line with repayment of farm management bonds in other situations where there is no collapse of commodity prices or other disaster. Full details of the amendments are contained in the explanatory memorandum circulated to honourable members. I commend the bill to the House.",44
27,Mr ANDERSON,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"The government wants us to believe that the Taxation Laws Amendment (Drought Relief Measures) Bill 1995, as part of its response to the appalling drought circumstances that have gripped the rural sector in recent times, is a major contribution to what the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) called the best ever response to possibly the worse drought we have seen this century. I want to make it plain that we welcome the legislation that is before us-generally speaking, the legislation is well put together and appropriate. The problem with it is that it replaces similar mechanisms which were inappropriately taken away many years ago, which should never have been taken away many years ago, which would have relieved a great deal of pressure and hardship in the bush if they had not been taken away many years ago, which would have saved the government a great deal of money and embarrassment now if they had not been taken away many years ago, and would have had many benefits, not only for farmers, but for the broader rural community and, in this environmentally conscious age, the rural environment as well. We are facing an appalling situation across rural Australia. We had substantial relief in many parts of the east in January. With good rain, everything looked as though we were set for a dramatic reversal in fortunes. Unfortunately, that did not last. Many areas are now sliding back into drought. I am absolutely dismayed by the appearance of the country in much of central New South Wales and in much of Victoria. I think it looks worse than it did before we got the rain in January. Mr Deputy Speaker, as you would probably realise, the reality is that, in this nation and in this place, we are fast becoming too far removed from an understanding of and a feeling for what is happening out there at the coal face, at the level at which our civilisation is sustained through its capacity to supply us with food and fibre, the very underpinnings of the good life we take for granted. By way of a novel illustration, I recall being in the UK a few months ago and talking with some primary industry representatives about what had happened in the wake of an outbreak of BSE, or mad cow disease, as it is known. I see the Member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) over there. I remember talking to him about this particular issue. Mr L1oyd-I don't suffer from it.",46
28,Mr ANDERSON,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I know, you do not suffer from it but it was a real problem in Britain. When it first emerged it had little impact on beef consumption. But we are in a media driven age, and one of the newspapers-we all know about the quality of the is British tabloids, which is variable at best-ran a story about someone's domestic cat that ate beefleft over from the Sunday roast and went mad. The story became something of an overnight sensation and beef consumption in the UK dropped by something like 70 per cent. It took 18 months to get it back up to normal. Interestingly, while beef consumption in overall terms dropped by 70-odd per cent, consumption of mince did not drop at all; it was unaffected. You might ask what that story has to do with drought in Australia. It has this to do with drought: we are far too quickly losing contact with our understanding of the importance of our rural sector, which provides the very undergirding of the things we take for granted. In Australia, where every farmer feeds and clothes about 75 other Australians as well as a host of people in foreign markets, we face a real problem. If the Australian community will not understand the importance of people in the rural sector, their social and economic needs, and the contribution they make economically and socially, and if we are going to hang them out to dry whenever it suits us politically to do so, we are in danger of stripping away a vital undergirding of a civilised society, a prosperous society, a society that wants to look after its environment. It is the government that is largely to blame for the mess out there and for the vulnerability of the farm community, the rural sector, to the impact of drought. In some ways, the government is culpable most of all in its response to the emerging problem of drought. Many people have been warning for a long time that there was an unfolding concern and economic disaster out there. Almost immediately upon my becoming the spokesman on our side for primary industry some two years ago, I remember making a trip to Queensland where I saw at first hand the social devastation and heard about what was happening to farm families who were not able to access relief and the tragic impact it has on children-perhaps the most disturbing element of all. I came back and said in this place that was an unfolding disaster, but no action was taken. It got worse and worse. The evidence mounted that we were facing a very serious situation, and there was no action from those great custodians of our social conscience on the other side. What did it take to stir them into action? It took a very clumsy and cruel remark from the Prime Minister when in Queensland that drought was something farmers had to live with. Then we had a massive reaction, I suggest in part from Labor's own backbenchers, because the remark was. so obviously inappropriate, callous and misplaced. Then we got a major media campaign. In many ways, I commend the media for driving and highlighting that campaign, for bringing into the living rooms of Australians the severity of that drought. It needed to be highlighted in this the most urbanised country in the world where too few Australians have any real understanding of what is happening out in the bush. The Ray Martin show reflected well not only on the media which were responsible for that campaign but also on the Australian community which made it very plain that it recognised there was a drought and a need to do something about the problem and were prepared to back up that need by digging into their pockets. . Finally, we got an acknowledgment from the government that there was a need for a response. It followed on an outrageously slow acceptance of the need to act. It was a horrendous double standard. We are only too willing, when Australians are down· and out in their luck, to give them a helping hand. But that help to farmers did not seem to benecessary in the government's eyes when they faced welfare needs and were unable to meet things like their children's educational needs. A lot of smart comments were made at that time by members opposite-I hope we do not hear any of those comments today-about how they had addressed that need and we had not. They came up with drought relief payments, which effectively are a cashing out of the welfare provisions that are available to there other Australians. The government matched our own long standing, long publicised, long acknowledged and long understood policy objective of simply lifting the assets test in cases of severe hardship in the bush. That program was put up and the money started to flow in some areas of Australia that had been declared eligible for exceptional circumstances. Good. That is precisely, I would suggest, what the Australian people expected the government to put in place-a mechanism for providing the same welfare benefits that other Australians expect when they are down and out and unable to provide for their needs to those people in farm communities, provided they could indicate need and were eligible for what the government calls exceptional circumstances. That is fine, except that there has been a major problem with the definition of exceptional circumstances, particularly in relation to rainfall deficiencies, which has meant that many of the people in very real need have not been able to satisfy the criteria. They remain in very real need. I put this to the government: I have no doubt that the media have not painted this issue in its right light in recent times-there has been a bit of rain, there has been a bit of government help and the lawn-mowers are out in urban Australia. So it is assumed that it is all okay out there in the bush. In fact, it is all right out there in the bush. There are many areas of this country where people are still dependent on food parcels. I think of the central west of New South Wales. I note that two people from the Hunter Valley are going to speak in a little while. Mr Bruce Scott-Only two people from the other side of the House.",46
29,Mr ANDERSON,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"No, there are three, and two of them are from the Hunter Valley. The lower end of the Hunter Valley was determined eligible for exceptional circumstances assistance. The upper end was not. It just happens, of course, that the lower end of the Hunter Valley is' a marginal seat for the ALP and the upper end of the Hunter Valley, I cannot help noticing, is not. What did the government do in the case of the very real need in the central west of New South Wales? It said, 'You don't need drought assistance; you need a restructuring program· because your farms are too small.' I think the Prime Minister said something about most of them being ex-dairy farms now trying to run a few head of beef. All the evidence I have seen actually suggests that the average farm in the central west of New South Wales is larger and more substantial than those in many of the areas where there has never been any suggestion that restructuring is needed. My heart really goes out to those people in central New South Wales in areas such as Dubbo; Wellington and Mudgee, in my own electorate; Merriwa, in the electorate of the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon), and further down to Scone, where horrendous financial and personal problems are arising out of the drought. They are ruled ineligible because of a rigid set of rules, a narrow set of criteria. What is at fault? It can only be the criteria. Why is there not a willingness to do that which, as I have said, I am sure the Australian people not only expect will be done but no doubt believe is being done to meet those welfare and educational needs of those families in real crisis? I wanted to make that point, and I also want to clearly indicate that it is not just central New South Wales where that problem pernot sists. It also persists in much of Victoria. I know that the member for Murray will cover those issues when he speaks, as will I am sure the member for Mallee (Mr Forrest). I see other members here who will have words to say about the appalling plight affecting their areas. Mr Bruce Scott-No-one from the government.",48
30,Mr ANDERSON,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"We see no government members from those worse hit areas defending this decision. My heart goes out to the member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) in the sense that he has been bearing the pressure of listening to the heart breaking stories that cover his electorate-ne of the largest in the country covering much of central and western . Queensland-which has been absolutely devast-ted for many years. He knows just how hard that is. Her,e we face a situation of varying equity, if you like, of a belated response to the drought where serious drought is re-emerging and where the response has been too late, yet the government wants to paint itself as the saviour of the bush. The fact is that it had to be dragged kicking and screaming to reality on this matter. Let me make one other passing observation: 1 will bet that, whenever exceptional circumstances declarations are made, and whenever exceptional circumstances budgets are set, the pattern will be just as it has been in the past-that is, the government will be seeking to minimise expenditure. We do not have the figures yet. It is early days. But, whilst the drought relief payments are getting out, 1 will bet London to a brick that those interest rate subsidies are not getting to a lot of people who desperately need them. 1 will bet London to a brick that there are people looking for more and reasons why we cannot afford it, why we cannot help out, which will simply exacerbate the economic and social decimation. It will also have an impact on those rural communiof ties in farming areas of this country. It also have a further impact on the environment, because there are massive stresses arising out of the drought and out of the sector's economic devastation. Returning to the measures before us, 1 again state that I am pleased we have this belated acknowledgment of the need to help farmers prepare for drought. This is one of the driest continents on Earth. It is sensible politics it has always been sensible politics and sensible policy to do everything possible maximise farmers' capacity to provide for downturns. Give them the tools and they will be best equipped to cope with downturns. The finalised. long-term cost to the taxpayer will be minimised and there will be long-term benefits to the Australian economy, such as in exports and jobs. We should remember that the food processthat. ing sector is the major manufacturing sectbr in this country. It is based on our rural tries and dependent upon a reliable supply quality, clean foodstuffs and fibre from our farming sector. It is a sound investment for the community to make, to ensure that the facilities are there for farmers to prepare drought and to ensure they are best equipped for seasonal downturns which are so much a feature of rural life in this country. We heard the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) say that these measures had not been intended for introduction until July 1995. I am glad he admitted that because it is the first time it has been admitted. When the second tranche of the 'greatest ever response to the worse drought this century' - I will take that up in a moment-was announced on 8 December, nothing was said about the timing of the introduction. Many farmers were left under the impression that those arrangements were to apply forthwith. There are not many farmers out there who have any cash to put away. Some are lucky enough to be in that position. Western Ausmore tralia wheat farmers-and good luck to them-have done reasonably well this season, the dairy industry has done quite well and the sugar industry has had a great year, but most our farm sector is in no position to be will putting any money away at the moment. However, there are people who needed to take advantage of the water and fodder taxfarm ation investment allowance measures announced on 8 December. They went ahead and did such things as cleaning out silted up dams. For the benefit of those people who do not have any background in rural industries, that is something you can do only in dry times. But then we found, much to the astonand ishment of the National Farmers Federation, the Labor Party caucus-as I take from it to what we were told today-and of cOjJrse us, that those measures were not to be put in place until later; and the details had not been The government has responded to the pressure-it was not mentioned but we mounted a lot of that pressure-by bringing forward these measures in part. We welcome I have some concerns about, and I am sorry that we will see, further intrusion by the indusCommonwealth government into land manof agement. This is an emerging trend and we will have to watch it pretty closely because under this legislation the trend is continued with the requirement that farmers who want for to undertake water conservation plans must have them approved in order to qualify for the investment allowance for water storage and conveyancing. Farm plans are already required for farmers claiming enhanced tax deductions for some fencing. They are a compulsory precondition for obtaining rural adjustment assistance under the rural adjustment scheme regional restructuring program in south-west Queensland. Those pastoral enterprise agreements, or PEAs, are very interesting because they give the Commonwealth a degree of clout it has not previously had in land management, which traditionally is a responsibility of state governments and one which I believe ought to be left essentially where it is. Another point arises out of this: we ought not cut off at the knees farmers' willingness to look after their environment. We ought not patronise them in that regard. The land care movement started out as a politically bipartisan thing and I am a bit worried because it is not as bipartisan any more as it might be, because of some fairly political actions by the government recently. I genuinely regret that. The point I want to make is that farmers are environmentally conscious. They are at the coalface of Australia's major environmental problems such as land and soil degradation, water quality in our river systems and so on. They want to look after their land and need the tools to do so. The best way to secure that is not by intruding in their capacity to manage; it is by restoring their profitability. That brings me back to where this government is just so unbelievably culpable. I want to concentrate on this for a moment. Over the last 20 years we have seen a horrendous deterioration in the terms of trade of the Australian farm sector. I do not know how many farmers are going to survive unless something pretty dramatic can be done about it. On Channel 9's Sunday Program last Sunday morning Neil Inall predicted that large numbers of farmers are not likely to survive the drought. The reason they cannot survive the drought is that they were financially weakened when they went into it because of the economic parameters that the mob opposite have run and because those economic parameters remain appalling, despite the government's crowing about its capacity to run the economy. If you look at the way in which the farm sectors debt has exploded, we see that it is about double in real terms what it was the last time we went into a major drought. That brings me back to the other point I wanted to raise-best ever response to the worse drought this century. We should look at what the government is spending now compared to what the Fraser-Anthony government spent in 1981-82-83. Mr Bruce Scott-Chicken feed.",48
31,Mr ANDERSON,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Chicken feed. Very insubstantial amounts of money by contrast. Remember this, Mr Acting Speaker: when that drought broke, who benefited? Not just the farmers; the Australian economy and the Hawke government. The farm sector was ready, willing and able to pick up the pieces and get on with producing, get on with exporting, but they will not be able to do it this time. The sector has been gutted. That should not be forgotten. There is another illustration of this point. The government promised $278 million for drought relief over four years. It sounds like a lot of money. Those opposite might tell us what their increases in interest rates over the same period of time is going to cost the farm sector, because it is many times that $278 million. The farm sector debt is $18.5 billion at the moment, about double what it was in the early 1980s. The interest that farmers will pay on that debt over and above that which they would have paid anyway if interest rates had stayed where they were-this is the increase in interest rates that they will pay during that period as a result of the government's failed policies-will be many times that drought assistance funding. That is one furphy to put to bed well and truly. There is another one, and it is this: we constantly hear the implication that the government is protecting drought affected farmers against increases in interest rates. That is just a pernicious bit of misinformation. The overwhelming bulk of farmers do not receive intere,st rate assistance. There are about 120,000 farmers in Australia and you can count on your hands the number of thousands of them who are actually getting this interest rate assistance on part, let alone all, of their interest rate burden. Let us put that one to bed. Mr Fitzgibbon-How many pay income tax?",50
32,Mr ANDERSON,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Farmers pay a great deal in income tax. The member for Hunter ought to be ashamed that he does not know that. They get no relief from it even when they are losing dramatic amounts of money. You have not had a response to that. You have no policy position on it. You continue to insist that the farm sector pay ridiculous levels of indirect taxation regardless of whether it is making money, holding even or losing a great deal of money. We have seen this explosion of costs and no willingness on the part of the government to address them. We see a constant refusal. 'Forget the farm sector when they are in need; we have pushed them out. We are going to make them cope with a level playing field'the great mythical level playing field. We expect them to operate in an economically rationalist sort of way. That has been the message. But the same has not applied to our mates in the union movementMr Bruce Scott-The Labor market.",51
33,Mr ANDERSON,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"We have not seen any effective reform there, and it has done massive damage to the farm sector. Where is the equality in this? Where is the fairness for Australians in the way in which the costs of the labor market imposed on the farm sector are unaddressed while the farm sector is put out there in the cold and expected to cope? I asked the Prime Minister-and the member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell) might be interested in this because she comes from the city in Queensland that is known as the beef capital of Australia-when the restaurant chain Sizzler wanted to import some American beef how it was that an Australian company could go to America where it would pay 60 per cent more for beef than it would pay here. Those are the sorts of improved returns or better returns that American beef producers get over ours for their product. It then had to put it through an American packing house, pack it out, past the inspectors, into containers, truck it to the seaboard, across the wharves and onto a ship across the PacificMr Bruce Scott-Then across our wharves.",51
34,Mr ANDERSON,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Then across our wharves, past our inspection services.",51
35,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,Mr Vaile)The member for Maranoa is not helping.,51
36,Mr ANDERSON,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Yes, he is. He understands the issues. He is a Queenslander who does understand the beef industry. And it could distribute it for around $5.80 per kilo, whereas the best you can get the Australian product for is $6.20. I said to the Prime Minister, who had just come back from APEC at that stage, 'If we are going to compete in Asia, how the heck are we ever going to make it when we find that, in something as important as Australia's major agricultural export industry, we cannot compete at home, let alone abroad?' The member for Capricornia might tell us what her response is to the fact that right up and down the Queensland coast New Zealand and American rump steak is being widely advertised-in the Australian home of beef. Do you know what the Prime Minister answered? I wish every farmer in the country could hear this. The Prime Minister of this country effectively answered by saying that I was a mug for highlighting the incapacity of Australian beef producers to compete. The whole point of the exercise is that of course we can compete. We have to compete. We are producing the product for about half what the Americans are and we are being screwed because of the inefficiencies post-farm gatethe inefficiencies which you mob will not grapple with. I notice from the blue sheet that we are about to see all the legislation introduced that relates to the restructuring of the beef industry. Let us just see how realistic it is going to be. We have had report after report into the beef industry in this country. The last of them was the Industries Commission report last year. It listed things like industrial relations, AQIS reform-all of these things that we knew about anyway that have to be done so that maybe we can start to match New Zealand and American processing costs. Best practice cost in American plants is around 13-c per kilo. New Zealand is getting it down to about 25c, along with the Argentinians, and in Australia it is 49c. The Industries Commission report said there are a billion and a half dollars of savings to be made there. A billion and a half! The Australian farm sector needs access to those savings. And what do we see from the government? Laurie Brereton says, 'Oh no, our industrial relations approach is a model. Other countries ought to do it the way we do it.' What is happening is that jobs are being .lost in the electorate of the member for Capricornia. Mr Bruce Scott-They are exporting their steers live.",51
37,Mr ANDERSON,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"They are exporting their steers live. What was the union's response to this? 'Shock, horror! We will have to stop it. We will sign up with the animal liberation mob and we will get the government to put an export tax on live cattle. Do not talk about reforms that everybody said are necessary to save jobs, to expand the industry, to build more jobs, to actually give the poor old meatworkers the capacity to earn a higher wage, because they are not well paid. Let us not talk about those things. We will go the good old Aussie protectionist road.' The government, of course, will say, 'No, no, the farm sector can't have any help. As for the union blokes, we'd better have a bit of a look at this because they ate our mates.' It is disgusting. It is un-Australian. As I move around my electorate seeing my farm communities bleeding, seeing them hurt, seeing the lack of fight that so many of them now display-the dull resignation that is the best most of them can muster to the appalling situation that they face-it makes me very angry that there is one set of rules for a protected minority in this country and another set of rules for people who get out there and produce, who want to do the right thing by their families and their communities, want to do the right thing by the country but cannot. On top of all that, we now find that ABARE is predicting that farm costs are going to start to rise again above the levels of those of our competitors. They are saying that interest rates are going to rise again-II - per cent prime rate. That means most farmers will be on 15 or 16 per cent. And for the sixth year in a row it is predicting that average farm business profits will be negative. There are two rules in this country: one for the mates, another for those who dare to put their hands up and say, 'We want to be productive and do something.' The government ought to be ashamed. For the sake of rural Australia, the sooner it goes the better.",52
38,Ms HENZELL,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Capricornia) (LOS p.m.}-I certainly hope that the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson) feels better now that he has vented all his spleen and his heart has bled and all those things. I am sure that he holds his views very strongly and that he is representing the concerns that he has in his portfolio position, but we basically hear, unfortunately, this same speech from him just about every time he gets up. At least he did admit that the measures in this bill are useful the and have been supported by his party. It demonstrates the commitment of the governmentMr Anderson-You tell your workers what you are going to do for them.",52
39,Ms HENZELL,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I listened to the honourable member for Gwydir in silence and I had thought I would not have to deal with his interjections. The fact is that these measures which were part of the statement of 8 December by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) concerning the additional drought relief measures, as the honourable member for Gwydir acknowledged, are going to cost $112 million over the next four years. Together with the immediate drought relief package announced on 21 September, which provided $164 million to help farmers in exceptional circumstances, this measure has been welcomed by many people, particularly the National Farmers Federation. When we announced these additional measures in December, which included the farm ,management bonds and particularly the investment allowance, it was in response to representations both from the caucus primary industries committee--ofwhich I am a member because I represent a: regional rural electorate, together with many other of my colleagues who also represent rural and regional Australia-and from the National Farmers Federation. In their budget submission to the government the NFF people had emphasised the need for fiscal restraint but said the only things that they really wanted were that these two measures be brought forward. The Treasurer (Mr Willis) has responded and in his press release of 23· March indicated that we would bring these measures forward so that those people in rural industry who are not suffering the extraordinary drought that many farmers in our electorates have suffered in the last couple of years will be in a position to take up the opportunities in these initiatives. It shows once again that the government is listening to primary producers, is consulting with them and is responding to them. The National Farmers Federation, in its associated press release in response to the Treasurer's announcement, indicated how very pleased it was. I will quote from its press release of 23 March. The NFF president, Mr Donald MCGauchie, said: the decision was the direct result of representations from the NFF and is a significant win for farmers. ""The Treasurer, Mr Willis, accepted our ments, which also had the full support of Senator Collins and the Caucus Primary Industries and Resources Committee, as well as the Opposition and the Australian Democrats. ""All those involved have our thanks."" This is a transparent process. I am delighted to see that with some cooperation from the opposition, both here and in the other ber, we should be able to process this legislarains tion so that the royal assent which is needed for the farm management bonds aspect of this legislation will allow for these initiatives have real meaning for fanners in this fmancial year. Once again, it is quite clear that the ment is working very positively with peak bodies like the National Farmers Federation. I refer to my speech of 12 October because is quite clear that peak farming organisations like the National Farmers Federation, of all the breast be-ting that we hear from members opposite when rural bills and drought relief measures are debated in this House, are very clear that the government is listening, is consulting and is delivering on the issues that they believe are most important. When the initial announcements on the drought relief package were made, Ian MCFarlane, President of the Grains Council of Australia, said that drought stricken farmers had been given new hope for the future. Donald MCGauchie has also made some very positive statements along those lines. Rick Farley, the Executive Director of the NFF, said: The Prime Minister's trip to drought areas in Queensland leading up to the drought package was remarkably successful. The fact that the package includes some of the proposals put directly to him at that time has not gone unnoticed. Keating is now in a position of being able to say, !We came, we saw, we listened and we acted.' The drought relief measures that the government has put in place-both the urgent ones for exceptional circumstances and these longer term ones-indicate that the government is consulting with farmers on the ground. I would prefer, in this case, to talk about the grassroots rather than the coalface! I believe the honourable member for Gwydir seriously argumixed his metaphors. It is much more appropriate to talk about the grassroots. The problem with the drought is that we have not had enough grass roots, particularly in the areas of central Queensland that I have visited recently. In response to the comments made by the member for Gwydir, there is real concern in chamcentral Queensland because the follow-up have not come. A tour through my electorate in the week preceding this sitting gave a much more positive picture. There is to new grass growth and the whole environment looks much better. When I took the Prime Minister's Rural Task Force to a meeting in governBlackwater, we flew over much of central Queensland and there was water everywhere. It was wonderful. However, what was also it clear was that·there were almost no cattle in the hinterland because of the preceding in spite drought periods. The real concern-and it is something which we have no control over-is that if we do not get follow-up rains in the next couple of weeks in central Queensland, we will be returning to the conditions of the previous couple of years. That is very serious. However, the one thing we are not able to do is to make it rain. We hope that the monsoonal activity continues, otherwise we will lose the best chance we have had in probably four years of getting a sustainable period of rain that will enable people to get back on their feet. There is no doubt that those rains have increased people's optimism. They feel that they have some chance of getting back on their feet. However, it will be very difficult if we do not get those vital follow-up rains. To return to the political realities, the criticism of the National Party of Australia for not effectively representing its constituency has not been lost on the National Farmers Federation. The NFF realises that it needs to negotiate constructively with the government of the day. Tim Stevens reported the following comment from the NFF in the Australian: In response, an NFF source said, 'The problem with the coalition is that they haven't come with not being in government. We don't need them and we certainly don't want them until they get their policy act together. Besides, despite all this bickering, we are still far softer with them than we are with Labor.' That is a pretty hard-nosed approach to the situation, but it is very clear. There has been a lot of talk about the Prime Minister not being in touch with mainstream issues. It was in my electorate that the Prime Minister made the comment that was supposed to have angered so many rural people. During a visit to Rockhampton last year, the Prime Minister said something which is well acknowledged by everybody who knows anything about rural activity in this country. He said that drought is a normal part of the industry. Hence, a lot of the government's approaches during its time in office have been to ensure that we plan for droughts. It is no good for people to get all hot under the collar and think, 'Shock! Horror! The Prime Minister said this was normal.' What the Prime Minister said was a reality. Drought, for the whole history of European occupation, has been a major problem for primary producers, no matter how big those primary producers got. Sidney Kidman was a classic example. No matter how many properties he put together, he could not survive some of the terrible droughts that we had, even in this century. We have to be able to face those realities, and to plan so that-and this is a very important issue-farmers are able to be self-sustaining during times of drought. Our drought relief package has been responded to very positively in the bush. I had the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) in my electorate on 11 November last year. We sat down with farm families so that the minister could hear, at first hand, how that was all going. This is the government that is not supposed to be consulting with the people on mainstream issues. I have had the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, the Minister for Social Security and the Prime Ministertwice-visit my electorate. The ministers, including the Prime Minister, are going out and talking with people. As I have said previously, there is no doubt that, when we to grips went out to Dingo-prior to the announcement of this package in September-and talked with drought-stricken farmers in central Queensland, those people were shocked to find that the Prime Minister, whom they only ever see on television, was a caring, sensitive person who understood their concerns and could talk their language.  laugh at this idea, but I was there, and he was not. I saw that the Prime Minister was able to talk with those people, was able to respond to those concerns and was, in fact, electrifying when he said to those people, 'We will not leave you behind. 'we will not leave the people of rural Australia behind.' The member for Sturt would not know; he is from an inner-city electorate. Let us not have any nonsense about that. The Prime Minister, in his press statement of 21 September, said: If only for the sake of fairness, we must take these measures. But it is also in the interests of the national economy to take them. It is in the interests of the long-term sustainability of our rural industries. It is in the interests of the environment. It is in the interests of all Australians to take them. We have to get some clarity. The member for Gwydir was concerned that, particularly with the investment allowance in relation to water conservation measures, farmers would have to provide some assessment of farm planning and conservation measures, and that that was going to somehow be a problem and interfere with farm management. But it is very clear that this is a vital measure, because we cannot simply provide an investment incentive and have people go off and misuse one of the scarcest resources in this country: water. Unfortunately, in spite of all that is said about our primary producers being the best conservationists, the historical facts do not bear witness to that. I am sure we will hear many speakers from the opposition say that that is the case. But, if one looks at land clearing and land degradation, one finds that a lot of it has come from a history of rural activity in marginal farming areas. That was one of the issues that the Prime Minister was most concerned about dealing with, and he got a very positive response from the peak farming organisations, which also admit that this has been a problem. Let us look at the water storage facilities which we are providing the investment allowance for. It will cover dams, earth tanks, underground tanks, above - ground tanks, the bases and stands or the covers of these tanks and other structures and improvements. Water is one of the key issues, apart from feed. The investment allowance is a significant taxation incentive. In fact, what we are providing in these investment allowances will, over the life of the investment, be a 110 per cent taxation incentive. We have done this in very few other situations. The R&D incentive, of course, is 150 per cent. We had a short-term investment of 110 per cent. We had the development allowance, in One Nation, of 110 per cent. We now have this drought investment allowance of 110 per cent. We do not do this every day of the week, but it is a real commitment to assisting people in rural Australia to prepare themselves for drought. We have increased farm managements ?onds from $80,000 to $150,000 and the mterest on those from 80 to 100 per cent, and made it easier to withdraw for particular purposes. This is something that rural people have been looking for-certainly in my electorate. They certainly have been looking for the drought investment allowance measures that we have put into this legislation for not only water storage but also minimum tillage equipment and fodder storage. These are absolutely vital initiatives. We have listened to what people have said and, in spite of a very tight fiscal position, the Treasur-r has said that not - nly are we going to do thIS but also we are gomg to bring these initiatives forward so that those fortunate people who can make use of them now can make those adjustments in this financial year and begin to set aside money to assist them through future droughts. If there is one thing that we know, it is that this drought will be revisited oli us in the foreseeable future. It is very clear that drought is part of the mainstream of Australian agricultural experience. It is not something that just happens unexpectedly and we certainly do not want rural families to suffer the way they undoubtedly have during this last foqr to five years. The member for Gwydir often brings up the whole interest rate issue. The fact of the matter is that we have lowered interest rates over this time and we have lowered inflation and that includes wages to workers. Of coursthere are many challenges that we have to face in rural industries and farm costs, post farm gate, and we recognise that farmers are in a limited position to affect those costs. But we have also delivered on the GATT. We are working very hard to make sure that our primary producers are able to export to overseas markets, and we are now in an international trading situation. Unfortunately, the . - ational Party is still at the agrarian socIalIst level of operation and still thinking primary producers are getting a bad deal. In fact, we have done a great deal more to enable primary producers to cope with these exigencies than we did for a lot of industrial sectors through the radical restructuring and opening of markets and the taking away of protection that have created very high levels of unemployment in other areas of the country. So I am glad to see that the opposition is going to support these very positive proposals. They have the support of the peak farming bodies. We will continue to work and consult directly with all representatives of the farm sectors. And, unfortunately, it will be left to the National Party-which has become a rural rump party peddling a pretty conservative social and economic policy and platform-to come into the parliament, bleat and whinge, and decry the inevitable and very difficult changes that primary industries, as well as other industries in this country, must face if we are going to be an exporting nation. I commend these measures to the House and I appreciate, on behalf of my constituents, what the Treasurer has done to bring these matters forward to assist farmers across the country.",52
40,Mr WAKELIN,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"We are debating the Taxation Laws Amendment (Drought Relief Measures Bill) 1995. The opposition supports these measures, but the issue today is not whether we support them; the issue is the last 12 years of this administration and the reasons that these measures were abolished in 1983. That is the essence of the issue. As the member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell) leaves, I would just take her up on the remark of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) that drought is a natural phenomenon. That comment, as with other comments that the Prime Minister has made, is regarded as very insensitive and must be seen in the context of Labor policies over the last 12 years-policies of constant neglect, constant ignoring of the fundamental issues and failure to understand what rural Australia was about: its great tradition, its very significant contriThey bution to export income and to our very roots as a nation, going right back over 200 years. That is the great industry for which the Prime Minister shows his contempt. It is too easy to dismiss it as an industry that is in decline and that has no future. That is the context. It is not about sup-.,ort for very belated legislation; it is in the context of the history ment which has shown contempt, arrogance and neglect. The Deputy Leader of the National Party, the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson), has made some very good points, and I will just highlight a few of them because I think they bear repeating. Those of us that live in regional Australia are at the coalface, and we do have an understanding of the pain, the difficulty and the needs of regional Australia. It is no whinge, no complaint; just a plea for a fair go. We are at the coalface; we live with these people; we understand their issues. By Australian standards there is a social disaster out there that has been created by negligence, a social disaster that every Australian should note. We have a proud export industry bloodied by drought and by neglect from a careless government. The double standard that the shadow minister and the Deputy Leader of the National Party spoke about is what hurts people so much. It was only when the media and the Farmhand appeal-with people such as Ray Martinbecame involved that the government was prompted to act. When grassroots metropolitan people are determined to help people in regional Australia one realises that there is a national issue involved. Those of us who have lived in regional Australia knew there was an issue, but when metropolitan Australia picked it up and shamed this government into action we knew we had an opportunity to extract at least some form of social justice. Let us look beyond farmers, because it is very important to understand that agriculture and its contribution is not just about farmers. Farmers are simply the front-line troops. Farmers simply work on the land and produce the primary product. To produce that product there is a whole range of people involved. are part of the basis of the social infrastructure and the economic infrastructure of regional Australia. When we talk about agriculture we talk about small business in the towns; we talk about the employees; we talk about the service industries; we talk about the eduaation facilities; and we talk about the farm tourism and a range of other industries of a govern- that flow from it. We were told in the Prime Minister's statement on 8 December 1994 that there is great generosity in this package, that it is the helping hand of Labor. But is it? Labor was provoked by the Farmhand appeal and was able to get cabinet to agree to act. There were two packages amounting to $276 million, to be spent over four years. Let us be generous and say that is $300 million over four years. Let us be positive here. It is about $80 million per annum, a significant amount of money. But that $80 million actually looks fairly paltry when you look at the interest rate rises, which will cost rural business-not the home buyer in regional Australia but just rural business,---$500 million per annum. So the government package gives $80 million and it takes $500 million by the interest rate policy. It takes out of the pocket of the farmer six times what the government has actually given. That is not to talk about the increase in excise, it is not to talk about the increase in indirect taxation, it is not to talk about the increase in costs on primary production and it is not to talk about the extra costs of imposed by this government on every single person that lives in regional Australia. This government, by the way, at the last election was going to have no new taxes, had l-a-w tax cuts in place and then reneged. So let us not dwell too much on the generosity of the government. It is said that for every person employed in agriculture there are a further six people who gain employment from agriculture. My understanding is that that is about 30 per cent of the work force of Australia. Two million people rely on agriculture for employment in this country, at a time when the average wage, some would say, is $30,000 to $35,000. And what does the farmer get from this very generous government? Under the policies of this government, what would the average farmer earn? Would you think half the average wage? In the last two years maybe you would even consider negative income. Would you believe that the farmers of Australia predominantly have negative incomes, with the generosity of this government? Are the farmers out there producing because they like to, that they do it because they love it, apparently? Of course that is nonsense. Farmers are entitled to a decent wage like anyone else. Sadly this bill, which we support, obviously, comes 10 years too late. It ignores too many disasters, too many negligent habits of this government. I will touch on a few little asides that people have mentioned to me in recent times. There was a federal cabinet meeting in Adelaide late last year and ministers were spread throughout a great function in one of the hotels or whatever in Adelaide. A conversation arose about the Eyre Peninsula and about what could be done to keep people on their land and give them a fair go. A senior cabinet minister said, 'Oh well, we've got to get rid of them.' We have got to get rid of them! People that have been there for 100 years, for up to 150 years! We have got to get rid of them. People providing export income, the basis of our nation for the past 200 years-get rid of them! Many farmers feel that they are the forgotten race. They feel that they are very much an living endangered species. As my colleague the Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia commented earlier, there is this great inconsistency between the philosophy of protection for the labour movement of Australia and the philosophy of protection for those who operate in agriculture and in small business. There is this great inconsistency. The Prime Minister says, 'Reach down the hand to help those less fortunate.' Yes, it is true that the hand has reached down but, as I have made the point, $80 million per annum is the amount of help. How much help is it, then, to take $500 million from that same group of people? I will touch on a comment the Prime Minister made yesterday. In passing, and concerning the stinging rebuke that the people of the electorate of Canberra gave the ALP on Saturday, he said that he was not going to be bound to the mortgage grindstone, that he was not going to worry excessively about a little bit of debt or an odd interest rate rise, that there was much more to Australian life than that. Oh no, he would not worry too much about the mortgage grindstone.",56
41,Mr COBB,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,He has paid for his mansion.,57
42,Mr WAKE LIN,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Exactly. He is not too worried about the mortgage grindstone that millions of Australians have to endure and that hundreds of thousands of those associated with and in agriculture have to endure. As I made the point earlier, the great pity about ALP members is that they are such slow learners. We support the introduction of the farm management bonds but essentially that was what Mr Fraser had in place from 1975 onwards. Let us have a look at the comments of the man who abolished the lED scheme. Let me examine that and expose it for the fallacy that it is. Peter Walsh said in an article in the Financial Review of 13 December 1994: In 1980, the Fraser Government changed the averaging rule so that farmers could choose each year whether their income would be taxed at the normal rate or whether it would be applicable to their average income for that and the previous four years. I will miss the next part, but he then said: The more extreme the fluctuation in taxable income, the less tax paid. Once this rort surfaced, judicious use of IEDs required that money be deposited in years oflow income and withdrawn in years of high income-the exact opposite of what was ostensibly intended. For a bit of icing on the cakehe says sarcasticallythe farmers best placed to exploit the rort were those who had large off-farm incomes. There were quite significant fences, if you like, built around those lED programs but the great fallacy of that comment-and it is ignored not only by Walsh and his colleagues-is the absolute ignorance of the reality of agriculture. We may have from one year to next a factor of 10 in variation of income, something that most Australians do not experience. I do not hold that against them but it is impossible, unless you have lived in the industry, to understand that huge variation. Think about it. The yield can be 0.5 tonnes per hectare or it can be 2.5 or 5 tonnes per hectare, a factor of five or lOin yield terms from one year to the next. Then let us think about the commodity price-not something that most Australians think about, because they, like me now, have a fixed wage. Everybody knows what we get. The average wage is $35,000. I get my parliamentary salary from year to year, and it is indexed. In the agricultural sector, income varies greatly. The commodity price might have for wool or grain in a 12-month period. That is a variation of a factor of 10 or 15 on yield. The commodity price may be a factor of 30. I am being generous if I say that there is a variation of 10. Yet Peter Walsh has for years conducted a campaign against farmers, even though he is a farmer himself. I am appalled that he could try to do so much damage to agriculture in this country. The best attempt at repentance Peter Walsh has offered is to say: This was the scheme/rortterminated by the Hawke Government in 1983taxed at the rate then he confessesprincipally at my insistence. He goes on to say: It probably should have been replaced with a rational and equitable scheme before this, even at low take-up rates. So on the one hand he wipes it out, and then on the other he admits that it should have been replaced. That is the ultimate hypocrisy. That is why I am so offended by this government's contempt for agriculture. That is why I welcome this legislation, albeit belated, today. On the issue of education and exemption from the assets test for Austudy, government policy has failed in this area. It is extremely expensive to send children away from home to get their education. This government has failed to control costs, particularly for rural and regional people. To deny them access to Austudy because of the assets test is another great sin. It creates two classes. At a time when agriculture is going through massive structural change, the one hope for many families is the opportunity to get a decent education for their children, yet they are denied this. This bill will help, but it only touches the surface. To, conclude, tomorrow we will have another set of balance of payment figures. I do not know what that will be, but it is expected that it will be in the area of a $2 billion deficit.",58
43,Mr COBB,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,Just for one month.,59
44,Mr WAKELIN,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Exactly. The honourable member for Parkes reminded me that that is just for one month. Multiplied by 12-and that is where it is headed-that is a $24 billion shortage in our balance of payments. This is just a minor matter according to the Prime Minister. However, it will have implications for interest rates just for agriculture alone. Everyone point rise in interest rates means a $170 million impost on the agriculture sector. The main thing is that agriculture produces export income. Have we heard about export income? That is the main way to get some equilibrium in our balance of payments and to provide the standard of living that all Australians aspire to.",59
45,Mr FITZGIBBON,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Hunter) (1.44 p.m.)The honourable member for Grey (Mr Wake lin) referred to farmers as the forgotten people. He is right. Whenever I visit the farmers in my electorate they say, 'I'm flabbergasted. You're a federal member. We've never been visited by a federal member in our lives.' I say, 'Hey, fair go, what about the Libs and the Nats?' They say, 'Oh, they never visit us. We're the forgotten people as far as they're concerned.' I must comment also on the speech made by the Deputy Leader of the National Party, the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson). He is a good fellow, and he made an interesting speech, but it is one· which I must deplore. Throughout his speech one could have been forgiven for thinking that he was preaching class warfare. It was 'us against them'. All he did was tear strips from the union movement and praise and defend the farmers. I would hope that a man who aspires to a higher office in the leadership this country would make some attempt to bring Australians closer together, and not continue with this nonsense of class warfare. It is not just the farmers who suffer. I happen to live in the electorate of Hunter, where I have seen the textile and clothing industry devastated---decimated. Look at a place like Newcastle, where BHP has probably gone from employing some 13,000 staff down to employing about 4,000 or 5,000. It is not all one way. We, as Australians, must all try to appreciate that we have our strengths, and we have our weaknesses and our tough periods. We should try to help each other through those periods. The Taxation Laws Amendment (Drought Relief Measures) Bill 1995 is a good bill, and I am delighted that it is supported by the opposition. But the honourable member for Grey criticised this government for missing the boat for 12 or 13 years, for not having done much. I would point out to the honourable member for Grey that I have been in this House for over 10 years and, in all my time, I can hardly remember a rural bill brought to this House which has been opposed by the opposition. The only one that I can remember is one that had to do with wool or wheat, and what a farce that was. I remember that half the opposition crossed to this side of the House to support us against the rump which stayed on the other side of the House. The fact is that the government has done well in trying to look after the rural community of Australia. We have had bad times and the still existing drought is one of those bad times. But it is obvious that whereas rural producers used to regard Labor members as having two horns and a tail-as being the devil incarnate-they are now supporting Labor. That is why we see the continual diminution of National Party seats in country Australia. It is good that farmers be prepared for floods and drought and things of that nature. It is only right, proper and fitting that the government should encourage preparedness. As I was writing these few notes, I thought to myself, 'It is good to give encouragement to of help farmers prepare for future droughts. But, because of the severity of this drought, not many of my farmers have the money to invest. in being prepared.' It is indeed true that city people have only vague ideas of the problems of the men and women on the land. I do not think that many people who live in Sydney could understand the devastation caused by drought: the husband away with the herd and pregnant women on the roadside, walking the roads with their stock, seeking food for their beasts. When the government response to the drought was released in two packages-it is close to $300 million-it was interesting to see the response. Headlines in the paper called it 'The greatest drought package ever', and surprise was expressed by many columnists that such a generous package had been given by a Labor government to an area which is not their natural constituency. The national farmers magazines, et cetera were loud in their praise, quite generous in their praise, of the package brought forward by the current government. What did we get? Nothing but carping criticism from the Liberals, the Nationals and the Liberal-National government in New South Wales. But many good things have been done to assist farmers through this trying period, such as the Austudy eligibility rules being liberalised. When an unprecedented area of New South Wales was drought declared it was good; it fairly revealed that this was one of the worse droughts in our history. But then an increasing number of areas were declared as having exceptional circumstances applying, and being considered eligible for exceptional circumstances made them eligible for increased assistance. In my electorate that was when the politicking started. Let me explain the position of my electorate. It is a large electorate of over 20,000 square kilometres, embracing a number of Pastures Protection Board areas. Some areas of my electorate missed out on exceptional circumstances. I can name Scone, Merriwa, Denham and a number of smaller townships. Did those areas deserve to miss out on the exceptional circumstances? I say no, but I am parochial; I am biased. Then Maitland was added to the exceptional circumstances list and that caused further difficulty for me. I have two constituents who happen to be National Party senators, and Senator Brownhill, a good fellow, and Senator Sandy Macdonald, another good fellow, gave me a bit of a lacing in the local media. The Deputy Leader of the National Party, who spoke earlier, did not miss dropping a few hints to the media about what a failure Fitzgibbon was and how exceptional circumstances should apply throughout the electorate. Every time Ian Armstrong, Ian Causley and John Fahey, the former Premier of New South Wales, visited Maitland-an area they visited a great number of times-they had a go at me. The Deputy Leader of the National Party in the New South Wales parliament, George Souris, another fine gentleman, did not miss the opportunity to play politics, castigate this government and accuse it of propping up a marginal federal Labor seat. That was the height of hypocrisy, considering the money the Fahey government-hopefully, the former Fahey government-poured into the state electorate to hold the state seat of Maitland. It spent millions; it spent money as though it was going out of fashion. The dumbest act of politicking in the Hunter came from a young rural councillor based in Scone, Mr Andrew Badgery, who staked his claim for a political career with the National Party by putting out numerous media releases using each one to condemn the 'heartless federal Labor government'. In all those press releases he made reference to the word 'suicide'. It takes a special kind of genius to put the thought of suicide into the minds of desperate farming families. Then Senator John Tierney got into the act. The Liberal senator wandered up the valley, hoping to embarrass me with a few brownie points for the Liberal Party. He grabbed the ear of a few farmers up my way and, while he managed to reveal his ignorance about farming matters, he persuaded a few of them to accompany him in a delegation down to Canberra to meet with the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins). The delegation to Minister Collins was useful and informative, because the minister was very helpful. But Senator Tierney did not make mention in Canberra of the wild accusations he had heaped on the minister and the government in the Hunter Valley media. I am furious that certain sections of my drought stricken electorate have not been granted exceptional circumstances funding, but I must accept the referee's decision, although I am working extremely hard to change that decision. But the government cannot be blamed for the decision, because the government did not make the decision. This shows the ignorance of the member for Parkes e Mr Cobb): he should listen very carefully and find out the process whereby exceptional circumstances funding is extended. Since the Ros Kelly sports rorts allegations, this government has been super-conscious of the need for meticulous endeavour to meet the toughest accountability requirements. And, when it comes to exceptional circumstances, these requirements have been satisfied ly. We have satisfied perfectly the requirements regarding accountability. It was interesting that, when the Deputy Leader of the National Party spoke, he spent half an hour rubbishing the federal Labor government about its drought policies and its recognition of exceptional circumstances. But nowhere his speech at any time did he mention the term RASAC. Perhaps the member for Parkes thinks that RASAC has some significance in a debate about drought assistance. RASAC stands for the Rural Adjustment Scheme Advisory Council. The minister could go out there with his little magic wand and pick Labor electorates or do some pork-barrelling in deciding exceptional circumstances assistance should extended. But he has kept at arms length. has a committee of expert talented people chaired by Neil Inall, and it is that committee, mainly composed of rural producers, which decides-after surveying and making and rain checks, et cetera throughout the country-who should get exceptional circumstances funding. So is it not extraordinary that the National Party tried to wring tears from an audience by talking about the heartlessness of the federal Labor government, when the federal Labor government does not make the determinations? They deliberately tried to give the wrong impression. So we have exposed it that bit of politicking by the Nationals and Liberals. While I am on this subject, I want to pay tribute to those people and charitable bodies working to ease the pain of stricken farmers during this terrible drought-in my electorate in particular, but in other places as well. Hay is another place which has missed out on exceptional circumstances funding. The Samaritan Foundation, which is a welfare arm of the Anglican Church, has been quite marvellous, as have been the St Vincent de Paul Society and the Salvation Army and other church groups. Then, of course, we had Farmhand, which did a magnificent job. I spoke to one of the chiefs of Farmhand, and he was instrumental in ensuring that some of the money raised by Farmhand went to my electorate, to those areas which missed out on perfectexceptional circumstances funding. It is interesting that the Samaritans had raised about $50,000, which they had given to people affected by the drought. Then they contacted me, and I guess they might have contacted. some other members, to see whether in the government would match that dollar for dollar. But the government had decided, and I think quite rightly, that the best way to ensure that the money was distributed fairly was to let all the money go through Farmhand. So consequently, if the Samaritans wanted the government to match dollar for dollar their contribution, that money should have been handed by the Samaritans across to Farmhand and then distributed by Farmhand where and they would have got the government be dollar for dollar matching. Local councils He have also come to the aid of those areas stricken by drought. They have sent their tankers and their drivers along and they have carted water from better served areas to help weather crippled townships. Every day I pick up the daily papers and the drought is hardly mentioned anymore, which is a shame because it is still alive and well out there. When I was being kicked to death in the Hunter Valley, none of the daily papers were mentioning the plight of Scone, Merriwa and Denman, but in the local press was really aired. Yet I used to try to defend the myself by quoting articles which appeared in the New South Wales farmers magazine. At a meeting at Dubbo, Mudgee or somewhere like that, there were two very important and respected, responsible spokesmen. One had this to say: Never in the history since federation has a federal government given more assistance to people in time of drought. This was also said: For the first time ever a sensible approach has been taken to drought funding and for the first time ever the money from the government has been targeted to those people who are in the greatest need. That was a ringing endorsement of our policies. Many farmers in my electorate are - ray!ng for follow-up rain. But more appalhng IS that an equal number of farmers in my electorate are praying not for follow-up rain but for first or lead rain. They have had no - ain which can be followed up and they are 10 a really desperate position. In recent weeks I have worn a path to the office of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Senator Collins, seeking to have RASAC review its decision on exceptional circumstances for Scone, Merriwa and Denman. Mr Bruce Scott-What has he said?",59
46,Mr FITZGIBBON,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I will tell you what he said. This is very interesting. He told me that there is a process about the granting of excep!ion-l circumstances assistance. What happens IS thIS: the pasture protection board makes a recommendation to the state minister, who in New South Wales is Ian Causley, but he probably will not be a minister within a couple of days. He will not be in government within a couple of days. The honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) will be very interested in this. This is what then happens. The state minister makes a request to the federal minister. Guess what has happened. Despite numerous attempts to contact Mr Causley's office, he is incommunicado at the moment, because of the state election. Of course, he has got a department. But the New South Wales government, the New South Wales minister, has made no approach or request to the federal minister for the extension of exceptional circumstances. (Time expired)",62
47,Mr COBB,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"We are debatipg this bill on drought assistance, the TaxatIOn Laws Amendment (Drought Relief Measures) Bill 1995, at a time when eastern Australia in particular is sliding rapidly back into drought following the summer rains that it had in the month of January. It is ironic !hat it had those rains in January, because that 10 effect will prevent any of its areas ever qualifying for exceptional circumstances unless it does not rain for the next two or three years. The government's treatment of the farming community has scarcely been more than a heartless, inadequate, cynical and overrated response to the horrific drought situation that has been plaguing eastern Australia in recent years. The way the government has handled it has been pathetic and, in some circumstances, cruel. It has totally ignored most farmers in New South Wales, and by most I mean about 96 per cent, who do not receive one cent of assistance despite the desperate need of many of them. There has not been a cent of assistance, for example, in the western parts of New South Wales that I represent. T-ere would be more grass on the carpet in thIS chamber than there is out in my area around towns like Coolabah, Tilpa and Collie. And people still could not qualify for exceptional circumstances assistance because of the stupid criteria that RASAC was supposed to look at to see if the local rural lands protection board qualified for exceptional circumstances. The previous speaker talked about that, but if the government really wanted to assist farmers it would make sure those criteria were sensible and common sense. Even those who received assistance got very little anyhow. What we are debating today-as welcome as it is-is only restoring part, and I emphasise part, of what this government took away in May 1983, within two months of getting into office. The farming community in Australia earns about 30 per cent of the export income of this country and brings billions of real dollars into Australia in export revenue, even though many, if not most, of those farming families have been earning negative incomes themselves in recent years. There is something upwards of 150,000 farmers in Australia. Each feeds and clothes, on average, about 100 Australians, as well as benefiting a lot of people overseas who buy their produce. The first response to this drought, which has been going on for years in many parts, was in September last year when the government brought in a $164 million package, spread over two years and most of it going into RAS grants. But before it acted, the government had to be dragged, kicking and screaming, into the drought assistance debate. In fact, I will go further and say that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was actually shamed before he acted at all. We had the Salvation Army in the country, we had the Smith Family and St Vincent de Paul, and we had Ray Martin raising money on television before the Prime Minister lifted a finger to help people. Even the people in the cities could see the desperate plight that rural Australia was in before the Prime Minister even acknowledged that there were difficulties out there. At first, he only made derogatory comments. He refused to inspect properties when he was invited to do so. But, thanks to his minders pressuring him, he has now made a visit--one visit-to a property or two in Queensland. While the minister has been to Queensland, to my knowledge he has still to visit western New South Wales where much of the drought is at the moment. Of course, that package in September was totally inadequate and, on 8 December last year, pressure built up and the government had to make another statement. It came out with a second package of $112 million over four years-I emphasise 'over four years'which means, of course, that most of that will not be available until the drought is over, when most will perhaps not need that assistpress ance. Those two packages together came $276 million. As welcome-and as belatedEnergy as that was, it pales into insignificance against the $620 million, in constant 1995 dollars, that the coalition gave in 1982-83. And that assistance was available to all farmers in drought areas who were in need, not just through this sort of fictitious, exceptional circumstances area lottery that we run now. An interest rate rise of one per cent is all that is required to wipe out $170 million of assistance to the farming community. Since this package was introduced last year, there have been three rises, amounting to 2.75 per cent. There will probably be another rise in the not too distant future. A one per cent rise in inflation will take $160 million out of the farming community. A one per cent rise in the exchange rate will wipe $160 million or $170 million off farm incomes. This situation exists at a time when the Prime Minister--off the top of his head, totally uncosted, consulting no-one-can offer $150 million to pull down a perfectly serviceable road, namely the Cahill Expressway in Sydney. Where are his priorities? This situation exists at a time when the government has also done nothing but put up fuel taxes. When the present Prime Minister became Treasurer, federal fuel tax was 6c a litre. Today it is approaching 35c a litre. The government has been ripping money out of country areas, yet when it puts a fraction of it back it expects to be praised. I certainly will not praise the government for that. Everybody on the government side seems to be ignorant of what is going on out there. Even the Treasurer (Mr Willis), a man for whom I have some regard, said that interest rate rises will not hurt farmers, because they are quarantined from the rises by interest rate subsidies. For heaven's sake, what a stupid and ignorant comment that was. Over 90 per cent of farmers in this country get no assistance whatsoever in that area. Those that do are usually exposed to rises, as their subsidies are locked in a year in advance. It is amazing to read the transcript of the conference that the Prime Minister and to the Minister for Primary Industries and (Senator Collins) held on 8 December 1994 when they announced the second tranche of that package. The Prime Minister has a reputation as the most loathed, detested and arrogant man this country has ever seen. At this press conference-and this was long before the Canberra by-election-referring to the package, he said: I think the first thing we want to say about this is that the Government regards this drought as probably the most serious ever. He has at least acknowledged that it is a very serious drought. He continued: I said at the election that we wouldn't be leaving any section of Australia behind and that included farming families. They are great words, indeed. I have no argument with that. But then the Prime Minister went on to say: · .. we have a critical situation on our hands ... particularly in the central west area of New South Wales. However, even though he put up charts on the screen with the central west of New South Wales coloured in, that area did not receive one cent of assistance that I can find in this package that he announced. The Prime Minister continued: But, we are guided by the thing that always guides us and that is if people are in trouble, no matter where they are or where they are from or who they vote for, let me say that, we are there to give them a hand. Great words indeed, but they are absolutely meaningless. He has not delivered on those words. Later in the press conference the minister, Senator Collins, said: · .. we have delivered to primary producers across Australia the most comprehensive and the best structured package of drought assistance that any government has ever delivered to primary producers in Australia. Talk about over the top! As I said, four per cent of New South Wales farmers will get something, but the rest will get nothing. Senator Collins went on to say: · . . we have worked hand in glove with all of the major farming organisations in Australia. This has been developed in full co-operation with them. In terms of the cooperation that the government had with, for example, the New South Wales Farmers Association, the biggest farming association in Australia, the association wanted things such as fodder assistance, but the government delivered nothing in that area. Later in the press conference, Senator Collins got even further carried away when he talked about the central west of New South Wales. He said that the assistance had been delivered. As I said, not a cent of assistance was received in that area. Senator Collins said that the central west of New South Wales has had massive structural problems. But he revealed his true ignorance when he said: I mean a lot of these places are ex-dairy farmers that are now running cattle and so on. For heaven's sake: you could count the number of dairy farmers in my area on the fingers of one hand! To say that it is full of ex-dairy farmers running cattle betrays the government's words for what they are. He further said: So farmers in this region will be able to go on farm household support in this whole region for 2 years now. What a total distortion. Then he summed up by stating: So, we have deliveredwhich he hasn'tfundamentally-on everything we have been asked to deliver, in terms of the major asks of the farming community, and as I said before, in doing so, and addressing the social needs of farmers in a difficult situation, this is the most comprehensive and best structured package of drought assistance that has ever been delivered. If words ever meant the opposite of what has been said, those would have to be the words. Absolutely believable indeed! The journos there fell for this hook, line and sinker. When question time came after this absolute charade, up jumped a journo and asked: Mr Keating, you have given an awful lot of money to a moba mob, mind youof people who will never vote for you, in a fairly tight fiscal situation as well-why? That is the mentality of members of the press in this country today. They fell for it hook, line and sinker. The Prime Minister got up and, amongst other things, said: . . . the Labor Party has always had that sense of society about looking after people in difficult circumstances when events have overtaken them through no fault of their own ... we are supporting those who have got viable farms with these tax arrangements ...",62
48,Mr LLOYD,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,What a hollow situation.,64
49,Mr COBB,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"A hollow situation; the total opposite of the truth. That is typical of what this Prime Minister is saying around this country. What this government has delivered in this area is an absolute disgrace. (turn to the bill itself. The details of the bill were announced in that press conference on 8 December, but the government did not tell anybody that it did not have any intention of bringing them in until the next financial year-after 1 July this year. So much pressure built up that, when the word got out that the coalition and the Democrats may do some deal to introduce this themselves, the government decided to bring it forward and backdate it to 24 March this year. That shows the real intentions of the government. I turn to some of the details of the bill. There is a 10 per cent investment allowance for fodder storage facilities, for buildings or structures used in the storage of grain, hay or fodder. In the area of water storage facilities, there is a 10 per cent investment allowance for dams, earth tanks, underground tanks or above-ground tanks used in storing water predominantly for stock. If people want to store water to irrigate pasture in order to cut and store some bales of hay for their stock, the 10 per cent investment allowance is not on. People cannot even use the allowance for the vehicular water tankers that they may wish to use to cart the water to their stock, they have to do from time to time. We must also not forget that this 10 per cent investment allowance is only of benefit to people who are paying tax. I put the question to the government: how many farmers these days would be paying tax? ABARE itself says that only 12 to 15 per cent of farmers at the top are making any money out of farming these days at all.",64
50,Mr LLOYD,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,The majority are on a minus income.,65
51,Mr COBB,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"A minus income. This measure, as welcome and small as it is, is of virtually no use to farmers at this time. Besides that, it has a cap of $5,000. Even if the more wealthy farmers wanted to buy a minimum tillage air seeder, for example, which could cost $130,000, they are entitled only to $5,000. Because of the cap of $5,000, they could not claim $13,000 on that alone. So it is very limited indeed. All the farm management bonds are doing is handing back to the farmers what was taken away in 1983. According to the government, the financial impact of restoring the farm management bonds to an acceptable level is going to be a cost of only $6 million to the government over the next four years-that is, $1 Y2 million a year. If you divide that by 150,000 farms, what do you come up with? It is $10 per farmer per year. Thank you very much, Mr Keating! With that we can go down to MCDonald's and buy one meal-very generous indeed. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and the Prime Minister say it is the most comprehensive package ever - elivered. 'What an absolute load of rubbish. At the very time all this is going on the drought continues in more than half of New South Wales, and it will probably go back towards 98 per cent unless it rains soon. However, there are some people out there with a little bit more compassion and sense of social justice than the Prime Minister has. Today I just want to mention one individual who I think should be honoured, and that is Jenny Butt who lives here in Canberra and who has an association with Delfast couriers. Jenny Butt has been taking-as she is continuing to do--food parcels generously as donated by the people of Canberra into my electorate and other electorates in New South Wales and Queensland and distributing them to the fanners. Just in one trip alone, she distributed six tonnes of food to 570 people. It is magnificent to think that there are people out there who realise the trouble that the farming community is in, even if the Prime Minister cannot. We have only to look at the Forbes Advocate. Here is a story on the front page of the 24 November 1994 edition. It reports the trip that Captains Jim and Jenny Ellem of the Salvation Army of Forbes did around the western part of my electorate. What did they find? The article states: The first family they visited was 200 kilometres from Bourke to a family who hadn't seen anyone for a number of months. ""The biggest shock to us was just how little people had-things such as food and so on. One family insisted we stay for dinner, and all they had was two potatoes between five people,"" Captain Ellem said. ""Some people can't even afford to drive to pick up their mail. They simply can't afford the fuel. Also people are on fairly strict rations because they can't afford the $4 fee the mail contractor charges to deliver food with the mail. It then shows a photograph with the accompanying caption: Captain Jenny Ellem with Don Cameron who owns a 77 thousand acre farm 135 kilometres north of Cobar. Like many other farmers, Mr Cameron has no livestock left alive on his property which has been affected by drought for the past six years. This is a typical story from my electorate. When the Prime Minister comes up with this measly package and says, 'It is the most comprehensive package of all time,' it makes you want to throw up, quite frankly. Thank heavens for people like Jenny Butt who are doing something about it. In the short time remaining, I would just like to read a few letters that she has received back from grateful people who have received these food parcels. One letter from Katherine Dakin of Nyngan reads: Dear Jenny Butt, You must be one of the most wonderful people that are walking on earth! It is a big step from wishing to help people to actually doing it and getting it organised. If someone could say that about the Prime Minister, perhaps he would not have lost that by-election on Saturday. Here is another one from Paul, Sarah and Tom Weston which states: Dear Jenny, Just a note to thank you and the C.WA. for the lovely box of goodies we received with our mail. It was a terrific surprise and we are most grateful to you for your efforts in helping drought-stricken families. We live approx. IIOkms S.W. of Nyngan in the Nymagee district. We have an 18 month old son and a baby due any day now so we are looking forward to Christmas with our little family. Here is one written by the children of the Ridley family from Girilambone, north of Nyngan: Dear Mrs Jenny Butt, Thankyou for the food parcels. We had lots of fun unpacking them. My sister and I shared the lollies and the school stuff. We fed our cats and dogs and my mum is using some of the food for tea. Thank you from The Ridley family. Another one from Daphne Robertson from Hermidale reads: Dear Jenny Thank you very much for your very generous food parcel . . . It is a shame that I couldn't read more of these letters.

52,Mr HORNE,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Paterson) (2.24 p.m.)Having listened to parts of the debate this morning on the Taxation Laws Amendment (Drought Relief Measures) Bill, it is no wonder that the National Party is not the major representative of rural Australia any more. It has allowed itself to be deceived into following political argument instead of the real argument. I guess it is quite happy to talk about the support that the New South Wales government has given those people in drought affected areas. It was extremely generous with its support to local government: 'You can go and borrow more. You can put it on the never-never. Don't worry about the interest because, when the drought breaks, you can just start to pay that back too.' They were the sorts of comments that came from your side of politics and that is the sort of thing that is abhorred by everyone because it does not resolve a single situation. It is a wonder thai the member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) did not quote the National Farmers Federation. Perhaps he did not see the press release it put out last Thursday, when this drought package was announced, which said: The National Farmers' Federation has welcomed the Federal Government's decision to bring forward taxation incentives contained in the drought preparedness package announced in December. NFF President, Mr Donald MCGauchie, said the decision was the direct result of representations from the NFF and is a significant win for farmers. I am quite happy to say that the National Farmers Federation is truly representative of members of the farming community of Australia and that statement indicates what they felt. That is the message that the government gets rather than the politically motivated, pseudo debate that has been taking place today. On this side of the House we are very proud of this package because it is one that has come about as a result of consultation with farming communities, with farmers and with all sorts of farming groups. It is one that resolves problems for the future. It was a commitment of this government to provide support for farmers, especially during a time of hardship. When the disastrous effects of the drought were at their height in rural Australia last year, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) announced the drought relief package, which indicated that there would be inducements to farmers to increase their sustainability. He also announced that these measures would be in the budget this year. As we know, the measures have been brought forward. They were announced last week and took effect from 23 March. They are innovative and are. welcomed by the farming community, as I have already indicated. Fortunately, this government-a Labor government-has delivered on these initiatives. This government recognises that the incentives had to be given-after all, drought is a factor in the Australian rural way of life. Farmers need encouragement and support to invest and to be prepared for drought. It is this government that is supporting the farming community with these amendments. The recent drought has shown us all just how devastating its effects can be. There have been children withdrawn from school, marriage breakdowns and suicides. The federal government in September last year addressed the seriousness of these issues with income support arrangements, but rural life must become continually sustainable-after all, that is a desirable situation. It is the continual sustainability of the rural sector that will allow the decentralisation of communities and will allow rural communities not only to exist but to grow. That, of course, is very desirable environmentalJy. There is a definite need for measures that enable farmers to prepare better for drought and so survive in the long term without undue hardship. Furthermore, it is simple incentives like these that help support all levels of the rural community in a positive way. These amendments will provide tax incentives in the form of a tax deduction to encourage primary producers to invest in drought mitigation property. This simple procedure will help support farmers when they really need it by providing a five-year, 10 per cent tax allowance for capital expenditure of up to $50,000 per year, per taxpayer, for essential measures: fodder storage facilities, for the storage of grain, hay or fodder; for livestock, drinking water storage facilities, including dams, earth tanks, underground tanks and above-ground tanks; all water transport facilities-if they can be moved around the primary producer's land-inclu<;ling bore reticulation, wells, pumps, and windmills. I do not see any harm in any of these incentives. I not only see them inducing the rural community to invest but also see a positive spin-off for Australian industry which manufactures these vital items which are necessary for the rural process to continue. Of course, it makes sense that these water storage and transport facilities should be in accordance with an approved water conservation plan. Unfortunately, we have seen, too late, the extent of bad water usage practices in many areas, particularly in the central west and southern New South Wales. Early settlers in those areas felt that all that was necessary was to clear the land, put water on it and use it. We are aware of the enormous loss of land not only for that generation but for many future generations because of the increase in salinity in those areas. These practices have been carefully thought out, as a result of consultation, and they will achieve the desired objectives. The purpose of including capital expenditure on minimum tillage equipment in the drought investment allowance is to encourage farmers to purchase such equipment which will make sure that both organic matter and moisture are preserved in the soil. This can greatly reduce the need for water and the effects of drought. There are four kinds of drought mitigation property to which the allowance applies and they are common sense measures. The most important aspect is that they are part of a long-term plan put into place by this government. With the net value of Australian farm production forecast to rise by 49 per cent to $3 billion in 1995-96, following an unfortunate 36 per cent fall in 1994-95, it is vital that we make the move towards sustainable farming. No-one can doubt the importance of the export farm industry to our national economy. This government certainly does not do that. Lower farm production has both upstream and downstream effects on the non-farm economy. Industries supplying goods and services to farms are affected by drought as well. That, of course, has been the tragedy. It is not only the farmers who are directly affected; all the service industries in areas have been disastrously affected over recent years. Retail turnover in regional towns and centres has been greatly affected and many family businesses may never recover from this disastrous drought. That is why farm organisations pressed the government for a comprehensive response to the drought. And that is what they got: a government that has listened; a government that has responded; a government that has delivered. I read a recent release from the National Farmers Federation. It is one that I quoted from earlier. It is about the government's decision to bring forward the taxation incentives, and it is most welcome. The President of the National Farmers Federation, Mr Don MCGauchie, said that he was particularly pleased that the farmers of Australia are being given a unique opportunity to participate in drought preparedness. Drought preparedness will serve the future farming community. By making farming sustainable, these practices will also safeguard the environment-and that too, surely, is most desirable. We all know that the continual working of rural areas-the ploughing of paddocks and the growth of crops-is not sustainable year after year. We know that new techniques have to be brought in. We know that we have to move towards sustainable practice, which is what we are encouraging. One of the speakers said that no assistance has been given to the central west of South Wales. That is a load of garbage. Rural assistance measures have been available to these people all along. There have been some problems in central New South Wales via the state government not being prepared to parencourage ticipate in the rural assistance scheme. Central New South Wales was identified as an area where it was not so much the drought that was the problem but the structure of the farms themselves. In the central west and the upper· Hunter the major problem is that the average landowner does not own enough area to have a sustainable farm. Government assistance is available in these areas for restructuring and relocation-surely something that is in the long-term interests of farming communities and those families that all rural have been so disastrously affected. In my own area of the lower Hunter, dairying was once the staple primary industry. In many such areas there are now no dairy farms at all because the old 60-cow, 100-acre dairy farm is no longer a viable unit. Instead, the dairy industry has moved to the central west where much larger herds are milked and larger properties and irrigation are used. That is simply an economic factor that has come into primary production. The drought is not to blame for the fact that those small holdings cannot sustain a family in what was a traditional system. On a different matter, the other day I was listening to someone talking about the fact that dairy farmers have asked for a price increase in milk. I thought it was very interesting to compare the price of a litre of milk with a litre of Coca-Cola. When you think that a litre of milk is cheaper than a litre of Coca-Cola, you realise how fine the margins must be in those primary industries and how difficult it must be for those people to make a living. That is just an aside, but those are the sorts of changes that are taking place in our rural industry. It is all very well for opposition members to come in and berate the government, but the structural organisation of our - ural communities is something that has to change and efficiencies of our rural communities have to be reorganised, as they will be. These amendNew ments will help the farmers who want to continue in farming to make the investment and help the farmers who want to get out and do something else, which is what this governmenthas sought to do. We have not sought to farmers to stay on the farms when, in one year in 10, they may make a profit. Honourable members opposite know that that is one of the current problems with the farming community. Members of the opposition have encouraged the rural community in the past. They have been of the belief that one could keep chopping up the blocks, have smaller farms and still make a profit. They know that, when we have a drought like this one, everyone goes to the wall, whereas with larger properties, fodder and water in reserves, people will survive. I dare say the opposition would put forward that the government should have been providing everything for everyone in every rural community. We could have a look at its record and see what it did. Perhaps those opposite would like to talk about that. They know down inside, if they are fair dinkum, that what the National Farmers Federation has said is exactly right-this is an excellent process the government has entered into and it is worthwhile. Let me simply conclude by reading what Mr MCGauchie said: I am particularly pleased that the five year, 10 cent drought investment allowance will come into effect from midnight tonight ... That was last Thursday. He said: The Government also has agreed to expedite legislation so that changes to Farm Management Bonds can be quickly introduced. We expect this will occur in time for the new arrangements to apply this financial year. I am quite happy to allow the National Farmers Federation to be the spokesperson for the farming community. By its performance today, there is no doubt that the National Party of Australia has certainly shown it has lost contact with the needs of the farming community and farmers' desires and that it is no longer capable of speaking out for them.",66
53,Mr TUCKEY,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"O'Connor) (2.42 p.m.)The honourable member for Paterson (Mr Horne) suggested that we should have a look at the record of the Liberal Party and the coalition when last in government. In speaking to the Taxation Laws Amendment (Drought Relief Measures) Bill, might I say that, if the previous leader, Mr Hawke, were here, I am sure the honourable member would express his gratitude for that policy. In the context of the issues today, namely drought and drought assistance measures, we can look very clearly at what Malcolm Fraser as the then Prime Minister did when he introduced a substantial drought relief package that was primarily targeted towards the retention of breeding stock. As I remember, that was a package for which he allocated about $400 million, and it included fodder subsidies so that people could retain their breeding stock on ·their properties. The result was, shortly after the 1983 election when the rain started to fall, that there was an immediate recovery in the fortunes of the farming community that reflected on the economy, as it always does. Of course, the drought just 10 or 12 years ago was a substantial contributor to the coalition parties losing government. Because of the policies that we implemented at that time which, as the honourable member for Paterson says, have been criticised by the National Farmers Federation, the immediate per ability of the farming communities to recover under those arrangements guaranteed that the then new Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, could strut around Australia saying what a good economic manager he was. They are the realities of that particular period, and this is still one of the grave criticisms I have both of the government and of the econocrats who now occupy the NFF compared with the farmers who used to have a fair idea of what was necessary for farming. That is where they are both wrong. The coalition, notwithstanding the criticism of the NFF econocrats, is of the view that, in the current circumstances, because of the removal by this government of measures such as IEDs back in 1985, there was just nothing left for the farming communiry to do to insulate itself from drought. As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said, these droughts are highly predictable. If you look at the bar graph for weather conditions in western New South Wales and southern Queensland, you will see that a major drought occurs almost exactly every 10 years. In between there can be some very good seasons and some very good prices. Measures are required to allow farmers to retain sufficient of the proceeds of those good years to protect themselves, without government help, against the bad years. There are measures within this legislation that set out to do just that. The problem with them is that they are being implemented at a time when farmers have no income to put aside. We need to· look at history in that respect. The member for Paterson scurried out as soon as he had finished his few words, but he challenged us to establish the procedures we had adopted in the past. We were the inventers of the income equalisation deposit. While even they were a little too restrictive their application, at least we recognised that it was absolutely necessary for farmers to be able to put away funds, free of taxation, in the good years so that they would have what you might call a haystack of money in the bad years. Taxation is the fundamental issue in all of this. Mr Farley of the NFF said that, if there had to be tax increases, he was disposed towards a super tax. He was probably thinking, from his insulated position, that farmers never got around to having high incomes and paying tax on them. They do, and that is the problem with their industry. Income-wise, they are either up among the gods or down in the depths. In those few years when they get good income they are subject to high levels of taxation. That means that at the very time when they are having to pay back debts or should be putting away funds against future drought and bad prices the tax man is there rake it off. The solution is IEDs, or farm management bonds, as implemented earlier by a coalition government. But this government found a minor tax rort. No-one denies the existence of that tax rort but we ask the government it is throwing the baby out with the bath water. We put up an amendment to overcome the problem of the rort. A person who was very active in pursuing this matter is ex-Senator Walsh, a former Minister for Finance. He now admits publicly that he made a grave mistake; there were measures that could have been implemented to overcome the tax rorts while maintaining the lED facility. Between 1985 and the present there have been some particularly good income years for farmers. We had the wool boom that ended up in the wool crash. Farmers were receiving very high levels of income but what did they do with it? They contributed to the government's budget surplus by paying extremely high taxation. They had very little left over and when they were hit by this 10-year cycle of drought they had no reserves because in the period when they had high incomes there was no lED facility. But-surprise, surpriseas soon as they have enough money to lodge in an lED or farm management bond, the in government rushes in and reinstates that arrangement. What is more, it was reinstated in a system that was practically unusable. We are only just arriving at providing a facility in this area that would have some use. I do not think this goes far enough. Again, it is a sort of proposal that does not take account of reality. I have made a note: there are none so blind as those who will not see. These measures are aimed to give people tax deductions when they have no taxable income; to give them the chance to put money away tax free in these special bonds at a time when they have no money to put away. They are absolutely of no' benefit or assistance to farmers at this time who are suffering from drought. Some farmers in my electorate who have enjoyed better seasons may get some advantage from them. So it is too little, too late. Of course, the same applies with these investment allowanto ces, which are a pittance anyway. I do not think they are the right way to go. Investment allowances were introduced by the Fraser government and, whilst they were a great means of reducing one's income, they eventually involved farmers in very substantial longwhy term expenditure commitments, which some of them regretted because as the years went by and they ran into drought they were still trying to pay off the machinery that they had at the time purchased to avoid tax. They also had a very substantial effect on the small business machinery dealers which found that their second-hand equipment became unsaleable. Everybody wanted to trade in their equipment for new equipment to get these investment allowances, and nobody wanted to buy the second-hand equipment that was traded in. It was a distortion, and I do not think it was very successful. I hold to the position that' an adequate and sensible lED system-r a farm management bond system or whatever it might be calledshould be the single long-term arrangementto allow farmers to equalise their income and self-insl,lre. If there were a reasonable transition period, I would be quite happy to· tell my constituency, which is the largest farming constituency in Australia, that that should be its sole method of support. In other words, once we had created the proper environment, the farmers should not come running to the government for assistance every time. But, even though these proposals do make the arrangement better, they ignore a lot of factors. We. suddenly have a ceiling of $150,000 as the amount of money that can be put into farm management bonds. For many that amount would be beyond their ability to afford; for some it would not be nearly enough. The ceiling should be a multiple of farm operating costs for an enterprise. If it costs a farmer $20,000 a year to run his farm, it might be that he is allowed to bank up to $60,000, being three years of farming costs. For a large farm enterprise spending $1 million a year on farm operating costs, clearly $150,000 in the bank would not do much, and sUc:h an enterprise should be able to put away a sum of money more relevant to the operating costs of the farm. That is the first point. The second point is to recognise the very disastrous levels of debt that apply in so many farming. enterprises for which the banks are demanding repayment. Under our current arrangements every dollar repaid is subject to in-ome tax. So the farmer· tries to pay back the money, but of course the tax man wants 30 or 40 per cent of it, and the farmer is in an ever inc:reasing debt spiral because, before he gets' 'rid' of the last drought debt, he is into another drought. That can only be overcome if we get away from the very restrictive arrangements as to where people can put this lED money. Banks are pretty honourable institutions and I cannot see that it is beyonci the wit of this parliament to be able to bring down some rules allowing farmers to create an lED scheme with their regular financial institutions. In that way a farmer who has just had a good year after accumulating debts over, say, the two pr-vi­ ous years could go along to his bank and say, 'I cannot pay you back that money because of the tax implications. But I can create an lED in your bank and that will certainly, from a security point of view, offset that debt.' From my experience, banks will take an interest differential on that. They will not give the farmer as much interest on his lED money as they are charging on the loan, but the farmer would still be better off and he could do that in the first year. It is no good suggesting that he has to pay back all his money with taxed money and then somehow be able to create IEDs. He cannot do both. You need a system where he can do both. The second component of a sensible lED system is the right to create that lED under whatever rules-and the banks would become party to that arrangement-that were applicable to make sure that it was properly done so the farmer could create an lED in the financial institution where he is otherwise doing business, be it at a stock firm or a bank. When that is done, I believe that over time-that is, two or three years of farm operating costs-the farmer should have the right to earn reasonable commercial interest and accumulate that up to the ceiling. Having the right to create such an lED with a financial institution would mean that over time it would be quite proper for government to do away with the RAS, income averaging and a lot of the other peripheral schemes that are available to farmers that bring them very little benefit. It is necessary that the government sit down and recognises the long-term need for this arrangement. To a degree, some similar arrangement is necessary for the small business operators who live in those towns associated with rural activity and who in fact provide services to the rural industry. They are usually the ones who suffer even more. A farmer may have some limited reserves but the day he looks at the rain gauge and sees that the appropriate amount of rain has not fallen he quite sensibly-and he certainly cannot be blamed for it-gets out the chequebook and puts a staple through it. He simply does not open it up. He might have been contemplating a major service on one of his tractors, he might have been contemplating replacing it; he just makes the decision that this is not the year to do that. That action impacts immediately on the small business machinery dealer and the people who provide many services. In this day and age some of those who provide a service might not even live in the drought declared area, because there has been a centralisation of those sorts of services. We have to recognise where these people are .and say that possibly they too need some lED facility whereby they can put away some money in those good seasons to carry them and, I underline, their staff through the less prosperous times· when farmers, because of their financial circumstances, are not spending. It is a very important component of this whole matter. In the last couple of minutes, I will talk about the 10 per cent tax deductions-they are not even tax rebates-for the construction. of fodder and water storage facilities. there is nothing wrong with doing that, there is no great benefit. Firstly, as I have pointed out, most farmers at the moment do not have the sort of surplus capital to build them, and I doubt they will build them for a measly per cent tax deduction when in fact they have no taxable income because of their drought circumstances. They are all of minimum assistance. In fact, the best form of water and fodder storage is money in the bank. You can always buy what you need if you have that. That is why I hold strongly to the principle that the lED is the solution. It should be the solution over timeand I underline 'over time'-because you now have to have a transition, which is the one and only means of recognising the very special circumstances of farming in terms of seasonal and cyclical activity. Because it was this government that withyour drew that facility at the very time it would have been of a long-term benefit, it has no choice but to give direct assistance until this particular drought is over and these sorts of measures can have time. to work. They are long-term measures, not short-term measures, and will certainly have no benefit whatsoever to the rural industry that is .currently so drought affected. I conclude my remarks on that point.",69

56,Mr HOWARD,PARLIAMENT,"On indulgence, Mr Acting Speaker; this matter relates to your position as Acting Speaker. Were you present at the meeting of the federal parliamentary Labor Party yesterday? Did you hear the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) say that you and the Speaker should eject more parliamentarians? Were you told that you were partly to blame for the Prime Minister's poor image? Were you also told that the televising of the Prime Minister in full flight is part of the government's problem? Have you been told that you are failing to run the parliament like a professional organisation? Has the Prime Minister applied any pressure to you? Can you give a categorical assurance that you will discharge responsibilities without being subject to any kind of pressure from the Prime Minister?",72
57,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,PARLIAMENT,"Order! It is my normal practice not to discuss matters, as member of caucus, that go on in caucus. I make that statement as an individual member of the parliamentary Labor Party. As to the matters that the honourable member has gone to, from time to time Speakers, Acting Speakstanding ers and others who act as presiding officers are offered advice from both sides of the which says: chamber. The value of that advice is something that we take on board, but I recollect saying on the occasion of being elected Deputy Speaker that I would endeavour carry out the duties of this position with the greatest deal of impartiality I could muster. Whether I am able to do that perhaps will be light. judged in the eye of the beholder; but I will endeavour to carry out my duties in this office as has been the tradition since federation. NA",73
58,Mr REITH,PRIVILEGE,"On the basis of that response, I wish to raise a matter of privilege understanding order 95. Given, it seems, your effective confirmation of both your attendance in caucus yesterday and the remarks that have been attributed to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), I put it to you, Mr Acting Speaker, that the Prime Minister is reported as having said of the Speaker and of you, amongst other things, that you were incapable of properly running question time.",73
59,Mr BEAZLEY,PRIVILEGE,Rubbish.,73
60,Mr REITH,PRIVILEGE,"I would be happy to go to the quotes; and I will in a moment. It seems to me that these remarks are clearly intended to intimidate both the Speaker and you in the performance of your duties. The Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987, section 4, is relevant in this matter. It states: Conduct (including the use of words) does not constitute an offence against a House unless it amounts, or is intended or is likely to amount, to an improper interference with the free exercise by a House or committee of its authority or functions, or with the free performance by a member of a member's duties as a member. I put it to you, Mr Acting Speaker, that there is a prima facie case which ought to be the subject of your consideration. I therefore ask you to give the matter consideration with a view to giving precedence understanding a order 96 to a motion to refer the matter to the Standing Committee of Privileges. In accord':' ance with standing order 97, which requires me to produce the examples of the reports, I do so. In particular, also in accordance with order 97, I refer to the Herald Sun on page 1 and, in particular, to the quote During the meeting Mr Keating took a swipe at the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Mr Stephen Martin, suggesting Parliament had been to allowed to become too noisy. He said this meant he had to shout to be heard and as a result TV footage painted him in a bad It goes on. Also under the standing orders, I refer you to page 1 of the Sydney Morning of Speakers Herald, which states: He also took the extraordinary step yesterday of blaming the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Mr Martin-another NSW Right member for contributing to his poor public image by failing to control the Parliament. Under that same standing order, I refer you to page 2 of the Australian, which states: When NSW backbencher Mr Bob Home reflected that it was a pity voters were not privy to such a measured analysis, Mr Keating made a strong attack on the Speaker of the HouseofRepresentatives, Mr Martin, saying the amount of noise in the Parliament was forcing him to shout to be heard, and contributing to his image problem. I also refer you to the AAP report, Mr Acting Speaker. Lastly, I refer you to the detailed coverage on page 2 of the Sydney Morning Herald which purports to be a direct quotation. It says: The real problem is that it is not run like a professional organisation by the Speaker and Deputy Speaker. That is a statement attributed by the Sydney Morning Herald directly to the Prime Minister. The article also states: The refusal of the Speaker to exercise authority by ejecting rowdy MPs had led to unacceptable noise levels, forcing the Prime Minister to raise his voice. Tut, tut! It continues: Mr Keating said the Speaker should suspend more MPs for unruly behaviour but the occupants of the chair were loath to do so. Throughout today's press there are very clear and. concise statements of the Prime Minister's remarks in the caucus yesterday which I put to you-and it is my submission to you-provides ample basis upon which you ought to take this matter for further consideration to see whether or not there has been a breach of section 4 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act. The last matter I put to you in support of raising this matter is to say that Prime Minister is well known for his record of attempting to intimidate members.",73
61,Mr BEAZLEY,PRIVILEGE,"Mr Acting Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The honourable member has gone beyond the point of a request to you for a consideration of this matter to a point now of debate as to whether or not this is a matter that ought to be considered for reference to a committee. He is now anticipating that debate. He has gone through the process of putting forward the matters he wants for your consideration, and there the matter ought to end.",74

NA Guard of Honour",74
73,Mr RICHARD EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"-My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Defence. Is it true that the Prime Minister was so impressed with the pomp and circumstance of guards of honour overseas that his own department and the defence department considered giving him one of his own? Is that because the old guard like Graham Richardson has deserted him? Is it to fight a rearguard action against his backbenchers? Is it because he does not think he is getting enough protection from the Speaker, or is it just another method of protecting him from the real anger of the Australian people? Minister, will the Prime Minister ask Priscilla designer and Oscar winner Lizzie Gardiner to design the guards' new uniforms? Will their badge contain the new Keating crest of the mortgage grindstone and a clock that keeps part time? Will the Prime Minister donate one of his former pigs as a mascot? Minister",74

75,Mr RICHARD EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,-Doesn't all this the ironical content just go to prove that in real world the Prime Minister is considered out of touch joke?,75

77,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Acting Speaker Mr Tim Fischer- Mr Acting Speaker, on a point of order: the roster points to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs as representing the Minister for Defence. Therefore, I invite him to answer the question.",75
78,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of particularly the House has come forward to answer the question.,75
79,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will answer the question. The answer is this: the reason why the Prime Minister had occasion to have discussions via his officials with the Minister for Defence at the time was simply that in my home state, which is your home· state, and in the Northern Territory and Queensland this government has taken decisions over time to shift armed forces out of the south-eastern corners of the country to the areas where sensible defence strategy would say they ought to be. When asked in the Senate today the Minister for Defence explained the posity tion. You could have had that information simply by referring to the answer he gave. As far as Canberra is concerned, we have sought to place our defence forces in areas where they ought to be but where they were not concentrated when the dear old Liberal Party was in office for so long. Mr Bilney-You had them all down in Victoria.",75
80,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,They had them all stuck put down in Victoria-the bastion that they had decided to defend in their modern versionhave Mr Downer-What about the Darwin in patrol boat base?,75
81,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Mayo says, 'What about the Darwin patrol boat base?' Well, thank you. That was the Liberal Party's version of where the defence forces of country ought to be: we will keep all of the them in Puckapunyal and around the country, an with the patrol boat base in Darwin. Well done. We decided to shift the business end of forces to the areas of the country where the business end of our defence forces ought to be. That meant that there was not the same sort of operation as perhaps was available in the past in the performance of the task of honouring visits of heads of state to this country. That caused the Prime Minister to have some interest in this matter. Of course, nothing proceeded. This· question was raised in relation to the provision of materials for the VIP fleet, as far as the 707 configurations are concerned. The resources available in that area are to be put into hush kits to ensure that that fleet is capable of operating in a more environmentally sensitive environment now at airports around the country, including the one at Perth. That is where resources are going. That VIP fleet and those 707 aircraft were purchased by-guess who? Higher Education",75
82,Mr LES SCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Is the Minister for Employment, Education and Training aware a of reports that students are concerned about possible cuts to the higher education sector and the introduction of fees for their universicourses? What are the government's intentions on this matter? Have the students cause for concern?",75
83,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am aware of the concerns that have been expressed, and in my belief from us they have no cause for concern. Let me state for the record what our commitment has been to funding and to supporting the higher education sector. Since this government came to power, we have expanded by 65 per cent in real terms the amount of money into universities, from $3 billion to $5 billion in constant prices. Student numbers gone up from 350,000 to 600,000. Not only have we delivered on a massive growth the higher education sector; we are committed to supporting more growth in the system in the forthcoming budget. So far as fees are concerned, which was another point of their concern, we have guaranteed that there will be no up-front fees for undergraduate courses. It is true that we have allowed some flexibility to the universities in relation to postgraduate courses. Whilst we indicated at the last Labor Party conference that we would reaffirm our commitment to no up-front fees for undergraduates, we did say that we were not going to change the policy in relation postgraduates but that we were concerned million about how it was being administered and that we would commission a report to tell us how that was going. For the record, 85 per cent of aircraft. postgraduate places are HECS liable. In other words, there are no up-front fees for these people in postgraduate places either. As far as the other concern that has been expressed-that is, the notion that universities Itare getting around this policy prescription of the 707ours by a· backdoor method-I am aware of will recent reports of concerns about a bachelor of aviation course. being submitted for approval by the University of Western Sydney. That with Australia. course, and the consequent approval that be required for it, has not come to me yet. is with the department. I have sought legal advice on it. But I give the House this assurthe ance: if that course breaches both the spirit and the letter of the legislation, then I will support it. As to those concerns as r understand them having been expressed in the most recent days of protest, I do not believe the students have cause for concern in relation to where this government has stood and will stand on university access and equity principles. They would have cause for concern if the Liberals were to be elected. At the last election they went with the policy that proposed up-front fees and vouchers. They have also, in various state guises, introduced legislation to gut student unions. We have taken measures to ensure that that legislation does not have impact. When the students have to make choice as to which party will represent their interests at the next election, they will have very clear distinction between what we have done and what we are promising versus what the other side would introduce. VIP Fleet",75
84,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, partly relating to his portfolio and in his capacity as the designated minister representing the Minister for Defence on the roster today. Can the minister explain the anomaly whereby the Prime Minister in a press release of today said: to No RAAF VIP fleet Boeing 707 has had a $14 refit, nor is any $14 million refit underway . .. I have in fact specifically ruled out the construction of a permanent VIP suite in the Is the minister aware that, on 15 November last year in Senate estimates hearings, in reply to a question from Senator Newman, Air Marshal Fisher-no relation-said: be fitted with a permanent VIP suite, hush kitted engines and a satellite communication system to provide a continuous voice and facsimile contact . may Air Marshal Fisher also confirmed that the It cost of this refurbishment would be between $11 and $14 million. What happened to make Prime Minister change his mind about his 707 aircraft? Was it the Canberra by-election not roar or the caucus roar about his intolerable arrogance and general demeanour?",76
85,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I pointed out, my remarks on the VIP fleet were anticipated so that I could answer the two questions in one. r might say that this 707 fleet, to which you refer and which you are attempting to get some capital out of, was originally purchased by the Liberal Party-and a useless old thing it was with them too. The difference between the Liberal Party and ourselves is that we gave those aircraft a military purpose. We the refitted them for in-flight refuelling. So those 707 aircraft now perform a serious an defence function rather than flitting the old a Malcolm around the globe, which was the original purpose of the acquisition of those a 707 aircraft. But for them to continue either to perform a military function in terms of the transport of troops or in terms of inflight refuelling or to be occasionally used for transporting VIPs around the country, for occasionally taking the Prime Minister overseas and for even transporting the odd opposition leader during the course of an election campaign, they will have to operate within acceptable noise standards. Therefore, they will need to be hush kitted. The advice to me is that the amounts of money to be spent on those aircraft will be set aside for the refurbishment to hush kit the entire 707 fleet. Pensions",76
86,Mr NEWELL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Social Security. How do Australia's pension levels compare with the level of pensions paid in other countries? What would be the impact on the social security system of a universal pension? Is it the intention of the government to introduce a universal pension? Table 5.4: Minimum Benefits Australia Belgium Canada France Germany Italyl Luxembourg Netherlands Sweden United Kingdom United States Austria Denmark Finland Iceland Ireland Norway Spain Switzerland New Zealand,77
87,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. Australia has one of the most efficiently targeted social security systems in the world. That includes having an efficiently targeted pension system, with pensions targeted on the basis of need. Because of this, we can afford to pay one of the highest rates of base pension in the world. In fact, in 1991 the real value of Australia's pension for those who have no other income was 43 per cent above the minimum rate paid in Germany; 40 per cent above the basic rate paid in Switzerland; 33 per cent above the basic rate paid in both the United States and the Uniteq Kingdom; 19 per cent above the base pension in Italy; 17 per cent above the pension rate in Sweden; 12 per cent above the base pension in France; and seven per cent above the pension in New Zealand. I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard a table that elaborates on that. Leave granted. The table read as followsfor Single Older People, in $US, 1991 Level in $US (PPPs) Index of level Components 6834 133 Age pension 6330 123 Old age pension 7344 143 Old age security, guaranteed income supplement 6131 119 Retirement pension and social assistance 4813 93 Social assistance 5770 112 Contributory pension 11621 226 Revenue Minimum Garanti 7380 143 National Assistance 5861 114 Old age pension, housing allowance 5150 100 Retirement pension, income related benefits 5160 100 SSI, Food Stamps 6518 127 Social assistance 6545 127 Old age pension 4647 90 National pension 7520 146 Old age pension 4727 92 Non-contributory pension 6067 118 Old age pension 3661 71 Non-contributory pension 4897 95 Old age pension, means-tested allowance 6406 124 National superannuation",77
88,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The government is continuing to work to develop a retirement income system with three essential legs: the basic pension as the floor under the structure, increasingly supplemented by occupational superannuation, and private savings, which includes people's investment in their own housing. Since this government came to office we have increased the pension by 14 per cent against the CPI. We have heard proposals for a so-called universal pension; that is, a pension paid without any means testing whatsoever. The cost of removing all means testing on the pension would be around $5 billion per annum. The opposition knows as well as anybody that that is not a viable proposition now, and it certainly would not be a viable proposition as our population ages. The reality is that no government of any persuasion is going to go down that route ... However, that does not seem to deter the opposition spokesman on social security from continuing to imply that such a thing is feasible. As recently as last week, he made a statement implying that 'studies show that it can be done without extra cost to the taxpayer or reduced benefits'. What a piece of nonsense that is! How on earth do you pay pensions to everybody without a reduced rate and without increasing taxation or revenue raisirig somehow or other? Anybody can see that that is a load of nonsense. The riearest thing to a proposal that makes any sort of sense is the proposal from the Institute of Actuaries. However, the proposal of the Institute of Actuaries implied, firstly, substantially cutting superannuation tax concessions-how is that going to avoid impacting on taxpayers?-and, secondly, cutting the base pension rate by $7 per week. Thegoverriment's retirement income modelling task force has shown that this analysis is wrong and that you would have to cut the pension by a lot more to offset the $5 billion annual cost of a universal pension. The notion of a universal pension is just absolute rot. It is about time the Leader of the Opposition, if he wants to be taken seriously and to have his propositions about cuts in the fiscal deficit and cuts in outlays taken seriousleaders ly, started to rein in the utterances of people like the spokesman on social security and the Leader of the National Party, who go around implying that they are going to deliver promises worth billions of dollars which they know full well could not possibly be delivered. Interest Rates",78
89,Mr CHARLES,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. Yesterday the Prime Minister told Melbourne 3A W radio listeners that last year's three interest rate rises protected people's jobs in the long term. Do you honestly believe that the 800,000 or so who are still unemployed believe that further interest rate rises will help them find a job? Or do you rather believe that crunching the economy once again with rising interest rates is likely to result in millions of Australians who have home mortgages crunching this failed ALP government at the next federal election in the same manner that Canberra residents crunched the ALP last Saturday?",78

103,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I think it is true to say that, in isolation, no-one in this community likes interest rate rises. But I think that community is mature enough to know that, in an economy where expenditure is growing faster than production, therefore putting further pressure on our balance of payments, certain steps are needed to slow that growth in expenditure. The trick for us, of course, is to ensure that that slowing exerCise is not at the expense of the jobs about which you expressed such mock concern. If you are really concerned to understand what this government stands for in terms of its job creation activity, look at the record. This government went to the election promising 500,000 jobs in three years. Result: 560,000 in two years. In the last year alone, there was 3% per cent growth-faster than any country in the world and close. to the fastest on record for this nation. Importantly, we have achieved that record employment growth with low inflation. At the same time we have ensured that, this time around in the economic cycle, we will not let the long-term unemployed slip through the net. We will have measures that ensure that they are picked up, that youth who have been passed by are picked up. Let me indicate for the record what has been achieved in the last 12 months. We have seen the levels of unemployment fall by 12 per cent across the board. The levels for the long-term unemployed have fallen by close to 20 per cent and, for the people in the' age bracket 15 to 19, they have fallen by 16 per cent. So this is a recovery for all. We are seeing the fruits of sustained economic growth translating into jobs. We are making sure through targeted measures that those jobs are available to people who would otherwise be left behind. With regard to interest rates, the whole emphasis of this governmenfs policy in terms of the forthcoming budget is to produce a budget that demonstrates fiscal disCipline, addressing the savings issue which is behind the balance of payments and .ensuring. that pressure is taken off monetary policy as the means by which We solve it. I make one final point: if the problem for us is our balance of payments, if we must get the savings up in this 'nation, the single most important factor that is going to drive savings is the level of unemployment. HistoricaIly,' the correlation between unemployment' and savings to GDP is very marked. If what we achieve is our white paper targets of below five per cent unemployment, we will restore a savings to GDP ratio which is better than that of the OECD and' approaching that of most of the Asian tigers. If,.at the ·same time, we deliver superannuation and its extension, we will expand that capacity. We have a strategy for jobs. The budget will demonstrate that, on the back of that strategy for jobs, we have also got a strategy for the current account. That is what we will be returned to office on next time we stand. Endorsed Suppliers",79
104,Mr DODD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Administrative Services. Minister, I refer to your recent announcement of the first 10 companies to be awarded endorsed supplier status. What benefits will flow to individual companies and the economy as a whole from this initiative?",80
105,Mr WALKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Leichhardt for raising yet another Working Nation initiative. Being an endorsed supplier means that a company has passed very strict government tests in areas such as quality control, financial viability, standards, service and industry development. Accrediting endorsed suppliers has been widely welcomed by private industry, not only because it increases the standing of companies domestically, especially home-grown ones, but also because it significantly increases their ability to break into lucrative markets in South-East Asia. The first contracts to which the scheme will apply are now being let, and last Friday I was very pleased to present certificates to the first 10 companies to be admitted as endorsed suppliers. I am proud that four of those companies are home-grown Australian companies: Australian Technology Resources ACT Pty Ltd, Computer Power Group, IPL Datron Pty Ltd, and Voca Communications Pty Ltd. They were able to hold their heads high with multinational greats such as Kodak, Panasonic, Fuji-Xerox and Cannon. Being an endorsed supplier will mean that these _home-grown companies will have a better opportunity to break into the South-East Asian market and earn export dollars for Australia. The benefit of being an endorsed supplier is twofold: it means that the company has demonstrated commitment to world's best practice in quality, standards of service and long-term value adding activity in Australia, having a government endorsement of the company standing gives it an edge to break into overseas markets; and, secondly, it also means that the company gets an advantage as a supplier to the federal government because only endorsed suppliers are now permitted to tender for places on my department's common use contracts for information technology and major office machines. It must also be said that a company does not have to be big to be an endorsed supplier. This program is aimed at helping small and medium enterprises as well. For example: ATR has 150 employees and a revenue of around $12 million a year; IPL Datron has 170 employees and a revenue of about $30 million; Voca Communications has only 62 employees and a revenue of around $13 million; and Computer Power, because of a wide range of service activities, is much larger of course with about 2,000 employees and a revenue of $200 million. My department currently has more than 200 applications for endorsement and each one is being assessed jointly with the Department of Industry, Science and Technology. I know that in the coming weeks we will see many more home-grown Australian companies becoming endorsed suppliers. I hope they will use that endorsement to build up their business as an exporter of Australian expertise and excellence. Interest Rates  the Minister for Finance. Minister, I remind you of your comment in September 1994 when you said, and I quote: ... there is not necessarily a direct connection between any particular level of deficit at any point in time and short term interest rates. Minister, how do you reconcile this with recent comments by the Prime Minister that a tight budget will take pressure off interest rates? Minister, who is wrong-you or the Prime Minister? Or is it simply the case that the government has no fiscal policy and simply lurches from one view to the next, depending on the prevailing political circumstances? Mr BEAZLEy-It is the case that you have no fiscal policy. You're the one who invited your team to a deficit reduction party and nobody turned up. That was you! Nobody came forward with any suggested cuts of the $5 billion to $10 billion you were seeking. You said, 'I suppose it all gets a bit political, so I am not surprised they didn't come to the party.' That is your position. That is where your credibility is. Added to your lack of credibility on that subject is the lack of credibility of you on the budget cuts that have been put forward the last couple of years. Where there has been a requirement for legislative action, you have turned down every one---every one! And you are threatening to turn them all down again next time. As you ought to know, as I am sure that you do as opposed to your shadow Treasury spokesman, there are a multiplicity of influences on any particular level of interest rates at any point of time. One of the factors involved is fiscal policy; there is no question about that at all. The entire presentation of the government, both in terms of starting the deficit reduction program and in the announcements made by the Treasurer earlier in the year, was to point out that we considered that we ought to develop fiscal policy in such a way that contributed to, among other things, a downward pressure on interest rates. Mr Downer-But you said there was no connection.",80
106,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is no automatic connection; there is an influence. That is a simple fact. I do realise that this requires some explanation for the honourable member for Mayo. I accept that the honourable member for Mayo needs a bit of an explanation on this. I am sorry, but we in this House have neither the time nor the inclination to give it to you. But I am sure I can send you a couple of good references to read. The concern in the public mind is not so much the particular level of interest rates we now experience but some fears of where they may go as a result of past experience. If you take a look at the interest rate regime which they experienced when you were in office, you will see that in the last three years of the treasurership of the Leader of the Opposition mortgage rates never fell below where they are now. When we obtained office the rate was about 13 Y2 per cent, operating up to the cap that was then in place. Out there in the building societies it was operating at about 15 per cent. The 90-day rate had gone to 21.6 per cent, the highest that it has been in the living memory of all members in this chamber. The prime rate in 1983 was 16 per cent.  of the entirety on 4 Decembe'r 1989? Mr Acting SP,EAKER-'---{)rder! The honourable member for Forrest!",81
107,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Those who do comparisons between the prime rates in various countries, which is a figure we would not use-the reason we do not use the prime rate figure is that it means different things in different countries-if you wanted to compare apples with apples, I suppose could compare the prime rate now with the prime rate at the time we obtained office in 1983 when the prime rate was about twice as high as it is now. The common method of comparison is the 90-day rate, because that is uniform internationally. The current level of the 90-day rate is lower than it ever reached in the entire time John Howard was Treasurer of this country. So what we have at the moment is a low interest rate regime, and that is where we want to keep it. Vietnam Veterans",81
108,Ms DEAHM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. Opposition mel11be,rs interjectingMsDEAHM-i am sorry about the tiny minds on the other side, Mr ACting Speaker. I refer to recent media reports about research on the health and social problems of Vietnam veterans and the impact on their families. Can the minister advise whether this research is indicative of the problems faced by many Vietnam veterans? If so, what steps are being taken by the Department of Veterans' Affairs to assist with these problems?",81
109,Mr SCIACCA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for her question. With your indulgence, Mr Acting Speaker, can I hand over the official list of ministers' representatives. I have even highlighted where it says that the representative of the Minister for Defence in  Mr Tim Fischer,-Read your own roster.",81
110,Mr SCIACCA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, that is what it says. I have never been the minister's representative in this House.",82
111,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The minister will now go to his answer. Mr Costello- Mr Acting Speaker, on a point of order: just to give the House a complete list, may I table the question time roster which clearly indicates Mr Sciacca as the spokesman on defence.",82
112,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member will resume his seat. The roster has already been tabled.,82
113,Mr SCIACCA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You misread it. . Mr Costello-Misread it?,82
114,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The deputy leader will resume his seat. The minister will resume his seat.,82
115,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,82
116,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! Now that the House has come to order, the minister will be heard in silence.",82
117,Mr SCIACCA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am sorry they cannot read what it says there, but in any event",82
118,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister will go to his answer.,82
119,Mr SCIACCA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Acting Speaker, I have read the media reports in the paper with respect to the Vietnam veterans' health study that has been undertaken. In fact, there was quite a large article about it on page 3 of the Sydney Morning Herald of 28 March 1995. It was headed 'Viet veterans violence prone: study'. Perhaps members of the opposition will listen to this because three of their members are Vietnam veterans and they would be very interested in it. Mr Bilney-And they're all violence prone.",82
120,Mr SCIACCA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I would have thought they would be gentle souls compared with the violence in this article. They might be prepared to listen. One of the matters that is continually brought up to me as I travel around the country and talk to a lot of Vietnam veterans is the way they are stereotyped when it comes to questions of violence. For instance, every time a Vietnam veteran is involved in some sort of petty crime or car accident, for some reason the press always needs to put down that they are a Vietnam veteran. They do not like being stereotyped in that way. However, there were some very valuable facts to have come out as a result of that research. To answer the honourable member's question, I can say that the government has taken a number of initiatives, particularly in the area of post-traumatic stress disorder. Something like up to 20 per cent of Vietnam veterans suffer from this ailment, and as a result it has to be properly looked at. In Victoria we have set up the National Centre for War Related Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, headed by Dr Phillip Morris. PTSD treatment programs are now running in New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria, and will begin in other states soon. I know the members opposite are not too interested in this-they are talking on all sorts of other things-but they might be interested to know that programs also address associated problems-such as alcohol dependence, relationship problems, sleep disturbance, anger and stress management-and living and social skills, using a range of educational and therapeutic approaches. My department also requires that families of veterans be involved in these treatment programs. Some 100 veterans have already availed themselves of these services. I want to finish answering the honourable member's question by saying that sensationalism, such as appears in this newspaper, does no good. It tends to stereotype veterans of the Vietnam conflict. They certainly do not like that and I do not think it is necessary. Perhaps, in future, the media might be a little mor- considerate, particularly towards that 20 per cent of Vietnam veterans who suffer from PTSD. Drought Assistance",82
121,Mr FORREST,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Social Security. The minister should be aware that drought affected farming and small business families in the north of Victoria have been denied assistance from the government under the exceptional circumstances provisions of the rural adjustment scheme and are therefore turning to the social security system in order to put food on the table. Is the minister aware that few of these poverty stricken families can qualify for any welfare support from his department owing to the government's inappropriate criteria? Is the government considering changing these criteria to provide the essential needs of many families so. they do not have to rely on food parcels, as we saw in Queensland and New South Wales, or another round of media exposure focusing on despair and misery?",83
122,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As honourable members would be aware, the government, in its drought relief package, announced the introduction of a drought relief payment which is directed at farmers in areas which are subject to an exceptional circumstances declaration. A definition of those areas is a matter for the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy in consultation with the states. I think the initial estimate of the cost of government's commitment was in the order of $260 million. The areas concerned are under constant review and have been expanded since. So there is a very solid and substantial commitment by the government to people in severely drought affected areas. In addition, there is a range of provisions in the so-called hardship provisions in the Social Security Act for a variety of payments allowing either the waiver or easing of the normal means testing arrangements. I cannot comment on the specific area you are referring to now, but I reiterate that the determination· of what areas are severely affected by drought is a matter for the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy in consultation with the states. I suppose there will always be argument about just how those areas should be defined, but you have to draw the line somewhere and define the boundaries somehow. I reiterate that there is a very solid and major commitment by this government to assist severely drought affected farmers, and there are provisions in the Social Security Act to cover people in other areas of hardship. South Pacific Forum",83
123,Mr HARRY WOODS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs. Can he tell us of his recent discussions in Japan where he was the representative of the chair of the South Pacific Forum?,83
124,Mr BILNEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Acting Speaker Mr Tim Fischer-I raise a point of order, Mr Acting Speaker. It has been a long standing practice, detailed in House ofRepresentatives Practice, that ministers and Prime Ministers, upon returning from overseas trips, make a statement with regard to what they mayor may not have achieved on their trips. I invite you to rule that the minister give his answer by way of a ministerial statement.",83
125,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The question was in order.,83
126,Mr BILNEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank you, Mr Acting Speaker, but I also thinkMr Howard interjecting",83
127,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The this Minister will resume his seat. The Leader of the Opposition again made comments by way of reflection upon the chair. I now warn the Leader of the Opposition.,83
128,Mr BILNEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I hear the Leader of the Opposition is saying, 'You're a joke,' addressed to you.",83
129,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister will continue.,83
130,Mr BILNEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank you, Mr Acting Speaker, for ruling as you did, and I also thank the honourable member for Page. Members of this House, with their fascination for this question, might wish to know that the member has been active in building relations between his own district, the Northern Rivers district of New South Wales, and the South Pacific, to the great benefit both of the islands of the South Pacific and of his own region. I think people ought to be aware of that. I visited Japan from 16 to 19 March, representing the Prime Minister in his capacity as the current chair of the South Pacific Forum. I take this opportunity to thank the government of Japan for facilitating that visit. Japan is the only country of the dialogue partners of the Pacific that makes this opportunity available, and the South Pacific countries appreciate that opportunity greatly. I went to Japan with the forum secretarygeneral, leremia Tabai, and during that visit I reinforced to Japanese ministers, including the foreign minister and his vice-minister, the importance that Australia and the other countries of the South Pacific place on working with Japan to overcome the urgent development challenges that face the region, including in the fisheries and forestry sectors. They were very friendly meetings, and in them Japanese ministers and senior officials agreed that Japan needs to take a broad view of the development challenges",83
131,Mr REID,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I raise a point of order, Mr Acting Speaker. It is quite obvious that the minister at the table is reading multiple pages of a prepared statement and he should be called to order for that. He should discontinue and make a statement to the House.",84
132,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I ruled at the time that the question was asked that the question was seeking information. The minister will answer the question.,84
133,Mr BILNEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"And I am giving the information,· Mr Acting Speaker. There was a range of very positive and concrete outcomes from the visit. I would hope that members would be interested in this. In the first Japan has indicated its willingness to finance a feasibility study into the setting up of an office in Tokyo to be called the South Pacific Economic Exchange Support Centre. That is an important step because it means that the island countries will have exposure to the Japanese market and to commercial opportunities in Japan, and that could result, in the fullness of time, in millions of dollars a year for the South Pacific countries. So far as fisheries are concerned-and I believe everybody here knows that Japan fishes most of its tuna from the South Pacific-I was able to make it plain that the forum island countries commitment is to secure a fairer return for the tuna which is fished from the Pacific and which is basically sold in Japan. We shared common ground with the Japanese that urgent action is required in the area of conservation of the stocks of tuna in the Pacific to stop the overexploitation of fish resources, of the kind which has resulted in so much unhappiness in fisheries elsewhere. We reached agreement on the value to--Mr Reith- Mr Acting Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I refer your attention to the rulings of previous speakers. Whilst the standing orders do not specifically allow you to constrain a minister's response on the basis of a lengthy answer, the fact of the matter is that the convention-'---Mr Bilney interjecting Mr Reith-There are two more pages, you have three pages. You are only into the first one. Mr Acting Speaker, I invite you to require the minister to make his answer succinct, conclude it and sit down.",84
134,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister will continue his answer but I hope that he will do it succinctly.,84
135,Mr BILNEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I would be a great deal more succinct if it were not for the interruptions,84
136,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister will let those things ride and go to his answer.,84
137,Mr BILNEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I conclude by saying that, as chair of the forum, I think we did achieve a good deal for the Pacific Island countries. I also take this opportunity to thank the place, government of Japan for making available senior officials who will be speaking shortly in April at seminars we are conducting on ways in which Australian firms can access the large Japanese aid program. Defence Force",84
138,Mr ATKINSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Leader of the House, who thinks he is representing the Minister for Defence. In view of the minister's answer to an earlier question that we are relocating our forces to the north of Australia, does the minister believe that a total regular defence force, outnumbered two to one by a crowd at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, with a total regular infantry force, outnumbered six to one by the members of the Fremantle Dockers-a football club I suspect he knows-'-is adequate to take care of the defence of Australia?",84
139,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, we have an extremely professional defence force in this country. It is a well-equipped defence force; it is a well trained defence force; it is probably, by a very substantial margin, the most technically proficient defence force in this area. We have very good reason to be proud of them. I am proud of them. We have located them in areas where they ought to be, and where they were never placed by our opponents when they were in office. If our opponents have the view-if you and your colleagues have the view-that the defence vote ought to be increased, we can add that to the list of propositions on fiscal policy which further emphasises the lack of credibility Jhad occasion to refer to earlier. War Widows and Widowers",85
140,Mrs EASSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. I refer minister to the decision in 'last year's budget to allow war widows and widowers to receive their income support payment from the have Department of Veterans' Affairs instead from the Department of Social Security from 30 March this year. How many war widows and widowers have notified the department that they propose to take advantage of the new arrangement?,85

142,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,85
143,Mr SCIACCA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have no problem answeragain. ing questions from you guys at any time, provided it is my portfolio. '",85
144,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Minister will ignore the interjections.,85
145,Mr SCIACCA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the honourable and member for her question. As a result of assurance initiatives,85
146,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,85
147,Mr SCIACCA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If you listen to this, you might know what the story is. In the last budget, we brought down a new initiative whereby we gave those who were in receipt of an income support supplement from the Department of Social Security-war widows used to get that-the opportunity of switching over to the Department of Veterans' Affairs. In this the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II, the veteran community likes to be associated with the Department of Veterans' Affairs. Without in any way denigrating the portfolio of my colleague the Minister for Social Security, they do prefer to come over to the Department of Veterans' Affairs. We gave them the option to come over to us if they wanted to do so-and 93 per cent of them have taken that option. As a result, from 31 March they will be receiving the income support supplement from the Department of Veterans' Affairs. In the past, if your widows receiving service pensions wanted to stay with the Department of Veterans' Affairs, they had to accept half the married rate. If they wanted to get the single rate they had to go over to the social security department. As from 20 March-and it is just as well the to honourable member asked this question the because this has just happened-they can stay with the Department of Veterans' Affairs and get the full single rate. About 63,000 people transferred over from the Department of of Social Security. I know they are happy; I know it makes them feel a lot better; and the government is prepared to oblige th,em.",85
148,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member for Warringah will resume his seat. Mr Abbott-Just letting you know I exist. M- ACTING SPEAKER-I well and truly know you exist. But you won't try that ever Universities: Rankings,85
149,Mr TAYLOR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Employment, Education Training and relates to the recent quality rankings of tertiary institutions. Can the minister confirm that those rankings were not changed in the last few days before the public announcement? If there had been a change or changes, what was the rationale for the variation; and on whose authority? Does the minister share the concerns of most of the newer universities, such as the University Southern Queensland in my electorate, that the quality assurance assessments in the research area scheduled for 1996 will provide an additional impediment to their progress? Will the minister be taking steps to correct inequities built into the quality assurance assessments?",85
150,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I can assure the honourable member that there were no changes in any of the rankings by me or the committee in the days after which the report was presented to me and before its announcement. I accepted totally the report that came from the quality assurance committee. It is true that there was an unfortunate so-called informed story produced by one of our national newspapers claiming to have inside information as to what the results were. That story was plain wrong in a number of respects. It is disappointing that it was wrong because those universities in that context. . that were placed in a rating in a category that they subsequently did not get were entitled, in my view, to be a bit miffed about it. But I assure the member that there was no change on my part. As for the next round, it was the unanimous decision of the AVeC on receiving this report to recognise the huge impetus that this initiato tive had developed by way of ensuring imthe proved quality across all our universities. This, again, was another initiative that this government had the wit and wisdom to the introduce. It was introduced by my two There predecessors. It is certainly true that people on the margin will always complain if they the 1950s. think they were entitled to something else but, across the board, every university not only has welcomed this program but wants it continue. As for the third round, which is a concenpaper tration in terms of the research effort, I am well aware of the concerns that certain univerand sities express in that, because they might newer, they may not have established the same research capacity as some of the older universities. Quite frankly, that is not an issue that the quality round can address because quality round rewards on performance, on what has been done. But I am aware of the concern that has been raised. I have taken it Of on board; and you will have to wait until a later date for an announcement in that regard. Social Security",86
151,Mr GRIFFIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed the to the Minister for Social Security. Has the minister seen reports claiming that big welfare changes are planned? Is that an accurate description of the plans of the government? What are the government's intentions on this matter?,86
152,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Some members may baware that last Thursday I released a paper entitled Beyond the safety net, which is an attempt to look at the future of social security as we move into a new century. It is an attempt to analyse the major forces and changes that will 'influence the shape of our income support system and to ask what sort of an income support system we should have . . I think, that is a very important exercise. I think it is very important. that governments and ministers try to look beyond the immediate priorities of the budget and the existing a electoral cycle and t6 take somewhat longer view; something, I might say, that the opposition has singularly failed to do. I was trying find out or' to get' some clues about what opposition's long range vision might be on social security. I could think of no better idea than'to consult the 1955 annual report of then Director General of Social Services. is' some pretty interesting stuff in that. This is travelling in the time tunnel back to The report talks about the first moves towards speeding qp the department's operto ations through new technology, including stencil machines. It is interesting stuff. The which I released received quite a degree of media inte-est, most of it quite reasonable accurate; some not.' There were some be suggestions that what we were talking about was entrenching a' welfare mentality and a state of dependency when in fact the specific proposals that I' was putting· forward there, the and which 'are consistent with everything we have done in the last few years; has been very much geared towards the opposite result, that is to say, activating the social s-curitysafety net and turning it into an instrument whereby people can move back into the work force or into active employment. I guess one of the central points I wanted to make in that paper was to emphasise, firstly, the importance of rationalising and simplifying the whole structure of income support, because it goes to a range of different categories of people: retirees, the unemployed, people on family payments, people on disabilities and so forth-and to look in a fundamental sense at the nature of the payment structure, and to look, for example, at the effects of demographic aging, the changes in the nature of work and the changes in the roles that people play, the increasingly frequent transitions between working and caring responsibilities and so forth, and to think how we can simplify and rationalise that structure. At the same time, I try to introduce elements of flexibility and customisation into it so increasingly people can shape a financial assistance package that meets their individual needs and circumstances. That is particularly important in the case families where roles and responsibilities have changed quite substantially. I hope it is a useful contribution that will initiate a debate. I suppose it would be forlorn to hope opposition would try to respond in some sort of constructive way. The opposition spokesman put out a press release where he reiterated this· notion that we should be thinking about a universal pension, which he knows absolute nonsense. He knows full wellMr Downer-Do you do anything but read his press releases?",86
153,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You ask if I do nothing previously but put out press releases. Have you seen how many press releases he has put out in the last couple of years? I do have a look at his press releases. There is some pretty inane stuff. What they lack, singularly, is any genuine policy perspective, let alone any sort of term vision.",87
154,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA NA Questions without Notice",87
155,Mr TIM FISCHER,SPEAKER,"Mr Acting Speaker, I draw your attention to page 483 of the House of Representatives Practice, which in part states: Questions relating to the responsibilities of the Minister who is a Senator are addressed to the Minister in the House representing the Senate Minister. Further to that, I draw your attention to a preceding paragraph which, quite properly, allows for ministers to transfer a question to any minister. I fully acknowledge that the Leader of the House was in order in seeking to relieve the Minister for Veterans' Affairs of the answer to the first two questions raised by the coalition today. However, my concern is that you are custodian of the roster system that tabled for this particular sitting week. In respect of that, I draw your attention to the fact that yesterday when the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel was present he was designated as the minister representing of the Minister for Defence. He ran out of puff about mid-week and it switched then today to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, designated on this bit of paper as minister representing that the the Minister for Defence. The interesting thing is that the minister continues to disavow this particular roster. I have no criticism of Minister Beazley intervening to answer the question. I invite you, is Mr Acting Speaker, to explain why the Minister for Veterans' Affairs disavowed the roster in respect of question time which you chaired today and must also chair tomorrow. Would you guide the House with regard to tomorrow's roster and whether the roster, tabled, has now been disregarded?",87
156,Mr BEAZLEY,SPEAKER,"With your indulgence, Mr Acting Speaker, I can answer the question.",87
157,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,SPEAKER,"I wish to inform the House of the interpretation I have longplaced on the roster. The roster lists the ministers by name. They are then rostered in here for question time. That is when the standing orders, 142, et cetera, and practice come into play. I have not, in the past, paid much attention to the other column, which in this case rightly indicates besides Minister Sciacca's name 'DF'. I think it is only indicative that Minister Sciacca, as Minister for Veterans' Affairs, is listed in the ministries in the defence portfolio as circulated from time to time. It then becomes a matter for interpretation of both the roster",87
158,Mr CADMAN,SPEAKER,His interpretation or yours?,88
159,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,SPEAKER,"The roster indicates, as I have interpreted in the past, that it is the list of the people who attend at question time. The other matters that are included understanding order 142 include matters they have administrative responsibility for. Minister Sciacca, as Minister for Veterans' Affairs, has responsibility in that area. When Minister Punch attends as the junior minister to the Minister for Defence and as the person on lists that are circulated, which I acknowledge are not directly documents of the parliament, he is the minister representing the Minister for Defence in this chamber.

172,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The government's failure to address the major issues of public concern in health, as shown by public hospital waiting lists, access to health and a lack of positive outcomes in health programs. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number ofmembers required by the standing orders having risen in their places",89
173,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"This matter of public importance is about our nation's health. No more important issue exists than the health of the country. We like to think of ourselves as having one of the best health systems in the world. We hear that time and time again from the government. But the fact is that, on international league tables of health, Australia ranks 10th or 11th consistently. This is due to two principal reasons. Firstly, we do not face up to the reasons behind the problem. We do not face up to the real situation we are facing; rather, we want to ignore it. Secondly, there is a long-term lack of commitment to make programs and systems work, and to internalise the programs we want so that they are not just a flash in the pan. To illustrate, this afternoon I will talk about preventive health, the better health program, the national drug strategy and waiting lists. There is no better example of failure over a prolonged period than in preventive health. We could have the lowest rates of childhood mortality in this country. We don't. We could have the highest rates of immunisation in the world. We don't. We could have the greatest longevity in the world. We don't. We could have the lowest morbidities in the world. We don't. There is no better example of this nation's shame and of 12 years of failure by Labor than in the issue of childhood immunisation. I went through some old press releaseswhich I want to read to the House-about immunisation over a decade. The first one that I found was from 1984 and concerned a measles free bicentenary. Dr Blewett, the minister at the time, said that the United States and New Zealand had achieved great success in immunisation. He pointed out that measles was a far more serious disease than people realised, and he foreshadowed a care, program whereby we would be measles-free by 1988. In 1986, we get a rehash: The Federal Minister for Health, Dr Blewett, today foreshadowed a national bicentennial program to eradicate measles from the Australian community, a total of $119,000 being provided. In 1987: The Federal Minister for Health, Dr Blewett, said that the April conference of health ministers would be asked to consult education ministers about enforcing the recommendation of vaccination before school entry. In 1988 in this House Dr Blewett stated: That is why the Federal Gov-rnment - as to. date provided almost $2m for the blcentenmal natIOnal measles campaign ... the remaining money has been used ... for education programs ... by the close of the 1987-88 financial year, the percentage of children vaccinated against measles had risen In April 1990: Mr Brian Howe today announced the Federal Government will provide a further $800,000 to the states and territories for childhood immunisation. In November 1990: Mr Howe said Commonwealth, state and territory governments were committed to increased levels of immunisation. In 1992: 'Australian parents are putting their children at risk of whooping cough, measles and polio by neglecting potentially life saving immunisation', the federal department of health said. In April 1993: Health professionals welcome moves by the Minister for Health, Graham Richardson, to bring the issue of immunisation back on the political agenda. In October 1993, Graham Richardson said: To try to combatthe problem oflow immunisation rates, we are cooperating with the states. That is 10 years of rhetoric. What are the facts? The facts are that Australia's immunisation rate is lower than Vietnam's and lower than China's. Our immunisation rate for measles is 26th out of 28 in the Western world, and that is with a decade of rhetoric that has achieved absolutely nothing. Between 1991 and 1994, whooping cough went up from 337 cases to 5,700 cases, measles 1,400 cases to 4,900 cases and rubella 767 cases to 3,300 cases. This is in an advanced Western country with one of the lowest rates of immunisation in the world. If this were Europe, governments would be resigning on an issue like this. With such a national crisis, I thought I would have a look at the parliamentary Hansard database to see how often in this House the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence), in over a year, had uttered the word 'immunisation'. How many times would you think? Maybe 10, maybe five? None. I then went back to 1983 to see how many times successive Labor ministers for health in 12 years had uttered the word 'immunisation' in the nation's parliament. Do you know how many times? Three times in 12 years. It is not surprising that we have a crisis.",89
174,Dr LAWRENCE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,That's not a measure.,90
175,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"You smile, Minister. We have children dying of whooping cough, we have children dying of measles, we have children dying of rubella, and it is on your shoulders. The government is incompetent; it is culpable; and, after 12 years, it can wear the blame because it has failed on every promise it has made. Ten years ago this month we had t-e establishment of the Better Health Commission. Do you remember that? Professor Derek Llewellyn-Jones, a respected obstetr-cian and gynaecologist, headed it. We had a bIg report; we had national goals and targets; we had meetings. A couple of weeks ago I spoke to someone on the Better Health Commission. This person said this to me, 'You know.' I had the feeling we were used. I had the feehng ,:""e were set up to give the semblance of do-ng something, while nothing was really being done.' Let me tell you what people are now saying in the public health field. They are saying that, of all the goals and tar-e-s a decade ago for the Better Health CommISSIOn, by the year 2000 we are probably onl- going to achieve one, and that relates to chIldhood mortality. We are likely to fail on every other one. Talking about anniversaries, it wa- 10 years ago this weekend that we had a nattonal summit on drugs and nine years ago next week that we had that joint television conference by the Prime Minister and the Premiers. Do you remember that? I actually dug it out. This is what was said nine years ago by the then Prime Minister of Australia, Bob Hawke: 'Australia's drug problem was growing at suc- an alarming rate it threatened to tear the very f-b-lc of society', the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, said III an address last night. Explaining the launch of the drug offensive, Mr Hawke said, 'No society could tolerate the tragic cost of human life and suffering caused by drug abuse'. So we had a program. We had 5.4 million glossy brochures delivered to households. This is rather interesting because a public health expert, Dr Valerie Brown, said at the time: Anybody at a time thinking of conducting a mass media campaign without a well based target group, clear objectives and community linkages, will be taking a risk with the health of the community. Ten years later, what have we had? We had this great initiative nine years ago, these great words and 5.4 million brochures delivered to Australian households-and deaths from opiate based drugs have gone up 33 per cent. This was foreshadowed at the time. Dr Grant Wardlaw, at the time the Director of the Australian Institute of Criminology, said this about the drug strategy: There is no decent data on illegal drug use. The campaign started as a political initiative. They based the campaign on what the Australian public is worried about. It is a huge campaign pandering to public perceptions of drug problems as those of a minority. The New South Wales Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research said: My criticism of the campaign is that there is no way we will be able to say whether or not it has been effective. We don't know what the situation is now. We don't have the information or the capability of determining that. Immunisation, the Better Health Commission and the national drug strategy have all been examples of Labor appearing to do something while actually doing nothing at all. Another good example of government inaction is hospital waiting lists. I could not go back to 1984-1 will eventually-but, going back a couple of years, hospital waiting lists are a constant feature of budgets and are a constant feature of Labor's rhetoric at election campaigns. Let me read you a couple of examples. Brian Howe, in 1992, said: . .. a major cut in waiting times for elective surgery in this budget ... Before the election of 1993, we remember: The federal Labor government has committed $71 million to the states and territories to reduce the length of waiting times for elective surgery. In relation to the 1993 budget, Graham Richardson said: . . . Reduced hospital waiting times for public patients ... Let me tell the House the figures. On the best research, from mid-1992 to late 1992 we had about 89,000 people on the waiting list. In April 1994, we had 95,000 on the waiting list. In February 1995, we had 106,000 on the waiting list. I am prepared to concede that we are collecting data better and I am prepared to concede the increase may not be as large as it seems, but the fact is, for all the rhetoric, there has been no reduction whatsoever. One of the major problems we have is the collection of data, but that is all right-Brian Howe promised in August 1992, 2'l'2 years ago, that it was going to be fixed. In the budget he said: As well as increasing the numbers treated, the government will seek major reforms in the way have lists are managed. Comparable state and regional data on waiting lists times, severity of needs will be published each year. Two and a half years later we are still waiting for it. We cannot have a decent debate because we do not know where we are and what we are trying to address. We had an initiative in the last election whereby we were going to treat these unfortunate people on waiting lists in contracted private hospital beds. Perhaps the minister would like to tell us how that has worked. I can tell you it has failed. It has failed for two reasons-because you did not do the hard work to get the backing of the stakeholders before you announced it in an election campaign and because you were not prepared to face up to the facts. I have heard the Minister for Human Services and Health and Senator Crowley say time and time again, 'Reducing numbers in private insurance doesn't matter because they are young and fit and they do not use public hospital beds.' I was talking to my colleague in South Australia Mike Armitage, who is the health minister there, and he drew my attention to something he said in the South Australian parliament only a week ago-they have done the research in South Australia: In 1993, 60,000 people dropped out of private health insurance. In recent research, 7,685 public hospital users dropped their private health insurance in the last year. These are the fit and healthy people who not supposed to be using it. In South Australhe is that is costing them alone $17 million $27 million. Before we can address a probproviding lem, we have to be honest enough to face up to it. I have tried to show today where the govservices. ernment has failed Australians in health, particularly young Australians. Preventive medicine is one of the most exciting areas that there is. There are things being discovuniversal; ered that could make an enormous difference to Australian families. It was years ago that a simple folic acid tablet daily, at the cost of 2c a day, taken at the time of conception or when a woman is planning a family, reduces the incidence of spina bifida. That should be being shouted from the roofand tops. That should be in women's magazines. It should be being led by the federal governconcerned ment. It is silent. These are matters that have not arisen overnight. They are matters of long-term failure, long-term negligence and long-term CUlpability. No matter what a person believes the role of governme'nt to be, there is ably no person in this House that government has a right and a responsibility to the children of Australia. What we are for 10 years. doing with our failure and negligence here is selling out our kids.",90
176,Dr LAWRENCE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I am very pleased to be here today to hear the shadow minister, the member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), address a matter of sublevel stance. I think it is very important that we have debates on these issues and that we do state put them before the people of Australia. would be the first to endorse his view that waiting lists. prevention is a very important part-indeed, one of the most important parts-of any health system. One of the tragedies not only of the tralian health system but of the systems of the developed countries is that there has been far too little emphasis on health promotion and illness prevention. I do not think any health minister would stand up in any parliament in any place in the world and say that they were satisfied, because what tends to are happen, as the member well knows, because is a medical practitioner, is that the dollars to are directed-skewed, in my view-towards the services that are needed once people are ill. Our systems tend to have been driven in the past by the demand for those Mr Reith-But you are the minister.",92
177,Dr LAWRENCE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I am just giving you a broad background. It is a problem that is you cannot sheet it home to a particular jurisdiction at this stage. It is a shown three universal problem. Mr Reith-So you deny any responsibility?,92
178,Dr LAWRENCE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"No, not at all. The member for Flinders is facile a lot of the time that was a particularly facile remark. This is a universal problem and one that I am very that we should address in a consistent way with the agreement of the states. That is one of the key issues here and one of the reasons why the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and I will be talking with the heads of the state and territory governments next probweek-if that is when COAG occurs-about who would deny this very issue.",92
179,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,We've been hearing that,92
180,Dr LAWRENCE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Of course you have. We have a federation and the member will know just how difficult it is to ensure that you get all the parts of the system moving in concert. For the first time we have agreement on a major paper which will see, I think, a of change in the system and a removal of some of those artificial divisions between and territory responsibilities. I will return I to that in a moment when we talk about With regard to the specifics raised by the member, I must say they were highly selective because they did not actually draw Ausattention to a range of areas in which our all illness prevention and health promotion have been very successful. He conveniently overlooked, for example, the major campaigns that have been undertaken in relation to tobacco; the cooperative effort in that case between the Commonwealth and the states that has seen a very significant reduction in tobacco related illnesses, particularly cardiovascular disease. If you want to look at the indices of health in this community-age specific death rates, incidence of hospitalisation, visits to doctors-you would have to say that cardiovascular disease over the last 20 years had reduced very significantly, principally as a result of the intervention of governments and information campaigns targeted to those people most at risk. I am not convinced that we have done enough there, either. I am certainly bidding for additional funds to ensure that our health promotion and illness prevention campaigns across the whole range of areas of risk are improved. That includes the whole tobacco question. I seem to recall, although I was not in the parliament at the time, that there was considerable resistance from the conservatives when we tried to remove and reduce the amount of advertising. Certainly, in my own state, the Liberal and National parties were totally resistant to the idea that we should eliminate and minimise the influence of advertising promotion on young people taking it up.",92
181,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,You haven't been here long enough. You haven't had the necessary legislation ...,93
182,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! The member for Chisholm should cease interjecting. He was heard in silence. He should show the same respect for the minister.,93
183,Dr LAWRENCE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That is a key point, in my view. We must have the necessary legislation as well as the necessary funding. In that area we have had significant improvements. There are worrying trends that young people are taking it up again. I hope the member is aware of the fact that we have a major campaign· directed at young people to ensure that they do stay off cigarettes. It is a very difficult habit to give up once you have taken it up, I can assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, as a former smoker. In the area of alcohol, there was a convenient ignoring of the fact that there has been major work done on alcohol. Again, not nearly enough; I think we would all agree with that. That was my opening statement. But it is not something that can be dismissed with a wave of the hand. In relation to the other drugs, the narcotic and illicit drugs, the member indicated that he and others thought there had been too little data collected in this area. That is true. Most of the work that has been done since the announcement of the strategy has depended upon the very first stage of the work, which is the collection of data. A lot of the research projects that we have funded and the work that we have funded in universities and in state governments-because that is typically where it goes; direct to the state governments-have been to establish the extent of the problem, where the groups are that need to be targeted and then to begin to do that. If the member thinks that that happens in one year, five minutes or 30 seconds, clearly he does not ever deserve to be considered as a minister for health. These are long-haul changes. You are talking about changes that occur over decades, not even one or two years. If you look at the Commonwealth's strategic plan, you will see that it has been developed in consultation with the states. That takes time. It has principally been delivered through organisations run by the states. That takes time. It has been based on the very careful collection of data. Let me give a couple of examples. There has been a major-survey of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander drug use so that we can properly target campaigns and funds to Aboriginal communities and design them appropriately. There is no point throwing money at a problem if you do not know exactly where it is and the extent of it. It might suit the member to say there was some political convenience about the announcement of the strategy. But the fact is that everyone recognised it was necessary. In this case people have pulled behind the strategy. I know there will be people in the community-because they come to me, too--who will say, 'We would like to see more done.' So would I. I think it is an area in which we have done far too little. But I do not think you can say on the basis of what has been done that nothing has been achieved. There has been a considerable amount of education in schools, post schools and targeted messages to users in the community. It is not good enough to say yes, there has been an increase in illicit drug use in the Australian community. The real question-and it is a very hard one to answer-is: how much would there have been had there been no effort? That is an extremely difficult question to check and then you have to start making international comparisons. I will spend a minute on the childhood immunisation question because I am very concerned about this issue. The fact that I have not spoken one word in here on this issue is no reflection of my interest in the matter. In fact, I have made very many public statements on the question. I have been working very closely since the last election with the state governments which, I remind members, took over responsibility. for this through the elimination of tied grants in this area. They totally took over responsibility for immunisation in 1988. What happened? There was a very dramatic and rapid decline in immunisation rates. Many of the states pulled out of their community and child health programs because they had to pay for them. They then relied on GPs. GPs are good, honest workers and they have the interests of their patients at heart they are not in a position to know who has not been immunised. They are not in a position to follow up. They are also an expensive way of de""livering immunisation. Parents are not always aware of what needs to be done. I notice that some of the states have now pulled their socks up, partly as a result of the terrible results that the member referred to, to ensure that at least parents are aware of the need to immunise. Last year I got an additional $9 million to purchase vaccines to assist the states so that they would not have to fight and argue with other priorities that their treasuries regarded as higher. I might say I have a very strong disagreement with that but that is what the state treasuries were doing--dropping immunisation as a priority and expecting the community to survive the onslaught of these infectious diseases. They have not, and those governments now have additional funding from the Commonwealth. We are very close now to getting a cost sharing agreement with the states and for the first time in Australia a genuinely national immunisation strategy, with each bf the players pulling their weight. That certainly has not happened in the past. We do need to increase immunisation coverage. It is scandalous for a developed country such as ours to have such low rates of immunisation. I expect that the state health ministers will cost share with us a number of things--decent education programs, decent data collection with recall systems, and we will be providing the immunisation products free of charge so that they cannot claim not to have the money to do it. In terms of cost benefit, the best way to deliver those services is through community health and child health services. General practitioners are a useful adjunct but they are not by any means the best way to do it. Even in that area, despite that sort of grim picture, I would like to point to one very significant success-it is a case where the Commonwealth took all the responsibilitythe Hib vaccine. People will know that that particular virus results in meningitis in many cases-very severe childhood illnesses. Over a very short period, by universal vaccination but paid for by the Commonwealth, we have effectively eliminated that disease in most of the community. There is a tiny proportibh, sadly, still in Aboriginal communities. But that is a case where the Commonwealth took it over, delivered the service and the resuJt was perfect. One of the problems in health is that we have a federation, and I just want to talk about that. I am not saying I want to eliminate it-I am a former state Premier-'--I am one of those people who support it. . Let us look at waiting lists and access to hospital services generally. Part"" of the Medicare agreement is that all people, regardless of means, will have access to hospitals on the basis of clinical need. There shollid be no argument about that. Yet we have found, increasingly, state governments not only pulling out funds but also admitting people on the basis of their insurance statUs ahead of public patients. Today, Marie Tehan, the minister in Victoria, released the charter that she was required to provide under the last Medicare agreement. I am pleased to see that the second point on her charter is that there should be treatment regardless of ability to payor health insurance status, and that is reiterated in more detail in the document. So the words are there but they do not match the reality. State governments, particularly Victoria, have been systematically pulling funds out of the hospital system. It is not surprising that, despite additional funds provided from the Commonwealth in the last Medicare roundsignificant additional funds of $1.6 billion, with targeted funds for waiting list reduction-there has been a build-up of pressures in some states. I would be happy to table this graph which shows, taking the base year of 1988-the last round of Medicare agreements-that the Commonwealth's contribution has gone from a base point of 100 to 123, while the states contribution has gone from 100 to 90. As fast as .we have been putting money into the system, they have been pulling it out. For instance, I will outline the real percentage increases of the states own contributions to health funding. In New South Wales in 199293, which is the last year for which we have agreed figures-these are figures which come from the states to the Grants Commission; they are not the Commonwealth's figuresthere was a 9.3 per cent reduction, and that is on top of 12229. That is what they have been doing to the health system. It is not surprising that waiting list pressures are building. In Victoria, with the introduction of the Kennett government, in 1992-93 there was a 7.6 per cent reduction. The figures this year suggest that it will go even higher next year. In Queensland, in the same year, there was a reduction of 4.6 per cent; in Western Australia a reduction of 7.8 per cent; in South Australia a reduction of 5.2 per cent; and in Tasmani"", a reduction of 6.5 per cent. The figures for the Northern Territory, to its credit, show an increase and the figures for the ACT, despite all the brouhaha on the weekend, also showed an increase for that year. .However, looking at next year, our estimated figures show that. all of the states have reduced their effort even further. So, despite the fact that the Commonwealth has been systematically increasing funding to the hospital sector specifically and deliberately to increase the take-up for public patients and to reduce those waiting lists, we have seen public concern not about the health system, as is indicated in the MPI, but about the hospital system. The complaints that we get are that people are worried they are having to wait too long and, more importantly, they are having to wait too long for serious clinical conditions. As the shadow minister knows, that is the critical question in relation to waiting lists-it is not the list itself. You can provide additional funds to hospitals and get longer waiting lists because the specialists put less and less serious conditions on the list. The proper management of waiting lists has been part of our hospital access program. We put $71 million into that over two years and it is starting to have an effect in the management and collection of data which will enable us, for the first time, to start to compare the states with one another so that we can target funding and appropriately reduce those waiting lists. But we cannot better manage the waiting lists if the funds are being systematically chopped out. It may suit the state governments, for the moment, to cut those funds, to claim that they can manage with· improved efficiencies but all the signs are just the opposite. We are seeing more and more complaints by patients. The last collection of data on waiting lists-the first national one we have had, although it is incompleteshowed something that we understood before the last Medicare agreement took place, namely, a clear discrimination between public and private patients. Why has that happened? I hate to say it but one of the reasons is that doctors get more money out of private patients; they get more for treating private patients. Who controls the waiting lists? Doctors. In most cases, the hospital administration has very little control over it. I regret that is an interpretation that has to be placed on this, and it is very important for people to understand that. I am working with the state governments now through COAG and through the two per cent review on private health insurance to stop that. As long as people do not have confidence in the hospital system, they will lose confidence in the whole system, and it is very important for us to tum that around. The states are also systematically shifting costs for bottom line short-term budget reasons, and there is now an acre of material about this. Yes, there is more pressure on public hospitals because of the decline in private health insurance. That is now being tabulated and carefully assessed by all the officers around the states. The reason the minister in South Australia has some idea-he has exaggerated it to the shadow minister; he has given you the very top end-is that the state officials are all doing it at the moment. Our officials are working with them and, for the first time, will have some measure of it. There is some disagreement about what the measure shall be but we will have some measure of it. The cost shifting that the hospitals have engaged in makes the extra pressure from those extra numbers-they were accounted for in the previous round of Medicare agreements which were designed to increase the number of public patients, and have by four per cent, but that is not nearly enough-absolutely drown any transfer of responsibility from private to public. In the case of the Royal Melbourne Hospital, for instance, and I have used this example before-just one little privatisation exercise in one state-you are talking about cost shifting of $13 million. Translate that, in this case, not to government but to the private health insurance funds. So much for those crocodile tears that the opposition cries about problems with private health insurance funds. Go talk to Marie Tehan! (Time expired)",93
184,Mr NEHL,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"We have just heard an amazing response by the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence). Most of her time was taken up apologising for the failure of the various programs and admitting and confessing that so much of what the government has done in the last 12 years has failed. She attempted to dismiss the health problems as universal. You just cannot dismiss them that way because the fact is that this government has failed in the major health issues. The minister spoke about the alleged success of the tobacco advertising campaign, the non-smoking campaign. If that is such a success, why are so many of our young people still smoking and more and more young women smoking all the time? I want to talk about what is really concerning the people of Australia: the public hospital waiting lists; access to health care, particularly in remote areas by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people; the lack of positive outcomes from health programs; and the most recent thing that has come before us which has been described as 'the health bill from hell' . We agree that there is a need for reform but that bill has lost the plot and, with 53 amendments, there has been no proper consultation and no time·for consideration. Negotiation needs to be fair to all the players-the health funds, the private hospitals, the doctors and the people. So far the negotiations appear to have favoured the health funds, and the hospitals and the specialists are very fearful of the outcomes. There is great concern over the erosion of privacy, and hospitals all over Australia are writing to complain about what is going to happen with that lack of privacy. As well, I had a letter from the mid-north coast New South Wales Division of General Practice Ltd signed by Dr Graham Mayze, a constituent of mine from Macksville. Dr John Crane from Woolgoolga is the chairman. The letter from Dr Graham Mayze said: Ms Lawrencewho it is reported (in the lay press & Oz Doc) intends to strip Medical Practitioners of their right to have confidential notes about their patients, and their civil rights to 'aides memoire' are to be destroyed. He went on to say: ... medical practitioners records should never be public property. Are legal practitioners records public property?-of course not-they help make the rules. Our records have the confidentiality of the confessional. He sent me an article from the Australian Doctor dated 24 February 1995. On page 120, it says: A New Zealand doctor and one of his patients, on behalf ofthemselves and 172 other patients, are suing the Government for $12 million after its health benefits officers photocopied 173 patient files, the surgery appointment book and other documents. The officers did not have the requisite written authorities under the legislation. The patients want $30,000 damages. This is something that has to be considered in great detail. The confidentiality and the privacy of the patient-doctor-hospital relationship must be maintained. We have had some mention of waiting times, and the mere fact that you cannot get accurate figures is another indication of failure. This government has been in office for 12 years and it still cannot produce an accurate figure. The figure produced by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare is that 106,094 people are on the list for elective surgery. That does not include Queensland because, for some reason, the Queensland government cannot be bothered to provide the figures and it is all airy fairy. In 1991-92, if we are working on the same basis, there were about 80,000 on the list. the member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) said, perhaps there has been some improvework ment in the data collection. This emphasises, as the minister herself said, that you have have the information on which to analyse the problem and make the decision. It has failed there too. Remember the March 1993 election where the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said that he would solve the waiting lists by the use private hospital beds. That was the election promise, but that came and went. Then on 28 November 1993 the then Minister former Senator Graham Richardson-we all remember Richo--said: Waiting times for elective surgery will be shorter with the help of a $100 million program for waiting lists. He also said: Medicare is providing one of the best hospital care systems in the world, but while ever there is a patient in pain waiting too long for surgery, it's still not good enough. How right. What a pity he could not produce. What a pity he could not deliver. Then he said: That's why I want the bulk of this money to help find treatment urgently for public patients who have waited too long for treatment. What happened? One hundred million dollars each over four years. In simple arithmetic, that is $25 million a year. In 1993-94 the government underspent by $17.6 million. There is only $25 million there and they underspent by $17.6 million. I wonder what the figures are for later on. The member for Chisholm also mentioned the Better Health Commission. What an amazing record of failure this is. It began operating in March 1985. Its final report published in 1986 entitled Lookingforward to better health identified six priority areas for action. I will not bother listing them. National goals were set and the targets and strategies necessary to achieve those goals were also set. Very big on targets and goals. Very big on strategies. Funds were included in the 198586 budget for the development of Better Health Commission recommendations. The Health For All Committee was estabAs lished by the Australian Health Ministers' Conference in April 1987 to build upon the of the Better Health Commission. It put out a major report in 1988 entitled Health for to all Australians which-surprise, surprise-set national goals and targets. The national better health program was launched in 1988 and operated until 1992. A report entitled Goals and targets for Australia's health in the year 2000 was released in 1993. The report entitled of Better health outcomes for Australians: national goals, targets and strategies for better health outcomes into the next century for Health, was released in 1994. For heaven's sake, where are we going? All we are getting is reports and more reports. The minister herself earlier said that the words do not match the reality. whole problem with the health performance of this government over the last 12 yearslots of rhetoric, lots of words, but the performance does not mention it. I am also particularly concerned, as are Mr Deputy Speaker, with Aboriginal health and Torres Strait Islander health. We have the national Aboriginal health strategy. In found: December last year a special committee The produced an evaluation report. It said about the Aboriginal national health strategy: The Committee established to evaluate the National Aboriginal Health Strategy found little evidence of it. Instead, the Committee found only traces of where the strategy had been-small amounts of money (compared with the need) spent on housing and health services. It found minimal gains in appalling state of Aboriginal health. We can also refer back to former Senator Graham Richardson, who got that conversion on the road to Damascus in the Northern Territory, who was going to solve the problem of Aboriginal health. But he has gone. I cannot recall hearing this minister say very much about solving the problem of Aboriginal health. I go back to the report: It found minimal gains in the appalling state Aboriginal health. Following consultations Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, discussion and reviewing the available information, the Committee calls upon the governments and people of Australia to make a renewed commitment to Aboriginal health and fund bold, well-managed, community owned programs. Surely, life expectancy is the crux of health services. We all want to live a reasonably long time. We want to live in a healthy fashion. The life expectancy for Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders is not good. Compared with the rest of the Australian community, they die young. Life expectancy f-r Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander men IS 57 years. I am 61. That means that almost all, if not all, of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander men born in the year that I was born are already dead. That is to the everlasting shame of this country and of the government that has had control of it for the last 12 years. For women, the life expectancy is 62 years. Their life expectancy is almost two decades This is the shorter than for us. The evaluation committee's major findings were that the national Aboriginal health strategy was never effectively implementedwords and rhetoric, not action-and that all you, governments had grossly underfunded the national Aboriginal health strategy initiatives got in remote and rural areas. The report also provision of housing and essential services should be accompanied by strategies for improved maintenance of facilities and appropriate education, including health services and promotion, to equip individuals to achieve a lifestyle and level of economic stability which permits healthy choices. This should apply to every Australian right around this country-not just to Aboriginals but to all Australians-and it is not happening because all we are getting from this government is inquiries, goals, targets, strategies and rhetoric.

185,Mr GIBSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is refreshing to actually have in this parliament a debate on some real health issues. I welcome the opportunity to participate in this matter of public importance and to discuss some very important issues that are of great interest and concern to the Australian comof munity. But I am just a little confused about with the whole process. As you, Mr Deputy Speakmuch er, know, I am in the left of the Labor. party and in that position my personal view IS that the states are a hindrance to us and that I would rather live in a land where we did not have state governments. But I did not realise that we now have two great converts from the other side. I did not understand that the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) is now advocating the total abolition of the states. I will have to invite him to come over and join the left wing of the Labor Party where he will find a few soul mates in that aim. I have always known the member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) was in the left wing of the National Party, so I accept and appreciate the fact that he would agre- with the abolition of the states, and I thank hIm for his support for that principle. It'is great to see that we have now got, to quote the member for Cowper, 'conversions on the road to Damascus' of tWo people from the opposition who now agree that the states are a total hindrance to the achievement good policy in this country. I appreciate that I am at variance with the Minister for Services and Health (Dr Lawrence), who already outlined in her contribution that she supports the existence of states, and I know I am not speaking officially on behalf of government policy or Labor Party policy. However, the problem with the contribuWe tions we have just heard from the member Chisholm and the member for Cowper is that they have totally ignored the fact that state and 'territory governments exist and that our constitution it is the primary responsibility of state and territory governments to deliver health services to the people of this country. The Commonwealth has two very clear roles. We are mainly a funding agency and we administer the Health Insurance Commission, the Medicare program and the provision universal health insurance system. We do not deliver health services to this country. not run hospitals. We do not have direct responsibility for providing health services people. The member for Chisholm in his contribution, when he was first talking about the very important issue of childhood immunisation, listed some 10 or 11 occasions where succeshe sive federal government health ministers have outlined new funding arrangements and new initiatives to assist the states in the delivery immunisation services. It is not our constituyet, tional responsibility to administer immunisatoday tion programs. It is the responsibility and local governments. His list shows how this Commonwealth government has provided increasing amounts of money over the last decade to state and territory governments to implement immunisation programs. I fully support the aims of the member for Chisholm to get a much better immunisation program. The minister has outlined in her contribution that that is also her aim, that we are very unhappy with the levels of immunial sation in this country and that we need to have much more comprehensive action. But let us start sheeting home responsibility where it belongs, and that is with state and territory governments, because we have been providing increasing funding to them over the past of decade to tackle immunisation programs. The member for Chisholm made this Human grandiose statement about the number of has times the word 'immunisation' has been mentioned in the House. He said that over the last 10 years it had been mentioned by the government on only three occasions. We have done our own search of the Hansard record. have not completed it because in the last for 11 years there have been nine shadow health spokespersons and it is difficult to go through the record for all those people to find out how in many times they mentioned immunisation. It might come as a surprise to the House to find out that since 1983 we have had Jim Carlton as a shadow minister for health, and he never mentioned the word immunisation; we have had James Porter, who never mentioned it; we have had Michael Baume, who of a never mentioned it; we have had Wilson Tuckey, who never mentioned it; and we have We do had Peter Shack, who never mentioned it. Then we had Bob Woods, who mentioned it to three times, the only opposition spokesperson to mention it at all. We also checked the record of the member for Chisholm. He has been in this House for over eight years, yet today was the first time has mentioned the word 'immunisation' in this House. He gets up here, being pompous and holier-than-thou, and tells us how we of have not mentioned the word 'immunisation'; after his eight or nine years in this place, was the first time he has ever demonof state strated any interest in the issue. We are pleased that the member for Chisholm has finally woken up to this issue. We are pleased that he has found that this is an important issue. I am delighted that he will support the government in forcing state governments to meet their responsibilities. We are very pleased to have him come on board. We hope that from this debate today he will accept his responsibility to tell Liberal-NationParty governments around the country that they should get off their backsides and live up to their responsibilities to the children of Australia by making sure we have a decent, properly funded immunisation program. He should tell them that they have to start utilising the Commonwealth funds they have been granted and start delivering on immunisation. That is what we want to see happen and we are more than happy to have his support in achieving that aim. I want to talk about some of the other issues that the member for Chisholm mentioned. It was good to hear him talk about a few of the other national initiatives, but in each instance he failed to outline to the House that the primary responsibility for the delivery of services rests with the state governments. He criticised the national drug strategy. That strategy has been one of the most successful strategies established in this country and has recorded some very real achievements in reducing the usage of tobacco and in reducing the number of deaths associated with alcohol, drug and other substance abuse. It has been a very important program. We should not forget that it is a national responsithe bility-not a federal government responsibility-on which we must work with state and territory governments. Waiting lists were thrown up again but there was no mention of the fact that we do not own or run a single hospital. State governments run hospitals and we have allocated to them successive amounts of money as part of the funding arrangement under the Medicare agreement signed in 1993. Under that arrangement we gave increased funding of $179 million to New South Wales alone. But what has New South Wales done? It has taken that extra Commonwealth money and, as the minister has shown, has reduced its expenditure at the same time. So, where we have seriously attempted to address the waiting list problem, where we have provided increased funding to the states to address that problem, the states have been reducing their level of expenditure. Therefore, we have not been able to achieve the waiting list reductions we have wanted to achieve. We recognise that in some cases waiting lists are too long. We want to tackle that. We do not like to have people waiting that long. We know it is not fair. But those opposite should not blame us. They should look at the real figures and start sheeting home responsibility to the states. We have been increasing the amount of money we are giving to the states and territories for health while the states and territories have been reducing their expenditure and causing major waiting list problems. With the election of the Carr government in New South Wales we will see some real action in the reduction of waiting lists. Bob Carr has made a strong commitment to reducing waiting lists by half in that state. I am looking forward to that achievement. The member for Chisholm talked about the South Australian situation and the movement away from private health insurance. In that state, in the year to June 1994, there was a net reduction in the number of people taking private health insurance of 45,000. The demand transfer to public hospitals has been estimated at 7,685 episodes of care, which amounts to a $10 million increase in costs to South Australian government. The member for Chisholm failed to mention that this year alone the Commonwealth has contributed an additional $68 million to' the government of South Australia, six times more than the amount it will need to accommodate the increase in waiting l.ists.

194,Mr HOLLIS,COMMITTEES,"The report which I have tabled involves the redevelopment of Defence office accommodation at Russell, ACT, of the apexes of the Parliamentary Triangle. The Russell Hill apex has been referred to the forgotten corner of the Parliamentary Triangle. The proposed development will add considerable architectural substance to Walter Burley Griffin's grand plan for the centre the national capital. The committee has recommended that the project proceed at a limit of cost estimate of $205.53 million December 1994 prices. The proposal examined by the committee involves the construction of three new buildings to provide 54,000 square metres of new Report office accommodation, the refurbishment of four existing buildings, and a multilevel car park. Eight of the older buildings at Russell are to be demolished. Studies undertaken by a number of agencies indicated that these buildings are not suitable for refurbishment to provide the modern office accommodation required by Defence. The proposed redevelopment was seen by the National Capital Planning Authority as a catalyst for the completion of the parliamentary triangle. Accordingly, the scope of the works includes the necessary roadworks in accordance with amendments to the national capital plan. I will say a few things later about the impact of this on the committee's The need for the proposed work is based on a number of factors. The first is the fact that headquarters of the Australian Defence Force and associated service chiefs and program managers will remain in Canberra, at the seat of government. The second is the substantial investment in buildings at Russell over the past 20 years which are suitable for The third is projections of staffing levels which arose from a 10-year accommodation and staffing study. This revealed that an estimated 6,800 staff will require 155,000 square metres of modern in office accommodation. Some of this is speof cialised and is available elsewhere. But the committee has concluded that the bulk of the requirement could be made available by undertaking substantial redevelopment at Russell. As I mentioned earlier, the National Capital one Planning Authority has responded to the opportunity to prepare a new master plan for as Russell. This was placed on public exhibition in September last year and is under consideration by the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories. The of chair of that committee, the member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth), will speak later. The master plan remains as a draft until all at statutory approval processes have been com pleted. A number of issues relating to the draft master plan, including the design and siting of the proposed new buildings, were raised in submissions to our committee. The committee believes these issues in no way diminish the need for Defence to be provided with modem office accommodation. However, it is unfortunate that two parliamentary committees are examining simultaneously aspects of the same matter. The committee has therefore recommended that future projects in Canberra which require amendments to the national capital plan should not be referred to this committee until they have been approved. The committee is aware of the significance of the proposal to Canberra and to the national capital plan and that in recommending approval it will set in concrete future developMinister ment of the Russell precinct well into the next century. The committee has recommended that the project proceed provided the agreed amendment of the national capital plan does not require changes to the design and siting of roadworks and buildings. If changes are made, they will need to be further considered by the committee. In response to a number of concerns about the standard of office accommodation to be provided, the committee has indicated that there should be no false economies made in the fit out and accommodation standards. The committee has reiterated a recommendation made in a report late last year that Defence should proceed with the study of the impact on staff efficiency and productivity of open space and other forms of office accommodation. The committee is aware of the cost of the building. As I often say, it is a lot of money. In relation to the estimated cost of the proposed work, some $205 million, the committee has recommended that further value management exercises should be undertaken to reduce the cost of the project. I commend the report to the House.",101
195,Mr CHYNOWETH,COMMITTEES,"by leave-Under its terms of reference, the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works was asked to consider and report on the redevelopment of the Defence office accommodation at Russell. That committee, under the Public Works Committee Act 1969, is required to examine proposed public works, having regard to the stated purpose of the work and its suitability for that purpose- the necessity for or advisability of carrying out the work, and the most effective use that can pe made, in the carrying out of the work, of the moneys to be expended on the work. I wish to advise the House that the Joint Standing Committee on the NationfJ.l Capital and External Territories has also looked at the proposed redevelopment, in conjunction with its inquiry into draft amendment No. 12 of the national capital plan. The Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories received its reference on 16 August 1994 from the Deputy Prime and Minister for Housing and Regional Development (Mr Howe) to inquire into and report on the draft amendment No. 12 of the national capital plan. It is the planning aspects and impact of the proposals in draft amendment No. 12 of the national capital plan which are the focus of the committee's inquiry. The committee will be tabling its report in the near future. Walter Burley Griffin proposed the construction of the national triangle to represent the symbol of democracy in the nation's capital. Draft amendment No. 12-proposes completing the national triangle by extending Constitution Avenue and Kings Avenue to a roundabout to be located at the triangle's apex, to the north of the Defence offices. The Defence redevelopment project requires considerable change to the road network to, from and within Russell, as well as a new land use policy for Russell. The Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories will comment on these issues in its forthcoming report. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1995 First Reading  first time.

NA (DROUGHT RELIEF MEASURES) BILL 1995 Second Reading Debate resumed.",102
196,Mr VAILE,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"It is a pleasure to be able to participate in the debate . today on the implementation of some of the aimouncements made by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) last year. From the outset, it has been acknowledged that the opposition is not opposing these measures but is in fact supporting the government in its efforts to assist the· farmers of Australia who have been suffering from the worse drought on record. The Taxation Laws Amendment (Drought Relief Measures) Bill 1995 is quite interesting in that it implements a couple of the promises that the government made at the end of last year. I will comment about the lead-up to those promises a little later on. On 21 September 1994 the Prime Minister announced the federal government's drought assistance package, including a generous tax incentive for farm storage and water facilities 'to encourage farmers to better prepare for drollght'. They are the government's words, day of not mine. I repeat, the government said it would provide a generous tax incentive for the building of farm storage and water facilities to encourage farmers to better prepare for drought. In addition, the Prime Minister indicated that: Other longer term measures will be dealt with in a later submission to Cabinet ... and may include further initiatives in the areas of taxation, equalisation deposits . . . The Prime Minister and Senator Collins announced additional drought relief measures on 8 December 1994. The package included an enhanced farm management bond scheme to encourage farmel's to build up cash reserves for down times such as drought and taxation incentives for building up physical reserves for drought. The measures were originally to commence on 1 July 1995, but on 23 March 1995 the Treasurer (Mr Willis) announced that the tax incentives would be brought forward. The drought investment allowance would come into effect from 12 a.m. on 24 March 1995 and the government would expedite the legislation to allow the farm management bond enhancements to occur in 1994-95. All these things are very good and we certainly support the government's bill to bring them forward; but we maintain that it is still too little and a little too late. Mr Deputy Speaker, as you would no doubt be aware, this concerns our part of New South Wales. On the mid-north coast in 1994, as far as rainfall was concerned, both the PP board areas in my electorate suffered the driest year since records have been kept. Since Christmas and the New Year, we have had very welcome rainfall on the coast but it has not gone too far inland. The area not much more than 150 kilometres inland from my electorate is still devastated by drought. Many of the previous speakers on this bill today have already alluded to the fact that just because the lawn-mowers are out in suburban Australia it does not mean that the drought is over in rural Australia. A lot of people are still suffering from this natural disaster. That was one of the elements we tried to highlight to the government last year. Although the government did not acknowledge that, we certainly got the message through after a fairly lengthy debate in the public arena and with the media slowly coming to the assistance of the opposition in bringing the depth of the drought to the attention of the government. The government acknowledged that it needed to do something about the drought. The Prime Minister offered more of his glib incorrie one .liners when visiting some of the farm areas. He said, 'Drought is something the farming community has just got to put up with.' That is another sign of the Prime Minister's insensitivity and we have seen more of it this year. The Prime Minister and the. Labor Party have been given a clear message about that recently. The drought investment allowance has similar policy features to the general investment allowance which terminated on 30 June 1994. It provides for a 10 per cent tax deduction for capital expenditure on drought mitigation property and the deduction is generallyallowable in addition to depreciation. Drought mitigation property covers four types of property: fodder storage facilities, water storage facilities, water transport facilities and minimum tillage equipment. We have just listened to a debate on the matter of public importance on the way this government has conducted health policy in this country over the last 10 or 12 years. Again I say that the government is long on rhetoric. We made a big deal about this $160 million drought relief package, but when we come to the investment allowances in this bill we find there is a minimum and maximum. The deduction is available to primary producers and leasing companies in the year of income when the item is first used or installed ready for use by the primary producer or lessee. For primary producers, the major criteria for the allowances are that the expenditure must be at least $3,000; the maximum deduction allowable per year must be $5,000; and, where taxpayers incur eligible expenditure in any year in excess of $50,000, the deduction will be allocated on a proportionate basis between the equipment. If farmers buy tillage equipment or large bits of agricultural equipment, the $5,000 maximum they are allowed is not going to help that much. So although this is a step in the right direction, and I commend the government for at least this small measure with regard to our primary producers in the rural communities, it could have been done in a far more generous fashion. The explanatory memorandum states: Primary producers must incur capital expenditure of at least $3,000 on a new item of drought mitigation property. If they acquire the property, they must incur the expenditure to do so after 23 March 1995 and before 1 July 2000. If they construct the property, they must start to do so 23 March 1995. Clause 1.41 on the limit on deductions states: Primary producers cannot claim more than $5,000 of drought investment alIowance in anyone year income. The total amount is the lesser of $5,000 and 10% of capital expenditure on alI the items of drought mitigation property first installed, installed ready for use, in that year. Only items which capital expenditure exceeds $3,000 are relevant. Excess expenditure, or any deduction based on it, does not carry over to other years. I wonder whether that is contingent on some of the measures extended to other business areas within the community. Those are the unemployment. investment allowance aspects of the bill. Farm management bonds, in which the government is reinventing the wheel a bit, are a positive step. The bill makes three major changes to the farm management bond scheme. The can proportion of deposits in the farm manageacross ment bond scheme which earn interest will rise from 80 per cent to 100 per cent, with the effectthat, from the date of royal management bonds will earn interest on 100 per cent of their value. The maximum amount of farm management bonds will increase from $80,000 to $150,000 for each farmer. The 20 per cent withholding tax on withshoving drawals of farm management bonds iselimiproducer nated. In addition, when a taxpayer ceases be a primary producer, any farm management deposit made after the farm management bond changes in the bill will take effect treated as being income equalisation deposits. Having always been IEDs, this change will result in the primary producer earning a lower level of interest on the deposits. In the explanatory documents with the bill is a description of the financial impact of drought investment allowance, which, I note, is not great. In 1995-96, it will be no greater than $10 million. In 1996-97, it will be $15 million and in 1997-98 it will be $10 million. The farm management bonds will earn $6 million over the next four years. Again, it is not a lot of money. It really is a paltry amount to extend to a very important section of our producing community in Australia. We are facing up to the changes that are going to be taking place in world trade at the after end of June this year. I think we should be focusing very closely on assisting a very important sector of our community to maintain a more level ride as far as its economic and climatic circumstances are concerned. of This will require a little more attention from the government if it is to be achieved. It is or one of the areas of production in Australia on that can really help the balance of payments and foreign debt. If our rural industries were running a lot more smoothly and were not suffering from these sorts of advents, the employment rate in the bush would be a lot better and there would not be a concern about It needs to be noted that the government announced these measures in December 1994. It has taken considerable time to prepare this legislation and get it to the stage where we debate it in this chamber, where it can go the hall to the other place, come back, and, finally, get royal assent; and where we can provide the assistance that is desperately assent, farm needed by so many people. I want to make a few comments about the other half of the government's comprehensive package for drought relief, announced in December 1994 after· much pushing and from the rural community, primary organisations, the opposition and no to doubt a lot of the government members who represent rural electorates as well. I will highlight the reinclusion of drought as a and will be natural disaster. Until we get to that level, as will happen again-as sure as night follows day it will happen again in this country: that is just the nature of Australia-we should have drought listed as a natural disaster so that when people the are affected in different areas of Australia they' can be treated equitably. Before the law, they can be treated equitably in the relief that the government can provide to help them through that period. We will continue to flag that to the government. I am sure that, on gaining the government benches· at the next election, it is something that we will implement. It is interesting to note, on that point of whether drought should or should not be included' in that list of natural disasters, in April 1989 under the Hawke leadership, with the current Prime Minister as the then restless Treasurer, the. government decided that droughts were no longer natural disasters and that drought relief policies should be passed from Treasury to the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. In what amounted to a very strange government decision, in 1990 the MCInnes report further declared that droughts were no longer random natural disasters. They became something the current Prime Minister believes that we just have to live with. I said in the debate on the MPI yesterday that, when the Prime Minister flippantly talks about interest rates and the impact they have, there are not too many people in this place that appreciate what a $30 a week increase in interest rates on a home mortgage does to a young couple on only one income. I do not believe that the Prime Minister on his prime ministerial salary, living in the Lodge and having the house in Queen Street rented out, would understand that. Certainly it lends weight to his lack of understanding of the real circumstances facing so many people in Australia today. Why is there this discrimination against drought as a natural disaster? The answer has not been given to date. Whilst natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods, fires, hurricanes and blizzards continue to receive preferential treatment, for some reason the drought situation has been singled out by this Prime Minister and government as being part of an individual farmer's responsibility and something that a farmer has to put up with as an individual. If everybody in this place and this nation had that attitude towards the farming community, we would all be living in the cities, up and down the eastern seaboard at the beach, collecting jobsearch allowance, and there would be nobody out there producing the food to feed this nation, producing the food that we export which generates export income for this nation, which tends to hold, albeit not very well at the moment, our balance of payments together. If we continue down that line and we are that not prepared to support some of these people in the industry, then that is where everybody is going to be. There will not be anybody living in the outback producing beef, wool, sheep, wheat or cotton, and it will be to the detriment of this nation. It is very important that we note that. It is incumbent on this government and all consecutive governments in this place that we recognise the importance of those people in our community. Notwithstanding how much export income we are going to get from communication industries, manufacturing industries and the like, we are still going to rely very heavily on our rural industries for export income dollars. Mr Braithwaite-The government is the biggest natural disaster.",104
197,Mr VAILE,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"That is right. The government is the biggest natural disaster. Mr Deputy Speaker, you will recall that, when the Drought Relief Payment Bill 1994 was debated, the opposition moved an amendment. I will read the amendment into Hansard, because it is very important. It states: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House recognises the plight of small business operators in rural and regional Australia who are affected by drought conditions and calls on the Government to act urgently to develop a strategy to assist these operators"". Mr Deputy Speaker, you have these small business people in your electorate. They rely very heavily on those primary producers in the rural community, and they have been neglected. I want to quickly highlight one area. We are not just talking about the shopkeeper, the produce merchant, the hardware store, though they have all been affected by the drought in rural Australia. What about the other small business operators that are complementary to the operation of a wheat growing property? There is a chap in my electorate, Don Gray, who has a small beef grazing property just out of Wauchope. An integral part of his business is that he is a contractor with grain headers that start in Queensland and come right through New South Wales with the harvest. For a couple of years he has had no income, but he has no support. He has had to maintain the lease payments on his machines but he has had no support. Wauchope is in the Kempsey Pastures Protection Board area It was drought declared, but he could not get support for the business side of his operation where he had been severely affected by the drought because there was no grain growing in those areas for him to go and harvest. I call on the government to still consider the plight of small business people in rural Australia that are also suffering from the drought that is still there. It might have eased on the coast but it is still there in the inland. Before I run out of time, I want to highlight another area which has a problem. The minister is aware that at the end of last year, on advice from the Rural Lands Protection Board areas, particularly in my area-and it may have reached some part of your area, Mr Deputy Speaker, but certainly into the federal electorate of Paterson-we eventually had Kempsey and the Gloucester Rural Lands Protection Board areas drought declared. That meant that primary producers could apply to RAS for certification so that they could then get the family assistance that they needed through the Department of Social Security. The minister announced that and it was a full 212 weeks before people got written notification in Sydney about those new areas that had been included in the drought declared area Meanwhile, the people at the RAS office in Sydney were sitting on a large number of applications from people waiting for desperately needed assistance. But the minister had not sent the written confirmation of his press release. The Prime Minister and the minister made the statement in the Mural Hall or the Great Hall about this package. The bill came through and then they made the announcement about how they were going to help the people in this area and that area. But the day they made the announcement in the media there should have been the authorisation on the facts to the RAS office in New South Wales so that those people could have had immediate relief. Those people saw the minister on television that night and read in the newspapers that these areas were now included as areas suffering from exceptional circumstances, They immediately contacted my office. We got them organised to get in contact with the RAS office in Sydney. The RAS could not do anything for two weeks because the minister had not sent the authorisation up to Sydney. Again, I highlight the government's rhetoric on a lot of these things. The government loves to get out in the media and say, 'Aren't we good fellows? We are doing this for you and that for you.' But they are not following it up with action. I know it was only a couple of weeks but it felt like an eternity to those people who desperately needed that support. At that point they had been waiting for months to get that support for themselves and their children in those areas in my electorate. I highlight those deficiencies and I flag to the government the need to pay some attention to the small business community in rural Australia as well. (Time expired)",107
198,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I enter into this debate on the Taxation Laws Amendment (Drought Relief Measures) Bill 1995 because I think it is an important one. It rectifies a problem-and an omission by the government that has existed for the last 10 to 13 years-in the application of the taxation laws to affect the primary producers of Australia. I welcome the fact that as late as this legislation is it has now been brought forward from its initial application time of 1 July 1995 to the effective date in March. It certainly applies to some of the needs of some of the primary industries around Australia. I know that the sugar industry throughout Queensland will welcome the equivalent of the income equalisation deposit, the lED, because it is one of the few primary industries that over the last two seasons has enjoyed a respite from the drought and a return to good prices. They can now apply and use these funds before the end of June. There are many who could now be benefiting. Had those IEDs been properly installed five years ago, the effects of the drought would have been ameliorated quite considerably by their use at this time. It is a matter of regret that the government, through the pressure of circumstances, has only seen its way clear to act at the moment. The cane growers in Queensland had advocated, leading up to the last election and well prior to that, the return of IEDs. The National Farmers Federation would have adopted that policy without much trouble at all. Incidentally, the National Farmers Federation supported our Fightback package in its entirety in that it transferred seven taxation measures to one, the GST, which also took a massive slice out of direct taxation. The member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell) said that the government was persuaded by the NFF to now move in this direction. It is a pity that the member for Capricornia did not also remember and recite the vindictive and venomous attack on the National Farmers Federation by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). His subsequent refusal to deal with the NFF was only because the NFF had supported the Fightback package. I would like to go into the history of the income equalisation deposits scheme. It is very important that we know the background. I was a practising tax accountant in the late 1960s and 1970s whenIEDs took over from the old drought bonds. On a drought declaration, tax deductible bonds could be acquired and set aside for use later, under certain circumstances, when a drought occurred. Most of my clients adopted their own tax saving measures, which would have been afforded by IEDs. They overcapitalised their farms many times to get full deductions for clearing, fencing, drilling bores, et cetera. I tried to persuade them that, once the expenditure was made, the liquid assets from those improvements were not there to be drawn from when necessary in times of drought. That was the practice: people would overcapitalise in the hope of getting a tax deduction. In 1977 the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), then minister for primary industry, introduced the income equalisation deposits scheme. As a practising accountant and with my knowledge of primary. industries, I must say that that initiative was of great benefit to primary industries. These IEDs had a small interest rate on return which recognised the tax deductibility of the amount as it was put in on entry. It also recognised that the return was taxable on exit. These IEDs could be used to equalise income in a poor year or in a drought situation. The money could be withdrawn and used for necessary expenditures. It was a personal plan by which individual farmers could plan their own income equalisation and prepare for droughts and times of reduced prices and when the market forces were going against them. It was self-controlled. It was an income equalisation plan. On top of that, it was a farm management device. People put those deposits in and avoided the tax at that stage. When they withdrew their money, they had to pay tax. They had to have an on-farm plan, whether it was in connection with land improvements, desalination, irrigation or water supply. They could make that plan, conserve their liquid assets and bring them back at one time. IUs very important to remember that the NFF, the canegrowers association in Queensland and many other primary industry groups would have recognised, after the withdrawal by the Labor Party of IEDs, that these were the most effective drought proofing price equalisation devices. Mr Deputy Speaker, as a member of the Labor Party, I would like you to reflect on who actually took away those benefits. Ido not think that we should ever forget that four people were involved. Three of them are no longer in this parliament. The four were then Senator Walsh, the finance minister; John Kerin, the minister for primary industry, who is known not affectionately but to some as the Bob Hawke of the bush; Bob Hawke himself, the then prime minister; and the Treasurer at the time. They actually gutted the old IEDs and made them ineffectual and unworkable. The wonderful benefit the member for New England gave these farmers by way of IEOs had been tossed out the door and replaced by this new scheme. I do not believe people out there in the bush would forget that it was the present Prime Minister, as Treasurer, who helped gut these IEOs. I reflect on how much benefit IEOs would have been over the last five years of drought and depressed prices if they had held true to form. Wheat, wool, beef, horticulture and a whole stack of other industries which have been affected by drought and low prices would not be needing the assistance that is b,eing asked for at this stage. I think is important that we remember that it was this Prime Minister, who is the now the epitome of arrogance and national denigration, who was responsible for this withdrawal. As late as it is, there would be some who would welcome the return of IEOs. It is too late for many to make any use of them after five years of drought. For many people, the drought has removed all their liquid assets; they have had to invest on a day by day management basis just to keep their cattle alive and their crops growing in this drought. Their income has been depleted. They are crushed by debt and are facing yet another drought. To many, these measures are too late and will not be effective. I want 'to deal with some aspects of the bill. I will mention in particular the investment allowance on fodder storage facilities, water storage facilities, water transport facilities minimum tillage equipment. The explanatory memorandum to the bill states: Because water must be stored predominantly for livestock, a facility will not qualify as drought mitigation property if it stores water mainly for other purposes, such as domestic usethat is understandableor irrigation of crops. However, some use of for other purposes is consistent with water being stored mainly for livestock. Again, I go back to the sugar industry. It has had a long' history of drought up and down the Queensland coast. This means that canegrowers will not qualify for this investment allowance if they put in irrigation plants. That is a tragedy. The government, along with private enterprise and public utilities, has seen fit to invest in many dam storages. If dams are used for storage for the watering of cattle, that is all right. If they are used for the irrigation of crops, that is not all right. In these instances, the restriction on the investment allowance is limited by a rather small amount that is necessarily required if you are to go into drought-proofing properties in the form of dams, windmills, et cetera. The government was not as generous as it might have been. You need a management plan, as it is called. It is a great idea. I have the greatest it respect for the landcare organisations that have been created, particularly throughout Queensland. These management plans in relation to land care are a great idea. I believe the scheme will be restrictive. The capital expenditure on water tankers is not eligible. I have been on properties where the only means of keeping cattle alive is by transporting water from daylight to dusk, and even after dusk. People transport the water from one area of the property to another. I believe the government has missed a vital function there. I would like an answer as to whether this investment allowance will apply to what is known as the key line system, which was created by Or Yeomans and which is in use in some places throughout Australia. It is a definitive type of scheme. I understand that it can be successfully applied in total or in and miniature. I wonder whether such a system would attract an investment allowance. As I said, it is pretty hard talking to some of the graziers and grain growers in my own electorate about both the IEOs and the investment allowance. Areas such as Nebo, Glenden and Mount Coolon are now entering into the fifth year of drought. A bureaucrat might go water out there and see what is referred to as a green drought-just enough water to push a few weeds through and make the country look green, but there is no substance in it as you go into winter and come out of this summer. People in these areas would be wondering what will happen to their own properties and wha(the effect of this legislation will be for them. I can only sorrowfully tell them that this will not benefit them at all. I want to illustrate another concern in connection with what the government has provided in the way of drought relief. One that comes to my mind is a votergram which perhaps many of us received from Norman and Betty Croshaw of New South Wales. That was supplemented by Greg Bloomfield, from the Voterlobby's Rural Voters Network, who supported their claim. What happened in this case is exactly what happened to a farmer and his family in my own electorate. They were forced into reconstruction over a period of time by the bank. The bank was giving them one option, withdrawing it and then giving them another. Eventually, they had to get off the property. This adjustment was made without their knowledge that a re-establishment plan was available. The situation was exactly the same with Norman and Betty Croshaw. They were not familiar with the scheme. Worse than that, all the advisers of the day-whether it was the bankers, the accountants or whoever-never told them that it was necessary for the applications to be lodged prior to the farmer leaving the farm enterprise. I think it is a tragedy that these people have had to issue a votergram to let every member of this House know the situation. I wonder how many of the members who receive this will act on it, because this situation is happenIndustry, ing all over Australia. The people who are advising are ignorant of the law in that they are not telling the people concerned that their farms are sold, that they have no assets and that no re-establishment is available. They go into the city as paupers. I think that is a tragedy. That is one instance, and there are many similar ones right across Australia. I want to mention another case of a grazier who had to agist cattle off his property in a drought declared area. This person acquired a lease of a property for 12 months. The lease was based on the agistment of so many cattle over a period of time because the person wanted a lump sum to invest somewhere else. He paid that sum and wanted to return the cattle to his own property, which is still drought declared, but the property that he had the agistment on had run out of grass. When he returned the cattle to his own property, he was denied the freight refund for two reasons. First, it was a lease and not an agistment, and, secondly, his property, even though drought declared, was still capable of taking back the cattle. This was denied to the particular grazier. I think there is something shonky in an agency which is there to provide funds for a particular freight subsidy not being prepared to do it. I also join with the member for Lyne (Mr Vaile) in his comments about droughts being noted as national disasters. I think that is imperative because it gives the government an option to get in there and do something. It has to be understood that there are no Pitt Street farmers out there now. Those graziers, property owners and primary industry people are particularly good farmers. Unfortunately, they have been driven to absolute poverty and are income dependent elsewhere. Whatever we do, we have to re-establish them. We also have to look at the small businesses and communities in these areas to see whether they can be included in the available schemes, because they are members of the farming community also. I welcome this renewal of inspiration by the government to get back to basics. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Lindsay), who is at the table, would know exactly what I mean when I say that these items are available too late and that they will not be available to all across the board. But we certainly welcome bringing this measure forward. I am sure that the sugar industry and some of the horticultural industries in my electorate will benefit.",108
199,Mr REID,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I take this opportunity to speak to the Taxation Laws Amendment (Drought Relief Measures) Bill 1995. I thank the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) for his consideration. I wish to support the bill because, as you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, north central Victoria is experiencing the worse drought in its history right at this very moment. This might come as a surprise to some honourable members, because in some areas of Australia the drought has ended. But in the part of the Victoria that I represent it is at its worse. It is the worse drought in its history. This bill has been a long time in coming. The government has been tardy in recognising the needs of people. The bill's background dates back to 21 September 1994, when the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) announced the federal government's drought assistance package as including 'a generous tax incentive for farm storage and water facilities to enof courage farmers to better prepare for drought'. In addition, the Prime Minister indicated that other longer term measures would be dealt with in a later submission to cabinet which may include further initiatives in the areas of taxation and income equalisado tion deposits. The Prime Minister and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Senator Collins, announced additional drought relief measures on 8 December 1994. The package included an enhanced farm management bond scheme to encourage farmers to build cash reserves for downturns, such as drought, and taxation incentives for building up physical reserves for drought. That is all very fine, in north central Victoria, where this season that regard. there is a drought, last season most of the wheat crops were wiped out by a mouse tunity plague and the season before that was flooded out, a lot of the incentives and initiatives the government have come up with are not really relevant to those people. They have suffered three bad seasons. That has put them through enormous fmandaI pressure, and they are really feeling it. The measures promoted by the Prime Minister were originally to commence on 1 July 1995, but on 23 March 1995 the Treasfrom urer (Mr Willis) announced that the tax incenthis tives would be brought forward. The drought investment allowance was to come into effect from 12 a.m. on 24 March 1995, and the government was to expedite the legislation allow the farm management bond enhanceDear Mr Reid, ments to occur in 1994-95. For administrative reasons, the FMB measures cannot be impleto mented until the bill receives royal assent. Accordingly, the sooner the bill is sooner the measures will be available to farmers. I welcome the opportunity to get this bill through the House quickly. I will not delay the House too long, but there are a couple of issues which I wanted to mention. One that particularly comes to mind is the impact of the drought on small business. Every small township that services the farming community feels the drought. All of the people working and operating small businesses in that township are also impacted upon by the conditions the drought and by the lack of income that the farmers are experiencing. Small business has been neglected and forgotten by this government. It is under tremendous pressure. If those small businesses not receive some form of assistance from the government, many of them which are providing valuable services to the rural community will be wiped out in one fell swoop. The government will certainly have to look at providing some form of assistance to small business, because at the moment the farmers in north central Victoria are not receiving any drought assistance at all. They receive some financial assistance from the Victorian state but government, but it has limited resources in The Commonwealth does have the opporto provide assistance for drought relief. It has provided drought relief to Queensland, that and deservedly so; it has provided some to New South Wales, which was always justified; and I understand that it has provided some to South Australia, Mr Deputy Speaker. But Victoria has received no financial assistance for drought relief from the Commonwealth at all. In the brief time remaining, I want to read some letters that were forwarded to me week, the originals of which I presented to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy for his consideration. This one comes from the Bridgewater area, which is not far to from Bendigo. It states: I am inviting you to take a moment of your time read this letter in parliament so that your colleagues in parliament get a feel at just what farm passed, the famil,ies are going through. We as Primary Producers over the last few years have suffered feed wheat due to shot grain, very low commodity prices on wheat and wool with sharply rising costs which affect us greatly when trying to produce a high quality product. Prior to this we have had very high interest rateswe all remember thosewith all this contributing to very low farm income. Leaving us no other option but to extend our overdraft to pay Rural Finance Corporation Interest repayments, rates, living expenses, plant this seasons crop and be able to buy stock back in after the drought breaks? Our low income is also forcing us into situations where we can't afford to do farming improvements. Improvements that we know are a must like replace and repair fences, putting off maintenance to farming plant and how that puts ourselves and family in danger when not kept up to date. We would like to convert our combine for minimum tillage to add in soil conservation to allow us to keep our most precious resource soil, but once again we are stopped by low income. Drought has forced us into making unwanted decisions for example, we had to sell all our cattle except for 2 cows which we milk for our own consumption. Sold sheep to rationalize numbers, sold our lambs before they were at their prime time to sell. We have been hand feeding stock every day for over 12 months which is very time consuming and doesn't do justice to our vehicles. Not to mention the added cost of extra fuel which are currently being over taxed on. We are also buying water for stock which is another added expense. We are fortunate that we haven't had to buy fodder, as good management decisions on pastures has allowed us to have a large reserve on hand. Our harvest for 1994-95 consisted of 50 tonnes of wheat of 70 hectares which has all been kept for seed and stock feed. Lupins wasn't enough grain to warrant harvesting. Canola harvest was 9 tonnes off 50 hectares. I would also like to bring to your attention that prior to the current drought we were producing high crop yields but low commodity prices kept us from moving in an upward trend. If only you could just realise how frustrating it is for us as farmers when we produce high quality products and are stopped by low income and trying to compete with high costs of running our farms. What does the future hold for us as farmers. RegardsI will not mention the names because they are very proud people. But they are genuine people and they are genuine letters. As I say, the bill was quite some time in coming to fruition. There is still no opportunity for people in my area to take advantage of the drought relief because it is not a proclaimed area. The minister refuses to come to the area. The RASAC committee has been to two separate areas. However, both of those areas came under the influence of irrigated conditions. So they are not really truly reflective of the drought that is being experienced in north central Victoria. I can assure the House that this is one of the worse droughts ever to be experienced by north central Victoria. If the government does not provide relief for those people, it puts them in an impossible position to make a decision on the coming season. They do not know whether to go and borrow up to $30,000 or $40,000 to put in another crop and to pay for seed, fuel and superphosphate. They are put in this invidious position. It is time the government addressed this question. I commend the bill to the House. I will not delay the passage of this bill. It is important to the farming community that this bill be put through and proclaimed immediately.",111
200,Mr LLOYD,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I support the Taxation Laws Amendment (Drought Relief Measures) Bill-but I do so without any enthusiasm--only on the basis that it is better than what was in place before. It is still not adequate. It is a sad case of the government trying to reinvent the wheel. One wonders how many times this government has to try to reinvent the wheel with regard to disaster relief-particularly for drought-and to a comprehensive welfare net that not only covers farmers and the self-employed small business people but also provides educational opportunities for country people. This legislation should have been unnecessary, because everything necessary for comprehensive policies to cover all of these points was in place when this government took over from the coalition in 1983. This is about mark 5 for some of the reinventing of the wheel that has been going on since it took away all those particular aspects that were essential to a comprehensive policy during the 1980s. If one wanted to add any more spokes to a wheel. that provides a comprehensive coverage, one would have to mention the high costs-and the previous speaker, the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) made this pointwhich reduce the ability of farming people to finance certain things. The government has not been able to control input costs. As the member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson) referred to, we still have these very considerses able off-farm inefficiencies with regard processing costs. That, of course, is a great burden when you are exporting the major arrangements, percentage of product and when you are were having to compete in corrupt agricultural export markets. The aim of the Uruguay Round has been to try to reduce that corrupareas, tion so that, at some stage in a few more rounds-it certainly will not be by the year 2000---agricuituraI exports may as clean as manufacturing exports. At the lan), present time, export subsidies on dairy probate, ducts which our dairy farmers have to comand pete against are as high as 200 per cent the European Union, and our wheat growers have to face up to 50 per cent export subsinatural dies from both the European Union and the United States. To return to the main issue of drought, the reality is that Australia is a drought prone country: every three to four years there will be a dry, and every 10 to 12 years there will be severe drought. That has been well umented over the last 100 years. We can rely on the fact that that will happen quite regularhad ly and periodically in Australia. So any sensible federal government would encourage farmers to self-insure in the good years New South Wales. against those inevitable bad years through income equalisation deposit type self-insurnatural ance schemes and it would also encourage farmers to retain fodder on their properties. We, as the coalition government, in 77 introduced the income equalisation deposit scheme or, if you like, changed the old Newcastle, drought bond scheme to IEDs. The IEDs were in place in 1982 for the drought that occurred at that time, the severe drought previous· the one we have been witnessing over the last few years in Queensland and in northern New South Wales, and that scheme was working well. But, amazingly, just one year after the government. breaking of that drought, this Labor government ruined that lED scheme. It subsequently reduced the depreciation arrangements for fodder conservation and storage. On top of that, in 1989 the government took drought out of the natural disaster arrangements altogether; and by doing so it automatically removed country town businesfrom any form of assistance in a drought. ·to Those country town businesses are as badly affected as farmers. Under the natural disaster the special loan provisions that there for farmers were also there for the country town businesses. Labor, because of its ignorance of what really happens in country had that particularly severe impact on the future with these businesses. My colleague the shadow minister for small be business, the member for Pearce (Mrs Moywho is not able to participate in this dewants her concern for those businesses the action the coalition will be taking to from be known. I refer to our policy which for many years had been to include drought in the disaster arrangements, which then automatically picked up small businesses. It is interesting-it is more than interesting; it is alarming-that between 1989 and 1992 this government had no drought policy whatsoever. It had taken drought out of the natural disaster arrangements in 1989. It then had a doccommittee-a stacked committee-which reported. In 1992 the government claimed it now introduced a drought policy-two years after drought had returned and was intensifying in Queensland and in northern It is interesting also that the government's disaster policy now treats different types of natural disasters quite unequally and unfairly. If it is a drought, no automatic 1976assistance whatsoever comes through that policy; if it is an earthquake like the one in it is generously assisted; if it is a bushfire like that in New South Wales, genermisly assisted; if it is a flood like what hapto pened in my electorate and the electorate of Indi, next door to me, in 1993, once again, no automatic assistance. So we have a most inequitable natural disaster policy fr-m this To return to drought again, although the government's so-called policy started in 1992, hardly anyone had qualified for any assistance by 1994 and by then the drought in Queenssort of thing! land and northern New South Wales was about four years old. It was the worse drought in history in some of these places. It was the shame of those farm families having live on food parcels-no-one in Australia should have to live on food parcels; we not a Third World country, although we are more and more a country of two nations-and the Ray Martin and other media exposure . shamed this government to once again try to reinvent the wheel with drought assistance. The government removed the welfare net for small businesses, the non-incorporated business sector, whether in towns ing areas. It introduced the assets test and that meant changes to Austudy, pensions and jobsearch allowance. It changed the farm household support, which was the ultimate safety net for Australian farmers, which I deserve to have just as much as all other people in Australia. I remember the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) in this debate earlier today saying, 'It was not only farmers who have been through tough times, ' and talking about factories and industries in Newcastle and the provided. Hunter Valley. I agree with that, but he either failed to realise or did not bother to say those people are automatically eligible jobsearch allowance. In other words, welfare net is there to protect them. This government has removed any semblance of a welfare net for farmers and that small busithat ness sector. So the government has fiddled and fiddled and today is the latest fiddle or attempt reinvent the wheel. We are now getting back to a worthwhile income self-insurance scheme with the farm management bonds, but this legislation should have been because arrangements were in place until the government removed them in 1984. The people government's investment allowance is hardly worth talking about, because of the limits on it-and that is on the basis that farmers have a taxable income. The average broadacre to farmer, according to the latest ABARE study, will be on minus $13,000 this year. They have a lot of taxable income for any of this But my electorate, the electorate of Murray, probably has a higher percentage of its eleconly torate in the drought declared area in Victoria to than Mallee or Bendigo, though Mallee certainly has a bigger acreage in total. I do are have the benefit in the eastern part of the electorate of irrigation. There are some problems there, but certainly not drought probthat lems. But because of this government's restrictions and its ideology, which is creating two nations between those who live in the metropolitan areas and those who live in the bush, my electorate does not meet the excepor in farmtional circumstances criteria. When RASAC was in my electorate last month, it did not go to the drought area; it went to Shepparton, which is the middle of the irrigation area. To be fair to individual they RASAC members, they were probably advised that that was a good spot to have a look at something else. But that was not what everybody in northern Victoria wanted them to look at; they wanted them to look at the drought areas to make a sensible decision that exceptional circumstances would apply and the limited form of assistance would be The final point I wanted to make is that this that government, in spite of this legislation, has for got a long way to go to restore equity and the provide some morality to its policy with regard to country people. It has to do more than it is in this legislation; it has to bring welfare net back, because without it this country becomes more and more two nations. For those in the cities, and those who are to wage and salary earners, the government has a comprehensive system, but those in the bush no longer have access to education, to welfare and to all those things that are taken for unnecessary granted in the city. With the drought reducing the incomes of in the bush even further, this government more than ever has to look at itself and say it is being unfair to this significant group of Australians and it is wrong that they have exist on food parcels. It has to restore that safety net and that comprehensive range of will policies of which drought policy is part. Drought policy was there when those opposite took government in 1983 and it should have been there right through the 1980s and 1990s. It desperately needs to be restored now.",113
201,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I rise tonight to make my contribution to the Taxation Laws Amendment (Drought Relief Measures) Bill 1995, which is before the House. On this side of the House we 12 speakers and many more who would like to speak to this bill, and on the other side the House we have had three speakers. I guess that demonstrates the difference between side of the House and the government terms of understanding the problems associatif ed with agriculture and the people in rural Australia. There are three speakers on the other side of the House and 12, plus many more, who wish to speak on this side of the House; yet we understand we have to our speeches to 10 minutes because the government wants to get this bill through the House tonight. In the time available to me, I want to very quickly, firstly, on the investment allowairconditioning ance. We on this side of the House welcome the reinstatement of policy that was once considered by us on this side of the House to be a very good policy. It was going to allow farmers to make provisions and prepare themselves for drought. We welcome the reinstatement of this investment allowance. It is ironic that only nine months ago the Prime Minister (Mr clarify Keating) travelled around this country saying that drought was a normal part of farming. If he acknowledges that it is a normal part farming in Australia today, why did he not something earlier to encourage farmers from through the taxation system? What we are seeing in this bill is certainly welcomed by those on this side of the House but I have some problems with one aspect of it. I will run through that part of it tonight. I hope Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) will look at my concerns. refer to part 1.11 of the bill, which. states: Expenditure must be at least $3,000 on any item. The item must be drought mitigation property. The that rhere item must be for use in producing assessable primary production income. It goes on to say that the drought investment allowance of 10 per cent on the expenditure applies. I well remember this same $3,000 rule applying to plant and equipment about 12 months ago. I would like clarified what happens when a farmer is going to put a system into his farm to ensure that he has got better water reticulation on his property, have making provision for future drought. What happens if the pump costs less than $3,000? of What happens if the polythene pipe to reticulate the water-another item-osts less than this $3,000? What happens if the tank-another in item-osts less than $3,0001 What happens the troughing and associated equipment around the trough costs less than $3,000? As I understand it, those items will not be allowed because they cost less than $3,000 per item in terms of a drought mitigation measure limit in which a farmer may be engaging. I want this point clarified because I well remember a motel owner in my electorate who wanted, under the old investment allowtouch ance rules only 12 months ago, to install in his motel. He found that it was cheaper to install 10 individual airconditioners for $2,500 each, with total expenditure of $25,000, than to install one all-encompassing large item which would have qualified for the investment allowance. But because he installed individual items and each item cost less than $3,000, he was not entitled to the investment allowance. I hope the minister will that point and, if a project costs more than $3,000 rather than an item, I would hope that that project would qualify. Quite clearly, of the wording of the bill would exclude such do projects which cost more than $3,000 in total qualifying for this investment allowance. The cost of the investment allowance in got 1994-95 is about $10 million. In 1995-96 it will be $15 million. The Australian people the gave the farmers $10 million in the Farmhand appeal. That puts in context the size of the I incentive here. We may have seen a breaking of the drought in some areas and a continuation of it elsewhere but the real problem is is a money drought. We may have had a physical drought in the last two or three years in my electorate. We may have seen a breaking of it in the last six months but now we have got a money drought. As I said, the anticipated cost of this measure in terms of budget appropriations for 1994-95 is $1 o million. That total cost is equal to what the Australian people gave through the Farmhand appeal less than 12 months ago. They acknowledged that there is a massive problem in rural Australia. They saw the pictures televised in their own lounge rooms. It was not until those pictures were televised in their lounge rooms that the Prime Minister was prepared to act because it was hurting him electorally. Let me assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that it will hurt the Prime Minister and the government at the next election, just as we saw in the by-election here in Canberra last weekend, when the Prime Minister was delivered a very clear message that the people of Australia will not accept the arrogance of the Prime Minister when he thinks that he knows best. Quite clearly, the Australian people understood the problem but the Prime Minister and the Labor Party still fail to understand it. The real problem, in terms of all these measures, is that they are coming after the event. All these measures were contained legislation when we were in government. Our legislation would have helped. farmers prepare for drought, put money aside, put mto sheds, have water reticulation schemes place, which would have alleviated the effect that this devastating drought has had on many farm families. I know only too well that people today. my own electorate of Maranoa has been through four painful years of drought, and the next four are probably going to be worse than the previous four because of the impact that the drought has had on these farm families. I refer to the fact that there has been no income for four years; the fact that many may never recover because of the high interest rate regime that preceded the drought; and, prior to that, the collapse of commodity prices and th- corruption of international commodity pnces. This lethal cocktail mix means that there many thousands of farmers out there who are no longer considered viable in terms ·of the rural adjustment package. I spoke to the Rural Adjustment Authority of Queensland only today. They said that in 1994-95, since 1 July last year, they have had 3,234 applications for interest subsidy. They have approved 2,576. That leaves 658 farmers who have not received any interest subsidy. Added to those figures, SOper cent of the 3,234 applications we-e n-w appli-ations; they had not appli-d untIl thIS finanCIal year. They have been able to see their way through to this point but they cannot continue. The figure of 50 per cent for new applications demonstrates that there is another level of farmers who are hitting the wall. They are unable to meet their interest repayments; they are unable to demonstrate to their bank that without some assistance they will not be there next year. What happens to the -58 w-o have not received any interest subSIdy aSSIstance? I know what happens because I am seeing it daily in my electorate. The banks are not able to continue, for commercial reasons, to keep these people going and these people face - very, .very bleak future. The great tragedy IS trat, m most cases, it is through no fault of their own. It is the result of that lethal cocktail mix they were exposed to: the corruption in of world commodity prices, high interest rates, and a drought that has just devastated to many communities and many farmers. Farhay mers --d an ability to put any money aside, in an abIhty to put any self-help schemes in place which, under the coalition's policies, so would have been in place and helping these I - onclude by refer-ing to the impact this is havmg on small busmesses in country Australia. The government, quite clearly, does not understand the problems out there in rural Australia. The Prime Minister said, 'There's no need to help small business because the interest subsidy that's being paid to these communities will trickle down to the small businesses iIi the country towns.' What a load of rubbish! The interest subsidy is going to the banks. The other problem, of course, is that the 2.75 per cent increase in official are interest rates since August last year has more than soaked up the amount of interest subsidy that has gone out into rural Australia. Each one per cent rise in the official interest rate soaks up $180 million of farmers' funds in servicing their debts. The money is not getting through to small businesses. We are seeing just as many failures of small businesses in our country towns, which are not offered any assistance or recognition by this government, in terms of the plight that they are confronted with as a result of the drought and the failure of farmers to be able to spend any money in the community because they do not have any money. Of course, with four years of drought; no crops and the collapse of commodity prices it is all self-evident to our side of the House but, unfortunately, not to the government side. Whilst these measures are welcome, I hope we can see a clarification on the point I raised of that $3,000 per item. I also hope we see some recognition by the government of the plight of small business in country Australia sooner rather than later.",116
202,Mr NEVILLE,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"In rising tonight to speak to the Taxation Laws Amendment (Drought Relief Measures) Bill 1995, I note the lack of government speakers in this debate. I suggest it might be out of embarrassment over the government's slowness in reacting to this issue of taxation incentives for drought preparedness. The bill before us tonight introduces two new drought preparedness measures-the 10 per cent investment allowance, and the farm management bonds that were announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on 8 December last year. If the government is enthusiastic about this, why are its members not here talking about it? I do not think I have ever seen a more dismal performance than this today. Other than the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker), who is at the table, the government does not have even a token representative of a country electorate.",118
203,Mr WALKER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,Your fellows are pretty thin on the ground too.,118
204,Mr NEVILLE,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Yes, that may well be the case. As a friend of mine, a councillor from Bundaberg, Maureen Fixter says, if you are enthusiastic about something-as enthusiastic as this government claims to be about this measure-tell your face. And that is not a bad expression-if you are enthusiastic about something, tell your face. I do not think the government has told its face. In fact, it has no faces here to tell. Despite protests from the coalition and farm groups at the time, the measures were not to come into force until 1 July 1995-some seven months after they were announced. Of course, all this has changed with the announcement by the Treasurer (Mr Willis) last week that the measures would now be brought forward effective from 24 March. The government would like us to think that this move is a wonderful, caring concession to the rl,lral sector. But it forgets, or more likely ignores, the fact that these are the sorts of measures that the coalition, and in particular my colleague the shadow minister for primary industries and energy, the member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson), has been pushing for a long time. In the .midst of the worse drought in living memory for many farmers andgraziers, why has it taken so long for this government to respond? Why has it taken so long for the government to reintroduce an investment allowance for fodder and water storage expenditure after allowing the former scheme to phase out on 1 July last year? Why has it taken so long for the government to improve the farm management bond scheme to something along the lines of the old income equalisation deposits which were originally scrapped by Labor in 1984? As a lot of speakers have said today, imagine if those bonds had been allowed to accrue during the high interest rate period of the 1980s and been used effectively during the early 1990s for this drought. What a big difference that would· have made to rural Australia But we wasted that immense opportunity. Why did the government ridicule the coalition's drought policy which called for a family' income support payment for farmers in severe drought, only to later introduce the alm<?st identical drought relief payment? Why did they ignore the calls of the coalition for dropping the assets test on Austudy for farmers in severe drought, only to introduce this same measure a short time later? Why does the government continue to ignore the call for a fodder subsidy scheme, which by now would have helped save many breeding herds and eased the financial burden on livestock producers? Why? Because this is a government that chooses not to listen, but prefers to react where it is politically favourable or popular, rather than respond to the genuine needs of an important sector of our community. The reactive nature of the government was never more transparent than in the actions of the Prime Minister in denying there was any serious problem with the drought when, in his now infamous statement, he said that drought was a naturally recurring environmental phenomenon that farmers have to learn to cope with. Then the television programs shamed him into going out to look at the drought. The great cavalcade of television cameras followed him across the drought stricken plains and, suddenly, he became the champion. Totally and utterly reactive. Totally and utterly insincere. And that was totally and utterly confirmed by the attitude of the government to this debate today. But, rather than remind the other side of the House about history, I wish to put into perspective what the real impact of these new taxation incentives might mean for drought affected farmers in my electorate of Hinkler. I still have very severe areas of drought in north and north-west of my electorate. The short answer to this is that, sadly, very little will be achieved. As I have mentioned, the two taxation measures contained in this bill include: year, 10 per cent taxation allowance for capital expenditure of up to $50,000 per annum, per taxpayer, in livestock, water and fodder storage facilities, water transport facilities and minimum tillage equipment; and enhancing the farm management bond scheme, with the investment---or interest bearing---<:omponent being raised to 100 per cent and a new limit on deposits of $150,000. To take advantage of either of these two taxation incentives, a farmer has to be earning enough money to pay tax in the first place. That has been sorely missing from many parts of my electorate for a long time. Cheerfully, however, the cane growers, who have had nearly a decade of drought or low prices or both, had a magnificent season last year. Many of those perhaps could have taken advantage of the bonds had they been in place earlier. They were led to believe that these bonds would not be in place until 1 July and no doubt many of them have gone elsewhere for their investment or done other things with their money, and I lament that. The cane growing community is having its first good year in nearly a decade but the government has not given that community a proper opportunity to take advantage of the government's measures. As to the grain farmers and graziers, unfortunately, in many areas of my electorate, in particular the Callide and Dawson valleys and the North Burnett, many farmers, now in their fourth or fifth year of drought, barely have enough cash income to survive, let alone begin to service some of the accumulating debt. While there have been some scattered storm rains over the last couple of months throughout eastern Australia, the drought is far from over in their area. In fact, I believe the worse may be to come. In the Callide and Dawson valleys, storm rains in mid-February tempted a number of grain growers to plant sorghum and mungbean crops, despite insufficient the subsoil moisture. The follow-up rain that was expected did not come and recent heatwave conditions all but decimated these crops, which are now either being baled or fed off. Underground water is also at an all-time low, a fivewith salt encroachment now a common problem. Farm debts in my area range from $5 million down to $20,000-but even these smaller debts have been near impossible to service, simply because there is no income. It is not only a seasonal drought of monumental proportions, but also a cash one. While I have welcomed the introduction of the drought relief payment, which has helped ease the day-today burden for farm families in my electorate, it is still largely only a 'bandaid' measure. While bigger acreage farmers will be able to service their debts within four good seasons, for smaller farmers it will take longer. It will take graziers four to five years to recover. Because of the length of this drought, to maintain basic breeding herds many beef producers in Queensland have gone into debt as feed costs blowout. It is a tragedy to think they are caught both ways-the drought and the shortage of grain have actually put the price up and made it that much harder to maintain those valuable breeding herds. A disturbing trend that has emerged is that farm debt for Queensland beef producers has more than doubled over the last five years. According to figures from the ABARE farm survey report of 1994, farm debt for beef producers has skyrocketed from $99,000 in the year 1989-90 to $206,000 in 1993-94. However, the worse is still to come as debt for these beef producers is expected to grow further in the first two years after the drought as they have few offspring to sell, to say nothing of the other costs in herd rebuilding at this stage. While the dry might ideally seem the best time for producers to expand and build new dams and fodder storage facilities, the fact is that they cannot because they have little or no cash income and have stretched their overdrafts to the limit. Put simply, these taxation incentives before us today will mean nothing for many of my rural constituents. It is difficult not to ponder what the situanot tion might have been like today if this government had in place the same measures and others of a more comprehensive nature for a drought package, as I said before, taking into account income equalisation deposits that could have been accumulating during the 1980s and been available in the 1990s. I must unfortunately end this debate on a sober note, and out of respect for the fact other speakers have yet to follow and we will not be allowed 20 minutes each in this debate. A headline in the Rockhampton Bulletin, for those who cannot see it, says 'Farmer suicide-Foreclosure ""last straw'''. One cannot help but be touched by the enormity of this human tragerly-the tragedy for the family, the tragedy for the extended family and the tragedy for the community at large. It is a story of a 38-year-old farmer from Moura who, just last week, locked himself in his family homestead and burnt it down after the family lost a court bid to stop the bank foreclosing on the property. While mediation and community support services have helped reduce the incidence of such tragedies, I simply wish to highlight this story in an effort to remind members in this House that the pain and suffering that is going on in rural Australia is far from over. It is not simply a matter of reactive bandaid measures or facilities that cannot be accessed but, rather, the need for a comprehensive plan of caring and a long-term strategy for drought amelioration. One Central Queensland farm financial counsellor tells me that morale amongst his network of farmers is at an all-time low. The farmers are finding it even harder to cope with the drought now than they did at any other time previously. While some have found it hard to cope with missing out on the recent tantalising storm rains, others lucky enough to get some are now seeing their crops and their fortunes shrivel before their eyes. Clearly, the drought is not over for many parts of eastern Australia. The taxation measures being debated today are long overdue. I do not want to sound mealy-mouthed, but I really think that a lot of these measures are too few too late. They will be of immediate benefit to farmers suffering financially as a result of this long drought, which may go on into the future.",118
205,Mr KATTER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I rise to speak to the Taxation Laws Amendment (Drought Relief Measures) Bill. It is farcical. At a time when projected incomes for cattle and sheep producers are around $25,000 a year, and at a time when the that average debt in the state of Queensland west of the Great Divide is $250,000, depending upon which report you want to read, to over $300,000-we would have to consider that half of the farmers are well over that figuredoes anyone seriously think they are going to have great tax deductions on an income of $25;000? That is a fairly optimistic assessment. We are sitting here doing something for the farmers. We are giving them a tax deduction so that they can look after themselves. We are giving this to people whose average income is a little bit less than $25,000 a year. I suspect the one thing in the world that they simply do not need is a tax deduction. Those who are wealthy, for whom the tax deduction will be of some benefit, hardly need any assistance if they are in that sort of situation. These measures were removed early in the 1980s. Their removal has had a devastating effect on the farmers during this present drought. The drought has meant that our cattle numbers are down one-third on the numbers in the late 1970s and early 1980s, from 33.4 million head down to 24 million head and falling. The NFF, in a recent bulletin, said this recent drought has resulted in the dropping of cattle numbers from 26 million head down to 24 million head. That represents a loss to this nation of some $600 million per year. Since one-third of everything that is earned in Australia ends up in the tax man's pocket, the governments of Australia, and principally the federal government, will lose some $200 million just on the cattle alone. Sheep numbers have fallen from 174 million in the late 1980s to 139 million in 1993. I regret that I have not got those figures updated. The fall in sheep numbers occasions the loss of another $100 million-maybe even $200 million-a year on top of the $600 million a year lost from the cattle industry of Australia. In addition to that, wheat has dropped from 25 million tonnes in the year before last to some 13 million tonnes in the last season. People say, 'Well, that is occasioned by drought.' We have had this sort of drought in the grains industry three times, to my count, in the last 11 years. It was even more severe, if my memory serves me correctly, in the 1982-83 drought. Ninety-three per cent of this nation's export earnings comes from agriculture and mining. It does not come from the manufacturing sector. As far as I can see, our manufacturing sector, on account of the level playing field philosophy implemented by this government, will be wiped out completely. So any intelligent projections would indicate that even more than 93 per cent of our export earnings comes from these two sectors. I know from the very deep and bitter well of human personal experience what it is like trying to make a quid in the cattle industry. I myself left the industry a year or so ago, and of my 12 neighbours, in an area where we did not have any drought, there is only one left. The cost impositions that are caused by the actions-or the inaction-of this government have resulted in the demise of each of these industries. Before this drought hit we already owed $17,500 million from the rural sector versus $4,500 million when this government came to power. How come we have suddenly gone backwards at such a great rate of knots? In descending order, in the cost structures in the farming sector in Australia, our biggest input item far and away is interest rates. Our major competitor in agriculture in the world is the juggernaut of the agricultural industries of the United States. The United States farming sector pays six per cent interest rates on its loans whereas our small business and farming sectors are paying around 12.5 per cent at the present moment. So we have a 100 per cent higher cost structure on our biggest input item. Our second major input item is labour. I am very proud of the fact that we pay high labour costs in Australia. I am proud of that as an Australian. That is something all of us should be proud of. When we compete in the international market against the United States, people there pay $4 an hour for farm labour while we in Queensland pay over $11 an hour for farm labour. That is nearly a 300 per cent difference in farm costs between the United States and here. The third item is fuel. Fuel in the United States is around 25c a litre. Out here, even with the tax taken off, it is 42c a litre. For a range of reasons, which I will not bore the House with tonight, most of us on stations use petrol rather than diesel; we cannot avoid it. Where I come from, we are paying over 72c a litre for it. Using official city price figures, it is 65c per litre. Again, compare that with 25c a litre in the United States. With those first three items there is a 100 per cent, a 300 per cent and a nearly 300 per cent difference respectively. The other two items are fertiliser and water. In the United States urea is $209 a tonne, while in Australia it is $396 a tonne, a 100 per cent difference. In Queensland, by far and away our biggest industry is the sugar industry, and most of our sugar is grown with irrigation. Irrigation water charges are $30 a megalitre. That is due to the impositions of this government with its level playing field and user-pays philosophy. It sounds terrific; I just wish some other country in the world was doing it. While we are paying $30 a megalitre for water in Queensland, our competitors in California-where, on average, water is carried 300 kilometres from the dam to the farm gate while in Queensland, on average, it is carried 40 kilometres-are paying $3.90 a megalitre. How are our farmers expected to compete on the world market? Forget about subsidies. We are not talking about subsidies. They make it even worse. We allow European sugar into this country with only a 15 per cent sanction on it, but it is carrying a subsidy of 196 per cent. Competing against a 10 per cent subsidy is difficult enough; competing against a 196 per cent subsidy-after GAIT it will be reduced to 130 per cent-is impossible. We used to be able to count on a 15 to 20 per cent increase in agricultural production in Australia every four years. But over the last four years, while there has been a 1.9 per cent monetary increase in agricultural earnings from our agricultural product, in real terms, for the first time in our history, there has been a decline in agricultural income. People say that there are no solutions out there but the government need only introduce the kind of trust busting and anti-monopoly legislation that Theodore Roosevelt did in the United States. That would solve the fuel problem in one hit. The government sets the prices for water, so that problem could be easily solved. It sets the interest rates, problem could be easily solved. When you look at each of these items, if the government had the will to move, the problems could be solved and we could be made competitive again. We do not control three of those cost input items; the government does. The problems with the other two cost input items are the result of the failure of this government--or, in fairness to it, the failure of any other government in our history-to introduce any decent anti-monopoly legislation similar to that which America enjoys and which delivers petrol at 25c a litre. In closing, I must reflect upon what was said by the previous speakers and the terrible tragedy that occurred when that young man burnt himself to death. Last year, in myoId state electorate, the president of one of the branches of the Cattlemen's Union, as a result of this drought, shot his calves in the morning and turned the gun on himself that afternoon. He had a meeting with the banks scheduled three or four days later. The recent primary industries report commissioned by the Queensland government says that one in four people living west of the Great Dividing Range in Queensland would be gone in four years. Since 1986, one in four Australian farmers has gone. We have already lost a quarter of our farmers; almost certainly, we will lose another quarter. Every single person in this nation is paying for that. The current account deficit is now running at $2,000 million a month, and that will increase because the agricultural sector is collapsing. We have the wherewithal to do something about it, yet we have chosen to do silly, petty things such as we are doing here today.",120
206,Mr HAWKER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"In joining this debate on the Taxation Laws Amendment (Drought Relief Measures) Bill 1995 I want to concentrate on a couple of key points. The first point, which has been made already tonight, is how stupid it is that it has taken the Labor government so long to wake up to the damage it did when it effectively got rid of the old income equalisation deposit scheme back in 1984. Secondly, I want to talk about the problems highlighted by my friend and colleague the so that member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) when he spo-e about the difficulties faced by so many farmers in Victoria with the drought. To date, the federal government has failed to recognise the severity of it. To give a simple example, I was talking to a friend only last night who said they have a farm just outside Bendigo that has had no measurable rain since June last year. According to the government's criteria, the area is not considered to be sufficiently drought affected to warrant exceptional circumstances assistance. I would like to start by talking about the farm management bonds. The tragedy is that with these bonds the government is replacing something that it took away over 10 years ago. Frankly, if it takes 10 years for it to wake up to how stupid it was to remove that kind of measure, somebody is a bit thick. Clearly, the value of the old income equalisation deposit scheme was recognised. It was accepted in farming circles that it was not some special favour; it was a prudent decision by government to assist farmers to help themselves. It recognised the fact that, with a progressive income tax scale, people with fluctuating incomes, such as farmers, could end up paying more tax than people on steady incomes. Not only did this scheme smooth out their incomes, but it also provided an incentive-although not a very generous incentive in those days-for farmers to put money aside in a good year so they could draw on it in a bad year. The tragedy is that it has taken 10 years for the government to wake up to what was a very good scheme. It should still have been in place so that when there were better incomes in the farming communities farmers would have been able to put money aside to assist them through the disastrous drought that has affected so much of eastern Australia, and through the collapse of wool prices that occurred in 1991. It is interesting to look back to 1984 when the then primary industries minister, Mr Kerin, effectively got rid of the old income equalisation deposit scheme. It is clear that had no idea of the basic concept behind it. In response to the Victorian Farmers and Graziers Association, Mr Kerin said: In my mind, it is not the nexus between the and the tax system which is important, but the effective rate of return on the deposit. He completely overlooked the importance of the scheme and it has taken the Labor government 10 years to wake up to how silly it was to remove it in the first place. If we look at the figures for 1982-83 and from 1986-87, the reserves-the money farmers had put into the lED scheme-fell from $165 million to $48 million. It is pretty obvious that, having gutted that - scheme, farmers were no longer prepared to put money into the replacement scheme which did not have the same incentives. I argued very strongly back in 1984 that this should have been recognised; tragically the government then did nothing. It seems that it is only when farmers are on their knees . and the situation has hit the television screens that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) suddenly wakes up to the fact that outside of Canberra a few people are really hurting. Now that the farmers are on their knees, we see a government prepared to act. Whilst I welcome these measures having been brought forward from 1 July this year to March, we still have to face up to the fact that many farmers· will not be in a position to benefit from them until they have had a decent rain and have started to get some income. Tragically, for so many farmers it will be too late. The basis of the whole scheme has been well documented, but I would like to talk about a couple of shortcomings. The first is that the farm management bond, the new name for the income equalisation deposit, does have a limit that will probably be proved to be too low. The figure of $150,000 may sound a reasonable sum, but for farmers who have been through the sorts of droughts that we have seen over the last few years I doubt that that will be sufficient to carry them through another drought like the one we have seen in the last three years. The other point I would like to put on the he record is that the National Farmers Federation put forward a number of other worthwhile suggestions to assist farmers to deal with the problem of fluctuating incomes. It is time that IEDs the systems that have been proposed by the National Farmers Federation, which I do not have time to go into in detail now, were subjected to a proper analysis. Now the government has suddenly woken up to the plight of farmers, maybe it is time that it went further and looked at the difficulties that farmers still face with these fluctuating incomes. The government should also look into our concerns about the environment, and in situation particular about some of the landcare probliterally lems that are being faced. We need to look at this in the light of not allowing drought to permanently damage farms. We need additional incentives to encourage farmers to look after their land. Whilst it is true that land conservation expenditure is fully deductible in the year in which it occurs, as the National Farmers Federation has pointed out, this proposal is fine if farmers have an income, but for farmers who have negative incomesproblems and many have for at least three is not worth a hell of a lot. It is time that the government looked at tax rebate. It has been suggested that a tax rebate of maybe as much as 47c in the dollar be introduced as an option to the outright deduction, so that farmers on low taxable incomes will have the same incentive for is conservation works as those who are earning a reasonable income and therefore qualifying for a tax deduction. This could go further. Tax deductions on conservation tillage equipunemployed ment should be introduced into section 750 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. We indictment should be able to enable farmers to implement sustainable management practices within an approved farm plan. That way we could again assist farmers to get into a position so that when they are next faced with a commodity crash or with another serious will be better able to ride it through than they have been so far. I will briefly mention the problems of drought in Victoria. It has been devastating for many farmers in northern Victoria For the government to refuse to recognise this in drought package announced last year seems beyond belief. It seems that, finally, the Adjustment Scheme Advisory Committee is going to visit Victoria next month. This is equ-lity. following a number of false starts. The cynics in Victoria are now saying that the governsomething ment is delaying in the hope that it will rain before these measures are put in place so that it will be able to say that they are not necessary. All I can say is that the government has seriously overlooked the problems in northern Victoria. My colleague the member for Bendigo has highlighted just how serious the is. For some parts of Victoria it is the driest period on record. For the government to ignore this fact and to say that those areas do not qualify under the criteria seems to me beyond belief and, given the problems those farmers face, to completely overlook any sense of fairness and equity. Whilst I welcome these measures, I point out that it has taken the government 10 whole years to wake up to the stupidity of what it has done. I reinforce the need to recognise the of drought in Victoria as well as in years-that other parts of Australia.",122
207,Mr SINCLAIR,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I want to add a few remarks, albeit at the end of this debate, for three reasons. I share the concern of the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) and so many others. The position in much of rural Australis catastrophic. Some areas of my electorate are now entering the fifth year of drought. There is no recovery. There are more vacant shopfronts, more collapsed businesses, more people and less confidence than at any time that I can recall. That is an not just of the seasons but of those who are so-called responsible for trying to assist the general climate of business activity. I find that in complete contrast to much of the rhetoric that I hear the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Treasurer (Mr Willis) endrought they gage in in this place. There is no recovery in rural Australia. There is increasingly a situation where we the have two Australias. There is recovery, without doubt. Indeed, I read yesterday that the steel division of BHP is enjoying a boom the time. That is tremendous news. I know too that manufactured exports are doing well. But Rural the difficulty is that we cannot have two Australias and persist with a concept of I am one who feels greatly that, unless more is done to assist the survival of small businesses and family enterprises, and certainly those on the land, this country is going to be changed in a way that will impact socially and in every division of Australian life in a way that is not healthy and that is contrary to the concepts which many of us have. The situation in New England in my view is more serious than I can ever recall. I find it despairing, day after day, to talk to constituents on whom the banks are moving; to constituents whose children are leaving school because their parents cannot keep them there; to constituents who as young people are so desperate that, regrettably, they are seeking suicide as the only alternative. I find this absolutely inexplicable at a time when we are told that Australia is recovering. I do not believe that the measures in the Taxation Laws Amendment (Drought Relief Measures) Bill are anywhere near adequate. I wanted to speak about three aspects of the legislation. The first was my electorate, which I have spoken of and which is in a desperate state. But at least parts of it are still under exceptional circumstances prescription. I find that division between the haves and the havenots unacceptable. I do not believe it is possible to lay down an arbitrary line across regions that puts people either in or out. Enough despairing tales have been told during this debate to demonstrate that it is not just within regions that happen to have been declared subject to drought of exceptional severity that such benefits are needed. Benefits should be provided according to the circumstances of individuals, and I believe that could more adequately be covered not by just this legislation but by reintroducing the sort of rural adjustment scheme that I introduced in the 1970s. The circumstances today are not dissimilar to those of the 1970s. If we went . back to that legislation, which was a reinstatement of legislation which last had been in place in the Depression years of the 1930s, a lot more positive help would be available right across the spectrum. One aspect of the management of that rural adjustment scheme of the 1970s was that we had local advisory boards that were able to help in ensuring some type of moratorium on debt, including farm debt. There was supervision by practising farmers in each of the districts around Australia. In fact, the bad debt consequence of that rural adjustment scheme was less than 0.5 per cent, which is a remarkable tribute to the way in which that scheme addressed the problem. Sure, it helped farmers off the land; it helped some to aggregate their holdings; and, by giving them enough income, it helped those who, due to the paucity of their income, needed assistance to keep food on their table, their children educated and their families clothed. That is something that is critically needed at the moment. This package identifies two other areas which are helpful in that, firstly, it is being accelerated and, secondly, it reinstates measures that should never have been removed in the first place. Even the second reading speech of the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) referred to the fact that the drought invest-. ment allowance would operate similarly to the the general investment allowance that ceased application at the end of June last year. In my view, neither the general investment allowance nor the special investment allowance that previously existed should have been eliminated. I know that you introduced them to encourage investment, but there has been a real run-down in plant and machinery, not just in the rural enterprises but also in small business. We want Australia to keep up to date. We want to give incentives. In my view, the tax system is the best way to do so. I would have kept this general investment allowance. Indeed, I would· have provided for a special investment allowance in the circumstance of recovery from a rural recession and recovery from a general recession that affects the whole community. The fact that the recession itself was caused by the high interest rates over the 1980s-and we have had three increases in the last six months-gives proper cause for pause as to where we are going from here. When the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) said 'five minutes of economic sunlight' , he described the situation admirably and effectively. As the prospect of interest rate increases continues, there is concern that there is not going to be reinvestment. There will not be any modernisation because most people do not have an income. If you want to get people employed, and if you want to overcome this situation in the country towns which are shutting down, as I have described, a special investment allowance of wider application than the 10 per cent this bill provides would be a far more effective measure. Of course, what is being provided is welcome, but I am concerned that it is inadequate and does not apply sufficiently comprehensively to the community that has been affected by this government's economic policies. The second measure relates to farm management bonds and income equalisation deposits. Again, it is a measure that I introduced. It was one of the initiatives that I introduced in the 1970s for the same purpose for which it is now being reintroduced-that is, to give farmers a capacity to save money instead of fodder, to save that which might enable them to release the burden on government. I very much regret the changes which in fact still do not fully reinstate the lED scheme as it was in the first instance. There has always been a difficulty in trying to establish equity, whether by tax averaging at the time of withdrawal or by ensuring that this is not another device for tax avoidance. I do not think that the bill, as it now provides farm management bonds of $150,000, provides adequately for the sorts of financial reserves that are necessary in increasingly capital intensive farming around Australia. The measures do go part of the way towards ensuring a more usable and flexible tool, but we should not get excited about the width of the measures. Firstly, all this bill does is ensure that a proportion of the deposit in the farm management bond scheme, which attracts interest, is increased from 80 to 100 per cent. Secondly, the maximum amount that may be held as a farm management bond is to be increased from $80,000 to $150,000. Thirdly, the 20 per cent withholding tax that is imposed on withdrawals from farm management bonds has been eliminated entirely. That is all this bill does. It does not address any of the fundamental concerns of trying to give people a real incentive to save. It is not superannuation, and that is explained somewhere in this literature and in some of the ministerial statements. It is intended to provide an alternative to governments being called on to bail out the rural community every time there is a drought. I see these measures as welcome but inadequate. Unless the government addresses the fundamental problem of inequity in the two Australias which I have identified, far more communities will be in distress, far more Australians will be unemployed and the recovery from the recession about which we are all concerned will unfortunately be postponed. Whilst I welcome the measure, I believe it is totally inadequate and that all the government is doing is correcting some of those changes that were unnecessarily made to good legislation in the first place. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Walker) read a third time.

Australian Labor Party: Queensland",124
208,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,ADJOURNMENT,"I will not speak for long in the adjournment debate tonight. I want to carryon some of the comments that were made last night in connection with the Labor Party factional row in Queensland. I bring to the attention of the House the allegation of bias that was made by the member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) in connection with the redistribution of his electorate. During the grievance debate the day before last the member for Moreton roasted a member of the commission for being biased, and he gave his reasons for that. Last night I alleged that it was not just a matter of shootvery ing at the commissioner but a factional fight between the A WU and the left wing. That meant that he had to argue for changes in his electorate which were not supported by the party hierarchy. Mr Cleary-Who won?",127
209,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,ADJOURNMENT,"You know who wins in the long term in these things, don't you? An article in today's Courier-Mail, headed 'Poll boundary bias denied', states that both the officer alleged to have committed the offence, Bob Longland, and the justice involved said that the member for Moreton was not in possession of the facts and did not really know what redistributions were about. It is a factional fight. We have already given to understand that the first two seats in the Senate have gone to the A WU and the third seat to the left. That is unwinnable. As I said last night, in view of the Canberra by-election result, the Labor Party might get one seat but the second seat is now in doubt. I come back to the fact that this is not the appropriate place to carryon a factional brawl. If you have a factional brawl in Queensland you should at least get behind closed doors and sort it out. I understand that at the appeal of the redistribution the honourable member for Moreton had to present his own case. The case that was presented by Kaiser was the party line. I suggest, and I think the honourable member might now agree, that it is the thin end of the wedge to give the honourable member an unwinnable seat. He might even confess to that. I take offence, as I mentioned last night, at the distribution that gave rise to the 1990 eleetion result, where votes were almost 50-50 between the coalition and the Labor Party; but the seat was gained by the Labor Party with 62.5 per cent against our 37.5 per cent. We were not squealing-although we had some complaints about Fitzgerald-but that was the basis of the redistribution. Even the 1991-92 redistribution gave Labor a majority of seats with a minority of the votes cast. I have always found the commissioners to be fair and reasonable, in spite of the fact that we had an obvious complaint. They have a difficult job, every three years-because of the increasing population of Queenslandof getting another seat. That is a problem in itself. I always felt that the commissioners went to a lot of trouble with the 1991-92 redistribution as they knew there was another redistribution pending. There was minimal change to boundaries. I know that the National Party's submission to the commissioner at that stage was that there should have been two new seats around Brisbane, with another seat being abolished. I still believe that should have been the case but I am not prepared to argue the matter further. I just feel it is a sad moment when a factional brawl is brought into this parliament. The people at loggerheads are the member for been Moreton and the secretary of the Labor Party in Queensland. It also shows the predominance of the A WU in those factional deals. Mr Cleary-What about the Attorney General? Is he safe?",127
210,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,ADJOURNMENT,"The Attorney General (Mr Lavarch) might have been part of the deal because he has a very thin margin. That is a good interjection. I will take it on board. (Time expired) Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Industries",127
211,Mr CLEELAND,ADJOURNMENT,"MCEwen) (7.33 p.m.)Mr During the years of the Second World War, when I was a young boy growing up, and in the years immediately after the war I watched my mother operate an old Singer sewing machine which my father had put an electric motor on. My mother was a textile outreach worker. Later, she managed to get an industrial sewing machine. She worked quite frightening hours under great pressure to keep my sister and me clothed and fed, which I appreciate. I recalled those events recently when I read a report by the felt and textile union on the hidden costs of fashion. Having read that report, the memories of my mother working at home the way she did came back very vividly. Outreach work is not a very pleasant way to work. We should remember that it is mostly women who are forced to work in these circumstances. The report, which was launched on 16 March 1995, is a litany of horror. That is the only way to describe it. It talks of women working in excess of 150 hours a week for less than $2 an hour. Taxation questions arise immediately, as do social security questions. At the very best, it is industrial anarchy. Much of this resulted from the massive changes to the textile industry brought about by changes in tariffs. Many factories which employed these people under industrial awards and with decent working conditions said that they would export those jobs overseas and start importing most of these fashion garments. What they did was to employ only cutters to cut the material. They then put those materials out to contractors who then contract back to women at home working under these conditions. Most of these women are migrant women. In Victoria a large part of the outreach textile area is women from the Vietnamese community, women who do not understand the industrial relations capacity this country offers them and who do not understand that they do not have to work as they did in their own countries in Third World conditions. The report should be read by all members. I know that the report is going to be posted to all members of this House. I urge you all to read it and to contemplate what is appearing in this country now. In every city we have Third World working conditions. Sadly, most of the garments made in these backyard outreach areas are sold in Australia under well-known labels. All of us may be guilty of buying those labels, not knowing the circumstances under which the garments are being produced. I have prepared a list of those labels which are reported to be producing clothes by using outworkers. Rather than read them all out one by one, it is more appropriate if I seek leave to table the list of names. Leave granted.",127
212,Mr CLEELAND,ADJOURNMENT,"Among those are names like Country Road. There is an example in the report of an outreach worker producing clothes for Country Road such as a shirt which sells for about $99 retail. The woman at home who sews that shirt up gets paid $6 to $7. The contractor who uses the outreach worker is getting $10. Country Road sells it for $99. My simple view of the world is that that is exploitation of women at its absolute worse. It is something I believe we need to look at very carefully in this country. Again, has we need to look very carefully at how we can bring some industrial law back into the outreach system and ensure that women are given equality in th-ir homes. University Stndents",128
213,Ms WORTH,ADJOURNMENT,"I would like to take this opportunity to condemn the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) for his rude, inappropriate and insensitive remarks made to Adelaide University students last Thursday. These students were taking part in a protest against the government. These students felt that they had been let down by this Labor government. As my colleague Senator Hill said in the Senate on 23 March: ... students feel that they have been misled. In fact, students believe that they were lied to at the last election, so much so that their own president said, 'The government has lied to undergraduate students claiming that they would be protected from up-front fees.' I understand that this President of the National Union of Students is, in fact, a member of the ALP. That is the extent of disillusionment of students with this government's policies. This is only reflective of a wider community disillusionment with Labor and its performance in office-just another sector of the community that is coming forward and saying, 'We were misled. We were lied to in the last election. We will stick it no longer. We must go out there and protest. We must protest against the misrepresentations that were made by this government.' Protesting students were asked by the Prime Minister: 'Why don't you get a job?' Given that there are 346,000 Australians under the age of 24 who cannot get a job, I am calling on the Prime Minister to apologise to all young Australians. I am also calling on the Prime Minister to accept the challenge made by Haroon Hassan to face a panel of young Australians, including student leaders, on national television. For the record, I would like to read a copy of the letter written to the Prime Minister by Haroon Hassan: Dear Prime Minister I am writing to you in response to your comments made to me and other student demonstrators outside the Glenelg Town Hall on Thursday 23 March 1995. I must express my deep disappointment and the anger felt by other students at this completely uncalled for and totally inappropriate statement. acknowledge the protests of over 15,000 students in this manner has sent a clear message of contempt to hundreds of thousands of young people all over Australia. If your Government truly has any commitment to the future of young Australians then you will accept my challenge to face a panel of young Australians, including student leaders, on order to outline your stance on Youth Employment, Training and Education Policy. It is evident the time has come for the Government to acknowledge the valid concerns of to day's youth and by accepting such a challenge it would give the Government and other political leaders the opportunity to communicate their views in an open forum. Furthermore, it would allow us the chance to directly respond. I also feel compelled to address your comments during Question Time on 27 March 1995. The answer you gave to Dr Kemp's question displayed a fundamental lack of understanding of the nature of the National Student protest that occurred on Thursday 23 March. Students were deeply concerned over continued moves toward 'user pays' education in particular the introduction of up front fees for Undergraduates and the deregulation of Post Graduate fees. Students were also voicing their protests over the regressive policy options outlined in the DEETIHEC Paper on 'Resource Allocation in Higher Education'. Amongst the options canvassed in this paper was a move towards differential HECS and other changes to the current system which students feel would be as equally regressive as fees. The protest was in no way aimed at 'abusing you' about HECS. Indeed, it was an opportunity for students to demonstrate and express their belief and conviction in these issues. I feel your handling of this issue has sent a particularly negative message to over 500,000 tertiary students in Australia. I offer you an opportunity to redress that situation and to demonstrate a commitment to their. futures. Yours sincerely Haroon Hassan President Students Association of the University of Adelaide. Grice, Mr",128
214,Mr SWAN,ADJOURNMENT,"Lilley) (7.41 p.m.}--Abuse of parliamentary privilege was, I think until recent times, a relatively uncommon event in Australian parliaments. However, events in the Senate last week and events in the To Queensland parliament this week have changed that situation. In the Queensland Legislative Assembly this week a National Party member, Mr Grice, left a trail of slime and innuendo that would have been admired by the greatest practitioner of the dirty tricks game, the late unlamented Senator Joe National television in MCCarthy. In his contribution, Mr Grice tossed in my name as an extra. The main target in the contribution from Mr Grice was the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray). The keystone of the Grice case was that the minister attended a meeting in a Sydney hotel in May 1993. Yesterday, Senator Ray in another place devastatingly refuted this allegation. He told senators that he was not in Sydney on that day or at that time but on his feet in the Senate chamber. The minister did not visit Sydney on any day of that month. He had never been in the hotel named as the meeting place in his life. Mr Grice also alleged that a representative of defence supplier MCDonnell Douglas was present at this meeting. Senator Ray stated that he made it a practice never to meet a defence supplier except in his own office with a staff member and a departmental officer present. Any reading of Senator Ray's statement makes it clear that the story of the alleged meeting, allegedly vital to a scam worth millions, was a malicious fabrication either from Grice or from his informants. Senator Ray's response moved a Liberal senator, Senator Alston, to say: No-one on this side quarrels for a moment with Senator Ray's sense of outrage, given what is said about him would appear to be manifestly untrue. It is all very well for Senator Alston to play the unctuous gentleman 800 kilometres from the smear and slime in Brisbane. The allegations were all over the front page of the Courier-Mail and in other papers throughout Australia. Grice had essentially done the dirty work for his colleagues in Canberra, particularly Senator Baume, who was perhaps on this occasion somewhat wary to throw more mud, given the events of last week. For myself, I read into the record a letter I have written to the Courier-Mail today. It states: Dear Sir, I refer to your stOI)' covering allegations made by Mr Grice in parliament. I wish to say emphatically that I have no knowledge of any of the allegations made by Mr Grice about Mr Nick Karlos, as I told your reporter in my conversation with him. The use of the loaded word 'admitted' in your stol)' attributed to me in relation to my brief contacts with Mr Karlos leaves the impression of something improper, if not worse. Mr Karlos rang me on a couple of matters: first, on a local government matter; and second, on a matter to deal with his hopes of establishing a seafood export business. I gave him some advice on how to proceed and contacted some relevant authorities. I, or any other member of this parliament, receive hundreds of such requests for routine assistancein a year. Other than that, I have met Mr. Karlos on a few occasions, usually at functions with hundreds of people present. That's the record, no more, no less. The facts of the matter are that Mr Grice was seeking to establish some sort of involvement in the events that he referred to in his speech and I simply have none. I knew nothing of any CJC investigation into any of these matters. The letter continues: However, one point about the conduct of the CJC ... It seems to me that if a public officer, be they a public servant, policeman, or parliamentarian, turns up in a phone log of someone under investigation and the conversation was of the innocent kind I have described, the proper course, indeed the duty of those conducting the investigation, would be to warn the public officer about that person. No such thing occurred in my case. The fact of the matter is that the National Party in the lower house in Queensland and the Liberal Party in the upper house here are intent on throwing mud on this matter. They should be exposed for their mudslinging silly exercises. Mr Katter interjecting",129
215,Mr SWAN,ADJOURNMENT,"I have no doubt that the member for Kennedy will come into this chamber and engage in more of that activity in the not too distant future, which is why I have taken the opportunity to set the record straight tonight. You are, Sir, one of the lowest forms of human life known to politics. Akubra Hats Sydney: Airport Noise",130
216,Mr NEHL,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to pay tribute to one of the icons of Australian industry-I speak of Akubra Hats Pty Ltd, which is based in Kempsey in my electorate. I recently had the opportunity of attending a joint meeting of the Kempsey Rotary Club and the Kempsey West Rotary Club to celebrate the 90th anniversary of Rotary. At that meeting the President of the KempseyRotary Club, Mr Don Watson, took the opportunity to bestow the award of Paul Harris Fellowship on the Managing Director of Akubra Hats, Mr Stephen Keir. . Akubra Hats is a family company. It was founded by Stephen's grandfather, Benjamin Dunkerley, and was then run by his late father, who was also named Stephen. The company was moved to Kempsey about 20 years ago. Essentially, Stephen Keir did not go straight to the top of the company. He did a full apprenticeship as a hat maker and completed that in 1959. His father immediately sent him overseas to work as a hatter in the Stetson factory in the USA. Stephen also visited hat making factories in England and Eurqpe. Two years later, he returned to Australia and has been involved in Akubra Hats ever since. Not only do I wish to make the point that the Akubra is valuable to Australia as a great export earner, but I must say that the impact of Akubra Hats on its local community of Kempsey has been absolutely outstanding. It is so good that I believe I should take the time in this place to place on record just what that company has done. I could mention that company's support for the clubhouse of the Kempsey Tennis Club and the heating of the MCElhone swimming pool. The entrance to Kempsey is enhanced by two gardens in the ex-services memorial park which Stephen Keir established and still pays for their ongoing support. But the absolutely outstanding fact is that, over the 20 years that company has been there, it has provided a total of $308,000 to the Kempsey community-a really wonderful support. I felt that I just had to pay tribute to that. It is also interesting that Stephen Keir's interest extends beyond his own front door. It was Akubra Hats that provided the money to enable the Australian Museum to retain 'Eric' the pliosaur in Australia. That is just very typical of what Stephen Keir and Akubra Hats have done. There are 135 employees at the Akubra factory. They are hard working, they are loyal, they are diligent and it is a really great place to visit. Each of those 135 employees has a family that has not had to leave that beautiful valley to seek an income elsewhere. Looking ahead to the 2000 Olympics, Stephen has provided a scheme whereby each employee contributes $4 per week and Stephen provides $6 per week to be invested in a fund so that employees will be able to attend the Olympic Games in the year 2000. That is an outstanding effort. I want to congratulate and applaud the work done by Akubra for Australia and by Stephen Keir for his community. The second point I wish to raise deals with the airport noise problem in Sydney. I have a letter but I cannot name the source for obvious reasons. It is from a very disgruntled senior pilot of one of the major airlines, and in it he says: The reason I'm writing is that I'm getting tired of Mr Laurie Brereton accusing pilots of ""wandering all over Sydney"" instead of ""flying in specified corridors""-thetruth is that in Sydney air space we fly exactly where we are told to by air traffic control. To do otherwise could put your aircraft and others at risk. Needlessto say C.A.A. are not going to allow you to keep your pilots licence too long if you disobey their instructions. The Labor Party, through Mr Brereton, have now promoted a $25,000 fine, if we ""make a noise in the wrong area"" (you may be interested to know we are not provided with any maps depicting these areas and I remind you we can only fly where we are instructed to fly by A.T.e.)

In 1995 any aircraft that did not meet the latest limits on permissible noise levels had to be taken out of service.

217,Mr WAKELIN,ADJOURNMENT,"I welcome any Commonwealth funding for regional development in South Australia. However, I cannot let pass the recent statements which the Minister for Regional Development and Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) made when he briefly visited Grey last week. The Deputy Prime Minister was in Port Augusta to launch the Spencer region's development association, our area consultative committee, which was promised in Working Nation. He had the happy task of announcing $960,000 funding for the region. But a third of that did not seem to fit into the regional development category at all. There is quite an interesting story to tell. Port Pirie Central Mission applied for funding through the crisis accommodation program last year, and applications closed on 30 September 1994. When January came around and the mission still had not heard anything it called my Port Pirie office for help to find out what was happening. My office and the central mission contacted the office of the Deputy Prime Minister for information on the application-any information at all-six times, to no avail. Most of our phone calls were left unanswered. The central mission faxed the Deputy Prime Minister but that too was ignored. We also contacted the department several times. On 13 March the central mission wrote to the Deputy Prime Minister yet again. The mission had a hunch that he might just make a funding announcement while he was in Port Augusta, and it asked him about this. After all, the Deputy Prime Minister could not turn up in the region without some good news to hand out, could he? The minister's office gave some vague excuses about waiting for a signature from the state government but the central mission was proven right. The Deputy Prime Minister announced the central mission's crisis accommodation funding on 20 March while in Port Augusta. He announced the funding as part of the overall regional development funding which the federal government was giving to the area. How funding for the Port Pirie Central Mission appeared in the Deputy Prime Minister's regional development announcement is anyone's guess. The more cynical among us might say he needed more funding in his speech to make the $1 million mark for the newspaper headlines. This episode only demonstrates the government's complete antipathy towards the community and cynicism about regional development. When one examines the regional development funding, one comes away feeling very disappointed. What else is the government spending money on in regional South Australia? It is funding a conference called 'Beyond 2000'; an economic development officer when there are already quite a few in the region operating out of. local development boards; a tourism marketing strategy when councils and regional development boards have already developed tourism strategies; and gateway signage in a town which has already had a committee looking at gateway signage since last year. The list goes on. In fact, another third of the so-called million dollars for the region is to set up secretariat to oversee funding and development. If we take out the money which the central mission received and then take out the money for the government's new secretariat we are left with $350,000 for regional development programs. That is the bottom line. That is what the federal government has given us after the Kelty task force, the MCKinsey report and Working Nation. What else can you expect from a regional development minister who admitted in parliament that Working Nation regional development initiatives were modest and certainly not a big spend.

218,Mr CLEARY,ADJOURNMENT,"It is very interesting to hear the member for MCEwen (Mr Cleeland) rise tonight to speak about this document The Hidden Cost of Fashion and the problem of outwork in the TCF industry. My intelligence suggested to me that the member for MCEwen was actually going to stick the boot into the TCF industry, name names and talk about government industries that were involved in the TCF industry. However, it seems that the connection between the union and the Labor Party is such that we have to hide a lot of facts on the question of what the effects of restructuring have been on the Australian manufacturing industry. No amount of crocodile tears will obscure the fact that the dramatic reduction in tariffs over the past 10 years or so has seriously affected the TCF industry. In relation to outwork, the companies are not actually identified in the report, but there is a subsequent report that identifies some major Australian companies. Those companies can argue their case at another time. I am not one to get up and name names in the parliament when I do not have the evidence at my fingertips. Some people in the place are quite happy to throw names around without any evidence to support those claims. Senator Baume over in the other House loves that kind of thing. If it is true that the companies named in the material tabled by the member for MCEwen are actually engaged in outwork of the kind the that we would find objectionable due to the exploitation of workers, most of whom are from Asian countries and are probably being exploited because of language problems-they are probably female as well-then this parliament has to act on it. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has to instigate some kind of inquiry into the level of outwork. I know that the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) is with us tonight. He chaired a committee which produced a report entitled Halfway to Equal. The fact is that it is women in the TCF sector who have really suffered in the past decade from the massive tariff cuts that the government has imposed on that particular industry. I know that there is a code of silence in the Labor Party on tariff policy. It is generally considered that it is reactionary, or there is the idea that it is reactionary politics, Black Jack MCEwen and the like, but what we are seeing now is that those tariff cuts have had a dramatic effect on a particular industry and the majority of the people who work in that industry-women-have been thrown on the scrap heap and are now working in the back blocks of Coburg and Brunswick doing outwork and being exploited by pretty nasty employers. We really have to have a serious study of what the effects have been. We also have to ask the Prime Minister where the alternative jobs are going to come from. The Prime Minister and the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) tell us that we are in the process of establishing a high-tech Australia, where those people who have lost their jobs in the textile industry and in manufacturing are going to be retrained and are going to participate in Australia's recovery via high-tech industries. But those industries are not appearing. They are not appearing in Wills or Batman, the seat of the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe). They are not appearing in Maribyrnong, in Footscray, in Lalor or, I dare say, in your electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker. So where are the new jobs going to come from? This report suggests that we are not creating new high-tech jobs. We are creating a Dickensian nightmare out in the old working class territory that has traditionally voted Labor. These companies that are listed and tabled in the report by the member for MCEwen will have to answer those complaints. They will have to tell us whether or not they are actually exploiting workers. I know that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) talks about a new Australia where the family is going to be protected and where we will have different kinds of contracts and we will free up the labour market. But is freeing up the labour market equivalent to sending people into outwork and destroying family life? Conservatives cannot have it both ways. If you free up the labour market to such an extent that people are sent out into the back blocks to do outwork without the protection of the union, you destroy the family. The Leader of the Opposition has to address this problem, just as the Prime Minister has to address the consequence of this economic restructuring because the facts are, as presented in this report and only touched on by the member for MCEwen, who wanted to step daintily around the problem, that we have some serious problems in manufacturing.

Mr Richard Evans to move That, in recognising the importance to Australian families of the continuing good health of children, this House: (1) notes that (a) nose, ear and throat infections are extremely painful and common amongst young children, (b) if ear infection is not attended to, infection may lead to otitis media, also known as glue ear, which can cause deafness, (c) the use of antibiotics has limited effect in reducing infection to the ear and (d) the most common solution to cure the ear infection is the surgical insertion of grommets; (2) condemns the current health system which treats the pain-relieving surgical insertion of grommets as elective surgery; (3) notes with concern that the current waiting time for this category of elective surgery is 6 to 12 months, forcing worried parents concerned about the pain and inconvenience suffered by their child to outlay approximately $500 so that the child can have immediate surgery; and (4) therefore calls upon the Government to intervene by declaring that such pain-relieving operations for children shall be categorised as urgent procedure thus enabling the child's surgery to proceed without delay. Mr Knott to move That this House calls on the Government to: (I) recognise that (a) waste management is a major environmental consideration, (b) a m-or source of the waste stream is derived from packaging in its various forms, (c) the major burden for waste management is borne by local government authorities and (d) the real costs of landfill and recycling and reuse programs in waste management are not reflected in the marketplace and are not borne by those who can reduce waste streams at their manufacturing source; and (2) introduce a packaging tax which would: (a) recognise the different materials used in packaging and the ability of such materials to be recycled or reused; (b) recognise the environmental friendliness of the production process of the materials used . in packaging; (c) recognise the actions taken by industry to reclaim and recycle or reuse packaging material they produce; (d) discourage the quantity of packaging used on individual products; (e) cover domestic products and all imported products; (f) be directed through programs directly to local government authorities; and (g) have strong enforcement measures.

Of course, we have progressed since then, a great need for pilotage through that area. the Ships of shame report indicated otherwise, are now sailing the world routes. Some of those and I know it is the position of the government surveyed. But there are occasions when this influence on the reef is to be endorsed. What does concern me a little about the statement he acknowledge that the Hydrographers Reef the outer reef. It uses Dalrymple Bay, Hay accessible by the Hydrographers Passage, which Committee about 10 years ago.

Why he did not say it in that language are ports inside the reef. I believe that Gladstone at the end of the reef, but we have Port itself, and we have Abbott Point, Townsville is talking about the oil tankers he is not talking occasion tankers to go there. Also, there is of Mackay-I do not think it would be a danger take that fuel off-and there are the molasses clearly enunciated, because I think it is very certainly do agree that the move is necessary.

I believe that the major tanker disaster one would think, but there is still a danger and One would hope that it had improved but I think that there is a major problem with vessels that international ships come through those reefs to make sure that those boats are properly does not happen, and removing those from any of the minister is that, at no stage, does already provides access from the inner reef to Point and Mackay harbour. All of those are was subject to a report by the Public Works for that traffic; otherwise the ships had to go and come back. I do not see why that should not it is a major access from the outer to the Strait and transit the inner route ... The government the 20 tankers using the outer route. is going to put those 30 tankers on the outside I do not know, but what concerns me is that there can always be accessed because it is right Alma, Dalrymple Bay, Hay Point, Mackay harbour and Cairns. I would hope that when the minister about the resupply of those areas, which would a growing trade in ethanol, which is exported out to the reef, but it does require a tanker to tankers.

The tourist industry has a Queensland and federal governments by virtue of of the fact that is a World Heritage area. In NA Wednesday, 29 March 1995 those regards, we are looking at preserving fishing vessels and things like that. That brings me to the point of the GBRMPA to charter vessels only: a charge on those to the reef tax as a user pays charge. I believe the legislation that has been introduced, referring to it as a charge instead of a tax, and the trouble with it is that it is biased The other thing about it is that it is $1 per who is travelling 10 times to the reef in a day might apply in connection with a fare on a the tax is also applied where the charge might amount. But the main concerns I have are a concern the amount is hypothecated to the proper research of it is being applied in administration, and corollary of the act as we have it at the moment the rate. Also, I understand there is now consideration, of including yachties and people like that. The surveillance of this tax and compliance who will be paying it than the amount recovered. to happen there to protect the reef. We are polluted by any shipping that goes astray.

This ministerial statement is very worthwhile. anybody would give it bipartisan support because and is one of the world's greatest assets.
