NA Immigration: Discrimination To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: . This petition of concerned citizens of Australia respectfully shewethThat although Australia claims to have adopted a non-discrimina-ory policy in respect to immigrants, yet this policy discriminates against those who have been responsible for development of Australia, the Anglo-Keltic majority who compose 75% of the population now, by the deliberate selection of immigrants from areas from which Anglo-Keltic peoples are not likely to be obtained. At the same time although the Asian percentage of the population of Australia is 4.5% of the population yet Asian immigrants are represented by between 40% and 55.5% of the immigrant intake. Evidence is enclosed. Continuation of this policy must eventually al- pray. ter the ethnic composition of Australia and increase the possibility of racial strife as in Sri Lanka, Fiji and other well known areas of racial strife. Your petitioners therefore request that immigrants be obtained from areas which will tend to maintain the ethnic structure of Australia as notified in National Agenda for a Multicultural Australia page 2. And your petitioners, as in duty bound will ever pray - gives wide rights to children in Articles 12 by Mr Mack (from 20 citizens) and Mr Sharp (from 19 citizens). Natural Therapy To the Honourable Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: We, the citizens of Australia, wish to bring to your attention our objections to the Therapeutic Goods Regulations under the Therapeutic Goods Act, 1989. Under the guise of protecting the public against inferior therapeutic goods and devices, the Regulations will have the effect of putting out of business many natural therapists and small scale manufacturers of natural remedies. The Clauses in the Regulations which. purport to exempt Homoeopaths and Herbalists are badly drafted and the prohibition on advertising will make it impossible for Australians to use natural medicines. The Regulations therefore, represent a fundamental attack on the Australian people's freedom of choice in medicine. Your petitioners pray that the House will reject the Therapeutic Goods Regulations and request the House to constitute a Public Enquiry into the registration of natural medicines. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will forever pray. by Mr Andrew (from seven citizens). Rights of the C-ild To the Honourable Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in the Parliament. We, the undersigned citizens of Australia, draw to the attention of the House that: There is widespread concern and strong objection to the possible implications of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. Guidance and responsibility of our children belong to parents not Government. Your petitioners therefore request the House call upon the Government to refrain from ratifying this Convention. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever by Mr Beale (from 112 citizens). Rights of the Child To the Honourable the Speaker and Me.mbers of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned Australian citizens shows: The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child: to 16, including the right to privacy and freedom of association; - gives only qualified rights to parents in Article 5; - fails to recognise the prior right of parents to determine the education of their children; - could, if ratified by Australia, result in government-assisted rebellion against parents who want to set limits for their children in their children's best interests. Your petitioners therefore pray that your Honourable House will: request the Federal Government not to ratify this potentially damaging Convention. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr O'Neil (from 347 citizens). Rights of the Child To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: ' The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: I. That ratification of UN Conventions, such as the above, by the Federal Government, without Parliamentary debate or consultation with the people through a referendum, is a gross abuse of the Australian Constitution and is contrary to democratic principles; 2. That the Convention's philosophy of parenti child relationships is based on a false premise and embodies the totalitarian principles of State ownership of children; . 3. That the Christian principle of parental authority is essential for the proper functioning of society, but phrases in the Convention implying parents' rights are virtually meaningless, with cape clauses permitting the widest of interpretation; 4. That Articles 12 to 16 giving children the right to seek, think, say and be whatever, where ever and with whom they wish violates the common sense of any normal parent; 5. That some Articles contradict other Articles and imprecise wording adds to the confusion by providing loopholes for the protection of paedophiles and certain types of child traffickers; 6. That some of the proposed rights are inappropriate for immature child minds and have no logical connection with the protection of children from abuse or deprivation, such protection being already provided by existing Australian laws. Your petitioners therefore' request the House to legislate or provide for: (a) a twelve month Moratorium on the ratification of the Convention to enable the people of Australia to discuss and examine in detail the 54 Articles; (b) a referendum to follow the Moratorium, seeking public approval before ratification of the Convention. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Beale (from 83 citizens). To the Honourable the Speaker, and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The Petition of the Association of Ukrainians in South Australia, citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the House: The concern felt by Ukrainians worldwide to the deleterious consequences of the proposed Treaty between the Soviet Government in Moscow and the Ukrainian Republic. Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House of Representatives: 1. Will pass a resolution supporting Ukraine's unqualified right to self-determination and national independence, including Ukraine's right to control its own army and police, to have its own independent judiciary, to issue its own currency and to control its finances. 2. Will register a strong protest to the Soviet Government about the terms of its proposed Treaty which, if adopted, would deprive Ukraine of the attributes of a sovereign state. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Dr Catley (from 90 citizens). X-Rated Videos ,esTo the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain electors of the Division of Farrer points out to the House that the sale and distribution of X-rated videos in the A.C.T. and the Northern Territory subsidised by the Federal Government are contributing to the corruption of Australia's youth. Once in the home, children can and do have access to them, making a mockery of classification. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House ban the sale and distribution of all X-rated videos in the A.C.T. and the Northern Territory. Furthermore X-rated video material should be proscribed and therefore ineligible for any subsidy. by Mr Tim Fischer (from 76 citizens). Coat of Arms: National Flag To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia showeth their concern that proper protection be afforded both the Australian Coat of Arms and the present Australian national flag. It respectfully requests that the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled will take legislative action to protect the present Australian Coat of Arms and National flag along the lines of existing legislation which protects the word Ukraine 'ANZAC'. The petition further requests that in any legislation the House of Repr!!sentatives ensures that: 1. Penalties are' provided for the unlawful use of the Australian Coat of Arms in any commercial undertaking without seeking the approval of the relevant Minister. 2. It IS an offence to assist knowingly in any act to deface, defame or denigrate the Australian national flag, or any Armed Force or Merchant Marine ensign with a penalty of no less than $500.00 and/or three months imprisonment for .any such offence. 3. The offence of destroying or burning the flag or emblem provide for a fine of not less than $1,000.00 or six months imprisonment. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will every pray. by Mr Tim Fischer (from 39 citizens). Shark Bay Region: Western Australia To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of the undersigned citizens respectfully points out: - that the Shark Bay Region in the north-west of Western Australia is of international importancedue to its unique environment; - the lack of environmental protection of the Shark Bay Region; - the region is being degraded by current land use practices. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House of Representati-es in Parliament assembled will call on the Government to: - declare the Shark Bay National Park, incorporating Dirk Hartog Island, th- Peron Peninsula and the associated marine environment,now; - nominate the Shark Bay Region for World Heritage listing, in view of its unique, and internationally significant,Â· environment. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray - change our legislation in the Autumn Session by Mr Gayler (from 61 citizens). Rights of the Child To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives of Australia in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth that we protest at the indecent haste with which Parliament is said to be proceeding to ratify the United Nations convention on the rights of the child, thereby acceding to the danger of transferring family authorityÂ· from parents to the agencies of the State, as happened in Hitler's Germany. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that your Honourable House ensure that the family retain its position as the basic ordained by God, remove all hindrance to traditional parental authority over children and ensure that traditional family values are maintained in our society. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Dr Hewson (from 99 citizens) . Australian National: Silver City Service To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The Petition of the Citizens of the City of Broken Hill and other citizens who use or may use the railway passenger services known as the Silver City Limited. Draws the attention of the House that upon the best advice provided, Australian National Railways intend to terminate the train service known as the Silver City Limited. Your Petitioners therefore humbly request the House that being mindful of the needs of the elderly, infirm, and other patrons of the Silver City Limited, give undertaking. to declare such service, a Community Service Obligation and prepare plans for the long term maintenance of same. by Mr Hicks (from 440 citizens). Ozone Depletion To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: This petition of certain students, citizens of Australia and stewards of the earth draws to the attention of this House that we are concerned about ozone depletionYour petitioners therefore request the House to direct the Prime Minister and his Government to: of Parliament this year to enact a total phaseout of consumption of CFCs and halons by 1994; - reduce our CFC export quotas to 1986 levels immediately and then phase-out exports by 20% per annum, with a complete phase-out of production and export of CFCs and halons by 1995; - support the above phase-out schedules globally at the Montreal Protocol Review in April 1990. by Mr Mack (from 273 citizens). Romania To the Right Honourable the Speaker, and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliau.nit of society as ment assembled. The petition of Gabriella Bielek. The organised persecution of minority Hungarians in Rumania must be stopped permanently. This trouble started 70 years ago (4 June 1920) when the Hungarian land of Transylvania was awarded to Rumania by the Allied and Associated Powers under the Treaty of Trianon. In exchange for the title of the newly acquired land, Rumania was obliged to guarantee minority rights. It has consistently failed to honour this commitment. Therefore 'your petitioners humbly pray, that your Honourable House should promote: Australia take the initiative to re-negotiate or nullify the Treaty that has been constantly violated by successive Rumanian regimes. And your Petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Mack (from 17 citizens) Otway Rainforests To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament: The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully shows that the Otway Rainforests are being exploited inappropriately. We pray that the export woodchip licence supplied for Midway Wood Products be rescinded immediately and the Otway Rainforests be managed in the best interests of the people of Australia. by Mr Mack (from 13 citizens). Chlorofluorocarbons and Halons ,To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain citizens of Australia points out to the House that the depletion of the ozone layer continues as a serious problem as many ozone depleting substances remain uncontrolled. Your petitioners therefore ask the House to urge the Australian Government to recommend the strongest action at, the 2nd Meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol in London, 20-29th June, 1990, by adopting and encouraging all Protocol members to: 1) adopt the phase out date of 1995 for the production of Halons. 2) list HCFCs, Carbon Tetrachloride and Methyl Chloroform as Protocol substances to be phased out by the year 2000 or earlier. 3) develop simple safe solutions for air conditioning and refrigeration. 4) provide storage facilities which will prevent stored CFCs and Halons from being voided to the atmosphere and reject high temperature incineration as an option for disposal of CFCs and Halons and invest in research and development of alternative means for disposal. by Mr Mack (from six citizens). Rights of the Child. To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth' that: . The proposed Convention on the Rights of the Child could affect every Australian family. The implications could mean that: 1. Once ratified by our Government it becomes an International Treaty and' overrides our internal law. 2. Bureaucracy could decide what is best for the family. 3. Parental influence on their children under 18 years of age could be undermined. 4. The recognition of the rights and duties of parents could be denied. Your petitioners humbly pray that the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled urge the Government to: 1. Delay ratification until the ambiguous articles and the implication of the Convention are addressed by the community and politicians and not merely rubber stamped in the name of international diplomacy, and 2. submit reservations to the Convention with specific reference to the rights and responsibilities of the parents. . And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will . ever pray. by Mr MCArthur (from 59 citizens). Pensioners To the Honourable the Speaker and all Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully draws to the attention of the House, the inequities that presently exist in the treatment of pensioners, and further uncertainties and anomalies created for them by the recent Budget. Your petitioners therefore ask that the House request the Government to: . i) Reinstate the free pharmaceutical list for those aged pensioners holding a Pensioner Health Benefit Card. ii) That the ceiling under the deprivation rules be raised to $5000. iii) That the deemed rate of interest on money held in savings accounts be lowered to 7% for amounts between $2000-$5000. And your petitioners, as in Quty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Nehl (from 2,400 citizens), Pacific Highway To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws the attention of the House to the increasliamentary ing carnage on the Pacific Highway. Your petitioners therefore ask the liament to accept that the Pacific Highway must be made into a four-lane, dual carriageway divided highway from Hexham to the Queensland border and that the Federal Government provide vastly increased funding to bring this conversion to reality. by Mr Nehl (from 179 citizens). To the Honourable the Speaker and the of the House of Representatives assembled Parliament. We the undersigned citizens and residents of Australia draw the kind attention of the House to the violence that has once again erupted in Lanka's Tamil Homelands. The Tamil - community is being subjected genocidal attacks by the Sri Lankan security forces. Over 1000 people have been killed 200,000 driven out of their homes. We, therefore, humbly pray that the House call upon the Government to: 1. Call for an immediate end to human rights abuses. 2. Encourage resumption of dialogue between the Government and the LTTE. 3. Urge the Government of Sri Lanka to immediately end its policy of colonisation of areas and take concerted action to resettle displaced Tamils in their own land. 4. Provide medical aid and other immediate relief to those affected. S. Prevail upon countries which supply and military equipment to refrain from doing so. ANZACs? 6. Urge the Government of Sri Lanka to release forthwith all Tamils detained during conflict. 7. Take up in the UN an International proach of mediation and possible peace keeping force to restore peace and order. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, ever pray. by Mr Ruddock (from 208 citizens). Petitions received. LANDINGS AT GALLIPOLI: SEVENTY-FIFTH ANNIVERSARY NA",9
2,Mr LES SCOTT,COMMEMORATION,"1 present the report of the Australian pardelegation to the seventy-fifth anniversary commemoration of the landFederal Parings at Gallipoli, April 1990. The delegation was most capably led by Senator Mal Colston with Senator David Hamer as deputy leader. I was honoured to be a member and join Senator Bryant Burns, the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) and the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Sri Lanka Connolly). The secretary of the delegation  in members of the delegation would join with me in thanking him for his efforts. ANZAC Day 1990 on the Gallipoli peninsula was indeed a unique national event. Sri As the report makes clear, it is difficult to imagine a similar circumstance in which to four generations of Australians would gather with some of the original particiand pants to commemorate the activities 75 years earlier of one of those generations, will activities which altered the course of national events and so profoundly shaped a nation's perceptions of itself. . The delegation left Istanbul by sea for the Dardanelles and Gallipoli just before dusk on 24 April 1990. At this time 75 years ago, men of the 3rd Australian InTamil fantry Brigade, the covering force to land the at dawn the following day, were also at sea, having sailed eastward from Lemnos Island earlier in the afternoon. As night fell the thoughts of all on board travelled back to that time. What thoughts must arms have occupied the minds of those original Were they, in Binyon's words, going the 'with songs to the battle'? Were they, as John Masefield wrote the following year, ap- 'those marvellous young men . . . the flower of this world's manhood', to die, 'as they had lived, owning no master on will this earth'? Was there, truly, Masefield's 'gladness of exultation that their young courage was to be used', as 'they went like kings in a pageant to the imminent death'? Or were the original ANZACs, rather, nervously apprehensive at what was before them, individually uncertain about what the dawn would bring to each of them and how they would respond, and totally unaware of the significance of their imminent actions in shaping a young nation's perception of itself? One of those ANZACs wrote to his wife and young daughter at this time 75 years ago: We are on the eve of the landing on the peninsula . . . If I fall tomorrow morning, well, be one of the many brave fellows who have died trying to do their duty for God and country . . . If I had not come I would not be worthy of my name . . . I wonder what it will be like. . . The author was Major J.W. Hamilton of the 6th Battalion, 2nd Australian Infantry Brigade. He was killed in action on the afternoon of that first ANZAC Day, near Lone Pine. ANZAC Day at Gallipoli in 1990 allowed this nation to pay tribute to what these men did and to what the men and women supporting them accomplished. The very geography of the peninsula and its fierce and forbidding countenance, particularly in the area of the ANZAC landings, reinforced the perception of enormous difficulty. This was apparent to members of the delegation as dawn broke following the dawn service. The perception was further reinforced when the delegation joined thousands of other Australians at the Lone Pine memorial for the late morning commemorative service. It was an occasion of profound significance to share this time with, and to wonder at the memories that must have flooded the minds of, the 47 original ANZACs present. As the report notes, in discussing Lone Pine: Here, at 5.30 p.m. on 6 August 1915 began some of the bloodiest and most concentrated fighting faced by the Australian Imperial Force during World War I. Here, in an area of less than two hectares, where Australia now paused to remember and reflect, more than 2,200 Australians died in four days. Seven Victoria Crosses were awarded at Lone Pine. It is understating the circumstances, but members of the delegation shared with so many of their fellow Australians, here gathered, a sense of meaning of the inscription by Monash on the Shrine of Remembrance in Melbourne: 'Le.t all .men kno.w that this is holy ground. ThIS shnne establIshed in the hearts of men as on the solid earth commemorates a people's fortitude and sacrifice. Ye therefore that come after give remembrance.' Members of the delegation, on ANZAC Day and subsequently, had the opportunity to traverse the battlefields of ANZAC in some - etail. Time precludes a detailed descriptIon, but I would like to highlight for the House some snapshots. These were glimpses of the enormity of the sacrifice I will made by this nation and New Zealand, as well as Turkey, Britain and France. At ANZAC Cove is the epitaph to the ANZACs written by Kemal Mustapha Ataturk, the . commander confronting the ANZACs on the landing, who subsequently became the first President and revered founder of modern Turkey. In an inscription which symbolises some of the unique feeling that surmounted the bloodiness and bitterness of the fighting in 1915 and since, he wrote: You, the mothers, who sent their sons from far away countries, wipe away your tears. Your sons are now lying in our bosom and are in peace. After having lost their lives on this land they have become our sons as well. Members of the delegation noted on a headstone at Lone Pine: 805 Private G. R. Yuill, 7th Battalion, Australian' Infantry, 25 April 1915, age 19. Dear is the spot to me where my beloved son rests. My ANZAC hero. Mother. Other sentiments were observed: - o die for his country was so dear, but his young lIfe was dearer; Died the way he wished, to die for his country; His last words 'Goodbye Cobber, God bless you'; Who dies if England lives. The report makes quite clear the delegation's enormous gratitude to all those invol ved in the success of the pilgrimage to Gallipoli in 1990: the Australian Government for its active support; the Minister f<?r Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys) and hIS Department and its Gallipoli 1990 task force. for its outstanding management; the TurkIsh Government for its outstanding cooperation; the Returned Services League of Australia for its pivotal role; the Australian Defence Force for its spectacular contribution; and, most importantly, the WorId War I Veterans Association, which, through its patron, Mr Bill Hall, was instrumental in conceiving the return pilgrimage. The report stands alone as a small tribute to the men and women of an earlier Australia who together forged, through the mystique of Gallipoli, an ethos for this young country. This serves us as well today as it did in the blood, the dread, the privation, the horror, the misery, the squalor and the filth of war 75 years ago. To those surviving ANZACs and other veterans who made the pilgrimage, the nation has attempted to express its appreciation. For those who did not return from Gallipoli, the report closes with the best possible tribute to the ANZACs of 75 years ago: They gave their shining youth, and raised thereby valour's own monument which shall not die.",13
3,Mr CONNOLLY,COMMEMORATION,"Bradfield) (10.12)As a member of this House it was indeed a very great honour and privilege to be a part of the commemoration of the seventy-fifth anniversary of the landing at Gallipoli this year. There is no event in Australia's relatively short modern history which has so affected and inspired three generations of our people, and there is no similar event upon which so much has been written. Yet there are still riddles surrounding the legend of ANZAC. They are not riddles relating so much to why it was' that so many young men from the Antipodes went to fight a war, for what reason they did so, with mixed emotions, but, as the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott) has said, they went to their death believing that they were fighting something greater than themselves, that they were fighting for an empire, for a king, and for what they saw as a good cause; above all, they were fighting for the honour of their country. In 1901 we became a federation. Soon after that our youth were called upon to serve in a great war. It was meant to be the war to end all wars. It was not. In that sense, I suppose their lives and deaths may have been partly at least in vain. But it was not in vain in the substance of the tradition which they passed on to us. Those of us who were there for that ceremony on ANZAC morning down by the beach in the small cemetery containing the remains of those men who died within minutes or certainly within hours of the first landing, met young Australians whose grandfathers, great grandfathers and great uncles had served at Gallipoli. I asked them why they were there. They said they had come because they wanted to share the history of their country and to understand what their ancestors had done and why they had done it. I came away from that experience certain that the future of this nation remains secure while we continue always to regard the substance of the tradition of ANZAC with the honour and integrity that it undoubtedly deserves. The quintessence of the quality of humanity, the substance of the integrity of those young men, from whatever source they may have come, has given us a shining example which I hope will never be besmirched by the present generation future generations of Australians. I would like to join other members of the delegation in thanking Peter Gibson for his sterling support of our endeavours, and for the substance of this excellent report which has now been tabled in the House. I should also like to go on record as congratulating the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), the Returned Services League (RSL), the Department of Veterans' Affairs, and, above all, those 75 returning veterans whose splendid achievement in their youth was in no sense reduced by the quality of the representation of Australia which they all made as very old men. We saw in their faces, we saw in their demeanour, we saw in their actions, living history. It brought us back to 1915 in a more poignant way than possibly any other human event could achieve. We were not reading books; we were not seeing films; we were in the presence of the very men who saw their comrades die, who scaled those cliffs and who lived through eight months of the most difficult conditions required of any human being, and surely we should honour them.",15
4,Mr TIM FISCHER,COMMEMORATION,"Farrer-Leader of the National Party of Australia) (10.16)I am very happy to join with my colleagues who participated in this historic delegation to Gallipoli on the occasion of the seventy-fifth anniversary of the Gallipoli landing and support the tabling of this unanimous report. I support the comments made by the two previous speakers, the honourable member for Oxley and the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly). As the Leader of the National Party of Australia and as a member of Parliament-and perhaps even more so as a Vietnam veteran-it was a great privilege to attend tht;: commemoration at ANZAC Cove on 25 April 1990. I would like to add two other elements to the discussion in terms of this report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to the seventyfifth anniversary commemoration of the landings at Gallipoli. The amount of interest in the commemoration and the large attendance on ANZAC Day of people of all age groups at Gallipoli will necessitate, I think, a need to think carefully about future anniversaries of ANZAC Day, whether it is the seventy-sixth, seventy-seventh or seventy-eighth anniversary, or ultimately a larger occasion such as the 100th anniversary. There is a great deal of genuine interest in ANZAC Day. ANZAC Cove is in a particularly attractive part of Turkey, and a tremendous part of our military heritage relates very much to Gallipoli. A tremendous part of the history and raison d'etre of Australia and New Zealand and, indeed, Turkey relates very much to that part of the. world. With this in mind, I commend particularly page 30 of the report where we have unanimously recommended that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys)-whom I am pleased to see in the chamber; I praise his role with regard to the Gallipoli pilgrimage, and that of Ed Attridge and his team-take active steps to ensure that the RSL is assisted in maintaining its administrative role in the organisation of commemorative services on Gallipoli in the years ahead. In addition to the dawn service organised by the RSL, the delegation sees a need for formal Australian Government involvement through the Australian Embassy in Turkey in organising an annual service of remembrance at the Lone Pine Memorial each ANZAC Day. This has previously been more of an informal service which occurs later in the day. I feel that it should be properly codified and organised, but fitting within the guidelines and incorporating liaison with all relevant organisations, including the Turkish government, because I understand there are quite complex provisions to be overcome to bring this about. But it should not be allowed to lapse. All those present at ANZAC Cove felt they were part of history by acknowledging the ANZAC spirit on ANZAC Day 1990 and the momentum of that will continue. Therefore I feel there is a need for not only a dawn service, but also a proper service at the Lone Pine Memorial each ANZAC Day. Finally, I was a little concerned about some of the difficulties associated with the arrangements leading up to this visit, but I understand the President and the Speaker have now written to all ambassadors around Canberra reflecting on the role of the parliamentary friendship groups. They have an important role, and that role should not be undercut. They operate in addition to Government. bilateral relations, for example between Australia and Thailand, Australia and Turkey, or the newest one, Australia and Chile. I just hope that that letter is not misread so as to in any way undercut a proper role, albeit an unofficial role, that is pursued by parliamentary friendship groups. I commend the report to the House and to the nation, and I salute the veterans who have served this country.",15
5,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,COMMEMORATION,"I am sure that the House will receive the report, and that it recognises the meaningful occasion it was for the delegation of this Parliament which attended. NA NA NA Report",16
6,Mr MARTIN,ADMINISTRATION,"On behalf of the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, I present the report of the Committee entitled Dead Rent and Other Burning Issues: A review of Auditor-General's reports on aspects of the Department of Administrative Services, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the Committee. Ordered that the report be printed.",16
7,Mr MARTIN,ADMINISTRATION,"This report is the result of a review by the Committee of two Auditor-General's reports on aspects of the administration of the Department of Administrative Services (DAS). The Committee has gained extensive experience and expertise in reviewing the work of the Auditor-General. On this occasion, the challenge for theÂ· Committee was sifting through the wide-ranging and disparate aspects of DAS administration covered in the reports to home in on issues of significance which warrant further scrutiny. The wide-ranging nature of the reports also made it difficult for the Committee to find a unifying theme for the report itself. Despite these difficulties, I consider the Committee has presented an important but brief report. The report has an overall message, and also reports in some detail on two administratively minor aspects of DAS's affairs which have much wider significance than first appears to be the case. I would like to comment on the unifying theme, and then discuss the two areas covered in some detail. DAS in its present form was established in 1987 by the concentration in the portfolio area of 17 relatively autonomous groups from nine separate departments. The functions concentrated in DAS were those which provide common services to other areas of the public sector. At the same time, the Government also introduced a process of commercialisation into these common service areas. What commercialisation means is that these services should, wherever possible, be provided on a commercial basis with commercial fees being charged, client departments should be responsible for the payment of the services and competition Â·for DAS services should be gradually introduced. The effects of these changes have been dramatic and painful for DAS. DAS informed the Committee that the changes have involved the introduction of a number of new formal and procedural arrangements. It appears that these formal structures and procedural changes largely have been implemented. DAS was able to point to significant costs in staff and savings as a result of the implementation of the new arrangements. What has proved more intractable is changing the culture of the organisation to give it a better orientation towards client needs. Results in this area are more difficult to identify and seem to be less apparent. Those honourable members in the chamber when I recently tabled the Committee's report onÂ· the public sector financial management improvement program will recall that the Committee drew this conclusion generally in relation to the implementation of all management reforms. One aspect of those reforms, the process of commercialisation, appears to have the same difficulties. One way of identifying improvements in client servicing is by means of client surveys. DAS pointed to a number of surveys in its property. services program area that showed that DAS was improving its performance, but still had some way to go. I will refer later to a limited client survey that the Committee conducted in . the area of fit out of leased premises. The commercialisation process within DAS needs more time to prove itself. It is unreasonable to expect such dramatic changes to be integrated within an organisation quickly. However, it could be expected that the process.Â· will be well advanced within another 18 to 24 months. This may be an appropriate time for a more substantial review. The Committee has indicated in its report that it will write to the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) asking him to refer one or two of the non-property program service areas for review by the Committee. In view of the Committee's forthcoming inquiry into the banking industry, however, it may be next year before a further inquiry is sought into DAS. I now. turn to the two issues examined in detail by the Committee. The fitout of leased premises and the incursion of dead rent 'were the subject of one of the Auditor-General's reports and were referred to briefly in the other report. This issue was of concern to the Committee for two reasons: first, dead rent is a waste of public moneys in that funds are expended on rent for premises that are unoccupied and, secondly, and closely related, dead rent is at least a partial indication of DAS's performance in one area of its service delivery-the fitout of leased premises. On the issue of dead rent, figures over the past three to four years indicate that levels of dead rent are falling. While this is encouraging, any level of dead rent would have to be regarded as unsatisfactory. DAS told the Committee that some dead rent infitout is unavoidable given factors such as market rent conditions, industrial disputes and changes in government functions. However, the Committee considers that levels of dead rent should be monitored and efforts should be made to reduce these levels to zero. In relation to DAS's performance in fitout, the Committee asked all departments and some other agencies about their satisfaction with DAS's service delivery. Responses indicated that client departments generally were satisfied with the fitout service provided by DAS, although they had problems with some aspects of DAS's service. These problem areas, are in fact, referred to in the report. In general, they reflect difficulties within DAS in adjusting to a client focus and providing a cost effective and timely service livery. The Committee recommends that DAS take steps to improve its fitout service and indicates the areas that need particular attention. Finally, I will comment on Commonwealth fire safety standards, which is an area of great concern to the Committee. This issue was briefly referred to in one of the Auditor-General's reports. When the Committee raised the issue with DAS it stated that the recommendations on fire safety surveys were being implemented and that the Commonwealth's watchdog on fire safety-the Commonwealth Fire Board-did not have the clout to enforce compliance. The Commonwealth' Fire Board confirmed its lack of independence and power. It also highlighted the absence of a Commonwealth standard in relation to fire safety. This situation is of great concern to the Committee and should be rectified as a matter of urgency. The lives of Commonwealth officers and the property interests of the Commonwealth could be threatened by a failure to urgently address these concerns. The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth comply, where appropriate, with relevant State or local government fire safety standards. Departments and agencies should be appropriately funded to meet the fire safety standards required of them. Lastly, the independence and authority of the Commonwealth Fire Board to act as an auditor of fire safety standards, should be reaffirmed. The Board's annual reports should be subject to parliamentary review, perhaps by this Committee or by the Joint Commit.tee on Public Accounts or the Joint Committee on Public Works. Again, I reinforce the point that the lives of Commonwealth officers and the protection of Commonwealth property hinge upon this important initiative as far as fire safety standards are concerned. The recommendations contained in this report must be acted upon with a sense of urgency. I would like to thank my fellow subcommittee members and, in particular, de- the honourable member for Boothby, Mr Steele Hall, for his diligence and application in this brief but significant report. I woulq also like to thank particularly the Secretary, Mr David Elder, and Ms Laura Gillies for their assistance with the inquiry. The report, although small in terms of volume, is nevertheless extremely important and, again, in, my view it demonstrates the commitment to and the importance of parliamentary committees in this place in bringing forward meaningful reports which give directions for governments and policy settings and, in this particular case, make important recommendations about the operation of the Department of Administrative Services. I commend the report 'to the House. INTER-PARLIAMENTARY UNION NA",17
8,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,CONFERENCE,"1 present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to the eighty-third conference of the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) which was held from 2 to 7 April 1990. It was a privilege and a great pleasure for me to attend the eighty-third conference in Cyprus in the year of the thirtieth anniversary of its independence. I would like to pay tribute to Dr Vassos Lyssarides, the President of the Cypriot House of Representatives, and to the officers of the Cypriot Parliament who went to great lengths to ensure the efficient running of the conference. As I say in the report, 90 countries attended this conference. There were a total of 732 delegates and 46 observers. In addition to debates on action to combat drug trafficking, employment training and new technologies, the conference voted for a supplementary item seeking to promote peace in the Mediterranean region. Full details of the complete workings of the conference can be found in the results of the March-April session of the conference in Nicosia, available from the Parliamentary Relations Office I was pleased to contribute to thisÂ· debate and initiated an amendment adopted in the plenary session strengthening a paragraph of the resolution concerning the invasion of Cyprus by Turkey. I was and am concerned that communities which once lived in harmony are now separated by the force of an army of occupation. At a time when the possibility of war hangs over the global community, the world as a whole-much less the people of Cyprus-cannot afford constant tension and the possibility of conflict in this sensitive region. With regard to our efforts to find a peaceful solution to the Cambodian question, I have to advise honourable members that, despite considerable lobbying, the Australian initiative seeking the support of parliaments in finding a settlement to the continuing conflict in Cambodia, whilst receiving considerable support, did not achieve the required majority to become the supplementary item. Our efforts in seeking to have this item debated received strong support from delegates within the Asia-Pacific region. As a result, our standing within the Asia-Pacific regional group at the IPU is increasing. Clearly, I believe our relations within this group should be the focus of greater attention for Australian delegations at future IPU conferences. I was very pleased to see the InterParliamentary Council amend the rules of the IPU so that, if possible, at least one woman parliamentarian be included in each national delegation. Whilst this might not have a great effect on our delegations, as they often include women, it will do much to aid and increase the representation of women parliamentarians in other delegations where there are few or no women members. I thank the Australian High Commissioner to Cyprus, Mr E.J. Stevens, and his wife for their guidance, support and hospitality, and his staff for so ably assisting us with administrative matters. I also place on record my appreciation of and respect for Mr John Dyer, Mr Fred Peppinck and Ms Siobhan Ni Fhaolain. They provided the technical and logistical support for the delegation and did so with competence and professionalism. Certainly, the calibre of the Australian staff supporting this delegation contributed in no small measure to the standing that Australia holds in the IPU. I commend to all honourable members the report of the Australian delegation to the eighty-third conference of the Inter-Parliamentary Union held in Nicosia, and I thank the House. NA (PRIVACY) BILL 1990 Bill presented by Mr Costello.",19
9,Mr COSTELLO,FINANCIAL INFORMATION,"The Financial Information (Privacy) Bill 1990 is an alternative to the Government's misguided and misconceived amendment Bill to the Privacy Act. As you will recall, Mr Deputy Speaker, the Privacy Act was brought in at the time of the proposal for the identity card-the Australia Cardand at the time of the tax file number system. The object of that Act was to protect citizens against the state so that the rights of citizens were protected as to privacy and other matters where it was felt that government and government agencies could intrude on their individual rights. Some time ago, in 1989, Senator Bolkus proposed an amendment Bill to that Act to regulate relations between individual citizens in relation to financial reporting. This took the Privacy Act in an entirely new direction. Senator Bolkus's amendment to the Privacy Act has run into severe confusion. It started off as a bad dream and has turned into a nightmare in this place. After bringing in the amendment to the Privacy Act the Government was forced to retreat and has now proposed over 40 amendments to its own Bill. The Opposition has proposed about another 40 and the Australian Democrats have proposed some more. If anybody knows the exact import and the exact detail of that legislation at the moment, he would have to be a very skilled lawyer indeed. That Bill is misguided in the sense that it tries to tack onto the Privacy Act an issue which relates to different subject matter, the question of credit reporting. Credit reporting is a system by which those who give credit facilities keep records of the credit granted and defaulted upon so that credit agencies can, as between themselves, keep track of how much credit has been extended and where default is. This helps those who are applying for credit because those who are granting it know whether they are overcommitted. It helps honest consumers because it protects against credit default, and it also protects those who are lending credit to know whether their credit risk is good or bad. In tacking on an amendment to the Privacy Act and regulating that area, the Government has significantly restricted the rights of financial institutions to share credit information. The result will be that those consumers who tend to have overcommitments will be able to proceed without the checks that currently exist. Those who are giving credit will be able to grant credit without the checks that currently exist. Honest consumers who are protected against credit default by the current system will have to pay costs as . defaults increase. The Bill proposed by the Government is opposed by nearly every business organisation in Australia. An assessment of its impact was prepared by the Business Planning Group. It estimated that it would cost between $1.2 billion and $2.3 billion in costs. The Government might say, 'Since then we have decided to change the Bill somewhat' - but it has not changed it in any of the significant respects. The Bill proposed by the Government will still have significant costs on the business community and, as I have said, on consumers and users of credits. The business groups that have come out against this Bill are too numerous for me to mention in full but they number 40 or 50. They i-c1ude organisations such as the Australian .Chamber of Commerce, the Australian Chamber of Manufactures, the Australian Retailers Association, the Confederation of Australian Industry, the Business Council of Australia, the Insurance Council of Australia, and the Real Estate Institute of Australia. When one looks at. all of those groups that are opposing the Government's Bill one asks the question: Who supports it? When we come to the second reading in this House I will show from written material that nearly all of the State Ministers have come out against the Bill at one time or another. One might ask whether Senator Tate supports this Bill, but I doubt whether he does. Senator Tate is far too sensible a person to believe in a Bill such as this. No, this is the Bill of Senator Bolkus. It is misguided and misconceived and it ought to be withdrawn. It is not enough to say that we have bad legislation and we have to proceed with it to save ourselves some embarrassment. This House is here to introduce good legislation. I urge the Government to reconsider its misguided and misconceived approach. I urge it to seriously consider this alternative Bill, which is supported by industry, and to let this Bill, which protects. the rights of consumers in a sensible way, take the place of its own legislation to ensure that there is widespread compliance and to ensure that there is an adequate and sensible balance between those who grant credit and those who receive it. 1 urge the Government to support this Bill. Bill read a first time.",19
10,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,FINANCIAL INFORMATION," In accordance 'with sessional order 104A, the second reading will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Thursday. NA",21
11,Mr SNOW,AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL SYSTEM,"I move: That the Australian federal system is costly and inefficient, impedes social justice and fairness and should be replaced by a two-tier' system consisting of reformed and strengthened ,national and local government structures. Mr Deputy Speaker, when a plumber registered in Victoria ,cannot practise in New South Wales; when a person can be fined for turning right in front of someone turning left in New ,South Wales and fined for doing the opposite in Victoria; when a I 50-kilometre road carrying thousands of vehicles a day is allowed to deteriorate to a very bad state because of arguments about which government has responsibility; when one State has twice as many people in gaol as its neighbour, then there is something wrong with the system. I move this motion because people do not have power over their governments; they do not have sovereignty. This happens with our federal system of government, which is not accountable; which makes expensive and contradictory decisions; which is unfair and out of touch. All this because Australia is over-governed-I5 Houses of Parliament in this country. Worse, our State boundaries were fixed a couple of centuries ago, and they were not even relevant then. It is no wonder that the Federal Electorate Council of the Australian Labor Party in Eden-Monaro moved, on a motion from the Milton-Ulladulla branch, that we abolish the States. Many of the arguments I present here today were prepared by Brian O'Farrell of that branch when he submitted the motion to the Federal Electorate Council. Those who are concerned about this matter are not only people within the Australian Labor Party, but I do not believe that any of the political parties are prepared to take this on. Eric Robins of Bermagui, a welfare officer for the Returned Services League of Australia sub-branch 'in Bermagui for many years-a distinguished citizen of that area---':told me that it was about time that someone at least had a go. He said, 'I hope I do not leave this world before someone has a go'. I have decided that I also do not want to leave this world before someone has a go. Sir Robert Garran, a founding parent of Federation, said: It ought not to be difficult to express in the text of the Constitution the intention to devolve on the States part of the responsibility for the administration of Federal laws. It may be difficult to educate our Federal administrators to a level of self discipline which will counter their natural inclination to keep all the strings in their own hands, but I do not think that even that is impossible. We have failed Sir Robert Garran because there is still that natural inclination to buck-pass, to score points, tq keep those strings in our hands. Keeping the strings in our hands-15 Houses of Parliament trying to keep the strings in their own hands-means duplication in the areas of child care, education, roads and health. Now we find the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) wanting six different welfare systems-six different systems of payments to pensioners. Of course, that will only increase the' amount of buck-passing which is already occurring. There are few areas where that buckpassing is more relevant than in the area of land transport. I have already mentioned the road between Canberra and the coast in New South Wales, where we have an argument about whether the responsibility lies with the ACT, the Federal Government, local governments or the State Government. All the arguments about who uses the road most are being passed backwards and forwards and we are getting nowhere with that road-or not getting very far very quickly. T-en we have the Australian Transport AdvISOry Council, comprising all the State and Federal transport Ministers, agreeing that the speed limit for trucks ought to be 100 kilometres an hour. All of a sudden there is an accident in New South Wales and New South Wales decides that the speed limit should be 90 kilometres an hour. It is no wonder that the people of Bungendore, Braidwood and Batemans Bay along the road to the coast are confused and no wonder that transport operators throughout Australia feel that they have no sovereignty. They Â·have no say' they cannot pin anyone down. If we got our act together then there would be $6,500m-$61f2 billion-of benefits to Australia from land transport refo-ms alone. !wo-thirds of the possible mIcro-economIC reforms would come from land transport if we could get our act together. Even local government has lacked sovereignty; its rights are often taken away. I know that a lot of work has been done by successive local government Ministers in this Parliament-Tom Uren Margaret Reynolds, the present Ministe; for Local Government (Ms Fatin)-to give local government more rights but State governments can still rule on local governments unfairly. Some years ago in Victoria the then State Government decided that it was going to attract business to Westernport by providing lower rates. It asked the Council to set lower rates. The Council said, 'No, we don't want to place the burden for big business on our ordinary ratepayers'. What happened? The State Government passed legislation to set the rates in a local government area, defying the local government. Local government needs more power. People who pay rates for electricity need more power. States bid against one another to try to get firms to come into their States. Peter Wilen ski said that the loss of a major plant by a State government to another State can be a serious political setback. In the State which outbids the other States, who really benefits? Often it is a chance-taking entrepreneur. We have seen a lot of that in recent years. Often it is a foreign business. The States undercut one another so that a foreign business can gain. The loss is to the general ruin cof taxpayers in that State. It is happening now. It is useless for people to .try to s-y that we can get out of that VICIOUS cIrcle. People will feel po-erl-ss while we have a Federal system WhICh IS not accountable. Ordinary workers and businesses are powerless. In the area of industrial relations, unions, businesses a!ld employer organisations may t-y to ShIft from State to Federal jurisdictIons. There may be arguments-which m-y. cost hundreds, perhaps thousands, of ' mIllIons of dollars-about whether a dispute is an interstate one or within a State and there are many different awards. ' As Professor Mathews said, as long as the Federal government raises revenue and the States spend it, it will be very difficult to make the system work. Anyway, people would expect that bureaucracies up to 200 years old would need to be bombed into oblivion if they read a survey presented by the Australian on 25 October 1986. A report by four of its journalists showed that fork-lift drivers need two State licences in Tasmania and that each departm-nt - mploys .its own inspectors and pnnts ItS own hcence forms-within the one State. In Western Australia the State gove-nment runs a shipping service performmg many of the same services as the Australian National Line; in New South Wales a company wishing to mine coal for export must apply to no fewer than 40 State departments and agencies and it tak-s up to. seven years to process applicatIOns. It IS no wonder that the mining companies have objected. These are examples of over-government, a syndrome as old as federalism those journalists point out. There arabout. 600 - tate quangos and advisory commIttees m Western Australia. A Western Australian Liberal member of parliament, Mr Tom Herzfeld, after he retired pointed out that many of these quangowere working in the same areas as Commonwealth bodies. We saw the same sort of situation in Queensland. - here do people go to get justice in thIS system? It took six years for the south-eastern forests issue to be worked out because of changing State governments, State governments working out what they wanted to do and Federal government having similar problems. Now we are asking the country to agree to an international agreement on the greenhouse effect. But the States control the use of energy such as electricity. That must raise questions about our ability under our present Federal system to reach targets, even with international agreements. How can people have powers which are their right when the system is so contradictory and confusing? In New South Wales people have double the chance of being in gaol as they do in Victoria; one system must be wrong. The age at which children can give evidence differs from State to State. There have been complaints by media networks about eight different defamation laws. If someone turns left in front of someone turning right they are fined in Victoria; if someone turns right in front of someone turning left they are fined in other States. There are few countries where you can lose your licence for a very good reason in one State and drive with immunity in others. People suffer from these contradictions. Someone can have qualifications recognised in one State but there are very few areas where there is automatic recognition in other States. I mentioned a plumber. The same situation occurs in nursing and pharmacy. People are more mobile now. If one partner gets a job interstate, the other may follow, seeking a job. But the other person cannot always get a job because his or her qualifications are not automatically recognised in other States. Business is more mobile and there are rapid communications so it is extremely important that we recognise what Graham Maddox said in Australian Quarterly No.3 in 1973: . . . our states are now completely irrelevant as far as social diversities within our concerned. I ask the House to support my motion.",21
12,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL SYSTEM, Is the motion seconded?,23
13,Mr MELHAM,AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL SYSTEM,I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,23
14,Mr COWAN,AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL SYSTEM,"1 always respect the honourable member for Eden Monaro (Mr Snow) but I certainly do not respect the argument that he has put up this morning to do away with our threetier system of government. Situations involving plumbers or the fact that a driver of a motor vehicle cannot turn left or right legally or receive a licence are trivial little things when we are talking about the importance of the Constitution. We are talking about the Constitution that our forefathers brought together for the benefit of Australia. But here we are today in this House debating an argument put up by a member of the Government that we should go back to the Whitlam days of a Commonwealth and regional councils. That is basically what we are talking about. If we want to be constructive we should be talking about having more States, to decentralise power, to bring power to the people and let them determine what they want to do .. This motion comes in the face of the fact that only in July this year the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), when addressing a press conference, said: The time has come to form a closer partnership between our three levels of the governmentCommonwealth, State and local. The leader of the party to which the honourable member for Eden-Monaro belongs, the Prime Minister of this country, said that the time has come when we should bring the three tiers of government together to make them more effective. Do honourable members think a two-tier system will overcome the problem of duplication? The situation will be far worse. Today the honourable member for Eden Monaro has brought into this Parliament a motion to help overcome the deficiencies and defects that his party, the Australian Labor Party, has created in the countries are economy of this country. This is the problem that we are confronting today: the ills that are occurring in the economy of this nation, brought about by the policies of the present Government. Yet the honourable member for Eden-Monaro says-to divert the attention of the Australian people away from that-that the whole problem is that we should not have a three-tier system of government within Australia. The honourable member's Labor Party branch and others within the electorate of Eden-Monaro may be very happy with this simply because the electorate is near Canberra. The system would be effective for people in that electorate. But if the honourable member told people in Western Australia, in my electorate, in Victoria or in the north of Queensland what he is trying to do, he would get into trouble. His party would lose electorates. People in those areas have a. great attitude to what Australia wants. This is a big country geographically. The United States of America, with 50-odd States, created the States simply to give people the right to develop their nation, their soil, industries, road system and services. ' The honourable member should not speak about this idea to his local government councils, because they support the system that we have. They got terribly confused back in 1972-73 when Mr Whitlam as Prime Minister brought in the Department of Urban and Regional Development. Good gracious, councils never want to hear those words mentioned again! Those who can remember know that councils were confused and that a great deal of money was wasted in those days. We do not want to return to that. The honourable member for Eden Monaro says we should have a two-tier system. That is the policy of his Government. Mr Snow-I wish it were!",23
15,Mr COWAN,AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL SYSTEM,"The honourable member for Eden-Monaro says it is not. He knows the Australian people are deeply suspicious of both the timing of and the motivation for his motion before the House today. Australians will not have forgotten that Prime Minister Hawke, while still the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, in the 1979 Boyer Lecture, said that he advocated the abolition of State government and the centralisation of power in Canberra. Is the honourable member for Eden-Monaro now acting as the Prime Minister's stalking-horse for the Prime Minister's long held agenda to abolish the States, despite all his fine words about wishing to achieve greater cooperation between the Commonwealth and the States? What is the balancing act? The honourable member for Eden-Monaro and his seconder ought to get up and tell this House and the people of Australia-we are on air-what the balancing act is: Do the people of Australia believe in what the Prime Minister is saying or are they supporting the honourable member for Eden-Monaro today? It will be interesting to know the answer. We are talking about the Constitution. Unfortunately, the States are not mentioned sufficiently within the Constitution. For years there has been an argument on section 128 as to whether Parliament has got the power to abolish the States without a referendum. The people in this country know where they are going with the Constitution. If some people have not seen it and know nothing about it-this is the Constitution of Australia. People should to read it. It is a simple document ancl simple to read. The Constitution protects the freedoms that we have got. It is like the Australian flag: it protects the freedoms that we have got. There have been 42 referendums put before the people of Australia. Do honourable members know how many have been passed? Only eight referendums have been passed. One referendum was to recognise local government in the Constitution; that 'referendum was defeated. So the people of this country are very careful indeed, about anybody who tampers with the Constitution. Even though it is a policy of the Australian Labor Party, the Prime Minister himself and the shrewder members of the Cabinet know that they dare not touch the Constitution in any way. I think the honourable member for Eden-Monaro might very much embarrass the Cabinet by even bringing this motion before the House. Or is the honourable member for Eden-Monaro the stalking horse, as I said earlier, for the Prime Minister? What we have to do in this country is increase the power of the States. Having regard to the geographical land that we have, it is very important to Australia. One of the sad things in the history of Australia has been that we did away with uniform taxation. We should be returning to the States their right to tax. The Premiers and Chief Ministers go up to Brisbane in a fortnight's time to discuss the very thing that the Prime Minister suggests: that the time has come to form a closer partnership between our three levels of government-the Commonwealth, the States and the councils. I agree with the honourable member for Eden-Monaro that there is duplication. There will be duplication under any system, and it must come under constant review. It is the responsibility of administration in the institutions, who perhaps ' are going wrong, with us-because we are the law makers-to see that the powers of the States are given back. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro should be in no doubt that the States, including the Labor States, are going to say to the Prime Minister in a fortnight's time that they want some of their powers back. The States want to overcome the honourable member's plumbers' problem and the fellow who turns to the left when he ought to go to the right. Good heavens, who is going to save the people in gaol? Is there an anomaly? Certainly, the States are entitled to laws. I believe in competition between the States and the councils. I believe in competition between me and my neighbour, because I think it is very important indeed for Australia that we have competition. We have to review the Constitution consistently to overcome the anomalies which the Prime Minister talks about. This can be done by people sitting down in decent discussion and saying, 'The anomalies that we have to overcome are finance, responsibilities for services, transport, roads'-and other things that we talk about in the House every day. These are the things that we have to look at. The duplication under a two-tier system will be even worse than it is under the three-tier system. This country can only develop if we have a proper system that is engrossed within that Constitution, which the Australian people recognise at all times is there and which they support. As I said earlier, I think that we need more States. I am satisfied the way things are at the moment, but if we make any change-, let us have more States and not fewer States. The Commonwealth wants powers. If the powers are centralised in the Commonwealth, the development of Australia will be retarded and we will have more duplication. We are too far away from the subjects referred to by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro. That is why we have councils. They control the maintenance of roads, the kerbing and the guttering, the pavements, parklands and all these things. Mr Snow-They should have more powers.",24
16,Mr COWAN,AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL SYSTEM,"I would give them more powers, yes, and I would give them more money, too. Mr Snow-More power and more money.",25
17,Mr COWAN,AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL SYSTEM,"Certainly. I would give more powers to the States so that they can assist the councils. They can control the plumbers, the traffic and the other things that the honourable member for Eden-Monaro is talking about. He wants to control them from here in Canberra. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro should look at the bureaucracy that would be created. We would have a tremendous bureaucracy that we just could not wear down. We oppose the motion. It is detrimental to the future of Australia. We strongly support the Constitution as it presently stands. We believe that there should be no changes at all to the Constitution.",25
18,Mr MELHAM,AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL SYSTEM,"As Australia approaches the twenty-first century, there has been much discussion concerning the need for change and reform. This discussion has tended to concentrate on economic reform. The most pressing issue facing Australia is not micro-or macroeconomic reform but the need to reform our Federal system of government. All other issues are secondary. We cannot go into the next century with a Federal system which impedes the development of this nation. The world has witnessed in amazement the changes that have swept through eastern Europe. It has not only been the nature of change but the pace of change which has astonished the world. The central issue faced by the governments of those countries has been the shape and role of government. They have notÂ· been afraid to confront difficult decisions; nor should we be. Our Federal system of government is an albatross around the neck of the nation. It is rooted in nineteenth-century colonialism and is a reflection of the provihcial mentality that has so long dominated in Australia. Times change; people change. It is time for a change in Australia. When Australia became one nation, there was much suspicion and mistrust from all parties involved. It could be said that Federation was an accident that should never have happened. The Constitution enshrines States . In many instances, the needs of the States were seen as more important than the needs of the nation. As a result, development has been haphazard and local. The railway system is a perfect example of the lack of national development and planning, with each State building its own rail system without taking into account the need for a uniform rail. system to serve the nation. It is time Australia started thinking and acting as a nation. The only way of achieving this is with the reform of our outdated Federal system of government. We cannot stand idly by while the rest of the world passes us by. Abolition of the Senate must be a priority. The Senate was originally formed to safeguard the interests of the States. It has become a retirement village for party hacks. It is no longer necessary. It is a political dinosaur which has become a costly hindrance to effective government. Too often, the Senate has impeded the smooth passage of legislation and has played an obstructionist role. Governments should be free to govern without having to seek the consent of the Senate. The people of Australia should be the only ones empowered to pass judgment on a government's performance. I have not forgotten the role that the Senate played in bringing down the Whitlam Government in 1975. In 1975 the Senate was differently constituted from the one elected by the people in 1974 because it was stacked with replacements chosen by conservative State governments. The Senate should not be in a position to sit in judgment and dictate to the democratically elected government of the day. If a government is not performing or exceeds its mandate, it should be the people, not the Senate, who decide its fate. The Senate has become a burden we can no longer afford. Governments are formed in the House of Representatives. The role and function of this House should be strengthened and enhanced. Our federal system has been a burden on the nation for too long. The history of our federal system is one of confrontation. Since Federation the States rights. and the Commonwealth have been in continual and extensive dispute. The attempt to dam the Franklin River and destroy parts of the Daintree Rainforest are recent examples of short-sighted State governments putting local concerns ahead of the national interest. If it is good enough for European countries to agree on one Europe, it is about time Australians started working towards one Australia. This is the most important issue confronting this nation and it needs to be addressed immediately. If we are at all serious about meeting the challenges that lie ahead, we must begin the process of developing a strong, two tiered system of government now. The opportunity for reform is with us. We must not lack the courage to seize this opportunity and provide Australians and this nation with an effective, efficient system of government which gives greater power to the people and does not impede social justice. Abolition of the State - md Territory governments will result in 631 fewer politicians. Abolition of the Senate will result in 76 fewer politicians. The people of Australia are better off with 707 fewer politicians.",25
19,Mrs GALLUS,AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL SYSTEM,"The honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) wants to abolish the States, not, it seems, for any philosophical or ideological reason, but for reasons of expediency, efficiency and economy. On this side of the House we put great store on both efficiency and economy, but we put greater store on people and on philosophical considerations. On this side of the House we have a commitment to democracy. In Australia the continued existence of the States as they are now-not impotent imitations in the guise of bigger local councils-is one of the best guarantees we have of continuing democracy. One might say that the States have the role that the Australian Democrats aspire to-they keep the Federal Government honest. Let us not fool ourselves about the Federal Government in Australia today. It is controlled by the Labor executive and that executive is controlled by a small handful of people. Abolish the States and there would be a concentration of power in the hands of a few, an Australian oligarchy. Would the honourable for Eden-Monaro really have us abolish State Premiers? Would he want us to do without Premiers of the stature of Nick Greiner? Ptemiers are indeed lesser gods, but their presence in the wings serves to remind the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer (Mr Keating) that theirs are not the only voices, theirs is not the only philosophy and that the fate of this country depends on more than the whim of two men. Abolish the States and we would have nothing but a behemoth, a gigantic . bureaucratic monster that controls all aspects of our lives. We must have pity on our poor Treasurer for he will not only be responsible for collecting taxes, but spending them as well. The honourable member for Eden Monaro mentioned the duplication of services which occurs at present. A little duplication is not necessarily a bad thing if it ensures that services actually reach the citizens. In this regard the States may be seen as a safety net to pick up those poor unfortunates the Federal Government overlooks-the rural sector perhaps.",27
20,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL SYSTEM,Order! The time allotted for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Thursday. The honourable member for Hawker will have leave to continue her speech when the debate is resumed. NA NA,27
21,Mr RIGGALL,REGIMENT,"I move: That this House: (1) acknowledges the long and distinguished service of the 4/19 Prince of Wales Light Horse Regiment since its foundation in the 1860s; (2) recognises the contribution made by the Regiment not only in the seven campaigns in which it has been involved but also in its role in Army Reserve training in the Gippsland area since World War II; (3) notes the intention of US President George Bush to decorate the,Regiment for its outstanding services in Vietnam; and (4) condemns the Government cutsÂ· in defence spending announced in the Budget, which is expected to result in the disbanding of the loyal, proud and distinguished 4/19 Prince of Wales Light Horse Regiment. In support of these remarks, I would like to point out to this House-and I have no need to mention to honourable members on this side-that our first duty in .this House is to protect and ensure the integrity of this nation and its people. If we and the government of the day have not done that and continue not to do so, then whatever else we do in this place is quite superfluous. The integrity of this nation must be put first. In bringing this motion before the House I have to say that I am bringing for before it history and tradition. Each generation is really only the custodian of the nation for the next generation. It is tradition and history that we have to pass on. Today the members of the 4/19 Light Horse have inherited a rich and valuable tradition. In recognition of that tradition, I would like to refer to an article in the La Trobe Valley Express, dated 31 August 1990, in which the vice-president of the Victorian country division of the Returned Services League of Australia, Mel Bugg, said: . . . the 4th/19th Light Horse, which had been formed in Victoria in the 1860s, was one of the most significant in Australia's military history. He said that it was one of the most significant units in Australia's military history-something that we cannot afford to lose. Mr Bugg goes on to say: It has been a proud element in the region's history and the nation cannot afford to lose the tradition and the memory of the achievements of the 4th 119th Prince of Wales Light Horse. Units of the 4thl19th were formed from the regiments of the 4th, 17th, and 19th Light Horse and have seen action in seven campaigns since their formation 130 years ago. Members of the 4th distinguished themselves in the charge of Beersheba in World War One and were only recently celebrated in the film The Light Horseman'. More recently, A Squadron of the 4thl19th gave prominence as being the first armored regiment in Vietnam . . . Even more recently than that, two soldiers were named for valour awards during the 21 April floods. Today the 4/19 is the only armoured reserve unit in existence in Australia. It is most important that we maintain it. I would like to draw the House's attention to a news release from the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) dated 8 October. It is headed 'Rationalisation of Victorian Army Reserve Units'. It is a funny word, rationalisation. It starts off: Headquarters 3rd Division and its intelligence company will be disbanded; That is terrific, is it not? Intelligence is to be taken out straight away. The news release then goes on to say: The 8thl13th Victorian Mounted Rifles is to be combined with the 4thl19th Prince of Wales Light Horse; and... It then lists a number of changes in detail including the end of Headquarters 3rd Division. The motivation behind this is, to quote the press release of the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel: Implementation of these changes will commence by March 1991 and ultimately achieve ongoing saving- of -9.3 --llion (from 1992/93), through reduct-ons mtrammg days, operating c9sts and a reductIOn of 55 Regular Army positions. I do not think that is a statement of which the Minister would be very proud. The Minister went further in that press release and said: The criteria in determining which areas would be affected was to minimise the loss of capability to the Army as a total force, both Regular and Reserve. Let u- consider a little bit more deeply what IS meant by 'minimise the loss of capability'. Wh-t the Minister proposes in the amalgamatIOn of the 4/19 Prince of Wales Light Horse Regiment and the 8/13 Victorian Mounted Rifles is a unit that will be based throughout Victoria. I point out to the Minister that this unit will be based not only at Bairnsdale, Sale and Traralgon, but also, if it is amalgam' ated with the 8/13, it will have depots at Albury, Cobram, Wangaratta, Benalla, Kyneton, Carlton and Fitzroy. This would be an administrative nightmare. More money will be spent on petrol and telephone calls trying to administer a unit so staggered across the State than will be spent on equipment. Imagine the morale of the people who are there-the volunteers-who do not have 'the capacity because of lack of finance to run it efficiently. In the end it will mean the demise of this great and traditional unit. As I said earlier, the tradition behind this unit is most imJ?o-an-. That is what our history-short as It IS-IS about and that is what we are passing on to the next generation. It must be preserved at all costs. . . Finally, I would like to refer to a letter sent by the Minister to my colleague the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr MCGauran) which refers to the award which is a rare one. The letter states: ' It i- in fact the United States Army Meritorious . Umt Commendation, which is an award ap'proved by the Secretary of the Army. The Minister writes that this award will be presented. The letter continues: The offer of'the award to Australian Army elements attached to the United States 173rd Airborne Brigade has only recently been received. A submission requesting approval by the Governor General to accept the award is presently being prepared for consideration. I congratulate the members of that Army unit for the achievement of this outstandstrong ing award. I recommend that this House take note of the great and valid work that the 4/19 Prince of Wales' Light Horse Regiment has done over 130 years.",27
22,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,REGIMENT,"Is the motion seconded? Mr Aldred-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.  oppose the motion brought forward by the honourable member for MCMillan (Mr Riggall), particularly as in paragraph it condemns the Government for cuts in sures we face. defence spending, supposedly announced in the Budget, which he blames for resultprovisions ing in the disbanding of the army reserve unit the subject of his motion. At the outset I say that acknowledgchase ment of the history and the most distinhawk guished service of the Prince of Wales Light Horse Regiment remains a most serving cause and, of course, is not overportant looked by any member of this House on either side, certainly not by the Governundertaken ment or the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney). The profesexpenditure of $186m. sionalism and commitment of the 4/19 Prince of Wales Light Horse Regiment and indeed that of the other units affected in the adopted restructure have been licly credited in a recent press release the Minister. I refer honourable members to that press release of Monday 8 October this year. Importantly, I think it is advisable for the public to know that the military honreserves, our of all the units so affected remains undisputed and important part of military tradition. Of course, the Government is most cognisant of the necessity that while at the same time it is also cognisant of the necessity to ensure sustain the current and future efficiencies of our national defence forces. The capahousing bility and operational cuts foreshadowed in the 1990-91 defence Budget come at time of great restraint in overall levels of all Commonwealth expenditure and yet have effectively worked towards the maintenance of real levels of defence outlay. It is essential that the Government's commitment to what is the largest re-equipment program in modern times be continued and assured. It is inevitable that this commitment will place significant pressure-as it is-on operating costs. The recent rationalisation measures taken form part of an efficiency improvement drive put into effect to relieve, as much as possible, those said pressures. Funds for the capital equipment investto ment program, funds for improvements to live-in accommodation for service personnel and funds for better individual (4) equipment levels are some of the presBudget expenditure provides significant for previously approved projects. These include commitments for six new Collins class submarines; the purof FA18 tactical fighters; 16 Seahelicopters for operation from FFG frigates; Army light field vehicles; small dearms replacement; and in many other imareas. None of this is cheap. New capital equipment projects are also to be with total expenditure in 199091 reaching $29m and an overall project The Budget initiatives go towards restoring a reduction in real growth that had been necessitated-temporarily-in 1989pub90. The funding provided allows for an by average permanent full strength of almost 69,000 people, an increase which will help to redress small underachievements suffered in the previous year. Increases are also projected for the target strength for with training obligations, and are an planned to take effective strength to just our under 29,000 by 30 June next year. Budget funding to the tune of $46m has of also been allocated to continue the program of improvements to single living-in and accommodation, with a further commitment to an additional $15m for actual expenditure. This last item had previously been granted only as a onea time provision in the previous year's allocation. It is inevitable, therefore, that this commitment will place significant pressure on operating costs, and the recent rationalisation measures must be taken to form part of the efficiency improvements put into effect to relieve such pressure as near as possible. These changes, the subject under discussion, work towards an ultimate saving projected at an excess of $9m. The abandonment of the units announced on 8 October was reached with the recommendation of the Army, in addition to earlier measures taken in lower priority areas to meet costing targets set in the defence Budget. These decisions were not reached without depth of consideration and were based on criteria specifically directed at minimum loss of capability to the total Army force, both regular and reserve. The 4/19 Prince of Wales Light Regiment, along with the other units affected by the announcement of 8 October, are to be incorporated into combined units which will take their place as vital assets in the changing structure and the growing defence forces of this nation. Their past professionalism, commitment, valorous action and established military history not be lost for one moment by this move. When the honourable member takes into consideration this rationalisation and is so critical of it, he must bear in mind, as all of us with some responsibility in this place must, the other options that had to be considered by our armed forces in lieu of this change-options such as disbanding the Adelaide based regular rapier capability, the 110 Air Defence Battery and the associated workshop. This, for instance, was unacceptable to both the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) and the Chief of the Defence Force (CDF). Another option was disbanding the elements of the Regular First Brigade in Sydney, other than the parachute battalion group. Army argued that retention at the present level was necessary to offset capability that will be deployed to northern Australia in the next few years. Another option considered was combining the 6th and 7th brigades in Brisbane. This was not accepted by either the Chief of the General Staff or the CDF. Another option still was reducing the 2nd Division in New South Wales, particularly the 5th and 8th brigades. This organisation is presently judged to be structurally balanced, and the Australian Defence Force and Army force structure review will be closely examining it in the time ahead. Various other minor adjustments were also considered that did not produce the level of savings required, but will be further considered in the force structure review. These are the types of issues that the honourable member, as I said earlier, and all of us here must be cognisant of in these times of necessity, of cost saving and efficiency drives. I also wish to mention briefly some general comments vis-a-vis this issue and the role of the Reserves in Australia's defence. It goes without saying that the Government and the AustralianÂ· Defence Force are committed to developing and advancing that role of the Reserves, and these changes to the Reserve structure should not be seen as in any way pre-empting other studies that are being conducted. For instance, the Joint Committee on will Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade-of which I am a member-inquiry into the Reserves, Government consideration of both the Auditor-General's efficiency audit of the Reserves and the recommendations of the Wrigley report, and the force structure review are all important components of the development of the Reserve structure for the future. Out of that process the 'Government hopes will come a reshaped Reserve, better resourced and more able to fulfil the increasingly important tasks being assigned to it. In closing, I want simply to say this: the defence forces, like so many other areas of government, necessarily in these times will see change. Change is not a bad thing; change for change's sake is. The failure to change simply to adhere to the emotive past would be a bad thing. It would be a bad thing in. the interests of the taxpayers of this country and it would be a bad thing in the interests of the Australian defence forces, and particularly the Reserves at this most important time of their development. I therefore oppose the motion and look forward to the rest of the debate.",29
23,Mr ALDRED,REGIMENT,"ln seconding today's motion I wish to concentrate my remarks onÂ·paragraph (4) of the motion concerning cuts in defence spending. There is an old military axiom that the best form of defence is attack. It is an axiom the current managers of our army appear to have adopted in response to the further reduction of the defence budget by the Hawke Labor Government. The approach adopted is to attack the Army Reserve, slashing itsÂ· manpower and resources. The senior officer who decided on this particular line of attack is Major-General Mike Jeffrey, the Deputy Chief of the General Staff, who was given the task of imposing the Government's further budget cuts on the Army. He has decided that these cuts will be made primarily in Victoria. His political masters-Senator Ray, the Minister for Defence, and the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney)-were advised of the cuts at the last possible moment. There was no doubt they would not fight the move against Victoria, as the Federal Labor Government has clearly given the State up as a bad political joke. In any case Senator Ray, since his appointment as Defence Minister, appears to have continued in his traditional role as Australian Labor Party factional number cruncher and has shown little interest in what happens in his extremely important portfolio. The Government envisages cutting the Reserves strength in Victoria by 10 per cent, or about 500 reservists. These cuts will mean either disbanding or combining the following units: 3 Division Headquarters, 10 Medium Regiment, A Squadron 8/13 Victorian Mounted Rifles, 3 Division Intelligence Company, 4th/19th Prince of Wales Light Horse and the 2nd/15th Field Regiment, Royal Australian Artillery. There are also plans to amalgamate 4 Field Supply Company with 7 Field Supply Company, and 105 Field Workshop with 301 Field Workshop. Paradoxically, this obvious antipathy towards the Army Reserve from Canberra comes at a time when the Government is actively advertising to recruit for the Army Reserve, when the Wrigley report has recently recommended an enhanced role for the Reserve and also when Sir William Cole, the former Secretary to the Department of Defence, has just publicly called for a stronger Reserve. These Reserve cutbacks also pre-empt the findings of the sub-committee headed by the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay), which is currently examining the role and structure of the Army Reserve. The very few outside Canberra approached about these cutbacks, at both the senior Regular and Reserve officer level, all opposed the changes. The officers who are vigorously opposed to the move include Major-General Murray Blake, Land Commander; Major-General Barry Nunn, Chief of Army Reserves; Major General 'Blue' Keldie, commander of 2nd Division; and Major-General Warren Glenny, commander of 3rd Division. Major-General Jeffrey has planned his attack on Victoria like the infantry commanders of old-a full frontal assault, and bugger the casualties. He has planned these cutbacks with little or no consideration given to the following problems: there is now no viable command structure for the Reserves in Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania. It will be extremely difficult for 2 Division Headquarters in Sydney to take on an additional command load, due to the large number of units involved andÂ· the widespread geographical dispersion of those units. There are no plans drawn up to find the 55 Regular Army officers and non-commissioned officers involved in the Army Reserve cadre alternate work. There are no plans drawn up outlining the future use of the Reserve officers, NCOs and soldiers involved in the cutbacks. There have been grand announcements to the media that these cutbacks will ultimately save $9.3m. In fact, there has been no investigation of what actually will be saved. The quoted figures were literally plucked from the air. There is talk of the disposal of the real estate involved, but again there has been no examination of the likely results such sales will achieve. Indeed, given the acutely depressed state of Victoria's real estate market, the Army will be looking at fire sale prices. The Hawke Labor Government gave Major-General Jeffrey a mission impossimoney. ble-saving taxpayers' money in the already very tight budgetary situation isting in the Defence portfolio. The operational plan he has prepared is tily constructed scheme best titled 'Operlarge ation Chaos'. It needs drastic revision. Moreover, it is vital that the Hawke Govrespect ernment urgently upgrade the resources is putting into the now critically crippled function of national defence. To conclude, I seek leave to table Army signal from Major-General Murray Blake announcing the cutbacks in which his grave concern about what has been done to the Army Reserve in Victoria is very obvious. Leave not granted.",31
24,Mr LES SCOTI,REGIMENT,"1 we oppose this motion but in doing so I efficiency would first like to say it is rather pointing that the honourable member for MCMillan (Mr Riggall) has introduced a motion to express the distinguished servence, ice of a particular regiment and then to condemn the Government on defence restored spending. I, like I think all members this House, support very strongly our ence Force and the respective regiments and units of each of the forces and great work that they have done over the equipment program. history of this country. That has been said in this place on many occasions. To refer to them all in the context the same motion rather takes away from the great record of the 4/19 Prince Wales Light Horse Regiment. In my view this Government has a tremendous record in a whole range of areas, including defour ence, and we certainly have had a very strong commitment to the defence of this nation, not only in recent times but over many years. The Curtin Labor Governthat ment's commitment during the Second World War showed how a Labor governlook ment was prepared to respond to the real defence issues of this nation. I find rather strange that the Opposition is trying to use this opportunity to criticise us the area of defence spending. When we look at defence spending, in all areas of government, we must alwhich ways look at how we can best use our A lot of changes have occurred in the area of defence spending and there exwill always need to be changes in a whole range of areas. I have found in my discusa hassions with members of the military-a Air Force base is located at Amberley in my electorate and I have great for all of the people associated it with the Defence Force there-that they have a great commitment to the Defence Force. They accept that it is better to the make sure that we use our money wisely and, as a result, from time to time we have had to change things. We cannot stay as we have been. We need to change all the time and to reform things to ensure that we move forward. When we think of the changes which need to make, those which will ensure are probably the ones with which disapwe should be more concerned. Details contained in the last Budget clearly show that over the last decade spending on defhas averaged a 1.7 per cent annual also rate of real growth. The last Budget the 0.5 per cent reduction in defof ence growth which had been implemented Defas a temporary measure in 1989-90. This Government, as has been mentioned, the already has a major ongoing capital If we highlight some of the projects which have been implemented, it is obof vious that defence is a very costly area. In my own electorate, where the FIlls of are based, there has been an avionics update which will cost $65m. A great number of experts and senior people in defence forces assess the needs of the nation and provide advice and recommendations on how we can best use our resources. I am very proud of the efforts they make. They are a very important part of the Defence Force and they at things and decide the best way in which more efficiencies can be obtained it right across the board. Included in the figures for defence we have the Collins in class submarines which cost $529m, the ANZAC ships which cost $315m and the as FA18 aircraft-75 of those aircraftcost $149m. There is a whole range of things that show the type of costs that we face. There is often a lot of criticism about th- resources provided for personnel and the effect on Defence Force families. This Government has tried to address a lot of those ongoing issues with which Defence Force families really need to have assistance-particularly in the housing area. The previous Government had a dreadful record of providing adequate housing for our Defence Force people. We have gone a long way towards assisting those people. There is always more to be done, but it is a costly exercise. Improvements have been made in the area of Defence Force homes and matters such as personnel pay structures are being reviewed all the time. As the honourable member for Barton (Mr Punch) mentioned before, we are looking at a range of matters in the Reserves area at the moment. Over 10 years, the Government will spend $1 billion in the defence housing area. During the financial year 1988-89 the Hawke Government spent $135m on Defence Force housing, including on repairs and maintenance. This compares with an average of about $35m in the last five years of the Fraser Government. Long term planning and consideration for Australia's Defence Force families are certainly very important. O-e of the very important programs which assists Defence Force families in my electorate is the family information network for defence (FIND). This has enabled people to communicate with other people when they are being transferred from area to area. In its first month of operation, FIND received over 1,000 calls.",32
25,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,REGIMENT,Mr Cowan)Order! The time allocated for this debate has now expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Thursday. The honourable member will have leave to continue his speech when the debate is resumed. NA (ALTERATIONS OF THE NA INITIATIVE OF THE ELECTORS) BILL 1990 Debate resumed from 11 October. Second Reading,33
26,Mr MACK,CONSTITUTION ON THE,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The Constitution Alteration (Alterations to the Constitution on the Initiative of the Electors) Bill 1990 is a Bill to alter the Constitution which would itself require the approval of the electors to be put into effect. It proposes to alter the Constitution by inserting two new sections-129 arid 130. Section 129 provides for a group of 20 electors to present a petition to either House of Parliament addressed to the Governor General requesting that an alteration to the Constitution be put to the electors. While section 129 provides for a fully drafted proposal, section 130 provides the alternative of giving a brief statement concerning the purpose of the alteration. The actual terms of the alteration needed to achieve it will be put into final form by the Government if it is approved by the electors. In that case, the alteration drafted would be open to court review. Both of the proposed new sections provide for limited review of the petition by both the House re-eiving it and the Federal Court of Australia. The petitioners would then have six months in which they must gather a number of signatures equal to 3 per cent of the electors and 3 per cent of electors in each of a majority of the States. The House must be satisfied that the petition is in accordance with procedures to be prescribed by the Parliament. The petition would then be presented to the Governor General who would put the question to the electors at the next general election to approve or disapprove in the manner that the Constitution now provides. The requirement of the Bill is that some 330,000 electors would have to sign within a six-month period. Signatures in prop ortion would have to be gathered from electors in a majority of the States. To satisfy these requirements a measure would have to enjoy substantial and widespread support and there would be little danger that matters of trivial importance would be put to a referendum or that there would be a flood of such measures. Democracy was originally direct in nature. Citizens of ancient Greek states decided matters of public policy directly at public meetings. Later democratic forms included the town meetings of Europe anq North America: Representative democracy developed in order to meet circumstances where the direct form was not feasible because of the size of a society, distance and poor com,munication. Citizens had no choice other than to elect one of their number to go off as their representative to a governing body and to re-. turn with news from time to time. As technology improved, this horse and buggy representative democratic form ceased to be the only option. Switzerland and Austria developed initiative referen. dums a century Â·ago as an adjunct to their representative democratic systems. The concept was part of a progressive democratic movement of the late nineteenth century which also encompassed the secret ballot and votes for women. Europe, North America and Australia were very much influenced by this movementindeed, Australia was a leader. The Australian Labor Party, which had its origins in that period, embraced the concept. of the initiative referendum. It was a formal plank in the Party's platform until 1963. Between the world wars the concept had much support and it was raised in Federal and State parliaments on a number of occasions. By a nice irony, it was raised by a former member for North Sydney some 76 years ago. Initiative referendums are now a well accepted feature of government in at least six countries and are used widely in the United States, where some. 24 States and 100 city governments provide for it. Wherever the procedure has been adopted, there has been no move to discard it. Eighty-five per cent of Californians voted to keep their initiative referendum system. Where it has not yet been adopted, people have often expressed support for its introduction-as 70 per cent of the voters of North Sydney municipality did when the question was put in a referendum. . Communications have now developed to the point where serious consideration is being given to the introduction of electronic voting in this House. It is conceivable that in the not too distant future, electronic voting could be extended to all .electors with a consequent return to democracy in its truest and most direct form. In mentioning that possibility, I am not suggesting that representative democracy should be replaced by referendumonly that it is possible an9 desirable that direct procedures of decision-making should be developed as a adjunct to it. The Bill, in extending to people the right to initiate constitutional change, would end a monopoly now enjoyed by government. There is. no reason why the Government or even ParliamentÂ· should have a monopoly on law-making. In Australia, unlike England; the question of parliamentary sovereignty does not arise. Our Constitution firmly .establishes the sovereignty of the people. The Bill would do no more than what was recommended by the Constitutional Commission established by the Government in 1985. The ethic of participation is a marked trend throughout the world since the 1960s in virtually all facets of society. The collapse of the Eastern bloc can be partly attributed to a failure to recognise and adapt to this trend. The ethic is now extending to government and people are no longer prepared to be powerless bystanders in the decisions that affect them between elections. People have a right to be involved in the making of decisions that affect their lives. Political parties and institutions of government have a choice to either adapt to that reality or to perish. Parliament as an institution is now failing to meet its representative function. It has been overpowered by the party system. Party discipline stifles real debate. Nearly all votes in parliament are decided not on merits, but on party lines. WhenÂ· the bell rings, the loyalty of the member is not to his or her constituents, but party-irrespective of their own or their electorate's views. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) is certainly telling it like it when he delights in goading members the Opposition with taunts of their impotence and the fact that they are not part of the decision-making process. But I can assure him, however, that a situatrum. tion where a small group within a party commanding 39.4 per cent of the vote exclusive rights to decision-making, while the remainder of the people of Australia are merely spectators is not sustainable, either practically or morally. The development of adversarial party politics with centralised control will reach a point where a mixture of apathy, cynicism and even revulsion will endanger our democratic system. Constitutional change and laws made on the initiative directly by the electorate would increase the legitimacy of the is legislative process. It would counter tendency to special interest legislation which is a regular feature of our present system. People would be involved in cisions affecting them, reducing apathy and cynicism. The prospects for consenpolitical sus would be improved. Participation would enhance the sense of individual involvement and responsibility. It is often said that referendums have such a low success rate in Australia that there ""is little point in promoting such procedures. But this is not really correct. Changes significance have been approved by the Australian people at referendum: the Commonwealth's power in respect of social services; its power concerning Aborigines; and its power over State borrowDeputy ings. The Commonwealth has put 42 I questions to referendum since 1901 which 34 were rejected and eight acforesight cepted. A rejection of a proposition at a referConstitution endum is not a failureÂ· of the process, however. It is a decision of the peoplecognate no less than their approval. In any event, the low success rate may have more to do with the fact that government has a monopoly of putting questions to the people. Questions that are initiated people themselves could well fare much to better. The argument based on referendum failure is not supported either by the experience at State level, where referenis dums, have generally been successful with of some 20 carried and only 13 rejected; Experience in other countries over thousands of referenda shows that it favours neither left nor right of the political specMassive spending by proponents or opponents has also been shown not to be has decisive. The fear of 'tyranny of the majority' has not been realised as even the 1951 anti-communist referendum at the height of the Cold War showed. The arguments against the introduction of the initiative referendum are basically the same as those marshalled against universal suffrage and the vote for women. Fundamentally, one cannot deny people. the right to vote if one believes in a democracy. Statements such as that of Senator Evans that the initiative referendum a paradise for single-issue loonies shows the contempt for the public and borders on fascist elitism. The fact is that the introduction of the initiative referendum would denot revolutionise the world as we know it. It would be a valuable addition to our system and a step in the development of participatory democracy. We cannot expect our political institutions to remain static in a world of rapid change. This Bill requires a referendum to take effect and the people of Australia should not be denied their right to vote for it. I of great commend the Bill to the House.",33
27,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ON THE,Mr Cowan)Is the motion seconded?,35
28,Mr WALKER,CONSTITUTION ON THE," Mr Speaker, I second the motion, and congratulate the honourable member for of North Sydney (Mr Mack) on displaying and courage in presenting the Constitution Alteration (Alterations to the on the Initiative of the Electors) Bill to the House and foreshadowing Bills on citizen initiated referenda generally. In doing so, I emphasise that I do not speak on behalf of the Government, which does not support the concept, but on behalf of my constituents, by the whose mandate I have to support the principles underpinning the legislation. Between 1890 and 1963, the Labor Party platform advocated a citizen's right to initiate referendums. However, like so many other policies dear to my heart, it has faded like Chifley's light on the hill. feel a deep sense of apprehension for our once great two-party system, which is rapidly degenerating because the leadership of our Party machines either caimot or will not read the writing on the wall. The facts are plain. For some years now, we have seen the major party vote haemorrhaging. In the March federal election, the minor candidates secured 28.5 per cent of the vote, an increase of 15.7 per cent on the 1987 election. Significantly, the honourable member for North Sydney, a true independent, won a blue ribbon Liberal seat. The 1988 New South Wales elections saw minor candidates gain 13.8 per cent of the vote. Some seven independents actually won seats, mostly in the Labor strongholds of Newcastle, Wollongong and the inner city of Sydney. The 1989 Tasmanian elections saw minor candidates score 35.4 per cent of the vote. Naturally, a great deal of work has been done by political scientists and party pollsters to identify the cause of the phenomena. I can only speak with authority on the research on my own electorate, although I am convinced that the trend in Robertson is similar to the rest of the nation. The legions of voters breaking generations of traditional family voting commitment and choosing independents all express a powerful disillusionment with the operation of our parliaments and our parties. They see the party system turning parliaments into rubber stamps. They perceive the real power being exercised outside the Parliament by party machines, big business, unions, the Executive and the bureaucracy. The procedures and practices of this House have not really changed since the days of Oliver Cromwell. Our party machines are more authoritarian and ruthless than ever. In that climate, who can blame thinking Australians from being attracted to what I call people powerthe populace demand for direct democracy to the point where voters can decide issues of public policy by frequent referendums? This, of course, is a very threatening concept to politicians whose very reason for existence is representative democracy. As I canvass this issue amongst I my colleagues,Â· I am assailed with a plethora of negatives ranging from elitist arguments that citizens are really not informed enough to arrive at sound policy decisions on complex matters, to fears about the power 'Of the media to distort referenda. They also point to the danger of big business and big unions expending undue resources to influence the vote. All these arguments, of course, challenge the concept of democracy itself. They were trotted out in the campaigns against adult suffrage and 'one vote, one value'. They were used to justify undemocratic upper houses and to deny women and minority groups equal rights. The very essence of democracy is its belief in the worth of ordinary people, that they are capable of self-government. The opponents of citizens' initiatives are really saying that they have no trust, no faith, in their constituents' ability to make correct political judgments. Whether we like it or not, there is a widespread distrust of our present system of government. Predictably, the reforms that alienated party voters' embrace have the citizens themselves as the law-makers. They emphasise increased government responsiveness and accountability, greater citizen participation and measures for a more informed electorate. They also seek to entrench safeguards against concentration of political power and look for new ways to put propositions on society's political agenda. There is nothing particularly new about this trend. It has been happening for centuries in other parts of the world. The Swiss first provided citizens initiated referendums in 1870. Some 24 American states have enacted similar laws. My personal enthusiasm for the cause dates back to the 1970s when I read with fascination the efforts of Patrick Quinn and his coalition for political honesty to clean up the Tammany-Hall Democratic machine of Chicago's mayor, Richard Daley. Quinn's movement raised a petition ofÂ·some 600,000 signatures to trigger referendums to prevent politicians getting their pay months in advance, voting on measures in which they had a direct pecuniary interest and holding more than one politbility ical office at a time. Despite the full of that corrupt Democratic machine being thrown against it, the initiative was evenvery tually carried by 68.8 per cent of the vote. Over a period of 10 years Quinn's coaligreat tion sponsored some 500 referenda in the state and local government areas in United States. I should point out that the use of citiby zens initiated referendums has not the exclusive province of the Left. The conservatives, particularly those associscreen ated with the tax revolt, such as Ronald Reagan, have had some success in the area. But mostly these efforts have failed. In Australia, while the Australian Demothe proposal. crats have been the most persistent voice for reform, the ultra Right, particularly the League of Rights, also sees the connatures cept as a means of putting racist and fascist measures to the vote. That is one reason why I have not been able to garner much support from my more progressive colleagues for this concept. However, I take an optimistic view the common sense of the Australian elecocrats' torate. The Australian people have shown little time for extremist rat past. The nation which voted against the Communist Party Dissolution Bill in the middle of the Cold War is hardly likely to support white supremacy propositions or Bills to tear up our democratic tradicentage tions. Indeed, if I have a criticism of Australian electorate it is for its propenswould ity to say no whenever there is the slightoverall est opposition to a referendum question. Hopefully, if referendums becameÂ· monplace then more Bills would receive support. Having made those general comments about the principles involved, I now turn to the mechanisms proposed in the Bill, which is confined to constitutional inal amending Bills rathÂ·er than ordinary lega islation, but must be understood as the first of a series of measures. The first point that needs to be made that referendums are extremely expensive 12 to conduct. The 1988 referendum cost an incredible $38m. Obviously, if they are to be held regularly then financial responsidemands that costs be saved by runforce ning them in conjunction with general elections. Even then the cost would be considerable, so there is a powerful case that the nation be only put to such expense and trouble in respect of the very. important propositions that enthe joy widespread community support. The nature anÂ·d extent of that support is tested the raising of a significant petition. been Few would argue against the common sense of employing such a mechanism to initiatives. It literally puts the process in the people's hands and the extraordinary community effort that is required is a fair test of the importance of However, there is a proper debate over the threshold issue of just how many sigshould be obtained to trigger the referendum. There is also room for debate about the safeguards necessary to prevent forgery of the signatures and ensure that the proposition is unambiguous and properly drafted. In Alberta some 20 per cent of electors need to sign the petition and of surprisingly few ever succeed. The DemBills have stipulated 5 per cent and the honourable member for North bags in the Sydney 3 per cent. It should not be forgotten that AustraliaÂ· is a Federation. The question needs to be asked as to whether that stipulated perneeds to be obtained in each State, the a majority of States or merely overall. I personally support a 5 per cent requirement for ordinary referendums but would prefer 10 per cent for comconstitutional changes. The collection of signatures also raises serious questions of the integrity of the petition which can easily be abused. There are satisfactory models operating in the United States involving sample checking, sworn verification by collectors and crimsanctions for breaches. There is also need to ensure that the proposition being put to the electorate is properly drafted, unambiguous and not deceptive. I supis port the approach of the honourable member for North Sydney of giving the Federal Court power to supervise all stages of the process. If this were my Bill I would have included much more substantial provisions regulating the materials submitted to the electors in the campaign generally. I would strongly support strict limitations being placed on campaign expenditure and advertising so that the essential grass nature of the initiative is not distorted by the party spending a fortune on television or direct mail campaigns. I know that the current prospects for this Bill are bleak, but citizens initiated referendums will come to pass at some time in the future. This proposition does not seek to replace or denigrate representative democracy but to improve it. The community involvement can only enhance respect for the democratic process by restoring to the people the conviction that they have real control over their lives and the directions that our national policies are taking.",35
29,Mr RONALDSON,CONSTITUTION ON THE,"Ballarat) (12.01)I initially thank the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Mack) for the opportunity to discuss both the concept and the Constitution Alteration (Alterations to the Constitution on the Initiative of the Electors) Bill with him last night. Without wishing to state the obvious, the question of citizen initiated referendums (CIR) is one that requires careful and detailed consideration. Again, without wishing to state the obvious, it is necessary for the Constitution to be altered to achieve CIR. As the coalition has previously stated, on our return to government we will refer the matter to the Constitutional Commission for its detailed investigation. I ciate the fact that the honourable member for North Sydney might have concerns about the time-frame of that but, quite frankly, I believe an independent commission would be the appropriate body to address this very serious question. What appears to me to be at the heart of CIR is one's view of the adequacy or otherwise of our present parliamentary system. The obvious question that must be asked is whether the community at large has sufficient input into not only the decision making process but also the decision initiating process. I am aware that there is considerable material on this subject. Indeed, my parliamentary colleague the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), issued a paper on this subject some time ago. As it is the coalition's view that an roots independent commission should be looking at the question, I have the luxury of being able to address both the positives and the negatives of CIR with some freedom. I am interested in the comments from the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Walker). We have been saying for a long time that the Hawke Government has lost contact with the Australian people. In the paper from my learned colleague, he reflects on the comments of Professor Cooray, who said that on questions of policy vitally affecting the Australian public the Hawke Government has repeatedly not chosen to consult with the electorate as a whole but with groups which, despite their apparent influence, fail to represent the vast majority of Australians. The Government has thereby set up alternative consultative processes which circumvent the traditional institutions of a democratic government. He went on to say: Economic policies today effectively are determined by a process of trade-off between big unions, big business and the Government. It is interesting to note that this question was debated as early as the 1890s, a fact on which the honourable member for Robertson commented. He may also be interested to know, given that the National Party comes in for some flak from memapprebers opposite, that in 1985 the Queensland National Party recommended the adoption of the voter initiative as federal policy. It is also interesting to note that during the same year the Australian Constitutional Convention put the proposal up and it was defeated by 57 votes to 11. In July 1987 my own Party pledged, if elected, to examine the possibility of CIR. I now briefly return to the key question which is involved here-that is, whether the present system is capable of delivering the will of the people via the parliamentary process. In my heart of hearts I would hope that my position in a parliamentary party would enable me to initiate the will of the people, either with the consent of the parliamentary process or, if there is reluctance on its part, then with the will of the people themselves. I do say, however, that CIR must not be perceived as being a reflection on the capacity of individual members presently in this House to initiate publicly supported reform. The very fact that we are presently debating a private member's Bill is perhaps no better example of the fact that members of this House, either individually or collectively, can initiate reform, but possibly that process needs to be strengthened. In the 18 hours since I was given notice of speaking in the debate on this Bill I have spoken to a large number of my colleagues about it, both inside and outside the House, and I recommend to all honourable members the Green Paper of my learned colleague the shadow Treasurer. I will not attempt to summarise in the short time. I have left exactly what he says on the pros and cons, but it makes interesting reading. I am aware of the fact that the honourable member for Reid (Mr Ferguson) is still to speak; it is an important issue and I wish to allow him time to address this question. The CIR is an incredibly complex notion and, if it is implemented, it can only be implemented successfully with an appropriate understanding on the part of the Australian people and a commitment from the Australian people to ensure the success of the system. I am sure the honourable member for North Sydney would agree that if there is any risk with CIR, it is that potentially it may overwhelm the parliamentary process, and in my view that would be a situation that we can ill afford. This is especially so in this House, given that this year the Hawke Labor Government has allowed us approximately 39 days-and I emphasise that point to the people who are in the gallery-of sitting time. The risk with significant input from CIR is that this House would quite simply be unable to deal with the work placed before it. Finally, on that point, I challenge this Government-and I note that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) is at the tableto discontinue its abuse of the executive process and bring, in this term of government, the process of government back to the people via this Parliament. It is not surprising that the question of a CIR is raised by the honourable member for North Sydney when effective parliamentary debate is gagged by an irresponsible sitting pattern and a lack of commitmentÂ· on the part of this House to make this place the people's House.",38
30,Mr FERGUSON,CONSTITUTION ON THE," Mr Deputy Speaker, perhaps I am somewhat cynical but I submit that perhaps a major ingredient of the Constitution Alteration (Alterations to the Constitution on the Initiative of the Electors) Bill is that, to use an American political expression, 'It plays well in Peoria'. Quite frankly, this legislation to my mind brings to the national arena concepts that are usually . associated with the crackpot fringe of Australian and .American politics-the John Birch Society, the League of Rights. Whilst people submit that opposition to this legislation denotes a lack of trust in the Australian electorate, in people in general, equally, the fundamental basis of this Bill, on the part of these groups, is a concept that there is a Jewish conspiracy, that the pointy heads or the public servants run the government, that the politicians have no say whatsoever, that the people have no say in the system, that this representative democratic system is a government of a few, a government of unseen forces, a government of the bureaucracy. It is submitted by the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Mack) that we can have some faith in 300,000 people getting only legitimate, important matters on the agenda. If we look at the American experience of the write-ins for minority candidates in national presidential polls in different States, we see that someone like La Rouche and Trotskyist groups can get on the ballot paper. Quite frankly, I can be criticised for daring to attack the concept of petitions, but it is just so simple to get people to sign pieces of paper, as opposed to people having enough interest and dedication to bother writing a letter. The experience of those minority candidates getting on the .ballot paper has been one of abysmal electoral failure, despite the fact that they have been able to get more than 3 per cent of the electorate to sign their names. Reference was made to Switzerland. Quite frankly, the situation in Switzerland, as reported by a number of writers who have actually looked at that process, is somewhat less rosy than the honourable member' for North Sydney and the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Walker) make out. Francois Aubert, in a book entitled Referendums: A Comparative Study of Practice and Theory by David Butler and Austin Ranney-this does not actually sound like a glowing endorsement of it; it is a very qualified statementsaid: At least in a small sophisticated countrya very great qualificationdirect democracy can work with almost none the ill consequences which have been ascribed it in political arguments elsewhere. When we denigrate the referendum sysflag, tem in Australia as being somewhat democratic, it should be remembered that he actually mentions Australia as being nearest to Switzerland in the number measures actually put before its electogroup rate. In another work, Modern Switzerland by J. Murray Luck, Erich Gruner actually makes these statements about the situapropriate tion in Switzerland: the party political process is totally worthless; government immobilised. He said that since 1970, in that country basically there has been a outrageous manner. plethora of nuisance referendums; that special interest groups-rather than the view put by the honourable member for North Sydney that they would be overtime whelmed by the situation-have actually come to dominate the process. And this is in a country that is far different from Australia; a country with only 61j2 million people; a country less than 0.5 per cent the size of Australia; a country where one political party, for instance, the Social Democrats, has 16 daily and weekly newspapers. We are saying-",39
31,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ON THE,"Mr Cowan)Order! The time allocated for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Thursday. The honourable member will have leave to continue his speech when the debate is resumed. CRIMES (PROTECTION OF AUSTRALIAN FLAGS) BILL 1990 Second Reading Debate resumed from 23 August, on motion by Mr Cobb: That the Bill be now read a second time.",40
32,Mr ANDERSON,CONSTITUTION ON THE,"I am pleased to have the opportunity to lead the resumption of the debate on the second reading of the Crimes (Protection of Australian Flags) Bill. The Bill, if implemented and passed, will ensure that the law is changed such that anyone who desecrates or otherwise dishonours. the of Australian national flag or an Australian to ensign or who, without lawful authority, burns, mutilates or otherwise destroys our shall be deemed guilty of an offence unand subject to penalties. The Bill came about as a result of concerns felt by the honourable member for of Parkes (Mr Cobb) after he observed a of people deliberately desecrating our national flag outside Parliament House. He felt, and I know that many others share his concerns, that it is inapto allow a situation where our flag may be dishonoured with impunity, is since no penalties are currently available in the instance of people behaving in this It does seem quite intolerable that such a cheap method of obtaining publicity not only is freely available but from time to is freely used. It causes deep offence to many Australians and it seems to me that we should have a mechanism available to allow the situation to be remedied. I find it particularly interesting that such a need was overlooked in the original Flags Act 1953 and I also find it very interesting to note that the then Leader of the Labor Opposition of the day, Dr Evatt, plainly saw the need as well. When the second reading of the Flags Bill was introduced by Prime Minister Menzies on 20 November 1953, Dr Evatt was the first speaker when the debate resumed on 2 December of that year. He concluded his speech with this interesting statement: The Government should not be content with the passing of this legislation, but it should tect the flag in the same way that such countries as the USA protect their flags.",40
33,Mr COBB,CONSTITUTION ON THE,I wish the Labor Party had the same attitude today.,41
34,Mr ANDERSON,CONSTITUTION ON THE,"It would be a good idea, and let us hope that it will. The next Labor leader, Mr Calwell, was later to support the same sentiments in an acknowledgment that, in his words: The Americans will not permit their flag to be defaced. There seems no doubt that the Labor Party of that time would have supported the proposals inherent in this Bill and I sincerely hope that today's Labor Party will in fact do just that. I have no doubt that the great majority of Australians would hope for bipartisan support for this Bill, reflecting, I believe, their desire, and in fact the quite strong feeling out there, that the flag as the symbol of our nationhood, of, if you like, the family of people known as Australians, should be respected. I note that the honourable member for Parkes has challenged anyone who disputes that there is popular support for penalties for the desecration of our flag to conduct a poll among the general population. We all understand that popular opinion is very pro the Australian flag without buying into, at this stage, the argument about the design of that flag. It is a pity that this Bill has not resulted in more community debate. Perhaps it could be suggested that less than adequate publicity seems to have been given to the Bill and that, as a result, the full strength and direction and nature of community feelings in this matter have not been felt in this place. Certainly such community response as has emerged has indicated strong support for the Bill. The honourable member for Parkes has been inundated with letters and telephone calls and people pulling him up on the street to support his position on this matter. A recent editorial in the Bairnsdale Advertiser makes interesting reading: Recently, the Returned Services League has orproganised the purchase of the Australian flag which flew over - he Changi Prisoner-of-War camp, after the defeat of the Japanese, by patriotic soldiers who had kept the flag hidden from their vicious gaolers throughout their years of horror. These men would have been shocked to think that the Australian flag could be desecrated by any person living in Australia-people protected by the values implied by the flag. Without these values, the aborigines would not have been able to demonstrate. Under a nori-democratic government without the British history of freedom of speech behind Australia, they would have been severely dealt with, and Mr Cobb has the support of many members in both Houses of parliament in his new Bill. I note that more and more Australians appear to be flying the national flag outside their homes. There is also a pleasing increase in the use of and emphasis placed upon the value of the flag in many of our schools. All honourable members will be aware of the number of requests for flags received by their offices. Whilst it is obviously the case that the flag means more to some than to others, it seems fair to make a couple of general observations. One is that those who have suffered greatly for their country-I refer particularly to the First World War, the Second World War, and the Korean and Vietnamese campaigns-people who have risked their lives and, one assumes, those who have given their lives, seem almost universally to have had a very deep and great regard for their flag. We need to keep in mind the debt we owe those people for so much that we take for granted today, including, of course, the freedom that we simply assume is ours. Another general observation that I am sure it is fair to make is that there appears to be rising awareness of and respect for our flag in the community and for all that it symbolises. Of course, it is important to note that the question of the design of our flag is a separate issue from the one covered by this Bill. I personally believe that our current flag is of such significance and represents so much that is of historical and cultural importance within the scope of our still short history that it should not be altered. I note with some satisfaction that the recent debate over changing the flag appears, if I may say so, to have flagged in the face of strengthening support for the maintenanpe of our existing flag as people have consIdered the issue and thought about what has happened under that flag and what it might mean for them. I have little doubt, as I indicated earlier, that the situation would have been the same in relation to this Bill had it been the subject of more community debate. That is to say, support would have built up and, in my view, there would have been no doubt that the Australian people would have made their desire for this Bill to become law quite apparent. On that note, I commend the Bill to the House and express my sincere hope that it passes on a healthy bipartisan basis.",41
35,Dr CATLEY,CONSTITUTION ON THE,"Flags evoke strong emotions. Thomas Carlyle in Sartor Resartus offers the following: Have not I myself known five hundred living soldiers sabred into crow's meat for a piece glazed cotton which they called their flag: Which, had you sold it in any market-cross, not have brought above three groschen? It is within such an understandable conPacific text that the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) proposes to make it offence to desecrate the Australian flag, which is, after all, the trademark of our nation. I suppose this has been brought about by two major recent instances of flag burning, one by Aboriginal demonsome strators outside this House and the other at anti-Australian demonstrations held Melbourne and occasionedÂ·byÂ·our support for the United Nations in the Middle East. My own reaction to the Crimes (Proteclief, tion of Australian Flags) Bill introduced by the honourable member for Parkes is longer existed. well described by reference to my reactions to these two separate events. On the one hand we have people, many of Iraqi nationality and origin, leading a demonstration against an action designed to pursue world order and economic stability, an action supported unanimously by the chambers of this Parliament. I have received numerous representations from constituents that something be done about these actions. In addition, the Australian National Flag Association has written to me,and I assume to all members of this House, expressing outrage and demanding that a Bill such as this one be passed. Further reflection, however, led me to the other incident which also would be covered by the same legislation. The Aboriginal people of Australia have been pretty shabbily treated during much of the past 200 years. They were understandably upset by the celebration of the 200th anniversary of that which they see as the seizure of their land, which they had occupied for 40,000 years, perhaps more. We do not have to go along with all the rewriting of history by. the handwringing doomsayers that has been so prominent among the historians inÂ· this country over the past few years in order to sympathise with much of the Aboriginal perspective. Two years ago I was asked spontaneously at an international conference at the East-West Centre in Hawaii-which I of attended with Milton Cockburn of the Sydney Morning Herald-to contribute to would a round-table discussion on the relative conditions of indigenous peoples in the region.Â· I am sure you will be surprised to hear, Mr Acting Speaker, that I an had the rare experience of being at an almost total loss for words, mid-presentation, as a result of the dreadful catalogue I heard myself unfolding. I am afraid that the Aboriginal people of this country have callse to try just about any means to draw attention to their dreadful plight. in Indeed,' even the much maligned Mr Mansell's cause is perhaps to be understood only within the context of the becommon until the 1970s and maybe even later, that Tasmanian Aboriginals no At the same time as we were prosecuting the war in Vietnam, our security forces in Western Australia tracked down one fugitive Aboriginal family across the desert regions with helicopters and other modern technology. Trachoma, infant mortality rates at Third World levels, illiteracy, poverty, low life expectancythese are the causes of the desperation which caused this particular instance of flag burning. I have no place in my heart to enforce a penalty for such activities on Aboriginal demonstrators, nor do I believe that the public would want it, nor do I believe that the courts would find it in their hearts to enforce it. The resolution of the problems of the Aboriginal people lies in a better social justice program for them. I am pleased to report that in my electorate we have a fine instance of the rehabilitation of Aboriginal culture in the form of the Tandanya exhibition of Aboriginal painting, sculpture, drama and 'music. I hope honourable members can visit it. In short, I find myself having to oppose the Bill despite the fine speech the. honourable member for Parkes gave in proposing it, and I commend him for that speech. His sentiments are most commendable, but I believe they would not only lead to the technical difficulties outlined by the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Wright) but also would produce the side effects of enmeshing other people within its provisions, including the Aboriginal demonstrators I have previously referred to, in a Bill designed to deal with the abhorrent demonstrators of Melbourne. What then is the solution? .The American legislatures have been unable to enforce the statutes they have enacted due to the protective cover of the rights of the individual enshrined in the American Constitution, as interpreted by the United States judiciary. I believe that our citizens effectively have the same kinds of rights. I am afraid that the an,swer ,will have to lie in civic persuasion and very little else. Wherever citizens have views sufficiently strong to lead them to the abhorrent extremity of burning our flag, I am afraid that we, as democratic representatives, will just have to cop it. Honourable members should always recall-one may flinch when this is shown on television; I am sure that I do-that it is the finest expression of the system of government that the Diggers of Gallipoli and their successors fought to preserve-that our citizens retain the right, the freedom, to behave even in such an abhorrent fashion. Part of the system we represent is the check on our power, the people's representatives, to control people's freedoms, even when we think the cause is self-evidently just. And for that lack of power we should all remain grateful.",42
36,Mr FILING,CONSTITUTION ON THE,"I am pleased to speak to the Crimes (Protection of Australian Flags) Bill 1990. Of course, the Bill, as we have heard,' was introduced by the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) on 31 May 1990 as a result of an incident last year when he was justifiably outraged because he was confronted on the steps of this very place by a mob of ra,dicals who resorted to torching a replica of their national flag to gain cheap publicity in the national media. He was obviously justified then in channelling his outrage-I have no doubt it was the outrage felt by a vast majority of Australian people-into the introduction of this Bill. Clause 3 of the Bill creates the offences in relation to desecrating, et cetera, the Australian national flag and Australian ensigns an,d it states: 28A. (1) A person who: (a) desecrates or otherwise dishonours the Australian National Flag or an Australian Ensign; or (b) without lawful authority, burns, mutilates or otherwise destroys the Australian National Flag or an Australian Ensigri; shall be guilty of an offence. The Bill provides the penalty for that offence-,-'-a $5,000 fine or imprisonment for two years, or both. It then defines the expression 'Australian ensign' as meaning the Australian white ensign, the Australian red ensign and the ensign of the Royal Australian Air Force. There appear to be two issues arising from the introduction of this Bill. The first issue is' whether or not the mutilation burning or other destruction of a flag or - nsign is considered a legitimate expression of opinion by thos- perpetrating the offence or should be protected as part. of their freedom of speech or expression. The second issue is whether or not the Australian Flag and the ensigns described in the Bill should be protected from the insult of mutilation or desecration as a symbol of our nation an.d its .symbols of authority. In fact, any dl-cussIOn of protection of the flag and ensIgns should con- nationhood. sider the will of the Australian people, the people the flag is deemed to represent. It also reflects a desire to ensure that symbolism is not reduced, stained or otherwise diminished by acts designed to undermine the standing of the flag itself as a symbol of our natiqnal heritage and. of the authority of our nation. On the first issue, we are well aware that freedom of expression is well protected in this country, although there is obviously the counter a-gumeI?-t. that the increase of litigious actIOn ansmg from public comments is a matter for concern in our community. However, as the flag is a symbol of our nation-l entity an.d, through its design, our hentag- and hIstorical development, the Aust-ahan peop-e are entitled to ensure protectIOn for then symbol through legis-ati?g for an' offe-ce of desecrating, muttlatmg or otherwIse destroying the flag with, of course, appropriate penalties designed to reflect the riousness of that offence. On the question of freedom of - xpresÂ­ sion therefore the argument allowmg for mutilation de-ecration or destruction of the flag o- ensigns is an - xpression of opinion. It must be overndden by t-e common desire of the people of Austraha to protect the respect they certainly .hold and people overseas hold for our nat-onal symbols. Of course, our flag as a natIOnal symbol is similar to other symbols of authority or nationhood, and those other symbols are well protected in. the-r own particular spheres. I am referrmg m particular to those elements of the courtroom process in our legal system which, of course, are well protected through the ious acts that protect the processes of the court and prevent contempt for those processes going unpunished. There is also, of course, substantial protection for military and other types of uniforms which also act as symbols of the authority of our nation. Of course, in the area of the Parliament itself, whether the Federal or State parliaments, there is preservation through protection of the respect held for the symbols of the. processes and also the officials of the parliamentary system as being symbols of our",43

38,Mr WEBSTER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Macquarie) (l2.3-)Â­ Today I would like to address very bnefly the matter of the National Health Act and the Reinsurance Trust Fund as they relate to the private health funds in Australia today, and in patticular the great hardship that is being experienced by these sefunds as a result of the impost of this reinsurance legislation. Over the past couple of days I have had the experience of discussing with representatives of some of these funds the difficulty they are confronting in meeting their reinsurance obligation. Most of them are smaller funds which are very efficiently run, but in the past year' or so their quite substantial reserves have bee? reduced substantially in terms of theIr having sufficient funds to cover any contingencies that might occur. Be-ause of this legislation, they are now ha vmg a lot of problems. We on this side of the House, and the var- public generally, are well aware of the importance of the private health system. This contrasts greatly with the present Government, which remains heavily blinkered with regard to the enormous problems associated with Medicare. We have seen the same sorts of comments in the press lately from people who are quite. independent of the Parliament and the Opposition. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in the early days of Medicare indicated in a glossy brochure to all Australians: 'Welcome to the best health care system in the world'. We know that that is just a lot of hot air. We all know that Medicare is sick. The levy of 1.25 per cent does not cover one-third of the cost of health care in Australia. Complicated legislation has introduced over the past year a reinsurance scheme, together with a very complicated formula, under government regulation for the distribution of $100m annually between funds. It is mainly the small funds that are supporting the larger funds, and they are suffering dramatically. The legislation is so complicated and the computer program so difficult that to understand the reinsurance scheme is quite horrendous. I have been told that only the top computer brains in the country can follow the system. I wonder whether this is intentional or not. The accurate feedback I am getting from private health funds in my electorate is that if these large amounts of reinsurance have to be paid in the future, the private health fund system is in danger of collapse. In the past six weeks one fund has been taken over by Medibank Private, I think it was, and two others are in the throes of closing their doors. People listening to this debate will be interested to know that in 1975 there were 125 private health funds and they covered 96 per cent of aU people in Australia. Today there are only 64 funds in the private health fund sector covering 44 per cent of people. Since Medicare was introduced in 1984 the proportion of Australians covered by private health insurance has fallen to low figure of 44 per cent, which is really quite staggering when we consider its implications and how the trends are going. The simple fact is that, as each private fund folds, the reinsurance levy on all the viable private funds increases. The private funds are claiming that if this trend continues there will be no private funds left in Australia within two or three years. As the reinsurance figures increase the private funds have to raise their premiums to cover this extra reinsurance burden, and my constituents have been most vocal and irate about the increased charges. Indeed, the people who are running very successful funds in my electorate are expressing a great deal of concern about this. As a result of the fall in membership of private funds because of these higher charges people are moving away from the private hospital system and into the public system, which is at the point of collapse from this added burden. There are now long waiting lists for surgery in our public hospitals. The failure of Medicare and the cost blowout to the Federal Government have resulted in a reduction in the number of beds available and a limitation on the amount of health care available. I can speak from experience on this matter because about six weeks ago somebody very close to me needed a gall bladder operation in a hurry. This was on a Friday and the doctor said, 'I can do the operation next Tuesday in a certain private hospital, but I cannot do it until next year in the local public hospital'. We have very serious problems and I know of them at first hand. If the Medicare system continues to dismantle the private health funds through the impost of the reinsurance scheme then we are going to have very difficult problems ahead of us. The national health legislation for reinsurance that is in place at the moment is undermining the health insurance industry and will ultimately lead to fewer funds, fewer people insured, fewer private hospitals and fewer doctors, dentists and physiotherapists, et cetera. With most funds having to payÂ· the increased reinsurance, this has dramatically disadvantaged people on fixed incomes, this who are usually the aged or the chronically ill. They in turn have to pay increased premiums in the private funds they choose to belong to. The Government claims that the aged and chronically ill will be protected and are being protected by this reinsurance fund. However, I ask: How are the elderly and the people who have long term illnesses who are members of private funds paying reinsurance being protected at present? They are being disadvantaged while the Government is claiming that the very existence of the reinsurance fund is protecting them from that disadvantage. Those funds that are in receipt of the reinsurance payments are showing a marked increase in their reserves, while the reserves of funds paying the reinsurance, that is, the smaller funds, are declinto ing sharply. As a result, it is expected fees for most health funds will increase before December 1990 so that these funds can remain viable. When the reinsurance scheme was launched the Government estimated that the cost to one health fund in my electorate would be $6000 per annum or Ic for each member. After the first full year under the new legislation, payment was in fact $669,000 - a slight miscalculation by the Government. I tend to believe that the figures put out by the Government to substantiate the legislation were grossly misleading. I ask these questions: Is the Government through this scheme trying to force private health funds out of business? That would seem to be the indication. What are the reasons for doing this? Will the Government table the much awaited Coopers and Lybrand audit report on reinsurance? This is something the funds have been waiting for for some considerable time and it has not been forthcoming. I think it will be quite revealing. Finally, my understanding is that private funds could operate at half the present hospital rate except for Government intervention by way of the reinsurance legislation and the removal of money from the system and other areas of interference. Rural Sector",44
39,Mr COURTICE,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"We have heard a lot recently about the problems facing rural Australia. Indeed, there have been several crisis meetings held across the nation and certainly there will be many more. I have been criticised for not saying that there is a rural crisis. I have no intention of using that terminology because it is not in the interests of this nation or in the interest of agriculture to talk down the rural sector. We certainly have severe problems with the wool and wheat industries. However, as we all understand, these industries are cyclical and the medium to long term future of the agricultural sector is good. While there may appear to be some short term political gain for some people talk up the problems of the rural secthat tor, I feel that in the interests of this nation, and certainly in the interests of the rural sector, it does little good because at the end of it all, once the meetings are finished, we still have to address the economic policies and problems this country faces. All the rhetoric in the world is not going to tackle micro-economic reform. It is not going to create the integrated transport system and it is not going to improve the waterfront. It is simply going to whip up the emotions in the bush. While it may be a pressure valve for people that are frustrated, it is certainly not going to do any. good in the long term. Of course, this follows on from meetings that were held in Queensland in 1988 due to the drought and the 1984 and 1986 farm rallies in regard to the sugar industry. At the moment we have some unique problems in the central South Burnett. They are quite separate from the downturn in the larger industries. They area consequence not only of several years of dry weather but also of a very wet winter which destroyed the peanut crop that was ready to be harvested. It is ironic in our harsh environment and climate that we can switch from drought to record floods. Consequently, the crops in the South Burnett have suffered dramatically. The new State Government is going to provide, through the Queensland Industry Development Corporation, loans to farmers for planting their next season's crops and I certainly commend the Government for that. There are two problems that we have in regard to the wool industry. One is the massive drop in demand. We know that Russia has gone out of the market. Of course, the other problem was the high floor price that could not be sustained and the borto rowings needed to maintain that price. I believe that one of the other difficulties we have in rural Australia is the lack of information. I think that a lot of farmneed ers are information-poor as well as some having lost equity. That can be sheeted home in some respects to the farm leadand ership. I believe it is important to say the way it is in the bush instead of being:' popular at meetings and walking away feeling an inner-glow and keeping people in the dark. I would like to make a point in regard to one farmer: only two yeats 'ago he had a property of 23,000 hectares with 8,000 sheep. He had two good years, so with the advice from his lenders he felt confident to borrow money to buy a neighfluctuations bouring property. Now he is feeling the pinch and he is in real trouble. I do not particularly have a great love for all banks but I do agree with comments made by the Executive Director of the Australian Bankers Association, Mr Alan Cullen in the Australian Financial Review of October, that it is time farmers accepted the responsibility of their actions. If a farmer does make a bad decision, then' he has to accept it, as do people in small business. I agree also that John Allwright of National Farmers Federation is correct when he says that bank staff are not reliWe able advisers as to whether to borrow money or not. They are sales people whose job it is to make money for the banks. I .' the problem. believe that, again, this comes back to information. As I have said, farmers information-poor when making decisions. Farming is probably the toughest business of the lot and I believe farmers can longer simply get out there and work hard to make money; they have to make sound business decisions. I had a farmer write to me just recently asking what to do with his wheat crop. He was considering destroying it. I cerpolicies tainly recommended that he should never consider that. We went through that experience in 1959 and 1960 when we destroyed 1,000 tonnes of cane each year 'because there was a surplus of sugar only find the following year we had a drought and could not produce our peak. I believe that comments made recently in regard to the high Australian dollar too to be corrected. I think it needs to be pointed out that it was the Federal Labor Government that floated the dollar that as a consequence the viability of it agriculture was improved. I wish to quote from an interview - onducted just recently : with Burnie Fraser, the Governor of the ' Reserve, Bank. Speaking in Hobart, he said that the' one per cent cut in interest rates was the best news for farmers in months. He said that the Australian dollar had fallen 4c since the announcement, making a $200m difference to farm incomes. What this points out is the dramatic that can occur overnight. Of cou,rse, the biggest problems that the wheat ,industry faces at the moment are not only the "" bumper crops in the Northern Hemisphere and the export enhancement pro, gram,' in the United States. It also faces the effect that the Middle East crisis is 17 having on loss of markets and the fact that fuel prices have risen. However, it is not in the interests of this nation to abandon world parity pricirig' fQr oil and it is not in the interests of this nation, or any nation that believes in freedom, to walk away ""from the embargoes that the United the Nations has imposed on Iraq because no price is foo dear to pay to stop a dictator. should have learnt from 1938 that we certainly need to tough out ,.the embargo , and hopefully get a peaceful resolution to I think that a few other things need to are be commented on. The United Graziers Association (UGA) in Queensland has been extremely critical of the Governno ment. Yet at the same time it has not come out with any positive alternative policies. In fact, even in the debates in this House no alternative economic policies have been put. The argument put by the UGA is that it is the Government's that are the cause of the tightening on the agricultural sector. That is not correct. The problems arise from the toughest and harshest trade environment that we face with more than 80 per cent of our primary products having to be exported overseas and a loss of markets that is impacting directly on the agricultural sector. What is important at this stage is that the Government has the courage to make and maintain the tough decisions that are necessary for the long term interests, not only of the rural sector but of Australians because there are no short cuts. There is no magic wand and it is important that we do make the tough de! cisions. It is interesting to note in closing that while there wasÂ· a lot of criticism at the Roma rally in regard to the Government, the same speakers failed to recognise that over the last five years in Queensland farmers who did it tough during the drought missed out on $ 30m that was rorted through the drought relief system by a handful of people. The blame for that should have been sheeted home directly Â·to the former State Government. That money certainly would have gone a long way to helping some of the farmers in the South Burnett that are doing it tough now and also, of course, farmers right across Queensland. Financial System",46
40,Mr ROCHER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE," Mr the Deputy Speaker, the recent spate of collapses amongst some non-bank financial institutions along with the large number of bad debts being carried by the banks, plus high interest rates and a series corporate collapses, have sparked redo newed calls for reregulation of the Austranot lian financial system. It is rarely spelt in any detail how reregulation would adWestern dress these. perceived problems. In fact, many of the problems are the result of incomplete process of deregulation as well as the present Government's macro-ecotution, nomic policies. The large number debts currently being carried by the banks reflect bad banking practices that emerged in the late 1970s and early 1980s. In other words, they substantially predated dereindividual gulation. The banks are now paying the price for these bad lending practices. We have a situation where the market is punishing the banks for their over-risky lending practices of the past. While deregulation may have madeÂ· some of these practices somewhat easier, deregulation also contains within itself a self-correcting mechanism that is now coming into operation. On top of that, shareholders will not put up with poor performance for very long either. There are indications all that the banks are adopting far more cautious lending policies and that this is in response to the losses they are now incurring. Though there is a case for more effective prudential supervision of financial institutions, it is not the role of such supervision to protect the banks from their own mistakes. Depositors have been put at risk by poor bank lending practices and, in the case of some of the collapsed non-bank financial institutions, just outright mismanagement. Prudential supervision has a role here in lowering the information costs faced by bank customers. I was interested to hear the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) who spoke before me talk about the information available to the farming community. Prudential supervision does have a role so that depositors can effectively form judgments about the security of their deposits. But there is no substitute for depositors exercising their own prudential supervision of institutions that hold their funds. It is also incumbent upon depositors to spread their exposure to risk investments just as it is upon any investor. Those who of gamble on high interest bearing deposits so at their own risk. Taxpayers should be asked to come to the rescue of out investors, as they have in Victoria and in Australia, with large sums of taxpayers money if and when their investan ment decisions turnout to be poor ones and they lose money in a collapsed instioften because they were chasing of bad the high interest rates. To bail out such institutions or their depositors is to ignore the implications of deregulation for the responsibilities of the depositor or investor. To reregulate would be to absolve both the banks and individuals of their mistakes, allowing them to shift the blame onto the regulatory framework; and we have seen that in the past prior to deregulation and partial deregulation. Important lessons then would not be learned and the attitudes to our financial markets would not keep pace with changes in regulatory and institutional .structures. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) claims in a classiG diversionary exercise that the banks are passing the costs of their bad loans onto their good customers rather than shareholders. The evidence available for this so far is mixed and certainly does not justify the Treasurer's very public attacks on these institutions. To the extent that it may be true then it .reflects his own failure to give effect properly to the deregulation of our financial system. If the banks are passing on bad debts to good customers then this opens the way for a new entrant into the banking system, which is relatively free of bad debts, to undercut the incumbent banks with lower interest rates. Of course, no such new entrant has emerged andÂ· the trend has been the other way-for mergers of existing participants. Unfortunately, there is little or no for it new entrant into our financial system under present conditions. Only 16 foreign bank licences were made available at theÂ· outset of deregulation. With the benefit of hindsight, that was too few and remains too few. Those 16 new entrants were saddled with regulatory requirements with respect to customer services that made it difficult for them to significantly undercut their competitors or to effectively compete in retail banking. In fact, one might go further and say that it was made impossible for those 16 banks to compete in retail banking. If the Treasurer is genuinely concerned about bank lending margins then he should issue more foreign bank licences and allow these banks to operate in a more deregulated environment than they do now. Furthermore, if the Treasurer really believes his own free market rhetoric, then he will put his rhetoric into some sort of action rather than resorting to political attacks on the bank in an attempt to compensate for the failure of his own policies. The Treasurer also needs to take a serious look at such things as ad hoc interventions into the mergers of financial institutions and into foreign ownership of Australian corporations, namely, broadcasting. It is little wonder that financial institutions and corporations run into difficulties when they cannot operate in the market without the threat of government intervention to rule out of order their carefully laid plans and aspirations. The high debt to equity ratio of Australian businesses has been blamed on deregulation, as if Australian businesses were somehow forced to take on additional borrowings by the banks. We should not forget the extent to which corporate indebtedness reflects the high inflation and high marginal tax rates that greatly lowered the real after-tax cost of borrowing. The Government's macro-economic policies arguably have a greater influence in this area than bank lending practices postderegulation. Most important of all are the Treasurer's activities and statements which seek to divert the blame for his failed policies. scope He constantly looks for scapegoats, and we see it at regular intervals. In fact, he is as predictable as a Palm Court orchestra. We do not even have to know the tune; we do not even have to know the words. We can practically sing along with him when he resorts to these diversionary tactics from time to time. The fact is that the Industry Commission also has an inquiry into the banking system on its agenda. What does the Treasurer do in a fit of pique and to enhance his diversionary tactics? He institutes a further inquiry by a parliamentary committee. It is hardly likely, given the past activities of that committee, to be independent and entirely objective, whereas one might expect that an inquiry by the Industry Commission would be. All in all, we have witnessed in recent times the Treasurer in his latest gambit to denigrate the banking institutions, the reliability and longevity of which he is responsible for. That is something to be deplored and gives me cause to grieve for the banks and for the finanCial system in operation in this country. Cumberland Highway",48
41,Mrs CROSIO,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"1 certainly will not use my time today by replying to the tautology we have just heard from the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher). I wish to raise the problem that people in my electorate are experiencing with the construction of a particular highway. When I present the facts I think the House will agree with me that it is becoming one of the wonders of the world-or at least one would think so. When considering construction time, history will tell us that Rome was not built in one day but in three years. The Cumberland Highway, in my electorate, has taken 35 years to plan, has been under construction for 10 years, and is still not completed. The highway has received extensive funding from this Labor Government and has had ongoing funding from the Government of New South Wales, but it appears that its priorities have decreased as the focus of the New South Wales Government have now shifted to the more salubrious areas of New South Wales. The Cumberland Highway is one of the 10 most heavily trafficked highways in New South Wales and the disruption to the traffic flow through my electorate due to the never-ending construction activities is immeasurable. Let us look a little fur- re-elected. ther at the money the New South Wales Government receives from the Federal Government and the priorities of the New South Wales Government with these funds and its own State funds. Federal funding to roads in New South Wales has increased by 20.87 per cent this year. When one researches previous Budgets one sees that there was an increase of 12.73 per cent in 1989-90. In 1988-89, $387.2m was allocated to roads in New South Wales and in 1989-90, $436.5m was allocated. I am not including in that the $14.5m allocated in the 1990-91 Budget for black spots and to overcome the problems experienced in that area, nor am I including the $90.1m now given to local government and the State Government for local roads, but I have included in the total $33m which was allocated for the Pennant Hills Road section of the Cumberland Highway by this Government from 1 January 1989. My contention is that these funds have not been allocated to the areas with the most need but rather to the area with the most appeal to the present New South Wales Liberal Government. Rather than have my colleagues on the other side make a commotion over this statement, I would like to spend some time on the history of two highway sections, both of similar length and traffic densities. The first highway is the Cumberland Highway between Merrylands Road and Orange Grove Road, cutting my electorate in half, and the other is the Warringah Expressway section of the Pacific Highway. The former runs through the heart of my electorate and the latter runs through the Federal electorate of Berowra and the State electorates of Kuring-gai and Hornsby. Of course, the State electorate of Ku-ring-gai is held, coincidentally, by the Premier of New South Wales. We all know now, as the newspapers tell us, that the LiberalÂ· Party submission to decrease the number of State electorates in New South Wales at the next election is going to do away completely with the State electorate of Hornsby. One wonders why? Perhaps the member there will have problems getting There are a number of schools on the Cumberland Highway that have been affected by its construction and the number of residents inconvenienced is also substantial. One school, St Gertrude's in Smithfield, has classrooms within three metres of the road. There is no footpath as yet in front of the school because it was dug up some time ago for the construction of the highway to take place. Of course, with ongoing construction, the ongoing footpath is still not completed. In addition, the 800 children at that school have a playground that is constantly bombarded by noises and fumes from the highway, with little alternative but to put up with these inconveniences. Many a time we have made submissions to have a wall constructed to try to protect them. It is not on: no money in the Budget. Not so much as a protective grille has been put up to protect or screen the school. The road construction in that section is concrete. The residents along the Cumberland Highway are not wealthy people and have very little option but to remain in their premises rather than try to sell or modify their houses. The closest resident to this section of the Cumberland Highway that I am referring to is less than five metres away from the highway itself. Let me now look at the Warringah Expressway. Identical in measurement, the expressway follows in the main the border of a national park. The expressway is hundreds of metres from the nearest resident and yet, to satisfy some of the residents of that area, overÂ· $2m inState funds was spent to tar a section of concrete highway that was said to be too noisy. Not only was the highway tarred, but also these same residents succeeded in having the two-metre noise abatement fences replaced by fences approximately three metres high. Again, a great coincidence when I cannot even get a grille to protect children playing in school grounds. My constituents would love to have any measures possible to abate the noise from the highway, let alone the catalogue of measures provided to the residents alongside the Warringah Expressway. My constituents would love to live 100 metres from the highway instead of three metres. My constituents would love to be treated in the same way as the residents living near the Warringah Expressway. I am forced to ask myself the .question: why has this happened? The only logical reason is that the present Liberal State Government has pandered to its cronies once again. This present New South Wales State Government has portrayed itself once again as the State Government which cares only for its own and not the average Australian. Let us now turn to this monolith to Australia's road construction industry, the Cumberland Highway. It is still not finished. There is still no firm completion date. I have heard everything from 1988, when it was going to be a bicentennial road completion, onwards. In fact, it has become a standing joke amongst my constituents who refer to it as the never ending story. There have been in recent times only one or two groups of workers plodding and poking at the road surface. I think, Mr Deputy Speaker, that funding for this highway may be sought as a tricentennial project. In all this farce the real losers are the citizensÂ· of Sydney who traverse this stretch of road each day and waste not only time but also countless thousands of dollars on petrol in delays and congestion. I raise this matter in this forum and hope that my voice will be heard all the way down to Macquarie Street in Sydney and to the halls of the doyens of the northern suburbs. Mr MCGauran-It wasn't when you were there. It wasn't heard when you were there. Why would they take notice of you now.",50
42,Mrs CROSIO,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"On behalf of my constituents, 1 pray that they will fake notice of the problem. Mr Deputy Speaker, our honoured, learned gentleman sitting in the Opposition chair interjects. He wants to examine what has happened to the structure of the road since his cronies came into power in New South Wales. He wants to examine the direction in which those funds have gone. I am not speaking from hearsay, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am speaking from research and I am speaking from knowledge that I have obtained. It is not hearsay; it is fact. A structure that should have been completed when this Liberal Government came to power in 1988 is still not completed. There is no date given of when completion can be expected and yet the honourable gentleman sitting opposite says that New South Wales Government is looking after the people of New South Wales. It is not. It is concerned only with its own areas of concern; it is not concerned with the rest of the population scattered around the State of New South Wales and most particularly it is certainly not concerned to see the completion of the Cumberland Highway which transverses not only the Federal seats of Prospect and Fowler but also the State seats of Cabramatta, Fairfield and Smithfield. Of course, that section I am referring to happens to be controlled by the Labor Party of New South Wales and that is possibly one of the reasons the New South Wales Liberal Government can give for not spending the money where it should be spent and not completing the construction of that highway that the people are desirous to have completed. Maybe then, Mr Deputy Speaker, our learned friend would come and question why an express- fit. way, two months after being opened, was then tarred after that excellent road was completed to the standards of the national highway. Why was that money spent? Why was that $2.3m wasted when. my people are saying, 'Give us a grill for the playground. Give us a footpath. Complete the road-",51

60,Mr ALDRED,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"In this grievance debate I intend to bring to the attention of the House an issue which should be of great concern to all Australians-the difficulties facing small businesses today. The problem is now more than one of high interest rates. The current easing of monetary policy will do little to stem the recent flow of business collapses. The problem is not -, one of a lack of confidence in the nation; it is one of lack of confidence in the Hawke Labor Government. It is probably important to remind the House of the nature of small business and its size and significant contribution to the Australian economy. Small business was defined in the Beddall report, a report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, in January this year as being: independently owned and managed; being closely controlled by owner-managers who also contribute most, if not all, of the operating capital; having the principal decision-making functions resting with the owners-managers and finally; which employs either up to 20 people in nonmanufacturing industry and up to 100 people in manufacturing industry. Mr Deputy Speaker, the Beddall report states that there are 750,000 small businesses in Australia including 150,000 in the farming sector. This represents 96 per cent of all firms in the country, half of the private sector and one-third of all employment in Australia. It is these people the Hawke Government appears hell-bent on destroying. Destruction is taking place at an ever increasing, rate. Figures show that bankruptcies across Australia rising from 7,41'4 in the 1988-89 financial year to 8,636 in the 1989-90 financial year, a rise of 16.5 per cent. I am sure that I would not have to remind the House that the prognosis for this financial year promises to be an even gloomier' one for small'business. The publication Econostate from the State Bank of Victoria best summarises the appalling mess in my home State. It records it in seasonally adjusted terms. Retail turnover in the June quarter fell 2.7 per cent compared with a national decline of only 0.3 per cent. It records that dwelling commencements were 22 per cent lower in 1989-90 than they were in 1988-89. As Econostate from the State Bank of Victoria points out, despite the fall in interest rates and average real house prices this year, building approvals and house finance approvals remain on a downward trend. Mr Deputy Speaker, Econostate records an Australian Chamber of Manufactures' survey showing only 6.9 per cent of companiessurveyed for the June quarter reporting 'increases in expenditure on building and structures ,compared to 9.5 per cent in March. It also records a sharp increase in the unemplqyment rate-up from 5.4 per cent in June to 6.4 per cent in July to 6.7 per cent in August. The State Bank of Victoria does not believe the Australian economy will reach the bottom of the business cycle until the first quarter of 1991. So clearly the worse is yet to come. I have had over recent times a number of telephone calls from small business men one and women outlining the stark reality of the current business environment. The callers all offer solutions to the problems that face small business. Many solutions are offered, and there are two that I would particularly like' to' mention today. These two solutions are easily implemented and are practical responses to those that are continually mentioned. The first is that, although bankruptcy and receivership are accepted as part and parcel of the risks involved in operating in our private enterprise economy, many of my callers believe that the practices adopted by the Hawke Labor Government increase these risks by their seemingly deliberate policy of having the public sector delay payment on accounts. My telephone callers, particularly those in the printing trade or those dealing with the Department of Defence, claim that they are met with a range of excuses: 'We are introducing a new computer system', 'Our accounts are handled by another department or handled by Canberra', or,'We handle thousands of accounts and cannot access individual cases'. They believe these excuses are the norm throughout much of the Federal Public Service. It would aid the cash flow and improve the chances of more businesses surviving if more of the public sector paid its bills on time. The second suggestion relates to the rippling effect that bankruptcy and receivership has on the unsecured creditors of companies entering receivership or bankruptcy. At this point in time the Australian Taxation Office stands a much greater chance of recovering moneys owed to it than do the traders who provided goods and services to the defaulting company. The time has' now come to remove this advantage and rank the tax man as merely another unsecured creditor. This would have the advantage of increasing the chances of a payout for all concerned and decreasing the risks of bankruptcies amongst the unsecured creditors. Furthermore, if the Treasurer closed the loopholes in the tax Act his officers would not have to behave like vultures picking over the carcasses of dead companies. The Treasurer's press release of 15 February this year contains a hollow boast by him that over the last seven years the Government has been vigilant in its efforts to bring integrity to the tax system. The simple fact is that virulent tax rorts have thrived under the Hawke Labor Government. Small business and pay as you earn taxpayers alike have to be indebted to the work of Mrs Barbara Smith, a lecturer in accounting at the Phillip Institute of Technology in Victoria.Â· Mrs Smith has exposed a widespread abuse involving interest withholding tax-a tax scam which, I might add, is encouraged by favourable tax legislation and has added billions of dollars to our foreign debt. I would have thought that anybody exposing a rort of such magnitude would have been welcomed by a government boasting of its vigilance in protecting the tax system. That, however, has not been the case. Mrs Smith has been given short shrift by the Australian Taxation Office which, after conducting a superficial investigation, is attempting toÂ· ignore her allegations. I have. also been advised, and I hope it is not true, that taxation officers have been ordered to break off all official contact with her. .One can only ask who the Government is protecting in this instance. Withholding tax is the tax whichÂ· is deducted at source by the Australian taxpayer from interest, dividends, royalties and mining being paid, to non-residents of Australia.Â· It is the responsibility of the Australian payer to deduct withholding tax payments made to non-residents and to remit those deductions to the Tax Office. Countries which have tax treaties with Australia set limits on the rates of interest withholding tax that Australia may impose; The rate is generally set at either 10 per cent. or 15 per cent. It appears that generally 10 per . cent is the. figure used. This obviously advantages countries that have tax treaties with Australia as it maximises the income of their own :residents and thereby increases these countries' tax yield. Australia quite clearly loses. Barbara Smith points out that there are many exemptions available for the interest withholding tax and often no tax at all is imposed. Australia loses yet again. .One of the deductions available is that 'for non-resident charIties. That well known corporate entrepreneur Joseph Gutnick allegedly donated at least $10m to charities in Israel-charities involved with such things as the development of energy cohservation technology. Gutnick was blatantly donating these funds while simultaneously he ow-d money in Austhe tralia, money that was', eventually written off as a bad debt. This particular tax scam has become big business in a very short space of Interest withholding tax collections grown from $28m in the 1974-75 year, about 0.2 per cent of total tax office enue, to $638m in 1989, or 0.9 per of total collections. It has to be seriously asked how much revenue Australia has lost because of the Hawke Labor GovernNorthern ment's failure to fully and completely force this tax. Barbara Smith estimates the tax forgone to l;>e worth up to in the 1988-89 financial year. In response, the Australian Taxation Office disputes her estimate but concedes substantial tax revenue has been and is being lost. What a disgraceful situation it is when the more dubious elements of the corpogovernment, rate sector can openly get away with massive tax avoidance racket of this order of magnitude while small business is lentlessly held to account by the Australia Taxation Office for every tax dollar owed. Small business is now in great difficulty in this once prosperous nation, burdened as it is with high interest rates, high and falling levels of consumer confidence ment. about the future. Faith in the future will be restored only when these problems are realistically tackled by government economic policy but also when small business perceives the tax system to be operating fairly all and blatant abuses such as the withCLP holding tax scam are closed off dt!.c-si by the T r e as u r e r - , NOI:thern Territory Election",53

That is dead right: more old fashioned government because CLP mem$943m bers are old fashioned people. In fact, what they are on about is the sort of old fashioned government that has brought abuse to the Northern Territory electorate and its population, a refusal to accept the need for good open and honest a refusal to accept the need a for appropriate public administration standards, a refusal to accept the need for rean appropriate management of the Northern Territory economy, and a refusal to accept that it is irresponsible to indulge in the fetishes of the various Chief Ministers that have reigned over the CLP since taxes the late 1970s when we got self-governIt is interesting to note an editorial not published in the Sydney Morning Herald of 12 October 1990 that refers to this election. It says, 'the election game NT style'. I raise that point about 'the elecfor tion game NT style' because what the has based its election campaign on vely , is an ""appeal to the Northern Territory 'community and an appeal to the voters about spurious and extremely fallacious in relation to the forthcoming PremiersCoilference and an ,agenda based Aboriginal issues. The CLP has' on this occasion, as on every other occasion that there has been an election in the Northern Territory since I have been. there, which is 1975, chosen to rattle the racist can. What it has chosen to do is to kick blacks This is brought to public notice in this aneditorial in the Sydney Morning Herald it which makes a relevant and pertinent observation about the manner in which the Northern Territory CLP treats the Northern TeJ:ritory electorate. Indeed, 25 per cent of its constituents are Aboriginal people. There is a traditional tactic, however, of the CLP, the conservative parties the Northern Territory. Instead of runtional ning on issues which are of relevance the general community, important issues of the day, it has again on this occasion chosen to go to the people on the grounds that it wants to achieve some oommand or additional powers over the Northern' Territory Aboriginal people. I have to say that this approa-not been one which has had any success since 1987. In fact, as this editorial points the party has suffered six successive feats-four at by-elections and two at Federal elections since the last Northern Territory elections. It has on those six occasions sought to use the same corrupt political tactic to divide the community and in not one of them has it been sucTerritory cessful. It is still one that is trotted the course of this election campaign it has been made the fundamental platNorthern form of that campaign strategy. It is interesting to contrast the irrespon- ritory sible approach that has been taken by the CQuntry Liberal Party in the Northern Territory to this election and,' indeed, to the people of the Northern Territory with the approach that is being taken by the Labor Opposition. Its campaign is based on real issues: the need for open and government; the need to address the parNorthern Territory. lous state of the Northern Territory economy; the need to. have appropriate and honest management of government affairs; and the need to set up regional developtr(j.vel-;-again, ment strategies which acknowledge the special conditions that exist across ern Australia. None of these things, might add, has been touched upon by the CLP thus far in the election campaign. does not have any issues to run with. Instead of looking at the main game around this Premiers Conference, it lost sight of reality and, as I have said, approached this election in a very cynical and divisive way. I might just go to the point of the regional strategies that have been proposed by the Labor Party and its Leader, Terry Smith. I think it is a foretaste of things to come in this country as we approach this Premiers Conference and as we consider the Constitutional Convention of in 1991. I will come back to the ConstituConvention in a little while. The to sort of approach the Northern Territory Labor Party has adopted in this campaign is something that I think this Government would commend, and indeed it has been commended by the Western Australian and Queensland governments. I should t""ike to point out the agenda it has put forward in terms of a cooperative approach to northern development. In the out, time that there have been conservative degovernments in Queensland and the Northern Territory there has been no attempt to have a cooperative approach to northern development. It is something that I am proud to say has. been picked up not only by the Labor Party in the Northern but also by the Labor Party in out in Queensland and Western Australia. The and agenda that has been proposed by the Territory Labor Party, soon to be the government in the Northern Terafter 27 October, is an agenda that asks for a common approach to the Federal Government on northern development issues. It is a very simple proposal, yet something that has escaped the obvious ignorance of the conservative parties, who have for years governed the fair northern States of Queensland and the The Labor Party has proposed an integrated tourism marketing scheme to reduce costs and promote across-the-north an extremely sensible and worthwhile idea, something I would have northtHought any responsible government in I Queensland or the Northern Territory would have adopted some years ago, yet It something they have refused to adopt. It has suggested intergovernmental infrastructure planning in areas such as roads has and resource development projectsagain, a very appropriate and pertinent proposal. It has proposed joint postderegulation negotiations with national and international carriers for northern air services-again, something that is of importance not only to the Northern Territory, north Queensland and the north-west of Western Australia but to this nation as a whole. It has suggested common business incentives to promote small business growth throughout the region. It has suggested planned specialisation in education and medical facilities to establish regional centres of excellence. That is an agenda for the future. What do we get from the conservative parties in the Northern Territory, trotting out the agendas of the past? They are yesterday's men in the CLP. This nation and the world are going through a period of rapid change, and what do they ask for? The same tired old messages are coming from the CLP. There are no new proposals, no new policy initiatives. We could sit these leaders of the Northern Territory down at the Constitutional Convention of 1891-1891, not the one. in April 1991, next year, and not even the Premiers Conference at the end of this Â·month-and they would be completely at home. That is the sort of agenda they are operating on. They would fit in nicely. All the principles they would pursue are the principles that .those people who opposed the Federation of this nation would have proposed. They make the ultimate and sanctimonious assertion that everything that is good comes out of the CLP; nothing that is good can come out of Canberra. Indeed, they spend most of their time berating this Government for providing to the Northern Territory, on average, five times the per capita grants that are provided to the rest of Australia. Indeed, there is not a bad line in their policy launch document which states: 'We live with ever increasing taxes paid to Canberra'. What an absurdity. We all know-even the Opposition acknowledges-that taxation rates have tumbled under this Government. We are not paying more tax, we are paying less tax. They are also deriding the yearly reductions in the share of national income they say they get sent back to them.",55
62,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Timber Industry: East Gippsland,57
63,Mr MCGAURAN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Gippsland) (1.31)During the grievance debate today I wish to draw to the attention of the Parliament an act of gross dishonesty involving State and Federal Ministers as it affects my electorate of Gippsland. I refer specifically . to the agreement reached in February of this year between the then Minister for Resources, Senator Peter Cook, the then Victorian Minister for Conservation, Forests and Lands, Mrs Kay Setches, and . representatives of the timber industry. The House will remember that there was great debate during the election campaign and, indeed, in the months leading up to it about the capability of the timber industry to log in a very sustainable and renewable way the National Estate areas of east Gippsland. I hasten to stress, though, that people must understand, although it hardly needs to be said in this forum, that National Estates areas are not the equivalent of national parks. No logging of any kind takes place in national parks. Indeed, of the total National Estate area of east Gippsland, only 20 per cent is available to the timber industry, and even then not the whole 20 per cent but selected coupes. In February, in the heat of the election campaign, when the then Minister responsible for the environment, Senator Richardson, was desperate to put out bushfires, metaphorically speaking, wherever they appeared, which may in any way have undermined his strategy for cynically selling out to the extremist greens, we saw this agreement take place which brought about the cessation of demonstrations by the timber industry. At the time the timber industry was attracting Australia-wide attention and was demonstrating in Melbourne and other parts of Victoria, but most particularly in Gippsland. The agreement was executed by the timber industry on the firm and very simple understanding that it would vacate the National Estate areas until the end of September so that a study might be done to determine whether there were prudent and feasible alternatives outside the National Estate. It was as simple as thatnothing complex, a very short agreement. So the timber industry honoured its commitment under the written and executed agreement. It waited for this study to termine whether there were prudent and feasible timber resources available outside the National Estate. If the study found that there were not, under this crystal clear agreement it would re-enter the National Estate. The insanity of all this, even at the time, was that this agreement was in direct contravention of a IS-year timber industry strategy that had been decided some two years before, when the now Premier of Victoria but then Minister for Conservation, Forests and Lands, Joan Kirner, had hold of the portfolio. It was a timber industry strategy worked out for the long term and agreed to by the conservation movement, by the timber industry and by the Government. So it was something of a surrender of its contractual rights for the timber industry to vacate the National Estate sections able to be logged in east Gippsland, but it did it. I remember saying to one of the organisers at the time, very angrily, 'You have sold out the timber industry and the people of east Gippsland'. He, just as angrily, turned to me, and I can still rememwith ber his exact words; I will never forget them: 'If you can't rely on the signatures of State and Federal Government Ministers then Australia has no hope'. And he was right. I began to doubt whether the Government could be so cynical as not to abide by the agreement. But a little while ago, on 11 October-II days after the supposed announcement of the release of this study that had been agreed to in ruary-we found that the Government totally and dishonestly repudiated that agreement. So now the timber industry's access to the National Estate has been further reduced. The Federal and State governments did not honour the agreementÂ· because the report found there were no prudent and feasible resources outside the National tate. We knew all that in east Gippsland but we agreed to move out between February and the end of September and let another study be done even though the IS-year timber strategy had already laid most of these studies in concrete. Nonede- the less, we did it. Now we have found that the Minister for Conservation and Environment in Victoria, Steve Crabb, who has so much invested in a very personal sense as well as that of his government's supposed political popularity, has repudiated the agreement. .I make the point that in his 12-page press statement about the new policy announced by the Minister in Victoria there is no reference whatsoever to prudent and feasible alternatives outside the National Estate. He knows what is in the report because that has now been released as well. So he side steps it and instead further reduces the access to the National Estate. Under the Minister's announcement of 11 October the amount of high quality saw logs available to the timber industry will be further reduced. The transfer of National Estate areas to national parks will lock away 240,000 cubic metres of prime timber which had been allocated to the industry under this timber industry strategy thatÂ· I have already touched on. This will mean a 171/2 per cent reduction in timber yield from the National Estate areas. It leaves loggers a reserve of only 25,600 cubic metres of timber in the National Estate. Minister Crabb argues the industry must make greater uses of low quality D and E grade saw logs but this is uneconomical without adequate quantities of C-plus grade logs. In fact, the Minister's announcement fails to address, let alone mention, issues concerning the February Feb-. agreement which imposed that moratorium on National Estate logging, specifically the promise that unless alternative sources of timber could be found the loggers would return to their National Estate allocations. Minister Crabb claims that he is introducing a new, exceptional process of allocating all wood to saw millers so that Esthe industry is saw-log driven rather than controlled by woodchip harvesting. This is the current practice in east Gippsland. Mr Deputy Speaker, you have to bear in mind that expansion of hardwood plantations will not assist the industry for 40 years. The decision to allocate additional saw log residue to Australian paper mill manufacturers will preclude any development of a pulp and paper mill in"" dustry in east Gippsland for all time. The Minister mentions an Australian Paper Manufacturers' investment of $800m, which means the establishment of a new eucalypt craft mill at Merryvale, which is in the Latrobe Valley. He believes the additional mill will take up all the available residue from east Gippsland. The Government has caved into the demands of extreme conservationists on logging in east Gippsland and there is no doubt at all that the protesters will now shift their campaign against any logging of any kind, whatever the safeguards in place, to National Estate areas in central Gippsland. So the Government has not swept this issue under the carpet; it has not appeased the extremists because the extremists will noti accept any form of compromise with the timber industry. The compromises were made in that IS-year strategy. The effect on my constituents in east Gippsland of this winding down of the timber industry is quite devastating. As compromise after compromise, year in and year out, is imposed upon them they find that their very livelihoods are threatened. Indeed, whole communities in east Gippsland are unravelling, they are bewildered. They are distrustful of government because they have been betrayed and sold out by Federal and State Labor governments. Petrol Prices",57
64,Mr LAVARCH,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"ln the short time. I have this afternoon I would like to mention the very important issue of petrol prices. It is an issue that is taxing the minds of many people in the community. I imagine that all honourable members would be receiving a great number of inquiries through their offices about why prices have increased and whether the Government is getting a great windfall out of it. In particular, in Queensland the Royal Automobile Club of Queensland (RACQ) has been running a very strong campaign on the question of petrol pricing. The campaign has two aims. One is to reduce the government excise on petrol by 8c to 10c, and the"" second is the scrapping of rack pricing for the wholesale distribution of petrol. Unfortunately, the RACQ seems far more intent on running a political agenda than looking after the interests of its members. Mr Sciacca-It comes after the last election.",59
65,Mr LAVARCH,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"This flows on, as the honourable member for Bowman indicates, from the last election. During that time the RACQ extended its activities from what one would normally expect from an organisation of this type into running a very strong campaign on road funding against Government members in marginal seats. Mr Courtice-It didn't do them any good.",59
66,Mr LAVARCH,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"ItÂ· did not work because people had a bit more sense and saw. through it. I should have thought that the RACQ, which has a very strong duty to its members and to the public, would have had a bit more sense. The popular image of the RACQ is that of the friendly breakdown service, the honest broker which provides people with advice as to the quality of a motor vehicle if they are going to buy a used car, gives comparisons between a Ford and a Commodore and things of this nature. It has a strong membership because of the services it provides. Although it is obviously legitimate for a group of this sort to extend its activities into the lobbying of government and making comments on government policies that affect its members-the motorists of Queensland-it is not legitimate for that organisation to adopt a party political agenda, and that is what the RACQ is doing on this issue of petrol prices. The RACQ knows full well that petrol excise has not increased by lc since the Gulf crisis began. The RACQ knows full well that petrol excise is set at 24.9c per that it goes up twice a year with the consumer price index, and that it has not increased at all during the current crisis that has led to the increase in the worldÂ· price of oil. Despite knowing that, the RACQ quite mischievously and deliberately misleadingly has gone into the press and had reported widely throughout the major newspapers of Queensland its comment that the Commonwealth is getting some sort of magical major windfall out of the price rise. It does not mention that the Commonwealth petrol excise is consumption based, not price based. That is, because the price of petrol has increased and consumption has decreased as a response, the Commonwealth is actually receiving less from the petrol excise than before the Gulf crises began, but the RACQ never mentions that. It is quite misleading. Of course, it goes on to talk about the crude oil levy that is paid by the producer, not by the motorist. Mr Broadbent-That's what happened under your Government. It comes straight out of the family budget.",59
67,Mr LA VARCH,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Of course, the honourable member for Corinella would be quite happy to see that tax abolished, to see that extra profit, instead of coming into the Government, into the community, going to the oil companies. He would be more than happy to see that occur, as would the RACQ. It has no interest at all in promoting an informed debate and is misleading its members and the people of Queensland. Mr Acting SPEAKEROrder! It being 1.45 p.m., in accordance Standing Order 106, as amended for this session, the debate is interrupted. I put the question: That grievances be noted. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA Royal Australian Navy: Wearing of Uniforms by Sailors",60
68,Mr NUGENT,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I wish to speak about the Royal Australian Navy order recently issued to sailors not to .wear litre, form in public. Other honourable members. I am sure will be as concerned about the subject as r am. It is perhaps particularly appropriate that this House consider this matter today as we have just heard the report this morning on the visit to Gallipoli and had a discussion on a Bill dealing with the abuse of Australian flags. Firstly, as a migrant myself I want to make it absolutely clear that all migrants owe their first allegiance to Australia and anything else is secondary. Secondly, servicemen must on enlistment accept that there may well be some risks in the job. Thirdly, anyone who attacks or abuses a servicemen in this country should jolly well be prosecuted. The recent order to sailors not to wear uniform in public in Australia is outrageous. Many of my constituents have approached me today protesting in the strongest possible terms. Speaking as a ex-serviceman myself, I urge the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) to review this quite disgraceful decision urgently. Margaret Olley: Exhibition of Paintings",60
69,Mr NEWELL,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"The name Margaret Olley is one which is well known to art lovers in Australia. Perhaps honourable members will recall that Margaret Olley was herself the subject of portraits by the late Sir William Dobellincidentally, one of which was awarded the Archibald Prize in 1948-and by Sir Russell Drysdale. The art of Margaret Olley is being displayed presently at the Lismore Regional Art Gallery in an exhibition which continues until 17 November. This is the final staging of a retrospective exhibition and tribute to Margaret Olley. Previous exhibitions have been held in Sydney and Brisbane. Margaret Olley is one. of the most distinguished and best known artists in Australia, being variously described' as remarkably' gifted and a major figure in the Australian art world. The Director of the New South Wales Art Gallery, Edmond Capon, recently referred to her as uni- a national treasure. Margaret Olley is probably one of the best painters of still life in Australia. Margaret Olley was born in the city of Lismore in the electorate of Richmond and she also lived for some time' with her family in the beautiful town of Murwillumbah. We are all very proud that such a major exhibition focusing attention on her work has been set up in Lismore. Her art is represented in national collections in Canberra and in the State galleries of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia and Queensland. Margaret Olley has travelled and exhibited widely, both in Australia and overseas, and in the limited time available to me it would be impossible for me to list her many awards. The organisers of the exhibition in Lismore, Gallery Director Richard Maude, Trust Chairperson Geoff Levitus and the trustees of the gallery are to be commended for staging this important exhibition of Margaret Olley's work. Death of Alan Humphries",60
70,Mr BROADBENT,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I rise today to record the death of Mr Alan Humphriesno ordinary Australian. He was a Victorian from country Victoria but unique because of his activity in migrant education. Because of the limited time that I have I will just draw the House's attention to his contribution to migrant education in Victoria. I will use the words of Lindsay Thompson, ex-Premier of Victoria, when he spoke of a public servant under his charge at that time. I can only heap praise on Alan Humphries, an officer of the Education Department. He was a zealous public servant in the best sense of the word. His memory of Alan was that his job was his hobby as well as his career. He said: He pioneered a new field for Victoria and at one stage had more than 1,100 migrant teachers to recruit and to train. Nothing was ever too much trouble for Alan Humphries. In talking to Lindsay Thompson, there were details that were missed. The fact that at that time in Victoria Alan was in control of a $7m budget. Those inspiring times for the growth in immigration into Victoria were handled by many such public servants. The death of Alan Humphries on Fathers Day was a loss to Victoria. He was a great contributor to Victorian migrant education. He was a close friend of our family and the opportunity to know and be part of the life of this man was something that I record before this House. Whaling Wall l\1r COURTICE (Hinkler)-There are two famous 'wailing walls' in the world; one is in Israel and the other one is in Bundaberg. The Bundaberg whaling wall was painted by the internationally acclaimed environmental marine artist Wyland. It took just five days and it covers the western wall of a six storey office in the main street; it measures 30 metres by 25 metres. One thousand litres of paint was used to create this masterpiece which reinforces Bundaberg and the region's close association with the humpback whales on their journey back to their feeding grounds of the cool waters of the Antarctic after travelling to the warm shallow Queensland waters for the calving season. The painting depicts a mother, a calf, an escort and a turtle. During this season from mid-August to mid-October trips can be taken from Bundab erg to watch these magnificent mammals as they frolic in Fraser Island's Platypus Bay, which is just to the southeast. Wyland painted this whaling wall as a gift to the city. The actual cost was sponsored by Australian Provincial Newspapers, Bundaberg News Mail, National Australia Bank, and Mr John Santelucia, the owner of the building, and was coor- . dinated by the Bundaberg District Tourism and Development Board. Other sponsors include Solver Paints, Continental Airlines, Sunstate Airlines, and many Bundaberg business houses and individuals. The whaling wall is No. 23 in a series of 100 in Wyland's overall plan to spread his environmental message worldwide. It is a great asset to our city. Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport",61
71,Mr COWAN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Mr Actingsenior Speaker, I wish to place on record the' recent statement of the Managing tor of Australian Airlines, Mr S-haap;-, bringing to the - ttention of the Gover'nm-nt and Aust!aha t-e problem of Sydney (K1Ogsford-Smlth) AIrport and ,the .need for that thIrd runway. , Mr Schaap - Olnted out very clearly that 10 August thIS year it cost the airline $713,565 principally because of delays caused by take-offs and landings. He pointed out that two in every five departures are delayed. One in every five arrivals is on time, which means that four out of five are not on time all the time. Air fares will rise by 7.5 per cent I 1 November, and undoubtedly the delays at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport resent one factor in the increase in costs. I appeal again to the Government to look seriously at the situation and to tell the people of Australia, and particularly the people of New South Wales, that committed and that it wishes to proceed with the third runway at the airport.

74,Mr SNOWDON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,During the course of the grievance debate I was talking about the issue of the Northern Territory election and I said that the current Northern Territory Government-the Country Liberal Party (CLP) Government-was totally out of touch with the issues surrounding the forthcoming Premiers Conference.,63
75,Mr LAVARCH,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,They are out of time.,63
76,Mr SNOWDON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"They are out of time; they are out of date. The current Chief Minister did an interview this morning on 8DDD about the forthcoming Preand miers Conference. He did not say one word about the issue of vertical fiscal imbalance between the States and the Comfarmprincipal monwealth. This is an extraordinary oversight given the fact that from a assets. Northern Territory perspective I should have thought, and every reasonable perthe son who knows anything about public administration in Australia should have thought, this was the most pressing issue in the conference. In addition, the CLP Government is continually berating the Commonwealth for its role in the Northern Territory and the policies and programs it has in place. But it is noticeable that the Deputy Chief MiI\ister of the Northern Territory, curcarer rently Mr Coulter, put out a brochure Palmerston setting out what he had achieved for his electorate. He made some dubious claims, one of. which wa'S that he was responsible for theÂ· location of the 2nd Cavalry Regiment in Darwin. Another was that he wasrespon-: sible for the location of a Comtp.onwealth"" Employment Service office in his electorate, neither of which are true. In addithe tion, another Northern Territory Minister said that he was responsible immigration policy which has been introduced into the Northern Territory.

77,Mr ANDREW,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"As honourable members on both sides of the House know, there is a major injustice in the application of the assets test to the family allowance and in the tightening of the assets test for Austudy. I would like to use this 90 second statement to bring to Senator Richardson's attention what is in fact a gross inequity in the application of the assets test on the family allowance. The family allowance was designed to be paid to the principal carer so that it became money that was received by country people. This was normally the mother she received it exclusively as her own. The assets test, however, is applied to the carer when she is part of a partnership so that the farm partner is regarded as the sole owner of those As a result, the principal carer is treated as if she owned the $300,000, not $150,000 that is in fact in her name. My request to Senator Richardson is that he consider the application of this assets test to a partner as being only her share of that asset because currently she is being denied the family allowance as if she were the sole holder of those assets. I consider that is a gross injustice. I alsq consider that the ceiling of $300,000, as an assets test that denies the principal or the family the family allowance, in ought to be lifted to $600,000. United Nations Day",63
78,Mr JENKINS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Next Wednesday, 24 October, is United Nations Day, the anniversary Of the coming into force . of. the United Nations Charter in 1945. The General Assembly decided in 1947 that United Nations Day be designated ' and devoted to informing the peoples of world of the aims and achievements of the United Nations (UN) and to obtain for a new support for its work. This year the UN has celebrated a time when it confronts great challenges. As the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) stated to the General Assembly on 2 October, the nations of the world are now entering a new era of cooperation. We are breaking new ground as we at last accept in full our international sponsibility to meet aggression and to solve regional disputes. In doing this have recommended ourselves and our countries to pursue peace and to end suffering. The week commencing with United Nathere tions Day is designated Disarmament Week. It is worth recalling the extraordiyesterday. nary level of annual global military penditure estimated by one source as being $US866,000m in 1987. In one year just under a trillion dollars is spent. On United Nations Day let us publicise this tragic waste, which brings to mind the words the Irish satirist, Jonathan Swift: Give me the money that has been spent and I will purchase every foot of land globe. I will clothe every man, woman and in attire of which kings and queens would proud. I will build a school house on every side and in every valley over the whole earth; I will build an academy in every town and endow it; a college in every State and fill professors. On United Nations Day let us recall that it was a Labor Foreign Minister, Herbert Vere Evatt, who played an important role in founding the United Nations and in shaping its vision of peace and justice. Let us draw inspiration from this vision. M ACTING SPEAKER-brder! It being 2 p.m., in accordance with sessional order 106A, the time for member's statements has concluded. NA NA",63
79,Dr HEWSON,INTEREST RATES,"I refer the Prime Minister to the following statement today by Father Brian Lucas, spokesman for the Catholic Church: My main concern is to defend certainly the right of the church to speak on behalf of people and to speak about the real needs of people. I think the Prime Minister, with respect, is wrong in suggesting that religion belongs to some sort of compartment all on its own. Religion is about life and it is about the ordinary concerns of ordinary Australians. I ask the Prime Minister to put aside the sarcasm of his attack on Archbishop Hollingworth yesterday and reto admit that his Government's policy of rehigh interest rates has compounded the we distress of many Australian families and increased child poverty in Australia.",64
80,Mr HAWKE,INTEREST RATES,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. As usual, is a complete misrepresentation on his part as to the burden of my comments I am able to speak from a very exlong experience which would prove to any objective observer that I have a very deep conviction about the pervasive right of religion to concern itself with the affairs of human beings in all aspects, including of their economic concerns. That is a conviction I have from my personal upbringin war, ing, as I think the Leader of the on the Opposition ought to know, and in the child whole of my life I have attempted to rebe flect the right and the obligation of the hillchurch and those associated with it to concern themselves with all aspects of the it with able affairs of their believers. What I was saying yesterday was something quite different: that where Archbishop Hollingworth, or someone else within the church, attempted to set himself up as an expert on economic policy, no particular attention should be paid to that, and in particular in that case, where there was a mistaken observation about the actual conduct of economic policyÂ· and the assertion that this Government had relied on the single instrument of monetary policy, then I was entitled-indeed, I had an obligation-to point out that error. As the Leader of the Opposition has indicated how we should take account of what representatives of the church say, I say to him: Very well, you do that. In that respect let me quote what Bishop Hollingworth, as he then was, had to say to the Opposition as to what it should do. It is a pity that those opposite did not listen to what he had to say. I will refer to what Bishop Peter Hollingworth, as he then was, had to say on the question of what we have done with regard to assistance to children in financial need. Just by way of background, to substantiate why Peter Hollingworth said what he did about this, let me make the point that at present more than half a million families, including 1.2 million children, are being helped with family allowance supplement payments or their equivalent in extra pensions and benefits, including family allowances. This involves over $2 billion of Commonwealth funding for children in low income families. That is the measure of what we have done since the 1987 election. I will quote what Bishop Peter Hollingworth, as he then was, had to say about this. I emphasise this in the light of the Leader of the Opposition's proposition that we should take account of what representatives of the church have to say on this issue. I agree with him: we should. In: particular, the Leader of the Opposition and all those over on the other side should take account of what Peter Hollingworth said to them. I will lead up to it. On 7 May he said: In strict income security terms, it is true prime ministerial promise 'that no children shall live in poverty by 1990' ... will be achieved. Remember that we should take no'tice of what he said; so Opposition members should not question it or heehaw about it. This is Peter Hollingworth saying to the Opposition: This represents significant progress, and demonstrates that governments can meet some modest social justice objectives, even at a time of economic restraint when they are involved in public sector cutbacks and tax reduction in order to improve their economic efficiency. He then said this on 20 August: The Government has made real advances in recent years in building a more secure and adequate system of income support for Australians living close to or below the poverty line. This is what he then had to say to the Opposition, which has never taken any notice of him: These reforms are too important to be caught in the crossfire of political conflict. The Oppositionthis is Hollingworth talking to the Oppositionought to openly acknowledge the merit of such reforms and move towards a more bipartisan stance on welfare policies for children. He says it all. NA",64

95,Mr HOWE,AYES NOES,"I thank the honourable Connolly, D. M. Costello, P. H. member for Cowan for her question. The Government's approach is to provide Do!>ie, J. D. M. Downer, A. J. G. social protection for all Australians who need it. That involves a number of comFife, W. C. Filing, P. A. plicated interactions. Firstly, the person the honourable member speaks about Ford, F. A. Gallus, C. A. needs quality medical advice and treatment and the Government provides Halverson, R. G. Hawker, D. P. M. through Medicare the guarantee of access to care for all Australians. The woman Hicks, N. J. (Teller) Howard, J. W. mentioned need have no concerns about the cost of visiting the doctor. Medicare Kemp, D. A. Lloyd, B. not only provides free visits when doctors bulkbill; it also guarantees that no AustraMCAnhur, F. S. MCGauran, P. J. lian need pay more than $240 a year for medical services through the Medicare Moore, J. C. Nugent, P. E. safety net. Peacock, A. S. Prosser, O. D. Secondly, the Government will ensure that this woman is able to afford all of Reith, P. K. Riggall, J. P. the pharmaceuticals she needs through her illness. The pharmaceutical benefits Ronaldson, M. J. C. Ruddock, P. M. scheme (PBS) guarantees she will be able to afford drugs as she needs them. Thirdly, Shack, P. D. Sharp, J. R. the Government recognises that the honourable member's constituent may Smith, W. L. Somlyay, A. M. need help coping at home as her illness progresses, so with the States we provide Tuckey, C. W. Webster, A. P. the home and community care program. Wilson, I. B. C. Woods, Bob When she is forced to give up her current job, if that is necessary, it may be she will be able to continue working, haps through retraining for a different career. The Government can provide that through the Commonwealth Employment Service, and the Government recognises that if she cannot stay in work she may need income support, depending on her private financial resources. So we deliver the disability support pension forÂ· people in this situation. Of course, if this person is forced on to the pension, the GovernCowan ment's policies mean that under the PBS pharmaceuticals are cheaper so she can continue to afford them. When it comes to the time of this pervarious son requiring hospital treatment, the States provide the hospitals that will do so under Federal policy which requires the States to guarantee access to public hosber for Cowan. pitals so that she need not worry about whether she can afford hospital. It may well be that her condition continues to deteriorate and she may require lengthy hospitalisation or accommodation in nursing home. Again the Federal Governpromise ment will ensure that these services available and will guarantee that, even if the woman is dependent only on the penthe sion, she will be able to afford quality that's care so that she can live out her remainthe ing days with dignity. ,In the case of this person who has been mentioned, the response provided is a systemic response. It does not go to a particular aspect or particular service alone; it goes to the question of the action of those various services available, whether they be Medicare, the pharmawhether ceutical benefits scheme, the home and community care program, or a labour market retraining program. Together those schemes operate in such a way person's dependence is maximised and she has an opportunity to make a recovery and participate in the work force at earliest possible date. That is what is not understood in the terms of the alternative approach being floated by the Leader of the Opposition. The problems with the suggestion that somehow one can devolve these key and critical services to voluntary agencies--.,... to, in a sense, agencies without the capacpoint ity to become integrated into the syscountry pertem-,--seem not to be understood by this naive and out of touch Leader of the Opposition. That is why the various voluntary agencies, whether they be the St Vincent de Paul Society or the Brotherhood of St Laurence, recognise that what the Leader of the Opposition proposes is nonsense. They recognise that providing security to a person such as the woman referred to by the honourable member for involves a system of interaction of a variety of integrated services. That is what the Government seeks to provide, not just in Canberra but in terms of the departments that provide services often at a community level in a way that is quite accessible to people such as the client mentioned by the honourable memNA",66
96,Mr REITH,REAL WAGES,"I refer the Treasurer to his press conference of 16 October 1990. a When asked whether he stood by his that real wages would rise in each are of the next three years, he responded: Well, I'd need to check precisely what I said in campaign, but certainly disposable incomethe important thing-disposable income has risen in each of the next-has risen in each of last three years-and will rise this year. I also refer the Treasurer to the unqualified statement in the Senate yesterday by the Minister for Industrial Relations; in response to a question on this topic, that of course the Hawke Government stood interby its commitments made in the recent election campaign. I ask the Treasurer he will stop his obfuscation and categorically state to this House whether or not he stands by his election promise that real wages will increase in each of that the the next three years.",67
97,Mr KEATING,REAL WAGES,This is a pretty strange the question from somebody who believes wages should only increase in line with productivity. That is his position. Mr Reith-Do you oppose that proposition?,67
98,Mr KEATING,REAL WAGES,"Yes, I do. With what skerrick of integrity can he get up and ask that question when, as I have made the before, trend productivity in this is about 1V2 per cent? What does he want to do? Does he want to give 1112 per cent increase to somebody for phasing an inflation rate of 6 or 7 per cent? Does he want a massive real wage cut? He has argued in every national case since we have been in office that the national wage case should not agree with the accord arrangements.",67
99,Mr HAWKE,REAL WAGES,"When they were in office, as well.",68
100,Mr KEATING,REAL WAGES,"As the Prime Minister says, that happened when they were in office as well. Now he asks some question about the Government's commitments in respect of real wages. Over the period this Government, real wages have been reduced but disposable incomes have inchronically creased. They have increased in per capita terms and in family terms, and that is what is important to a household or to an individual. I cannot remember precisely what I said in the election campaign about real wages, but it is immaterial in this sense: it is disposal income that matters, and disposable income has risen sharply in the last three years and will do so again this year.

101,Mr LAVARCH,FAMILY POLICY,"My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security and concerns the Governschool. ment's family policy. Can the Minister advise the House of the measures in place which would assist a typical working famcent. ily of three children-the first a prepeople schooler with serious asthma, the second a secondary student of 17 and the third who has been unemployed for over a year-in which the mother also wishes return to the work force?",68
102,Mr HOWE,FAMILY POLICY,"I thank the honourable member for Fisher for his question, which alludes to a situation which is not untyphave ical in electorates not only in his area throughout Australia. We have an integrated response to the needs of families with children. This has been funhelp damental to the reforms that we have made in the social security system and integration with the labour market and the education system. This family will the benefit of the family allowance suppleService ment. We recognise the need to provide a national guaranteed minimum income for children. To achieve this historic reform, we introduced the family allowance supplement for children of low income workwage ing families. The importance of this initiative is obvious from the fact that the supplement is now being received by almost half a million Australian families. It was introduced as an integral part of the accord as part of the Government's commitment to improving the living standards of Australian families. The family will also receive the child disability allowance, which we have reof formed and extended to assist families to meet the extra costs of children who are ill or who have severe disabilities. The youngest child will also be eligible for concessional pharmaceuticals through the extension of health care cards to children who are eligible for the child disability allowance. This would not be possible without the existence of the national pharmaceutical benefits scheme, which ensures that all Australians, especially those with low incomes, have access to the drugs that they need. The second child would receive Austudy. This Government has recognised the crucial importance of encouraging and making it possible for children to stay at In the last five years retention rates for years 11 and 12 have doubled from about 35 per cent to about 70 per We have done this by offering young in this country a futureno longer demoralised by the prospect of no chance of working for years on end, which was the legacy for young people under the to previous Government. Extending Austudy to students in their last two years at school has made the cost of supporting them at school manageable for their parents. We expanded the opportunity for these but students to move from school to tertiary developed vocational training. The oldest child will be given intensive to get vocational training to help her to enter the labour market through Newits start. By introducing Newstart we have forged links between unemployment benget efit and the Commonwealth Employment for those unemployed for over 12 a months through our active employment strategy. Critical to the success of this approach has been the priority that we have given to generating jobs through the accord. Since 1983 we have created 1.5 million jobs. The mother will benefit from the expanded availability of child-care, which lets women make the choice to share in increased labour market opportunities. While this is not an untypical case, to be faced by families right across this country, it is one that cannot be dealt with in a piecemeal way. Dealing with the needs of this particular family involves an integrated approach. It involves an approach which is directed towards providing those allowances and opportunities as a matter of right. Of course, the contrast between the Government's approach and that of the Leader of the Opposition is clear. He tells us, on the one hand, that one has to make the hard decisions but, in fact, he has only displayed his ignorance. The fact is that problems faced by real Australians are hard, but it does not appear likely that he will face them. He says that welfare services can be devolved to the States and voluntary agencies. He wants to roll up income security with aged care, services for people with disabilities, child-care, and health services, and push them away from the Commonwealth. He says that because he cannot do the hard thinking about how Government expenditure in these areas can be targeted to achieve the best results while still delivering the services that people want and need. In terms of the Government's approach, we have been able to achieve significant savings over time. We have been able to target the social security system in a way that has never been achieved before. We have been able to devolve services so that a partnership has been formed between government agencies and the nongovernment network. Against that kindÂ· of picture and record, all that the Opposition can suggest is somehow that the Commonwealth ought to withdraw; that bureaucracy should be removed; that devolution should occur without thought to the policy considerations and, certainly, without any thought to an integrated approach which is essential for families, such as mentioned by the honourable member. NA",68
103,Mr REITH,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"I refer the Treasurer to an article in the Age newspaper, dated 27 September 1990, in which the Minister for Finance-the then acting Treasureris quoted as saying: . Perhaps one thing that hasn't come out sufficiently in the debate is the enormous scope there is for efficiency improvements in telecommunications. Figures show that our prices are above average for Western developed countries. Our prices are more than twice as high as the best performers. It is not some marginal thing-there is room for really substantial gains. I ask the Treasurer: Is the Minister for Finance correct in saying that there is scope for a 50 per cent reduction in prices from telecommunications reform? Will the Government's reform of telecommunications produce this 50 per cent price saving?",69
104,Mr KEATING,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"Of course, the very basis of the reforms proposed by the Government is the liberation of efficiencies achievable from the telecommunications system by giving Telecom Australia a competitor, and we are seeing prices fall in real terms already. I noticed a report in the paper yesterday detailing Telecom's profit, which showed that there was a real decline in call prices and, need I say, that is ahead of any competition actually occurring. But as to the falls which are likely to occur, particularly in the areas where competition would be likely to bite firstthat is in the STD area, the long distance area----'falls of 50 per cent could well and truly be the order of the day. That would be our general expectation, and those are the benefits that competition will bring. But the puzzling thing is why this was not apparent. to the Opposition over 30 years. How come the Liberal Party in office never believed that these efficiencies ought to be yielded and could be yielded by competition? As usual, it is only the Labor Party that has to bite all the hard bullets and to do the things that have been left undone for so many years. Members of the Opposition just sat there. I do not know what they did with themselves all those years. They must have had the drowsiest, dullest Cabinet meetings one could ever imagine. This Government is getting on with the job and, as my colleague the Minister for Transport and Communications has said very adequately in recent times, telecommunications reform will produce tremendous micro-economic benefits for Australia, including enhanced efficiencies and lower prices. NA NA",69
105,Mr SNOWDON,EXPENDITURE,"I refer the Minister for Finance to reports that expenditure on social security and welfare is excessive, and that it needs to be better targeted more efficiently administered. Would the Minister advise the House as to the curacy of these assertions?",70
106,Mr WILLIS,EXPENDITURE,"I am aware, as is everyone in this House, of statements by Leader of the Opposition of the kind ferred to by the honourable member for the Northern Territory. I must say that such statements are grossly misleading to the factual situation. This Government has borne down more heavily on governget ment expenditure overall-not just social security and welfare expenditure-than any previous government. It has done that by a process of increasing of program administration, eliminating fraud and targeting benefits to people are in real need. , One can see that just by looking at has happened to total government exof penditure, which in the previous Govern the ment's last year in office was 29 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP). This year it is 231/2 per cent of GDP-down '51/2 per cent of GDP. What that means is that, if we had not reduced expenditure 'as a proportion of GDP, we would have bad another $22 billion of outlays this year-$22 billion more than we actually have. That is a measure of the efforts this Government to control government expenditure-$22 billion. Social security and welfare are certainly areas that have been well represented the overall cutbacks. Social welfare expenditure as .a percentage of GDP has fallen from 8.3 per cent of GDP in the last year of the previous Government to 7.4 per cent this year, virtually a decline of one per cent of GDP. That represents about $4 billion less expenditure on social security than there would have been had we maintained the same level as a proportion of GDP as that provided under the previous Government. This has happened despite the fact that we have introduced major new programs, such as the family allowance supplement referred to by the Minister for Community Services and Health, and we have substantially improved the real level of benefits and pensions. For those in real need there have been substantial imand provements in real incomes paid through social security and welfare programs and acnew programs to assist people who were not previously assisted. Yet overall, as a proportion of GDP, the expenditures have been reduced by one reper cent, or about $4 billion. How has that been done? It has been done by the tremendously stringent activity of this as Government to cut expenditures in a way which was sensible and reasonable, to tarprogram delivery more efficiently to those who were in real need, to ensure that it was not paid to those who did not need it, and to eliminate fraud. That is the efficiency what we have done. In the process of doing that, since March who 1985 we have announced 40 separate measures to target social security paywhat ments and combat fraud. Quite a number those have been vigorously opposed by Opposition, most particularly the assets test, which took up the time of this House for months, if not years. The Opposition railed against the fact that we were targeting the pension benefits of those with lower levels of assets. Now the Leader of the Opposition rails about how we, should be targeting more. The Opposition simply cannot get its act together;, The of methods that the Leader of the Opposition suggests indicate the real mindset of the Opposition. It is not about rational targeting; it is simply about slashing and in depriving benefits when one reaches some . security and arbitrary point. The ;Leader of the Opposition indicated , in his,: now infamous Niki Savva article that the decision to cut off unemployment benefits after nine months was a bellwether decision. Of course, it is a decision which is truly appropriate to a flock of sheep but it also indicates the mindset of the Opposition: rather than going about this in an intelligent and compassionate way, it would simply say, after some arbitrary period of time, 'Bang, no further benefits'. That is the way that the Opposition would apparently conduct government. It would throw people to the wolves. To suggest, as the Leader of the Opposition suggested, that one can get hold of a major set of programs such as social security has, wipe out the Department and throw it all to welfare agencies, is the most ridiculous suggestion I have heard in this place in 18 years. It basically means that programs such as age pensions and unemployment benefits which involve millions of cheques being paid out every couple of weeks are going to be somehow distributed through 'welfare agencies. I have never heard anything more ridiculous. If this proposal were to work, the Leader of the Opposition frankly would have to abandon those programs. He would have to give a lump of money to the welfare agencies and say, 'Anyone who turns up to you who is - n need, such as an age pensioner, throw him a handout'. That is basically what it means. It is the whole handout mentality. For the Leader of the Opposition to say that he would save government expenditure by cutting funds to the Department of Social Security and giving programs to welfare agencies indicates that the Opposition is many, many years from being fit to govern this country.

107,Mr TIM FISCHER,OIL WORKERS STRIKE,"My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Industrial Relations. Given that today represents exactly one month since workers at the Esso Australia Ltd plant in East Gippsland went on strike and that the only keyÂ· comment about the duration of the original strike came from Bill KeJ-yÂ­ that is, 'it may go on a little time, it may go on a long time, how long is a piece of string' - can the Minister confirm that the Esso workers are still on strike and that vital tanker shipping to supply New South Wales and elsewhere is still held up? Will the Minister inform the House and those who are dependent for their livelihoods on the use of petroleum products of the Government's view on the likely duration of this unnecessary strike which has impacted on so many innocent victims?",71
108,Mr WILLIS,OIL WORKERS STRIKE,"It is a fact that the Esso workers are still on strike and that the strike has been going on for roughly the duration that the honourable member mentioned. The strike is a serious one and one which this Government is very concerned about. The Prime Minister has indicated his concern about it, as has the Minister for Industrial Relations, and the Minister for Industrial Relations has certainly been actively involved with the parties in trying to bring this dispute to a conclusion. Some of the worse aspects of the dispute, in terms of the tanker driver activities with the stoppages that were inconveniencing motorists in New South Wales and Victoria particularly, have ceased, as I understand it, and we are back to the basic disputes involving the Esso workers. It is certainly the hope of this Government that this dispute can be brought to a conclusion in the very near future. There are, of course, provisions in the Industrial Relations Act which are there for the resolution of disputes. The matter has been before the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. The employers have sought bans clauses in the award; the bans clauses are in the award. They are now capable of proceeding with bans clause activity if they so choose. But that is a matter for the employers to undertake. They are basically the ones who should initiate such activity. At this stage they have seen fit not to do so, presumably on the basis that they believe that the dispute can be brought to a conclusion in the very near future. The Government certainly hopes that that will be the case. NA NA",71

110,Mr KEATING,SECURITY SYSTEM,"Social security administration expenditures represent only 3.5 per cent of outlays of the Commonwealth Department of Social Security and as such, of course, therefore represent a relatively modest part of the Commonwealth Budget of $90-odd billion of outlays. This issue of the question of the administration of the social security system being placed somewhere else-to welfare agencies or the States-was the response of the Leader of the Opposition as he skirted around, in a very weak way, the central proposition he advanced in the article of a few days ago. He skirted around this proposal for the social vandalism which he was contemplating. But what we see is that the Opposition spokesman on social security, Senator Alston, said in the SunHerald on 15 October: It could be a firm of accountants might tender for the delivery of pensions.",72
111,Mr BEAZLEY,SECURITY SYSTEM,A Coopers and Lybrand card.,72
112,Mr KEATING,SECURITY SYSTEM,"This is no simple trip by the Leader of the Opposition. This is a view which has been developed by the Opposition. This has come out in a number of ways. The Leader of the Opposition has not withdrawn overnight, not withdrawn at all, from the propositionhe refused to withdraw when it was put to him on the 7.30 Report last night-on the issue of whether he would abolish the Department of Social Security. Whatever may be said about his responses, that central proposition has not been withdrawn. And we have Senator Alston saying, 'It could be given to a firm of accountants'. So we would have, as my colleagues are suggesting by interjection, the Price Waterhouses of this world distributing pensions. Ninety-nine point nine per cent of the $30,000m worth of pensions that are paid in this country every year are paid on time. But instead of that, people would be queuing up in the marble foyers of the major accountancy firms. It is such a ridiculous proposition, but it is advanced in a serious way. I do not know what the equivalent is for veterans: that the veterans, turn up at the Returned Services League of Australia clubs or that the veterans' widows go to Legacy-anywhere the Opposition can extend this crazy proposition. The fact is that this system works; it is integrated, as my colleague the Minister for Community Services and Health indicated earlier. It is an integrated system on which specialist people are trained, with computer programs available to them, to see that proper benefits are paid to certain categories of people on time and properly. The idea has been put that we could have a welfare agency do this. I noticed today that the national project officer of the St Vincent de Paul Society, Lee Donohue, said that non-government agencies are simply not in a position to take responsibility for areas covered by the Department of Social Security. He said: We don't see it as feasible. We've had no consultation with Dr Hewson on this proposal. . . . our position is quite clear: we don't see it as feasible. We're not an organisation that is set up and structured to be able to take on that role. We don't have the structure that can take on the role of the Social Security Department . . . You can't ask of volunteers to take on the role of paid social security officer. In other words, one of the principal people speaking for one of the agencies that the Leader of the Opposition nominates has rejected the proposition out of handwhich, of course, he should because it would be an impossible proposition. This is the Opposition's cold-hearted approach. If the Leader of the Opposition wants to be into the survival of the fittest and hard-hearted economics, he can go and run a cornpany; he can go and try his hand in the big world of corporate finance or corporate activity. But he should not put himself up as a possible Prime Minister of this country with responsibility to the whole society, including the aged, the sick, the infirm and all those people who have committed the cardinal crime of turning 65 and who he believes should be shunted off to Price Waterhouse or to some other body. What is worse than this savagery is the humbug of the Opposition now holding up in the Senate the Bill to extend the tax file number to social security recipients, which is simply aimed at dealing further with abuse and fraud. The Opposition is putting in jeopardy up to $120m of savings this financial year and $300m in following years. Also, the Leader of the National Party, in response to the Budget measure to further tighten the assets test, said that many farmers would be tripped into poverty limbo as a consequence of the measures in the Budget. Mr Tim Fischer-That is correct.",72
113,Mr KEATING,SECURITY SYSTEM,"That is correct, he says. In other words, on the one hand, those opposite cry crocodile tears about people. But, on the other hand, they refuse to cooperate in the Senate in terms of a progressive change in the administration of the social security system-where it really matters, as my colleague has said, to make $7 billion worth of difference to the social security system, as this Government has done since it came to office. They have the hide and the temerity to go through that humbug while the savage policy is dropped into the Sunday papers-the policy that would push people off to the voluntary agencies or to the accountancy firms-or put out by their spokesman for social security. This is where those opposite stand. After all these years they still do not have any structure to social policy-so little structure indeed that they would even dismember the department that can actually administer a proper social policy in terms of social justice. and the integration strategy, as my colleague the Minister outlined earlier. This is no one day wonder. This is no trip. We are seeing here the manifestation of the formulation of a policy on the part of the Opposition, coming from a number of spokesmen, about a dramatic change to the way in which this country operates, to the whole notion of social justice, fairness and decency, by dismantling the one agency of government that can competently fund and integrate a compassionate social security and social justice program. That is what we have from those opposite, and we have it from somebody who is so immature as to make these remarks-somebody who is not fit to hold the office of a leader of a major political party in this country and who holds these crude philistine views that one can associate only with the dark recesses of a crude financial market. NA",73
114,Mr STEELE HALL,CRUDE OIL PRICES,"I ask the Prime Minister a question about the Government's $4.5m daily windfall from crude oil and the Minister for Resources' attempts to disguise it. Is the Prime Minister aware that the Treasury's estimate of $A 70m tax gained for every $US I rise in the price of crude oil, when added to the industry estimate of net increased. oil producing company tax payments due to greater profitability, will exceed $100m for every $US I rise? Is he aware that for the two months of August and September since the invasion of Kuwait petrol sales are up one per cent on last year and diesel is up 3 per cent? I refer him to Senator Walsh's statement in August 1986 when he said: The Government's general policy is . . . to achieve broad revenue neutrality by reducing the excise on refined petroleum products. I ask the Prime Minister whether he is aware that Senator Gareth Evans said in November 1986: . . . the public can rest assured that the Commonwealth is doing its bit to minimise the effects of crude oil price changes . . . And can the Prime Minister remember",73
115,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,CRUDE OIL PRICES,Order! Is the of the honourable member for Boothby getting to his question?,73
116,Mr STEELE HALL,CRUDE OIL PRICES,"Yes, I am getting to it, Mr Acting Speaker. I also ask the Prime Minister whether he can remember saying in September 1986: The Government will continue to . . . adjust product excise rates to offset fully the revenue gained from higher prices which would otherwise accrue. Will the Prime Minister give an undertaking to observe the same revenue neutral position now as in 1986 and thereby cease being a windfall profiteer at the expense of the public?",73
117,Mr HAWKE,CRUDE OIL PRICES,"I have difficulty remembering the first part of the question! There are two points to bear in mind in considering the issues that have been raised by the honourable member for Boothby. First, although Australia has nearly 90 per cent oil self-sufficiency, refiners have had to pay international prices for both Australian and imported crude since the market was deregulated on 1 January 1988. Increases in the price of petrol result from changes to the international price of crude oil and not from government petrol excise, which is levied on a volume basis and is adjusted according to movements in the consumer price index. To return to arrangements which did not involve paying the international price for Australian crude oil would reduce the incentive for conservation, discourage exploration and development and encourage producers to export their oil to markets where they could gain higher prices, causing an artificial shortage in Australia. The second point is that historically Australia has had the third lowest petrol prices and the second lowest petrol-Mr Beale-Answer the question.",74
118,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,CRUDE OIL PRICES,Order! The member for Brucel,74
119,Mr HAWKE,CRUDE OIL PRICES,"This has everything to do with the question; Australia has had the third lowest petrol prices and the second lowest petrol taxes in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Figures produced by the International Energy Agency last month showed that since mid-August petrol prices have risen much faster in most other OECD countries than in Australia. This is due to intervention by the Prices Surveillance Authority (PSA) at the beginning of the Gulf crisis, the effect of which is the thrust of the honourable the member's question. That intervention by the PSA at the beginning of the crisis was to stop petrol wholesalers and retailers passing on excessive price increases to Australian consumers. The PSA required that the price increases be implemented in stages so that consumers were not hit too hard at once. Any consideration to subsidise the price of petrol from any increase in government revenue due to further receipts from the crude oil levy would need to take account of both environmental factors and the effect on conservation and self-sufficiency. The Government would also need to assess whether price trends were likely to remain upwards in the longer term. Finally, I note that the additional receipts from the crude oil levy would make only a marginal reduction in petrol prices of the order of lc per litre. It is calculated that in the event an amount of $400m would have an impact of about 1.5c per litre. The Government will continue to monitor the developments associated with the crisis in the Gulf. Honourable members would have noticed that the price of oil has been extremely volatile. It was just under $US20 per barrel when the crisis broke; it went up recently, some week or so ago, to more than $US40 a barrel. It is now down to about $US36 or $US37 a barrel. There is extreme volatility in the movements and the Government has adjudged it would not be appropriate, for all the reasons to which I have referred, to make an adjustment at this stage. NA",74
120,Mr SAWFORD,EDUCATION,"Has the Minister for Employment, Education and Training seen suggestions that the Commonwealth should have no role in the field of education? What is the extent of duplication between the Commonwealth and the States in the administration of schools and have the States or the Commonwealth sought any changes in this area?",74
121,Mr DAWKINS,EDUCATION,"I have seen some suggestions by the Leader of the Opposition reported in today's press that he will take the razor to the Commonwealth departments of Community Services and Health; Employment, Education and Training; and a few others. The report went on to say that, 'Dr Hewson said that he could not see the need for a Commonwealth Department of Education', and goes on to talk about health, transport and a number of other things. It is important to realise that this an echo of something which was said back in April 1988 when the then Opposition spokesman on education said that the Opposition was about to complete a review of policy which was certain to advocate the abolition of the Federal education Department. I think we should see this most recent contribution as yet a further indication of the Opposition's total failure to develop sensible policies in this area. Since the middle of 1987 I have been confronted by seven different shadow Ministers. That is a rate of about one every six months. The honourable member for Mackellar had a go, as did the honourable member for Tangney, the honourable member for O'Connor, the honourable member for Bruce and the honourable member for Flinders; and now the honourable member for Bennelong and the honourable member for Goldstein. None of the first five made any headway in trying to develop any coherent approach to policies for employment, education and training. In the continuing absence of policy development, the Opposition is now resorting to this kind of childish symbolism, these sorts of vacuous and, childish gestures, which simply talk about the Commonwealth abolishing certain departments. It ought to be recalled that both the Leader of the Opposition aBd the honourable member for Goldstein were senior advisers to the Fraser Government and are both now trying to fight the failed attempts of' the Fraser Government to bring about some new approach to federalism in this country. But what they do not recognise is that the debate has moved on; the debate has passed them by. It is no longer a simplistic notion of centralism versus States rights. It is not even, as the Leader of the Opposition would now pretend, a matter of duplication. The Commonwealth does not run a single school and does not employ a single teacher. There is no duplication in the area of schools as far as the Commonwealth and the States are concerned. Â° We are now talking about how we might function better as a nation. Of course, we is just know that the idea of nationhood, the idea of a nation, is a dirty word to the Opposition. We are trying to put to rest the notion that we are still a collection of fractured colonies, as the Opposition would have us. Rather, we are interested in having a nation which can operate free from senseless duplication and have national direction in important policy areas. There is a need for a national approach in education and training. We want to avoid the situation where the schools' mathematics curriculum is developed and redeveloped six or seven different timOes in different places around the nation. We want to avoid the situation where the skill levels for an apprentice in the metals trade industry is duplicated six or seven times around the country. If ICI wants to develop a new credential for its technicians, it has to go cap in hand to six or seven different governments around the country before it can get any progress in improving the skills of its work force. This is a legitimate role for the Commonwealth. It is not necessarily a case of the Commonwealth setting those standards, but it is most certainly a case of the Commonwealth providing the processes whereby those standards can be set and implemented. This is no irrelevant issue. It is a matter of key importance to kids at school and their families. It is a matter of key importance to industry and its employees. It is a key matter for Australia as we develop a distinctive identity as a nation. But once again we see that the Opposition is totally incapable of participating in this process. The Leader of the Opposition wants to t-ke us back to the 1950s when the Commonwealth had no role in these areas. Opposition members want to fix their eyes firmly on the past as they stagger backwards into the future. I might remind the House that those were the days-of 3190 18 October 1990 REPRESENTATIVES course, the Opposition, including the Leader of the Opposition would be totally ignorant of this-when only 5 per cent of our kids successfully finished the ftill years of secondary school; when we spent only 1% per cent of our gross domestic product on education; when the Commonwealth did nothing to support about 140,000 kids around this country who have special learning difficulties who need our support to receive a full education; and when we had no program of student assistance whereas we now provide $1 billion a year to support kids from poorer families and poorer farms who are trying to get a decent standard of education wherever they might live. What we have instead is a kind of knee-jerk reaction from an Opposition Leader who is totally policy defective and who has surrounded himself with people on his front bench-",74
122,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,EDUCATION,Order! The Minister is straying beyond the bounds of the question. ',76
123,Mr DAWKINS,EDUCATION,"'-They make his front bench look like some kind of New Right political kindergarten. This is the kind of collection of people who are pretending to have some claim to government in this country. Yetat the same time they s,eek to abdicate a national role in important key areas, areas in which this Government, as the honourable member for Port Adelaide asks, has already made important strides in trying to develop in a cooperative wayan approach to curriculum development, an approach to assessment, and an approach to developing national goals for schooling in this country. These are the kinds of things which the Commonwealth can and must do. Yet as the Leader of the Opposition seeks to abdicate a national role in this area, he also abdicates any claim ever to have any role in government in this country. NA",76
124,Mr LLOYD,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Given that the Labor Opposition in the Northern Territory has attacked the Northern Territory Government for the performance of the Territory's economy, is it not a fact that four key projects in the Northern TerriQuestions without Notice tory with, according to Access Economics Pty Ltd, a combined foreign exchange earnings potential of $530m have been held up,by the Federal Australian Labor Party policy, including the illogical three mines policy and Coronation Hill?",76
125,Mr HAWKE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"This Government makes no apology for the policies which it has adopted in regard to the development of Australia's resources. If the Opposition wants to go outÂ· and campaign in Australia for open slather in' regard to uranium mining in Kakadu National Park, it should go out and do it; that is all right. We will gladly entertain and accommodate the Opposition on that issue if it wants to do that when the time of the election comes. One of the great strengths of this Government has been that we have not been development or environment. Let us look at the test. What has' been the employment growth in this country under this Government? There are 1.6 million new jobs. If we are to compare the Opposition with this Labor Government, what is a reasonable way of doing it in terms of growth? I suppose some objective assessment would be the rate of employment growth the Opposition had when it was in office and how it compared with the rate of employment growth we have had. I will tell you what the answer is. The , rate of employment growth under this Government has been five times greater than the rate of employment growth when the Opposition was in office. Not only have we had growth which was five times faster than the Opposition's, but we have also discharged the obligation we have in regard to future generations. As distinct from the Opposition, which would just rip Kakadu apart and mine it up without any regard to future obligations, we have said that we will not do that. In regard to Coronation Hill, we make no apology for that. It is an extremely sensitive area. It is possible-and that is our concern-that if mining went ahead there, irreparable damage could be done from the headwaters of that region into the great Kakadu area. Now, it may be that after an appropriate investigation, which appropriate investigation we have set up, the recommendation to the Government-after that careful consideration-would be that it is safe for mining to go ahead at Coronation Hill. Opposition members-Oh!",76
126,Mr HAWKE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Honourable members opposite go 'Oh!' as though they have not heard this before. But what we are not going to do is just say willy-nilly, 'There's something-let's dig it up. Let's dig it up without any concern either for the question of environmental considerations or the considerations of our Aboriginal people'. What is appropriate to be done in the Northern Territory and anywhere else in this country is, if it is possible to agreed to: go ahead and develop that without adverse environmental impact or without adverse impact on the considerations of our Aboriginal people, then that development should go ahead. But as distinct from honourable members opposite-:who say, 'Dig it up at any price', irrespective of the concerns of Aboriginal people or the concerns of future generations-we on this side will have economic development, in employment terms, five times as fast as the coalition Government had. But we have such concern for the environment that the relevant world bureau has said that no country has done more for advancing world heritage standards and values than has Australia. So we can do both: we can have employment growth five times as fast as the Opposition, but we can discharge our obligations to this and future generations. That is what we have done and not only do we make no apology for it; we are proud of it and we will fight the Opposition on any election platform it likes on that issue-and we will win. Mr Steele Hall-On point of order, Mr Acting Speaker, I seek leave to table a document. Leave not granted. Mr Steele Hall-Should I explain the document?

EDWARDS Time allotted 30 minutes. Chairman 17 October 1990 GOVERNMENT POLICIES: IMPACT NA Discussion of Matter of Public Importance",78
132,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,ON AUSTRALIANS,"I have received a letter from the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The failure of the Prime Minister to understand the impact of his Government's policies on Australians. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their places",79
133,Dr HEWSON,ON AUSTRALIANS,"The matter of public importance that I wish to raise today is the failure of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to understand the impact Â·of his Government's policies on Australians. As usual, the Prime Minister has scuttled from this place when he is the subject of criticism. He can dish it out to the Archbishop and he can get his Ministers up on aÂ· daily basis with dorothy dixers in order to grossly misrepresent what we have said and take the arguments up to us, but he 'cannot take the criticism himself. Whenever we try to call him to account in this Parliament he runs away. I think it should go down as a permanent feature of our comment on the extent to which this Prime Minister has got out of touch with the people of Australia-",80
134,Mr HOWE,ON AUSTRALIANS,"Mr Acting Speaker, I rise on a point of order. If the Leader of the Opposition wants to move a censure motion, or whatever, he can do that. The Prime Minister has parliamentary business which takes him to Sydney, in this case to a Business Council meeting, and I do not think it is appropriate that we go on with this rubbish. .",80
135,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,ON AUSTRALIANS,"Order! There is no point of order. In the terms of the matter of public importance, the Leader of the Opposition is in order.",80
136,Dr HEWSON,ON AUSTRALIANS,"We all know that the Prime Minister holds this Parliament in contempt. He does not give it its true place. I have called on him on dozens of occasions to participate in a process whereby we might raise parliamentary standards, and an essential element of that is surely that the Prime Minister be prepared to appear in this House and to answer criticisms. There is no doubt that people i'n Australia are suffering and are in genuine distress. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer (Mr Keating) go merrily on their way, totally ignoring the. impact their policies have had on the lives of average Australians. Even today, the Prime Minister, for example, was boasting again about how much his employment rate had gone up-1.6 million jobs, or whatever. He glosses over the fact that there are elements of that number which indicate hardship for Australians. For example, about 55 per cent of the increase in employment has been among women. While that is good-when a woman has chosen, as a matter of career, to go to work and has had the opportunity to get a jobthere are many women in this country who have been forced to go to work as a result of the financial hardship that has been impacted on them by this Government. Of course, he boasts about how his employmentÂ· growth is a major source of bringing down poverty in Australia. As Dr Peter Saunders, from the University of New South Wales, has shown, the 1.6 million jobs has reduced poverty by about 39,000-nowhere near the glorious claims that the Prime Minister would have us believe were possible under his policies. As I have said many times, I think it is essential that the Prime Minister, the Treasurer, and other senior Ministers, including the Minister at the table, the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe), leave Canberra, get out of the VIP aircraft and the white planes to see what is happening to individual Australians and Australian families. They should talk to the 140,000 people who have been added to the unemployment rolls since last October. Mr Howe interjecting",80
137,Dr HEWSON,ON AUSTRALIANS,The Minister should go and sit in the bankruptcy courts and watch the people file through. He should go and count the empty shops and factories around this country. He should go and look at the lengths of the auction and for sale columns in Australia. That is the magnitude of the problem. Mr Howe interjecting,80

143,Dr HEWSON,ON AUSTRALIANS,"I challenge the Minister to go out and talk to the average pensioners in Sydney or Melbourne who are earning about $291.70 a fortnight about how they are currently forced into very difficult financial circumstances. Public housing will cost them about $120; their telephone will cost about $15; their electricity about $20; their transport about $30; their prescriptions and medical expenses, if they are healthy, about $20; the pre-payment of their funeral expenses and so on about $10-leaving them with about $17 per fortnight for all of their other expenses. There is nothing left for clothing, recreation, incidentals or unexpected bills. The Minister should go out and talk to some of the people who are struggling under high interest rates in this country. We have seen Government members in the House this week boasting that they have lowered interest rates. How have they lowered interest rates? By throwing many of the breadwinners in families who are fighting to keep their homes onto the unemployment lists so that they not only lose their homes but also, in many cases, may lose their families or their self-respect. This is the magnitude of the problem that is being created in Australia at present. Yet we are being accused of unjustifiably raising issues about the appropriate and effective targeting of government expenditure in circumstances where there is presently genuine hardship around this country. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), in particular, has had a record in this House of unbelievable arrogance, insensitivity, misrepresentation, irresponsibility and ignorance. What could have been more arrogant than the Prime Minister's actions yesterday when he attacked Archbishop Hollingworth for pointing out the consequences of the Government's high interest rate policies? The Prime Minister almost mocked him. He relied on semantics. He would not debate the issue that high interest rates have pushed more Australian children into poverty. He is still acutely sensitive about the commitment that he made some time ago, that no childÂ· would be living in poverty by 1990. What could have been more insensitive and irresponsible than the Prime Minister making a commitment such as that in the heat of an election campaign in 1987 when he knew damn well that he did not have the policies in place that would achieve that goal? As soon as he was put under public pressure, what did he do? He made another semantic distinction. He changed from 'will' to 'need' and tried to obfuscate his way out of it. What could be more ignorant than the way in which the Prime Minister has behaved in recent days in relation to some of the criticisms of his Government's performance? Let us take for example, the way he reacted to a pensioner who simply wanted to talk to him. The Prime Minister turned on him and called him a 'silly old bugger'. What could be more insensitive, arrogant and irresponsible than that sort of behaviour? People are genuinely concerned, not only about their own hardship, but also about the way in which the Canberra bureaucracy is failing to deliver services to people who are desperately in need. There are no better sources for comment on that than some from bureaucracy itself. For example, one person who used to work in my electorate, Ark Griffin, who was the regional manager of the social security office in Darlinghurst, iri May of this year wrote an article for the Sydney Morning Herald. Mr Griffin identified himself as one of hundreds of regional managers of social security offices across this country and one of the thousands of public servants whose work it is to provide income support for millions of people. I think the Minister should pay particular attention to what Mr Griffin had to say. Mr Griffin stated: Imagine my Social Security office as a welfare investment company that spent $40 million in one year. At the end of that year, when accounting for its activities to the board of directors, showed that it had: Conceived of no plan for the relief of local poverty. Developed no strategy on drug or alcohol abuse. Seen a rapid decline in the available accommodation for the poor in the area. Lost 75 per cent of its staff and ended up with a highly unskilled work force. He went on to say: Our politicians have given us programs for spending money, not programs for solving problems. Almost all of the billions spent are being spent on maintenance programs. And in Darlinghurst, it is very clear that what is being maintained is poverty. At the local level, Social Security is incapable of responding to community needs. The hiring of private guards and installation of bank-style security windows seems sure evidence that something is very wrong in the welfare business. The system is so incapable of response to those in the greatest need that the time has come for a major change. I think that any meaningful answers to these welfare problems will be found only at a level close enough to the problems for the immediate responses to be made. I draw the attention of the Minister to that passage, as those words were stated by one of his former regional officers in the Department of Social Security. Similarly, the Prime Minister's ignorance and insensitivity to the needs of many of those in the welfare community are clearly evidenced by a letter that was sent to him on 11 July by the Sydney City Mission. Charles Chambers, the Executive Director of the Mission, has signed the letter. He says: Dear Mr Hawke I draw your attention to a matter of urgency. Poverty in the greater metropolitan area of Sydney is rapidly increasing and is having dire effects on the lives of people. The number of people seeking crisis assistance from Sydney City Mission has dramatically increased in recent months. The number of families who came to our family support services division for help, counselling and relief in June 1989 it amounted to 1,675. That figure has risen for June 1990 to 4,097 families, an increase of approximately 150%. In that same period the numb'er of unemployed people that we are training and placing in employment has risen from an annual rate of 3,000 to an annual rate of 4,000. In the letter he goes on to ask for a oneoff grant of $600,000 to enable the Sydney City Mission to maintain its existing services to those in need through the current difficult financial year. The letter then states: We undertake that 100% of this money would go to the people in need and would significantly help us alleviate real poverty in this area. No administration or other costs would be deducted. This letter is written as a last resort and in the belief that you have a sincere commitment to the relief of poverty. ' A very sincere comn;titment to the relief of poverty-the letter remains unanswered at the present time. There are dozens and dozens of examples of gross inefficiency in the delivery of services. As I say, people are very concerned about the way the Canberra bureaucracy is failing to deliver services to people who are desperately in need of help. The Prime Minister has established a series of Special Premiers Conferencesthe first one of these to take place, I think, on about 30 October this year. He has set up that procedure to do what he claims will revolutionise Commonwealth-State relations in the course of this decade, so that we can go into the twenty-first century with a vibrant new process of federalism. It seems to me that, against the background of that sort of process, it is reasonable to challenge the Prime Minister to ensure that the issue of the Government being responsive to the people is a major one that should be on the agenda of that Federal-State relations debate. Better government does not mean, however, doing everything from Canberra. It is the view of the Minister for Community Services and Health, who is at the table-as he said today on The World Today and reiterated in the Parliamentthat everything should be centralised in Canberra. Indeed, it is an ideological thrust on the part of many on the bther side of the House that things should be concentrated in Canberra-even if that flies in the face of common sense or evidence which is clearly provided in the two examples that I quoted before. I say to the Minister that there is a very real chance in current circumstances to look at the precise nature of the expenditure functions and responsibilities of the Commonwealth and State governments at this special Premiers Conference. One of the true and difficult structural needs of this .country is to address those issues. I do not mind being attacked, as I have been in recent days by the Prime Minister and a host of other Ministers, for daring to raise the fact that this is a very important issue, that people are concerned about the delivery of government services and that people really do want value for their money. I do not mind being attacked provided there is a simultaneous response that there is a genuine focus on the issue. Twice I have offered to the Prime Minister to participate in the special Premiers Conference and to work with him in an agreed process, a bipartisan process, to make fundamental structural change in what has traditionally been a very difficult area, an area where on occasions in the past people have spent a lot of time taking cheap political shots rather than focusing on the issues. Disturbingly, again we are seeing the process of cheap political shots rather than any capacity or willingness to address the issue. Not surprisingly, on the two occasions I asked, on the two occasions the Prime Minister said no. Ido not care what the Government and its Ministers and others say about me. 1 do care that they get on and deal with those issues. They are fundamentally important issues to people in Australia, not only to those who are in need but also to those who pay their taxes and expect efficiency and value for money from the Government. I have put my bona fides on the table in respect of this issue and I challenge the Prime Minister and his senior Ministers to do the same.",81
144,Mr HOWE,ON AUSTRALIANS,"Batman-Minister for Community Services and Health) (3.26)I welcome the opportunity to participate in this debate. I welcome it because it has been an opportunity for the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) to make his first sensible comment in relation to social policy issues that face this country. He has forgone that opportunity. He might have talked about ageing and the problem of families and child poverty. He might have talked about the structure of welfare payments. He might have talked about the respective role of the Commonwealth and the States in terms of health and housing. But he failed to address in any substantive way any of those issues. The Leader of the Opposition began by slurring women and by suggesting, as is a tradition of the Liberal Party, that a job for a woman is not equivalent to a job for a man. He suggested that somehow because the 1.6 million jobs included 55 per cent of jobs for women that that was regrettable and that that somehow lacked substance. The Leader of the Opposition went on to talk about the adequacy of social security payments. What absurdity to hear from this leader of the coalition about the inadequacy of payments. We think of the level of the pension when we came to office, which was just over 22 per cent of average weekly earnings. Now it has risen to nearly 26 per cent of average weekly earnings. We think of the piffling level of rent assistance that was paid to tenants in the private market. The Leader of the Opposition talked about Darlinghurst. I wonder how often he has spent any time in Darlinghurst. After all, he did not even know the name of the regional manager to whom he referred in terms of this particular issue. Of course there are complex problems in Darlinghurst. Last year I visited the office there and organised meetings with a number of inner city agencies to discuss the - way that the Government, together with other agencies, might provide extended services for low income people in the Darlinghurst and surrounding areas. It is one thing to suggest that there are problems; it is another to suggest policies and approaches that might resolve those problems. We heard nothing of that from the Leader of the Opposition. The reality is that we have touched on important areas of social policy-for example, the role of the Federal bureaucracy. The Leader of the Opposition has suggested that we could devolve or transfer major elements of that bureaucracy across to the non-government sector. I think the problem for the Leader of the Opposition is that he has had to face some challenge in relation to those remarks-remarks that were casual, ignorant, and innocent of their impact. They simply could not be defended. The Leader of the Opposition has made no attempt to defend them. He does not think for a moment that one can seriously propose the scrapping of the Department of Social Security and its offices, which deliver ments of $22 billion. But it is a good thing to say. The Leader of the Opposition talks about those people 'at the coalface' as if they are the closest to the problem and therefore that is a good thing to be heard to say. But of course he knows as well as I know that those people at the coalface need to be supported by the complex of services that are delivered by the Commonwealth Government-whether these are the regional offices of the Department of Social Security; the Commonwealth rehabilitation service; the funding that is provided to supported accommodation programs, to missions such as the Sydney City Mission or church agencies right across Australia; or the child-care places that are increasingly assisting low income families, particularly sole parents to make it back into the work force. That complex of services needs to continue to be provided, but the Leader of the Opposition takes the soft option of using some words which he is not serious about. One of the things that perhaps causes me the greatest concern about the Opposition is its inability to follow through, to honestly state what the consequences might be and to face up to those consequences of any area of policy. Let me take, for example, the interview with Niki Savva that has been referred to in the Parliament this week. I refer to the Opposition's policy in relation to the removal of tariffs by the year 2000. One can understand that that is a serious policy proposition. After all, no government has done more to reduce protection than this Government and we understand the impact. But then further doyvn in the article, he was forced to consider the logical consequences of the position that he has taken. He gave a guarantee, according to the article, that over the seven years it would take to abolish tariffsÂ· there would be no job 10sses.Over the seven years there would be no job losses! He said that workers might not be in the same factories but there would be jobs for them. In other words, as soon as the logical consequences arise from the Opposition Leader's policy, he runs away from that paypolicy. Towards the end of the interview he said: It is very important to get out in front with hard line decisions on a range of issues. We have painted ourselves as a harder-line alternative to the Government and as time goes on the electorate will come more and more behind us. They will vote for us in the end if we've got credibility, if they genuinely believe that we are going to do what we say we will. If that involves pain they will wear it. Let me ask the Leader of the Opposition when he last went down to Darlinghurst and told people in the regional social security office that his Party favoured cutting people off from unemployment benefit after nine months? When did the Leader of the Opposition have the guts to go anywhere in the welfare sector and put tpat kind of proposition? I will tell him, there has been no such time because neiparents ther he nor his spokespeople-all eight of them--;will go out into the welfare sector and explain what the consequences of that policy are because they do not believe they can defend those policies in the real world. They might be able to defend them the other end of town and at the other end of the electorate-,--in Elizabeth Bay and Rose Bay those kinds of policies might be very popular and they might have a lot of support. But the Leader of the position should take those policies that is prepared to. advocate down into Darlinserving ghurst and defend them. there. In that same' article, he talks about the serious questions, the questions he is preback pared to take seriously; the meetings that he, as Leader of the Opposition, is pretion's pared to attend, the meetings with some of the people to whom I have just rerate ferred, at the other end of the electorate. He quotes them as saying: We bust our guts to fight to keep our business, struggle to pay our interest payments, pay cent of our income in the marginal dollar Keating, just to see him take on another of community workers or handout merchants build a bureaucracy that dispenses benefits those who aren't prepared to pull their weight. He is talking about the aged, the poor. They are the ones to whom he refers not being prepared to pull their weightabout and in hard times that argument gets even more legs than in normal times. In other words, what the Leader of the Opposition is really saying t9 the Parliament is not that he int((nds to wipe out bureaucracy. He has no more intention of wiping out bureaucracy than any conservhealth ative leader before him; but he does have an intention of wiping out people. He intends .to say, 'Look, as a conservative government there are certain groups of people for whom we do not take any sponsibility', and the identity of those people is clear. As long as we have been in government we have heard conservaof tive leaders identify the people for whom the Opposition will not take responsibilciently ity. As the honourable member for Mallee  'Let us not take responsibility for sole because those people are the undeserving poor with multiple fathers'. This is the Opposition's attitude: 'Let us not take responsibility for that particular group of people and let us not take responsibiUty for the long term unemployed because they are a group of people of at whom we do not think too much and who are rather undeserving. So let us wipe them out and let us suggest that somehow they cease to exist and that they will be able to look after themselves'. The Leader Opof the Opposition would say that there he are other groups who are simply not deor good enough to deserve the government dollar. When we talk about savings and cutting on expenditure, of course it is those people that do not fit with the Opposivalues, the conservative values and the values at the other end of its electothat it will target and wipe out. The . Opposition does not fundamentally have a policy that is based on any sense of social justice, fairness,' or that people who 50 per have been excluded should have the opto portunity to get back into the community. group Those opposite do not have integrated or approaches. They do not talk about linkto ing income security across to the labour market. They do not talk about linking tax to social security as we do in relation as to the child support scheme. They talk very unsophisticated, very basic approaches that might be inflicted on the various agencies that simply do not have the resources that are necessary to develop a modern and sophisticated social security system' linked, as it may be, to other elements of social policy such as a policy through Medicare and so on. So what we have from the Opposition is an approach, articulated again by the Leader of the Opposition, which is essentially ignorant, that is fundamentally unrecaring, lacks in compa-sion and that simply does not match sensibly with any well thought-out economic policy. The fact the matter is that, if we devolve to the voluntary sector functions that are effidelivered by the Commonwealth Government, not only do we face the problem-which, I think, the Leader of the Opposition recognises-of overwhelming those organisations, but we are likely to face quite significant and serious problems of inefficiency. If we want to ensure that the administrative dollar is kept to the absolute imum, of course an integrated system makes much more sense than a decentralised system in which one increasingly relies on agencies,which were never established to provide comprehensive income security systems-as has indeed been acknowledged by spokespersons for the St Vincent de Paul Society today. They understand that their role is part of a system to deliver significant services and that, increasingly, government can contract to have particular services delivered as appropriate at a local community level. But that is very different from talking about a systemic approach that would deliver, whether it be income security, health care or rehabilitation for disabled workers, through a voluntary sector. They can certainly provide services that would mesh in well with the Commonwealth rehabilitation service. But to suggest that one ought to replace the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service with a network of uncoordinated, voluntary agencies is to display incredible ignorance. The Leader of the Opposition is ignorant. He is very limited as a politician. His background is narrow and he reflects, if you like, not only a narrow range of class interests, but an inability to understand how the real world operates and how social policy needs to be adjusted to deal with the range of concerns and complex considerations that arise in the modern state. So that is why we get such simplistic, naive notions from him. But one ought not to have any illusions that they are simply naive and not more fundamentally flawed. They are more fundamentally flawed because they reflect a lack of compassion, a lack of a sense of social justice and a lack of any commitment to real opportunity for those who are disadvantaged so that people are able to regain a place within the mainstream and a share of more standard community incomes. The Leader of the Opposition ought to recognise and acknowledge the significant achievements that have occurred in the 1980s. But, just as that ought to be acknowledged, so he ought to be free to go on and address some of the issues we will min- need to face in the coming decade, some of them quite different issues. Within the context of Federal-State relations we are prepared and preparing to tackle those issues. For example, within my own portfolio we have indicated that there will be a national health strategy. That has been welcomed by the one conservative State health Minister, Mr Collins. There will be a national housing review, carried olit again in consultation with the States. There will be full opportunity to debate . the various considerations and policy proposals that come out of both those strategies. There will be a sensible discussion between the Commonwealth and the States as to particular areas where there can be some devolution. We ought to be quite clear that when we talk about that we will talk about it on the basis of serious policy; we will not take the cheap option as we have heard it today from the Leader of the Opposition, the suggestion that somehow we can scrap the Department of Social Security, that somehow we do not need any universal health insurance. How can he survive as Leader of the Opposition with the kind of parroting that one hears from the Monash mugs that are sitting next to him? The honourable member for Wentworth suggests that somehow he can get by as Leader of the Opposition while being in ignorance of serious policy issues and without any real attention to the needs of people. That is what this Government has demonstrated-a fundamental concern for people translated into good social policy.",83
145,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ON AUSTRALIANS, Order! The Minister's time has expired.,86
146,Mr CONNOLLY,ON AUSTRALIANS,"Bradfield) (3.41)What we have heard for the last 15 minutes demonstrates the absolute truth of the 1990s-that this Government is intellectually bankrupt. It is incapable of thinking laterally on any issue at all and of even imagining that there may be a different way to provide a better quality of service to those in need. It is incapable of distinguishing, in its own words, the difference between the efficiency of program administration, the elimination of fraud and .the need to target people in real need. All three are said to be part of the social justice strategy of this Government, a. strategy which I remind this House has, over the last 12 months, increased the unemployment rate of this nation by 140,000 people and has introduced record bankruptcies, rising suicides, a rising number of broken families, and high interest rates. People in this society demonstrated in opinion polls announced only yesterday-and this is what this debate is really all about-that they want the Government to go. The sooner those opposite rid this chamber of their presence, the better it will be for the tralian people. At Question Time the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) told us again about their social justice strategy, the need to reduce costs and the wonderful record the Government had achieved by being able to cut by exactly one per cent over the last . seven years the share of gross domestic productÂ· which is allocated to welfare. I remind the Minister of one salient fact. For the last four years he has been telling this chamber about the glories of high employment. He was right, because with high employment, of course, we reduce the cost of government outlays. What he does not understand today, however, is that unemployment payments are a substitute for employment, a substitute for the fact that the Government's economic policies have now failed. It is because of that failure that the Government has demonstrated in the last two days a remarkable degree of sensitivity to any suggestion-whether it comes from bishops of the church, from the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) or from anyone else-that there may be different and better ways of delivering services to the Australian people. Archbishop Hollingworth is an eloquent spokesman and has been referred to in this chamber on other occasions by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in support of his case. On this occasion Archbishop Hollingworth spoke about people in need; he spoke about his constituency. He deplored the evidence of conspicuous waste which has become the trademark of the Hawke Government. That waste has been perpetrated by none other than the Government's two arch-priests, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer (Mr Keating). One lives in Canberra and rarely visits his electorate of Wills; the other lives in Canberra and, when he travels to Sydney, goes incognito in a white Commonwealth car with black windows so nobody can see who is inside. He travels in a car without Commonwealth numberplates because he does not want anyone to know who is inside. This man has the temerity to come into this House and seriously suggest to the Australian people and his Aus- colleagues that he has the pulse of the ordinary Australian. We saw the pulse of the ordinary Australian in the Bulletin yesterday. We saw what the people think of this Government and we interpreted it to mean only one thing: go! And the sooner the better. The direction of the Government's economic policies is wrong and therefore the direction of its social policies-whatever the virtues of the so-called social justice strategy may be-will never be achieved under this Government. We were told by the Minister for Finance, for example, about the importance of efficiency of programming administration and of the need to eliminate fraud. Let us look at the record in this remarkable area, because here we find a government that honestly does not know which way is up. It has a Minister in the Senate, Senator Richardson, who does not want to be the Minister for Social Security. He tells people he does not want to be the Minister for Social Security and he demonstrated it clearly only last week when he said that the Department is losing $400m a year. Yet last year on the 60 Minutes program the previous Minister for Social Security, the present Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe), who is at the table, was asked, 'Is there or is there not fraud?', and his categorical answer, for all to hear-millions of Australians-was one simple syllable: 'No!'. Who are we to believe? Are we to believe the present Minister, Senator Richardson, who says that $400m is being ripped off ordinary Australians every year, or are we to believe the previous incumbent of the office? The Minister for Finance said today that there had been no less than 40 measures in seven years to target fraud. Mr Costello-Forty!",86
147,Mr CONNOLLY,ON AUSTRALIANS,"Yes, no less than 40 measures. All of that has been done since 1983, 'yet the admission last week was that $400m is still going down the tube. The trouble is this Government makes one fundamental error: it cannot distinguish between its responsibility to those who are in genuine need and its responsibility to the community which has to pay the taxes. The Minister at the table, above all people in this House, should be aware of the dichotomy in that simple proposition.' He 'has two responsibilities, not one. It is no good for the Government to talk to the' Australian people about its glorious social justice strategy when we have more kids on the street, no adequate accommodation for the poor, more' broken families, people cannot pay their mortgages, and rising unemployment140,000 in the last 12 months. The peculiar reality which the Government faces is simply this: while for the first few years it spent all its time lambasting us about high unemployment in 1983, is it not sad that seven years later we have seen the complete circle, and now the dog is biting its tail. That.is those in the Hawke Government have given to the Australian people. Yet they wonder why people will no longer believe them, why they are no longer trusted. We are about to have a premiers conference. I have here a copy of the social justice strategy progress report. It makes wonderful reading. I recommend it. I will even seek to table it in the chamber so we can all have a look. The first paragraph is so lame it is hardly worth quoting but it does make two interesting points. It says: Particular issues to be addressed include access to adequate and affordable housing . It goes on to say: . . . enable them'them', note; 'them' happens to be the ordinary people of Australia to have a decent standard ,of living . . . What has the Government achieved in seven years? More people today than since the days of the Great Depression are looking for a decent standard of living. Because of the impact of the Government's high interest rate policies, we have a bigger problem today in trying to house our community than we have had at any time since the Second World War. That is the outcome of the Government's social policy and economic policy. The Minister has the temerity to come in here and talk nonsense, because the Leader of the OppositioI). is meeting what the people want. The people are saying that they want change, new thought and a different approach to' problems. What is wrong with using the welfare agencies? I was a member of the Standing Committee on Community Affairs which produced a report entitled A Guide to Social Security Payments: Fairness, Courtesy and Efficiency?, tabled in this House two years ago. The evidence that we took from a whole range of organisations, including pensioner groups and all the welfare agencies, emphasised that in a whole range of areas they were able to give a service at the local level which the people wanted. They did not want to be dominated by bureaucracy in Canberra. They did not what want to have a service which had 16,000 staff, 300 regional offices and 540 standard forms, of which 291 are used by the public. There have been over 200 changes to the Social Security Act in the last two years and, as I said, from the miserable Minister for Finance there have been 40 measures to try to target fraud. The Minister for Community Services and Health, who represents the Minister for Social Security in this place, is a failure and his policies have failed. The Australian public know that he is a failure. Why does he not call it quits?",88
148,Mr SCIACCA,ON AUSTRALIANS,"Bowman-Parliamenmember tary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security) (3.51)-1 do not think that all the time. I have been in this House I have heard so much drivel from any member than that which we have heard this afternoon from the honourable memhonourable ber for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) and the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). too, was on the Standing Committee Community Affairs that the honourable member for Bradfield talked about. He is the ideas man of the Opposition. He not the shadow Minister for Social Security. Indeed, the only member present in this House that has any vague connection with the Department of Social Security the portfolio is the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton), who did not even speak in this debate. Apart from the honourable member for Mackellar, who has no shadow portfolio, none of the members that have anything to do with social welfare policy in this Parliament, none of the shadow Ministers, are in shadow Cabinet. That is the importance that the Opposition attaches to the delivliving. ery of services to those most in need. The honourable member for Bradfield tells us that he was on the Standing mittee. As I said, I, too, was on that Committee. Not once during the course of the hearings of that Committee was there any complaint about the concept having a Department of Social Security deliver the services that are necessary. Certainly, there were complaints around the fringes about counter staff, advice ters and all these sorts of things. Those have been picked up by the Government, and we are now doing something about them. Indeed, many if not all the recomhas mendations are about to be addressed by the Department of Social Security. In my position as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security, have initiated a review of social security advice letters. I asked members of the Opposition whether they would have some input into that. Not one person from the shadow Ministry that has got anything to do with social welfare policy wrote in with any submissions at all. If it were not for the honourable for Pearce (Mr Chaney), a former Minister for Social Security, and a in couple of others, there would have been little or no input into this review of social security advice letter from the Opposition. I acknowledge the input of the member for Pearce and thank him for it. But neither the honourable I, member for Bradfield nor the Leader of on the Opposition wrote to me to say how better or best we could deliver our services. The fact is that we have picked up a is lot of those areas of complaints. The Leader of the Opposition then sheds crocodile tears for pensioners. Can honourable members believe the hide of or the man-a man who is prepared to get rid of capital gains tax so that he can end up losing billions of dollars that the Government is now receiving and which it is spending on social security programs? The man who says that comes around and tells us how the poor pensioner cannot live. We all know that the pension is not as the much as we would like it to be. Everybody is entitled to a decent standard of But at least this Government has done something about increasing the level of pension to the point where it is now Com25 per cent of average weekly earnings. The Leader of the Opposition talks about the sorts of problems that pensioners have. He does not need to tell us what of the problems of pensioners are, because we know. People such as myself, the Minister for Social Security, Senator Richardson, many other Ministers of the letGovernment and, in particular, many backbenchers of this Government, actually mix with pensioners. How long has it been since the Leader of the Opposition gone out and spoken to 700 pensioners at a meeting, as I. did the other day, to explain social security policy to them? He would be flat out having 700 pensionI ers in his silvertail electorate. So it is absolute poppycock for him to tell us how we should be delivering our services to like to social security recipients. The Leader of the Opposition says that we want everything centralised here in Canberra. How ridiculous! He obviously knows nothing about the Department of Social Security when he says that we want to centralise everything in Canberra. Does he not know that the Department of Social ,Security has well over 200 regional offices throughout this country? He probably does not know. I doubt whether he has ever walked into a social security office in his life. If he has, I would be very surprised. Does the Leader of the Opposition not know that in every State we have migrant service units that cater for people who cannot speak English? Does he not know that we have all sorts of programs throughout this country that Social Security delivers? Does he not know that we have the jobs, education and training pro-Â· gram, the child support scheme, childcare fee relief programs, Newstart programs? And on and on it goes. So much for this stupid and absurd matter of public importance, which says: The failure of the Prime Minister to understand the impact of his Government's policies on Australians. We on the Government side understand, as does the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), the impact of our policies on matters social welfare on Australians. We are the Government that has introduced all these measures. For instance, we have introsuggest duced reforms in the labour market training to try to get disabled people into the work force. We are trying to get those unfortunate enough not to be able to a job to come back into the employment stream by our innovative projects-by Skillshare, which this Opposition during the last election campaign made very clear that it was prepared to abolish. We have promised those projects, not the Opposiwho tion. What really annoys me is that in his response to the Budget, the Leader of the Oppositi(;m was extremely critical of this Government because we did not cut enough expenditure from the Budget. suggested that the Opposition would have found an extra $2 billion to cut. Where was the Opposition going to cut that from? Obviously, the Opposition was going to cut it from social security spending. As has been mentioned on a number of occasions this week in this House, one only needs to see the Niki Savva article, which makes it very clear that the Leader of the Opposition wants to privatise the Department of Social Security. How ridiculous to suggest that a department that has some 16,000 people working for it, that sends out some 30-odd million letters per year, that looks after four million clients and spends almost $25 billion in payments, can be handed over to voluntary welfare agencies. This matter of public importance was brought up today because of the comments of Archbishop Hollingworth. He is a person for whom I have a great deal of respect. He is now the Archbishop of Brisbane. Next Monday this Government is giving a research grant of some $25,000 for a youth homelessness survey in Brisbane, to be headed by none other than Archbishop Hollingworth. I take my hat off to the Archbishop. But he does not know everything about everything, as the Prime Minister correctly said at Question Time, and to criticise the Prime Minister for that is a nonsense. Welfare organisations are not geared toof wards the sort of massive work that is involved in properly delivering services to those that need them. It is ridiculous to that the aged and the sick and and people who need unemployment benefit should be put in a situation akin to the 1930s depressions, where they would have get to line up on one line if they wanted advice and line up on another line if they wanted a cheque. That is just degrading those people, and it is probably the worse thing that anybody could envisage. Yet the Leader of the Opposition, a person would be the Prime Minister of this country, is suggesting exactly that. How can people trust such a person? I accept that the Leader of the Opposition is probably genuine. If I wanted merchant banking advice, I would go and see him. He But if he wants some advice on social security and what it is like to live out there with the ordinary people, he ought to come and see me. I could tell him a lot about it and I am sure that I could teach him a lot. But for his absurd suggestion that we privatise the Department of Social Security, I think that he may well be beyond help. He will need as much help as he can get from all his friends and advisers. around him. I suggest to the honourable member. for Bennelong (Mr Howard) that he ought to help the Leader of the Opposition because he needs his. help. . This Government is not worried about this matter of public importance because there are many things that this Government has brought in that have had an impacton Australians. For instance, we have achieved a fourth record Budget surplus; we have reduced foreign borrowings; we have brought in the accord with the trade union movement which has increased Australia's competitiveness overseas and which has resulted in a decrease in the level of disputation never seen in modern times. We have increased education speQding that has created a record number' of places in schools and universities. We have cut the top personal tax rate from 60 per cent to 47 per cent. The company rate has been cut from 49 per cent to 39 per cent, and on and on it goes. Yet . this Opposition and its mealymouthed Leader have the temerity to criticise the Prime Minister because they say that he fails to understand the impact of the Government's policies. We understand the impact of our policies. When times are tough, we will do what we can about it. But this matter of public importance is a nonsense and it has been shown to be so.",89
149,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ON AUSTRALIANS," Order! The honourable member's time has expired and the discussion is conclude.d. NA NA AMENDMENT BILL 1990 Bill presented by Mr Kerin, and read a first time. Second Reading",91
150,Mr KERIN,ENERGY LEGISLATION,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill is an omnibus Bill for legislation administered within the Primary Industries and Energy portfolio. Its introduction wHl facilitate the passage of amendments to existing legislation. The Bill contains minor administrative amendments to the Exotic Animal Disease Control Act 1989; the Export Control Act 1982; the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation Act 1987; the Murray-Darling Basin Act 1983; the Plant Variety Rights Act 1987; the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989; the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Power Act 1949; the Wheat Industry Fund Levy Collection Act 1989; and the Wheat Marketing Act 1989. Exotic Animal Disease Control Act 1989 Due to drafting errors, it is necessary to amend the schedule to the Exotic Animal Disease Control Act 1989 before regulations can be putÂ· in place to collect levies from the pig and laying chicken industries for payment into the Exotic Animal Disease Preparedness Trust Account. . Under regulations applying from 1 April 1990, the dairy, livestock, meat, chicken and wopl industries contribute to the trust account. Export Control Act 1982 Amendments to the Export Control Act 1982 are required to reflect operational changes in export documentation and ensure that powers afforded by existing provisions are preserved with the introduction of the system. At this stage, the system will be used for the export of meat and may be extended to the export of other commodities. Horticultural Research and Development Corporation Act 1987 This Act provides the framework for the Government's support of research and development in horticultural industries and establishes the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation to administer research and development funds. This amendment establishes independent selection committees to nominate persons for appointment to the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation. The amendments alter existing selection committee arrangements to conform with those contained in the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989. The composition of the current corporation selection committee consists of four members of the research council's selection committee under the Rural Industries Research (RIR) Act 1985 and three other members nominated by industry bodies. With the passage last year of the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989 and the corporatisation of rural research councils, RIR Act is expected to be repealed. This amendment will increase the number of selection committee members nominated by industry from three to a maximum of six. The industry will therefore have a greater influence on the selection process. This amendment provides for selection committees to be set up on an ad hoc basis. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy will appoint a part time presiding member for a three year term. The presiding member will then have the responsibility of establishing a selection committee when a vacancy arises on the corporation. The committee will be disbanded when the selection process has been completed. Looking to the immediate future, a selection committee will need to be convened to nominate persons by August next year for appointment as members of the corporation for the 1991-94 term. This amendment is presented with the intention that these new arrangements for selection committees will be in place to select persons to the corporation as expected vacancies arise next year. Murray-Darling Basin Act 1983 This amendment will allow the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council to make decisions out of session-that is, otherwise than at meetings. The Council consists of up to three Ministers representing agriculture, water resources and the environment from the governments of the Commonwealth, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. It is charged with the direction and coordination of the Murray-Darling Basin initiative to combat land and water degradation in the Basin. It also encourages the improved management of environmental resources of the Basin. In order to better discharge its duties, the Council wishes to be able to make decisions out of session. This should allow the Council to be more flexible in managing its programs and responsive to the needs of the community. The amend the ing . agreement is designed to allow the Council to do just that. Parallel legislation is being introduced in the parliaments of each of the participating States. Plant Variety Rights Actc 1987 Amendments to the Plant Variety Rights Act 1987 are necessary to validate participation in international testing arrangements and international obligations, to clarify the definition of breeding activities and to improve the level o(participation by overseas breeders. Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989 The Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989 is being amended to correct an inconsistency concerning the attachment of the wheat industry fund levy to the Grains Research and Development Corporation. The problem has arisen because the levy comprises both an industry fund and a research component. The proportions of the total levy attributable to each component is determined annually by the Grains Council of Australia, the industry body. As it now stands, the Research and Development Act does not provide the necessary powers to allow the regulations to adequately specify the research component of the levy which is to be paid to the corporation. Other consequential amendments to the Act have also been necessary. Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Power Act 1949 This amendment empowers the Authority to invest surplus funds in specified classes of securities without the require- a first time. ment to obtain prior ministerial approval for each transaction. Wheat Industry Fund Levy Collection Act The Wheat Industry Fund Levy Collection Act 1989 is being amended to provide that the levy on whe-t which is processed by or for a grower for his own commercial use or subsequent delivery will not be payable until after such use or delivery. The Act currently provides for the levy to become payable as a consequence only of the wheat being processed and this was never the intention. Wheat Marketing Act 1989 The main amendment to the Wheat Marketing Act 1989 is to provide for Grains Council of Australia to determine, within the limits of the legislation and . regulations, the management and use the wheat industry fund via an annual business plan. It was the Government's intention that the industry should have control over fund, which is made up from a levy on wheat sales, and this was reflected in legislation. However, the Grains Council's preferred method of control, via a busirowing ness plan, was not available under the as it is now worded. The Australian Board, which manages the fund, has agreed to this approach. The other amendments are a consebuilding their economies and alleviating quence of the establishment of the Grains Research and Development Corporation and the termination of the Wheat Reworks search Trust Fund. None of the proposed amendments have any significant financial impact. I compoverty mend the Bill to the House,and present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. Debate (on motion by Dr Bob adjourned. NA ASSOCIATION (FURTHER PAYMENT) BILL 1990 Bill presented by Dr Blewett, and read Second Reading",91
151,Dr BLEWETT,INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT,"I move: 1989 That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to authorise a contribution by Australia to the Ninth Replenishment of the International Development Association. I wO,uld like to begin by.giving honourable members a brief outline of the Inter- , national Development Association and its activities. The International Development Association, or IDA as it is commonly known, is part of the World Bank group. It was established in 1960. It now has a membership of 138 countries. The IDA prothe vides loans to its poorest member countries for development activities. Traditionally, the terms on which IDA of loans have been made are very favourable. Borrowing countries pay no interest on their loans; repayinent begins only after a period of 10 years and loans are repaid the over a long period of 35 or 40 years. I would like to take a few moments to the speak about the economic environment in which IDA borrowers must operate. Borcountries normally have a per capAct ita gross national product (GNP) below Wheat $US580 per annum-in 1987 dollars. Obviously, therefore, IDA borrowers are among the poorest countries in the world. They face extraordinary difficulties in I poverty at home. There is no doubt that the domestic policies and legal frameof these countries will have a major impact on their development. Nevertheless, the task of tackling world is one that all countries-rich and poor-need to share. Industrial countries like Australia can and should help. Industrial countries can help by working toWoods) wards an open andÂ· competitive international trading system. They can accelerate the transfer of technology to developing countries and contribute to the development of that vital resource-their people. Another important way in which industrial countries can contribute towards the task of overcoming world poverty is by ensuring that aid continues to flow to these poorer countries. Developing countries' need for external resources is greater now than at any other time during the past decade. This is because despite the international debt crisis-indeed, to no small degree because of it-total net resource flows from developed countries to developing nations have fallen dramatically during the 1980s. According to recent data from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development(OECD), total net resource flows from developed to developing countries have fallen by 50 per cent in constant terms from a peak of $US200 billion in 1981 to $US 100 billion recorded in 1987. There has been a modest recovery in flows since 1987, but the increase has been slight. This collapse of net resource flows from rich countries to poor countries was without question one of the major changes on the world economic scene during the 1980s. The change is a historical reversal of the trend during the 1960s and the 1970s when resource flows to, developing countries were rising. Of course, we should never oelude ourselves that aid is the panacea forÂ· the ills of developing countries. For example, total aid from all sources to major developing countries such as India and Indonesia is barely over one per cent of the GNP of these countries. And in China, total overseas aid receipts are Â·.a tiny 0.5 per cent of GNP. The clear implication is that, in some of the world's largest developing countries, the main effort to mobilise resources for development must be carried out at home. Overseas aid can help assist growth in developing countries, but in most cases is not central to it. Nevertheless, this does not mean that the provision of aid is unimportant fOr developing countries. For many of the smallest and poorest developing countries, the provision of official development assistance will remain their main external resource for development for the foreseeable future. Although private flows of investment and credit to these countries have fallen since the early 1980s, the flow of official aid has been maintained. For the larger developing countries such as China, India and Indonesia, the technical assistance and policy dialogue which has been part of the development cooperation process has been invaluable. Against this general background, we come to consider Australia's contribution to the Ninth Replenishment of IDA. Negotiations for IDA-9 concluded in December 1989. Under IDA-9 funding for development projects will be approved over a three-year period to June 1993. The World Bank will call upon donors to make their contributions over a longer period, reflecting the time taken to implement the various projects. Donors have pledged an estimated $US 14. 7 billion in contributions. Australia has pledged $A382.5m, or a 1.99 per cent share of the total. This pledge . represents a decline in real terms of our $A335m contribution to IDA-8. However, with the appreciation of the Australian dollar over the past three years, Australia's share in IDA-9 is marginally higher than in IDA-8. Australia has been a constructive participant in IDA since the Association's inception. For each replenishment, Australia joins other donors to negotiate an overriding policy framework which reflects the changing needs of international development cooperation. IDA-9 was no exception. Australia's requirements with regard to several key issues-poverty alleviation, the regional allocation of the IDA funds, women in development and the environment-coincided with the requirements of several other members. The Executive Board of the World Bank has agreed to administer IDA-9 taking these requirements into account. Let me briefly outline some of them. In speaking of effective development cooperation, we have now come to regard the achievement of economic growth without corresponding poverty alleviation as unbalanced. In its latest annual report, the World Bank identifies its primary mission as supporting improvement in the quality of life for people in its developing member countries. It is true that on a variety of social indicators, some. developing countries are now approaching the standards of the developed world. But this is far from universal. The World Bank has estimated that in 1985 over one billion people in developing countries were living on less than $US370 per capita a year. When one compares that figure to Australia's average per capita income of $USll,700 a year, one sees that the situation of roughly one-fifth of the world's population is very grim indeed. Under IDA-9, the World Bank has been asked to design projects which take a broader view of the development process. The objective is to encourage, where possible, the twin elements of economic growth and poverty alleviation. From Australia's point of view, IDA-9 has the potential to bring considerable benefits to the Asia-Pacific region. In spite of remarkable achievements in poverty reduction in a number of countries in the Asia-Pacific region, it remains the home for over half the world's poor. In IDA-8, up to 50 per cent of funds were earmarked for Sub-Saharan Africa. For IDA9, however, it is recognised that there will need to be increased flexibility in allocating funds based on the criteria of need and performance. Sub-Saharan Africa remains a region where the need for external resources is great. But if there are new demands in the Asia-Pacific region-for example, say Cambodia and Vietnam were to resume borrowing following a successful settlement there-then IDA resources would be found from a reallocation from all regions. Another policy outcome of great importance to our region is recognition of the special position of many small island countries, such as those of the South Pacific. Due to their per capita incomes being above the normal IDA cut-off, they would not normally have access to IDA funds, but their limited creditworthiness means that they are unable to borrow from that other member of the World Bank group, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Under IDA-9, they continue to be eligible for funds. Australia's insistence that the role of women be recognised in the design of projects is also reflected in IDA-9's policy framework. Effective project design needs to take account of the importance of women having access to education and their potential as decision-makers, entrepreneurs and members of the work force. In addition to incorporating sound women-in-development practices into project development, IDA has already shown it is prepared to fund projects which have a major focus on improving the position of women. In 1989-90, for example, IDA approved two education projects, one in Bangladesh and one in Pakistan. These projects are designed to increase the participation of girls in schooling. The Bangladesh project includes a scholarship program for female secondary school children. Environmental considerations will also be integrated into all aspects of IDA's activities. During negotiations, members called for greater consultation on environmental concerns with non-government organisations and with affected groups in developing countries. Members urged that environmental action plans be prepared for all borrowing countries by June 1993 at the latest. In addition, the World Bank has increased the overall level of its environmental reporting. Hopefully, these measures will go a long way towards allaying the concerns of individuals and groups who have been critical of some World Bank activities in the past. I would like to conclude by outlining briefly the payment arrangements for IDA9. In accordance with Australian practice, payment will be made in the form of nonnegotiable, non-interest bearing promissory notes. The promissory notes will contribute to the IDA-9 lending authority for the period 1990-91 to 1992-93. It is expected that the promissory notes will be encashed over a period of eight to 10 years beginning in 1990-91 to meet IDA's disbursements. Funds required for 199091 are already provided for within the global aid allocation so no additional allocation is required. Funds for the future years will be met from within the global aid vote. To date, the World Bank has only provided drawdown estimates through to 1993-94. These estimates, which I have set out in the following table, are subject, to change, as they are dependent upon exchange rates and the actual rate of disbursements by the Association: ESTIMATES OF DRA WDOWNS FOR IDA-9 (amounts in $A million) Year 90/91 91192 92/93 93/94 Next 4 to 6 years 11.9 35.3 57.1 63.8 214.4 The World Bank group remains an important source of aid for developing countries. Its continued effectiveness requires countries such as Australia to be active in their support and constructive in their criticism. I would like to take the opportunity to remind honourable members that the Treasurer now reports annually to the Parliament on Australia's participation in the World Bank group. His report also provides a general assessment of the effectiveness of each organisation affiliated with the World Bank, including IDA. This Bill provides us with an opportunity to demonstrate our continuing support for IDA and for the development needs of the poor in developing countries. ' I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Downer) adjourned. NA SAFETY (COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYMENT) BILL 1990 Bill presented by Mr Willis, and read a first time. Second Reading",93
152,Mr WILLIS,OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The Bill seeks to establish a statutory framework to secure the health and safety of Commonwealth Government employees while at work. In doing so, it will provide Commonwealth Government employees with the protection of modern occupational health and safety (OHS) legislation similar to that which is presently enjoyed by both public and private sector employees in most States. The incidence of occupational death, injury and disease in Australia, including in Commonwealth Government employment, is unacceptably high. On average, each week over 3,000 workers experience a compensable work injury resulting in a period off work of one week or more. Apart from the human suffering involved, occupational injury and disease results in massive costs to Australian industry and the community through the need to provide medical and rehabilitation services, retraining and workers compensation schemes. There is also a huge cost through lost production. Working time lost in Australia as a result of occupational injury and disease has been estimated at around 10 times that lost through industrial disputes. It is difficult to determine a precise estimate of the total costs involved. On the basis of the Australian national accounts figures the Australian Bureau of Statistics estimated the cost of workers compensation claims in 1989-90 was $4.8 billion. This direct cost alone represents 1.3 per cent of Australia's non-farm gross dome,stic product. If all the associated indirect costs such as lost production and retraining were included, this figure would be much higher. At a time when Australia faces considerable economic difficulties and is striving to improve its international competitiveness by improving productivity and holding down costs, this is a cost which cannot be ignored. Every effort must be made to reduce it. It follows that the reduction of occupational injury and disease should be seen as an integral part of efforts to improve Australia's performance through the Government's micro-economic reform program, including workplace reform through award restructuring. It is essential that consideration be given to improvements in occupational health and safety, when changes in job design and work patterns associated with award restructuring are being developed. These are the reasons which make improvements in occupational health and safety essential. Of course, this Government's commitment to improved occupational health and safety is not new. It is contained in the Australian Labor Party's platform and was included as a key factor in the non-wage element of the accord. That commitment arose because it has been known for many years that Australia has a relatively poor OHS record. In 1983 the Government commenced negotiations with the States, unions, employers and OHS professional- about the development of a national approach to occupational health and safety. In 1985 we established the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission (NOHSC). The fundamental aims of the Commission are to rectify the consequences of the previous fragmented and piecemeal approach to occupational health and safety and to provide a national focus for the development and application of uniform OHS standards and strategies. The Commission is thereby facilitating the development of a uniform approach to OHS across Australia and the most effective use of scarce OHS resources. This will avoid the duplication of effort which we as a nation can no longer afford. An important element of the Government's overall OHS strategy is the development of legislation for the protection of its own employees. Unlike other workers in Australia, Commonwealth employees are not covered by comprehensive occupational health and safety legislation. In 1983, this Government commenced extensive consultations on the content of OHS legislation to cover the area of Commonwealth responsibility. An important development which coincided with consultations on this legislation was an extensive review of compensation and rehabilitation arrangements for Commonwealth employees. The Commonwealth's expenditure on workers compensation in 1989-90 was $240m. Our compensation costs had been rising significantly for a number of years. The problem had to be tackled not only to reduce costs but to ensure that Commonwealth employees were protected from occupational death, injury and disease, and that injured workers were assisted to achieve a prompt return to work by effective rehabilitation and adequate and timely support, treatment and financial assistance. The Government has created an integrated approach to prevention, compensation and rehabilitation. A progressive compensation and rehabilitation system was introduced under the Commonwealth Employees Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 and is administered by the Commission for the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation of Commonwealth Employees, otherwise known as Comcare. It is designed to minimise the human and financial costs of work related injury and disease while at the same time providing adequate compensation and support for long term incapacitated employees. Those reforms are complemented by this Bill. It aims to provide mechanisms for reducing occupational injury and disease that give rise to these unacceptable human and economic costs. During the extensive consultation processes and the development of the resulting legislation, the Government was anxious to ensure that worthwhile improvements in OHS were not delayed unnecessarily. Accordingly, after careful consideration of the direction of consultations and the likely content of the resulting legislation, - the Government agreed to the implementation of interim OHS agreements between the management of individual public sector bodies and relevant unions. These agreements cover the detailed OHS arrangements to apply in individual Com-. monwealth bodies. It is not intended that this legislation override these arrangements except where any provisions of those agreements are contrary to the Act. Mr Deputy Speaker, I will now describe some of the major features of the Bill. The Bill is a comprehensive piece of legislation. A key aspect of the Bill is the emphasis it places on direct involvement by employers and employees in workplace OHS. Accordingly, it requires Commonwealth employers and employees in each workplace to take greater responsibility for the management of health and safety in that workplace. In this way it is consistent with the modern co-regulatory approach already adopted in most States of Australia and the Australian Capital Territory as well as a number of overseas countries. The legislation provides for regulations and codes of practice to be developed to cover specific problems. At the same time it imposes a: duty of care on employers and employees, as well as manufacturers and suppliers of plant and substances, to take all reasonably practicable steps to ensure a safe and healthy work environment. The Bill provides a framework for employers and employees to cooperate and consult in addressing health and safety matters in the workplace through the establishment of designated work groups and health and safety committees, and the selection of health and safety representatives. The legislation will be administered by Comcare, with a small core of permanent staff providing an advisory and investigation service. The service will assist monwealth agencies in complying with the Act, provide technical advice and have the power to issue improvement and prohibition notices and other orders and directions. In addition to the expertise of its own employees, Comcare will be able to draw on outside experts, including State and Territory government occupational health and safety inspectors, to provide advice and assistance on particular problems. The Bill covers the employees of Commonwealth departments, statutory authorities, government business enterprises and companies. Commonwealth employees will be covered in Australia or overseas, although not all provisions will apply overseas. The Bill covers persons employed by the Commonwealth under a law of the Commonwealth and of a Territory or under a contract of service or apprenticeship. We have ensured that the legislation will not prejudice Australia's national se-. curity or its defence. It provides arrangements which enable particular provisions to be declared not to apply or to apply in a modified form, in relation to specified matters concerning national security and specified members of the Australian Defence Force. The legislation also provides for particular provisions to be declared not to apply in relation to certain covert or dangerous operations of the Australian Federal Police. In addition, where the application of the Bill to a person who exercises a power or function under a law of the Commonwealth or a State or Territory would prevent the proper exercise of that power or function, regulations may be made excluding the Bill, or particular provisions of the Bill, from applying to that person. Standards An important aspect of the Bill in terms of the Government's commitment to encouraging a uniform national approach to occupational health and safety is that it provides for the adoption of standards and codes of practice which have been declared by the National Occupational Com- Health and Safety Commission. Where they exist, and are capable of relating to Commonwealth employment, these standards and codes will be adopted within the Commonwealth employment sector in all States and Territories. Where there are no NOHSC standards or codes the Commonwealth will adopt the existing State or Territory standard,pending review of its appropriateness and applicability to the Commonwealth sector. There will, of course, be consultation with State and Territory authorities in these matters. I am hopeful that the Commonwealth's intention to adopt NOHSC standards for its own employment area within all State and Territory jurisdictions will provide further encouragement to States and Territories to implement NOHSC standards. I have mentioned earlier that the Bill establishes workplace arrangements which are an integral part of the concept of coregulation, and provide the framework for ensuring the participation of employees in occupational health and safety matters, and cooperation and consultation beprovisions. tween employees and employers. I do not intend to describe these rangements in detail. The mechanisms for their establishment, and their various functions, are listed in the Bill. However it is important to note a number of aspects in relation to the powers of the quest. health and safety representative. He or she has the power to issue a provisional improvement notice requiring the employer to take corrective action to stop or to avoid a breach of the legislation. In addition, in an emergency, where the repRelations resentative believes there is an immediate threat to health and safety, the representative may order a cessation of work, but only when a supervisor cannot be located. If a supervisor is located, the supervisor has the right to decide whether work should cease. This approach has been adopted in most of the existing occupaManufacturers tional health and safety agreements in Commonwealth agencies but has rarely, ever, been used. A health and safety representative misuses his or her powers is liable to disqualified by Comcare from holding such a position for up to five years. Government will closely monitor the acsuch tivities of health and safety representanary tives and take whatever action is necessary' to ensure there is no abuse of their power. . The Bill provides for an advisory funchon for Com care which will be most important in assisting employers, employees and contractors with their obligations der the legislation and in dealing with occupational health and safety problems. Use of the advisory facility may be a first step in an investigation process. I have legislation. already mentioned that the legislation enables Comcare to refer requests for advice to experts outside the Commission. Investigations While the legislation's co-regulatory proach, which I have outlined here, emregard phasises cooperation in securing health aJ?-d safety in the workplace, it is recogconsistent nIsed that there needs to be effective forcement of standards. The Bill provides investigators with comprehensive powers to enable them adequately to enforce its These include powers of entry, and powers to issue prohibition and imarprovement notices to remove threats to health and safety or to stop or prevent breaches of the legislation. An inspector ent-ring.a workplace is required to carry an Idenhty card and produce it upon reAppeals The Bill provides for appeals against the decisions of investigators. In each case the appeal is to the Australian Industriai Commission, referred to in the Bill as the 'reviewing authority'. Sanctions The Bill provides, where a breach of the legislation occurs, that financial penalties can be imposed on government business enterprises, or their employees. and suppliers will also be liable to prosecution and fines for conif travening the legislation. Commonwealth departments and auwho thorities which are not government busibe ness enterprises may be the subject of a report to Parliament if found to be in The contravention of the Act. Employees of agencies may be subject to discipliaction under the Public Service Act or other terms and conditions applying to non-Australian Public Service personnel. The Bill is not intended to exclude the application of the criminal law in appropriate cases. Instead, it is intended that unthe criminal law of the States will continue to apply to Commonwealth employees to the extent that those laws are capable of concurrent operation with this It is appropriate that I say something about the level of pecuniary penalties which this Bill imposes upon government business enterprises and individuals who c.ontravene the legislation. Those penalaphes have been set at levels which have to the range of penalty levels in similar State legislation. This is again with the policy of striving for engreater consistency in occupational health and safety legislation, standards and strategies and will ensure that persons who breach the Commonwealth legislation are penalised in similar manner to persons who breach equivalent State laws. Financial Impact The cost of implementing the proposals included in the Bill will be offset by ings already being achieved by Comcare through the rehabilitation of long term compensation claimants and by a reduction in accidents in the workplace. Five additional staff resources will be required by Comcare in the first two years of operation and 10 by the third year. This will involve a salary cost of $O.4m by the third full year of operation. Contract staff will be used to supplement the minimal permanent resources, at an estimated additional cost of $0.5m in the first year, decreasing to $0.2m by year three. There will also be some additional expenditure for essential operational costs. The total cost during the first three full years of operation will be between $1.1 m and $1.4m per annum. The legislation will commence operation six months from the date of proclamation of the Act and, to facilitate this, 'start-up' costs of order of $0.3m will be incurred during the six months leading up to the commencement date. In addition, individual agencies may cur additional expenditure to implement the workplace arrangements. The net additional cost attributable to this activity cannot be precisely estimated due to the wide variety of existing occupational health and safety arrangements currently in place in various Commonwealth agencies and the offsets and savings which will be associated with revised arrangements. The provision of a safe and healthy working environment and the increased emphasis on cooperation to achieve such an environment is expected to reduce the incidence of accidents and injuries for which the Commonwealth would be liable. Implementation of the provisions of the Bill should, therefore, result in reduced Commonwealth expenditure on compensation and associated costs such as unnecessary retraining, lost time and sick leave. This Bill contains important reforms which, together with the compensation and rehabilitation arrangements already in place, will ensure that Commonwealth employees receive the protection at work to which they are entitled.

153,Mr CREAN,SALES TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"Hotham-Minister for Science and Technology and Minister Assisting the Treasurer) (4.40)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. Mr Deputy Speaker, you will recall that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) recently announced in the Budget that the Government intended to provide relief from sales tax on computers for use by manufacturers and persons who process goods on the behalf of manufacturers. The Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No.3) will give effect to this measure. The Government is concerned about the impact of sales tax inon business inputs, and it extended some exemptions to subcontractors in the 198990 Budget. The purpose of this Bill is to provide further tax relief on business inputs incurred by manufacturers in the course of producing goods. Under the present aids to manufacture provisions of the sales tax law, manufacturers are able to purchase, free of tax, computers for use directly in the manufacturing process. The measure recognises the broader range of activities that computers now perform in manufacturing than are presently covered by the aids to manufacture provisions. This Bill reflects that provision and introduces separate exemptions for computers used by manufacturers to enhance the efficiency of the manufacturing process. There are four new situations where exemption will apply to computers used by manufacturers and other persons who process goods on behalf of manufacturers. The first relates to the technical design and engineering of goods. Efficient man- . ufacture starts with efficient design, and computers used by manufacturers to design goods for manufacture will now be exempt. The second concerns productionrelated activities. Considerable efficiency gains can be made by the timely scheduling of production and computers to serve an important role in this process. An example of such a system is the just-in-time ordering system which has been widely adopted by motor vehicle Â·manufacturers. Where computers are used by manufacturers to schedule, monitor or control the production of goods, they will now qualify for exemption. The third area relates to the finalising of print for the production of printed matter. Printing is an area where computer technology has had a considerable impact in improving efficiency, and this Bill will ensure exemption for computers for use by printers and others in finalising text or graphics for printing. Exemption will also extend to computers for use by typesetters and subeditors in the newspaper industry. The final area embraces computers which may have a number of different uses in the manufacturing process. - omputers may be used. partly as an aid to manufacture, and partly in design or production scheduling or the finalising of print. To ensure that the exemption applies to computers that have a variety of manufacturing uses, the Bill will allow manufacturers to combine the various exempt uses to reach the level of use required to obtain exemption. These new exemptions will also extend to subcontractors who are engaged by manufacturers to carry out the exempt activities on their behalf. The measure will commence to operate from 19 October 1990, and this Bill will assist Australian manufacturers to be more competitive in the international environment. The estimated cost of providing exemption for this computer equipment is $44m in 199091 and $70m in 1991-92. The Government intends to examine further options to relieve the impact of sales tax on business inputs in the sales tax simplification review announced by the Treasurer in this year's Budget. I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill, and I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr MCGauran) adjourned. .

154,Mr LINDSAY,NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY," Mr Deputy Speaker, on behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, I present the report of the Committee entitled Operation Ark, incorporating a dissenting report. Ordered that the report be printed.",101
155,Mr LINDSAY,NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY,I ask leave of the House to make a short statement in connection with the report. Leave granted.,101
156,Mr LINDSAY,NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY,"Mr Deputy Speaker, before addressing the content of the report, I need to state that the presentation of the report has placed me in a most difficult position. Last night at 7.24 p.m., Senator Vanstone tabled in the Senate a report that had been agreed to by the Committee. Attached to the report was a document described as a 'qualifying statement' signed by four members of the Committee. To all intents and purposes, this qualifying statement is a dissenting report. I have no difficulty with the concept of members of committees adding protests or dissents to committee reports. Indeed, standing order 343 of the House permits this. My problem, however, is with the disclosure of in camera evidence--:-without the authority of the Committee-in a dissenting report. This question has been considered by members and senators in recent years. The Standing Orders are silent on the matter, but the Procedure Committee of this House has twice reported its view that a prohibition should be placed on the disclosure in dissenting reports of in camera evidence, unless the committee involved authorises it. In its report of 2 May 1989, the Procedure Committee of the Senate dealt with this issue. It was not able to agree on where the balance should be struck between the various considerations. It did, however, suggest certain guidelines be followed by senators who wished to refer in a dissenting report to evidence taken in camera. It recommended inter alia: - the Senator should advise the Committee the evidence concerned and all reasonable forts should be made by the Committee reach agreement on the disclosure of the evidence for this purpose; and - witnesses involved should, if practicable, informed of the proposed disclosure and reasonable opportunity to object. - and consideration should be given to disclosing Crime the evidence in such a way as to conceal identity of persons who gave evidence are referred to in the evidence. Neither of these recommendations was followed in the present case. My concerns as to the disclosure of camera evidence reflect a strongly held view that committees which take evidence in camera assume a heavy responsibility to respect the confidentiality of material trafficking. received and, when any question of disclosure arises, to give it the most careful consideration as a committee and in cordance with established procedures. Going to the particular position of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, however, my concerns-far destroying from being theoretical-assume a degree of practical significance that I cannot overestimate. The Committee has a very heavy responsibility in discharging its work in relation to the National Crime is associated with an organisation where confidentiality, indeed secrecy, is lutely essential in respect of many matAdelaide ters. The Committee relies on the saying frankness of those who appear to assist and give evidence. Those who do so should, I believe, be entitled to rely upon the Committee not to disclose in ordinary circumstances material received on a confidential basis. My concerns are that, if such material can be disclosed by one member of the Committee in a dissenting report without the authority of a majority of members, the willingness of those who assist the Committee in providing information will be lost-and, frankly, one can understand this. I have presented the report and its attachment to the House because they were presented together in the Senate last night, and there would have been no purpose in separating the documents now. Nevertheof less, I reiterate my great concern at the efinclusion of in camera evidence in what to is effectively a dissenting report. I will now address the content of the be report which draws to the attention of the given Parliament the details, as far as they are known to the Committee, of our National Authority operation, codenamed the 'Operation Ark'. The Committee became or who aware of a National Crime Authority operation in Sbuth Australia codenamed Operation Ark on 12 December 1989. On that date, the 7.30 Report broadcast an item about Operation Ark which was said into have arisen from the conduct of the South Australian police in February 1989 of Operation Noah-the annual phone-in operation seeking information about drug The 7.30 Report claimed that a report achad been prepared by the National Crime Authority which had dealt with allegations of the involvement of police officers in the drug trade and allegations of police prosecution briefs in return for cash payments. A claim was also made that, while the report was completed just before former Chairman Mr Justice Donald Stewart had retired in June 1989, it had not been forwarded to the South AusAuthority. It tralian Government. Mr Sumner, the South Australian Atabsotorney-General, was quoted in the Advertiser of 25 January 1990 as that the document was not a report from 'the present National Crime Authority administration' and that it did not have the support of 'the present National Crime Authority'. A report entitled National Crime Authority South Australian Reference No. 2 First Report was sent to the inter-governmental committee pursuant to subsection 59(4) of the National Crime Authority Act 1984 on 21 December 1989. Mr Le Grand had dissented to this report. Mr Sumner publicly released the National Crime Authority's report and the Government's response on 25 January 1990. The Committee examined the background to Operation Ark and found that it arose out of the failure to notify the proper authorities, the Commissioner of Police in particular, of the fact that 13 allegations concerning police involvement in, or protection of, drug trafficking had been received during the 1989 Operation Noah in South Australia. Because of the sensitive nature of the findings and recommendations of the 'proposed report' - that is, the Stewart port-the Committee believed that it was incumbent on it to determine the merits of the competing claims of Mr Faris and Mr Justice Stewart in respect of the status of the report. In this respect the Committee has been advised that contrary to the claims of Mr Justice Stewart that the proposed report was 'duly authorised for transmittal to the South Australian Government' there is no record of a minuted meeting of the Authority as constituted prior to 1 July 1989 at which the draft report was adopted as the report of the Authority for transmittal to the South Australian Government. The Authority is not a corporate body. Rather, it comprises the Chairman and members of the Authority, usually two or three in number, meeting in a minuted meeting. Mr Dempsey of the National Crime Authority stressed to the Committee that the actions of the Authority were based on propriety, not impropriety. He stated that the problem that arose was entirely internal to the National Crime Authority and that there had been no participation by, or consultation with, either the South Australian Governmep- or South Australian police prior to the delivthrown ery of the Authority's report on 21 December 1989. There had therefore been no 'suppression' of an 'original Ark report'. The Committee also sought to determine whether the time and effort spent in resolving this dispute had contributed positively to the good government of South Australia, whose taxpayers were funding the National Crime Authority's South Australian operations. The Committee learned that the South Australian Goveniment had accepted the thrust of the National Crime Authority's recommendations and with the full agreement and support of the Commissioner of Police took immediate action to implement the National Crime Authority's proposals for administrative reform. Though some members of the Committee dissent from the majority opinion, it was the Committee's opinion-and it is my opinion-that the Committee has exre- amined thoroughly evidence before it and that the matter is now closed. Combating organised crime is an extremely important role. It is a task fraught with difficulty and involving complex issues. Compounding this difficulty is the fact that the work of the Authority is prone to sensationalisation by the media and to ill informed comment. It is now time for the Authority, led by a new Chairman, to be encouraged to pursue its new directions without undue distractions. The Committee will further seek to assist this process by continuing its duties pursuant to the Act. I have referred to the Adelaide member, Mr Dempsey, in my remarks on the report. I wish to make these observations about Mr Dempsey in the context of recent media reports. Gerald Dempsey first joined the National Crime Authority in March 1989 as counsel assisting in the Sydney office. In August 1989 he became counsel assisting in the Authority's national office. He was appointed the Adelaide member of the Authority on 19 February 1990 for a period of 12 months. Mr Dempsey took office in Adelaide at a difficult time. In April 1990 a bomb was at his car when it was parked in the driveway of his house in Adelaide. More recently, Mr Dempsey has been wrongly accused under parliamentary privilege in South Australia of alleging that the bomb was thrown by Commander Mengler, formerly the Authority's chief investigator in South Australia. The Authority has issued a ,press statement denying that Mr Dempsey made such allegations. The suggestion that Commander Mengler threw the bomb has, of course, been shown to be absurd, as he was in Melbourne at the time. Mr Dempsey has rendered outstanding service to the Authority and through it to the Australian community over the last 18 months. It is a matter of regret that he has been laid low by this illness. I commend the report to the House.",101
157,Mr FILING,NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY,"by leave-In rising to speak to the tabling of the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority on Operation Ark I wish to bring to the attention of the House the qualifying statement to the report that has already been canvassed by the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay). The signatories to that qualifying statement are me, Senators Vanstone and Crichton-Browne and the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr MCGauran). Firstly, I would like to look at the introduction to the qualifying statement which makes the reasons for its inclusion in the report perfectly clear. The signatories introduce the qualifying statement as follows: The Committee report does not refer to a number of matters raised in this qualifying statement. We believe the matters raised herein will enable the Parliament to have a better understanding of the facts known to the Committee and consequently the controversy surrounding Operation Ark in South Australia. We are not satisfied that the Committee is in a position to make final conclusions as to the events surrounding the above-mentioned matter without interviewing further witnesses and examining of the totality of evidence obtained. The Committee's decision not to pursue this matter to a final report stage and the subsequent ruling out of order of a motion to call certain other witnesses, means that cross-checking of the evidence available is impossible, as is the resolution of the many questions the material before the Committee raises. The writers of this qualifying statement have not discussed all the evidence and all the issues which would have been canvassed had the Committee proceeded to the final report stage. This is in keeping with the Committee's resolution to report on the current state of knowledge of the matter of Operation Ark rather than proceeding to the stage of preparing a comprehensive report. The conclusions drawn by the writers of the qualifying statement to the report of the Joint Committee are as follows: In the opinion of the writers, the Committee's decision not to take further evidence relating to Operation Ark has resulted in members of the Committee being unable to make a proper assessment of the impact of the internal tension and conflict caused by the Operation Ark Report controversy on the capacity of the NCA to effectively fulfil the duties and functions during the relevant period. In the writer's opinion, the internal conflict and tension within the NCA and its potential impact on the Authority's capacity to effectively fulfil its duties and functions is relevant to the statutory obligations of the Committee. Frank discussion between the NCA and the Com, mittee at an earlier stage may have assisted the Committee's considerations. The apparent failure of the Authority to manage the internal conflict and tension arising from the Operation Ark Report and the impact of this on the Authority's capacity to fulfil its duties and functions is in our opinion relevant to the current evaluation of the NCA being conducted by the Committee and should be considered further in the course of the evaluation. When I was a young constable in the Western Australian police force an old sergeant once said to me, 'Son, if you're ever in doubt about your actions, don't hesitate to go back to the statutes'. I say that because in participating in the statement. I have reflected on what my function is as a member of the Joint Committee and what my obligations are to the Parliament. Let us look at the enabling legislation, the National Crime Authority Act, and the duties and obligations provided for the parliamentary watchdog over the National Crime Authority-the duties of the Joint Committee-that are described in section 55(1) (a) of the Act, which says: The duties of the Committee are(a) to monitor and to review the performance by the Authority of its functions; Subsection (b) requires the Joint Commitcourse, tee: (b) to report to both Houses of the Parliawas ment, with such comments as it thinks fit upon any matter appertaining to thAuthority or connected with the performance of its functions to which, in the opinion of the Committee, the attention of Parliament should be directed; It does qualify the authority of the Joint Committee in subsection (2) which states: Nothing in this Part authorizes the Committee(a) to investigate a matter relating to a relevant criminal activity; or (b) - o recoI.1sider the fin,dings ?f the Authority In relatIOn to a partIcular Investigation, I take my obligations to the Parliament very seriously indeed, In saying that I make no reflection on any other member of the Committee, and I have a great deal of respect for the experience of the ChairOperation man and of the other members, I must say that this qualifying statement gives me no joy whatsoever; nonetheless, I have a duty to the Parliament. I wish to touch briefly on the question of privilege and the use of in camera senting statement. evidence which has been raised by the honourable member for Herbert. The Joint Committee on the National Crime Authtake ority operates under Senate rules, There is no positive prohibition in the Senate r-les oJ? in camera evidence being used in dIssentmg reports to the Parliament. The Senate Procedure Committee and the Senate have considered the matter and t-e Senate has not imposed any prohibitIon on the use of in camera evidence in dissenting reports other than that it should be used in a dissenting report to the Parliament. The procedural situation is that in era evidence can be quoted to support the dissenting report and its use must support the substance of the report. I also point out that none of the evidence raised in t-e dissenting statement relates to operatIonal matters of the National Crime Authority. It is germane to the dissenting statement that Parliament must have the opportunity to appreciate the extent to which this matter has or has not been considered by the Joint Committe'e. Of a resolution has been canvassed by the honourable member for Herbert: it a resolution of the Committee that it was to report on the current state of knowledge as to the Operation Ark report. It is manifestly obvious to readers that the the points in the dissenting statement relate to the administration of the National Crime Authority ilnd not to operational matters. It is also obvious that the Committee's task to report on the current knowledge on the Operation Ark report was under its statutory obligations to the Parliament and to the National Crime Authority Act. The qualifying report raises serious concerns regarding tension and conflict within the National Crime Authority and our great concern is how much those tensions and conflicts that were raised by the Ark situation or dispute have affected the operational running of the National Crime Authority and its relevant efficiency. The point is that in the end we are not in a position to make a judgment at all; and that, hence, is the reason for the concerns of the signatories to the disI mentioned earlier in my speech that I my duty to the Parliament as a mem-er of the Joint Committee very seriously mdeed. My reason for signing that dissenting statement is as a consequence of that serious appreciation of my duty as a member of the Joint Committee to fulfil the statutory obligations of the Committee. It is clear that the matters raised by the Operation Ark report have not been satis-actorily resolved. By adding the dissentmg statement to the report of the Joint camCommittee on the Operation Ark report, we are signifying to Parliament that there should be an opportunity to further canvass information and evidence in order satisfactorily to resolve the great problems associated with the Operation Ark report and the National Crime Authority.",104
158,Mr MELHAM,NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY,"by leaveWhat happened last night in the Senate under the cover of darkness was a cheap, grubby, political point scoring exercise on the part of the Opposition. I regret that I cannot go into the substance of the report that was. tabled last night and the qualifying report that went with it becaus- of the restrictions of time. But some pomts need to be made. . The Chairman of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority was unaware that the tabling was to take place last night or, indeed, that there was a qualifying statement. I want to put it on record that I have no-hÂ­ ing against minority reports or dissentmg reports, but I object quite s.trongly to senting reports that. reveal m camera e-l1dence, private mmutes of the !omt Committee, and minutes of the NatIOnal Crime Authority without any reference to the Joint Committee. That is the test of the genuineness of this so-called minority report, this qualifying report, done in the cover of darkness without reference to Government members of the Committee. It has compromised the Joint Committee and every committee of the Parliament-of the House of Representatives and of the Senate-on the taking of in camera evidence because no-one is safe. No-one who gives evidence of a confidential nature to any committee of this Parliament is safe any more if this precedent is accepted, if under the cover of darkness, without reference to the Committee, a minority report detailing in camera evidence can be tabled. It was done without the knowledge of the majority of Government members of the Committee. There is a procedure that has been detailed in terms of disclosing in camera evidence. It has been discussed by the Senate Procedure Committee. People who give in camera evidence to the Committee are at least warned that their evidence could be publicised. No such warning was given in this instance. This has jeopardised every committee of the Parliament because if this precedent is accepted no-one can come forward with confidenc- and give confidential evidence. This Parliamentary Joint Committee is at the moment evaluating the National Crime Authority. How can we now do a proper evaluation of the National Crime Authority when people who come before us can have their in camera evidence tabled without reference to the Committee? Not one attempt was made to seek Committee approval to use that in camera evidence, to use the private minutes of the Committee or to use the minutes of the National Crime Authority. Why not, if it was needed for the qualifying report? The first I knew of it was when I came back to my office after it was tabled in the Senate-which was, in my view, a di-Â­ gross discourtesy to other members of the Committee. It was underhanded; it was deceitful; it was cheap political point scoring at a time when the National Crime Authority has a new Chairman, Justice Phillips, who is universally regarded as breathing new life into the National Crime Authority, who is attempting to cooperate with the Committee, who has been applauded by the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), and who has gone out of his way, in the short time that he has been there, to cooperate with the Parliamentary Joint Committee and to set up information flows and procedures. All that has gone out of the window. What was done last night was disgraceful.",105
159,Mr MCGAURAN,NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY,"by leave-Unless things radically alter in the remaining two months of this calendar year, we can write off 1990 so far as the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority is concerned. It has been a most unproductive year; the disagreements that have surfaced in the chamber today are the culmination of a series of events. It has been an extremely difficult year for the Committee, arising out of the difficulties suffered by the National Crime Authority itself. I was persuaded for a long while by the view expressed by the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay), the Chairman of the Committee, that Operation Ark should be put behind us. We have a new Attorney-General (Mr Duffy), a new Chairman of the National Crime Authority and a new Chairman of the Parliamentary Committee; indeed, the Parliamentary Committee itself bears little resemblance to predecessor from the last Parliament that the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) and I are the only remainin ing members of the Committee. But I do not agree now that the matter can be closed, as the honourable member for Lindsay would wish, until the princifrom pals involved in all of the controversy surrounding Operation Ark are interavailable viewed by the Committee. I say that cause of events that have occurred South Australia and have surfaced pubstantiates licly, at least to a certain extent. I refer the internal conflict, so very obvious, within the National Crime Authority itera evidence. self, and the allegations that have been raised in recent days-and, thankfully, thoroughly discredited. But they come after a series of events that were largely the responsibility of the previous ComAustralia mittee: Operation Ark itself; the sudden resignation of the then Chairman of the Authority, Mr Faris; the delay in finding a replacement; and the obvious lack of success of the National Crime Authority in South Australia-all of which have had a cumulative effect. I always thought that Operation Ark boiled down to a fundamental disagreevery ment between two sets of very successful, very senior and very determined lawyers: that is, the previous Authority, which wanted, on all the evidence available to us, the release of Justice Stewart's report; and the succeeding Authority, headed Mr Faris, which wanted it altered to substantial degree. But I now believe we will never get to the bottom of the story in South Australia until we examine more closely Operation Ark because I am convinced that Operation Ark is the key to unravelling the imbroglio that the tional Crime Authority's operation in South Australia has, sadly, become. For that reason, I believe that we not put Operation Ark behind us. The principals have to be interviewed. Morespeculation, over, I beli-ve. that the qualifying statesubstantiated. ment sets out very convincing reasons why that is so, and would be welcomed cerNational tainly at least by the previous Authority members. Indeed, I urge members to read its very carefully not just the majority report in but also the qualifying statement. I turn now very briefly to the matter of camera evidence, which the honourable . member for Moore (Mr Filing) has ""dealt with, and simply say that advice on the use of in camera evidence was sought Mr Harry Evans, Clerk of the Senate. His advice was, in essence-it is freely to honourable members should bethey wish to obtain it from me or Mr in Evans-that, if in camera evidence suba point made in a dissenting to report rather than stands alone as an attachment, it is a valid use of that in camMoreover, I impress upon honourable members the fact that the in camera evidence relates only to the administration of the National Crime Authority in South and not in any way to operational matters. In no sense have the operational capabilities of the National Crime Authority been compromised. Leaving aside the opinion of the Clerk of the Senate, signatories to the qualifying statement did have to wrestle with the propriety of the inclusion of in camera evidence. The emotive, intemperate and unwise contribution by the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) only politicises this matter. I do not want to take up the almost irresistible temptation to respond in kind; I simply say that there was a motion in the Committee last week by that Operation Ark would be tabled. As a is revealed in the minutes, Senator Vanthat stone, Deputy Chairman of the Committee, signalled her intention to attach a qualifying statement. I certainly say that for me, and I suspect for the other signatories to the qualifying statement, it was Naan immensely difficult decision to make about whether to include in camera evidence. But we believed that the qualifying canstatement would make little sense, and could even have given rise to wrongful if the points made were not I do not believe for a moment that the Crime Authority has been weakened or compromised. As with the Chairman, the honourable member for Herbert, I have a deep and abiding commitment to the National Crime Authority; indeed, I stand alone as one of the members of the inaugural Committee back in 1984 and have seen it through some good and some bad times. This is certainly the worse time. I can remember on the Committee. But the hope of the side, to use a colloquialism, is Justice Phillips in his new appointment as Chairman of the National Crime Authority. So far as the Committee is concerned, I do not believe that Operation Ark can be put to one side so neatly. It is symptomatic of the failures of the National Crime Authority in South Australia, and it is well past the due time that our Committee was able to obtain some answers as to just what has happened in South Australia. As of this moment I am no wiser than I was 12 months ago about any of the successes or failures of Operation Ark in South Australia-and that, quite frankly, places me in an untenable position. For that reason, I was a signatory to the qualifying statement. NA",106

Copies of the report are being circulated to honourable members in the chamber. Report-by leave-adopted. NA (RATES AND PROVISIONAL TAX) Bill returned from the Senate with an amendment. Ordered that the amendment be taken into consideration in Committee of the Whole House forthwith. In Committee Consideration of Senate's amendment. Senate's amendmentClause 7, page 2, definition of 'provisional tax uplift factor', lines 28 to 32, omit the definition, substitute the following definition: ""'provisional tax uplift factor', in relation year of income, means, until the Parliament otherwise provides, 10%;'.",108
161,Mr CREAN,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Hotham-Minister for - cience and Technology and Minister Assisting the Treasurer) (5.20)-I move: That the amendment be agreed to. The Senate has amended the Taxation Laws Amendment (Rates and Provisional Tax) Bill by changing the definition of the term in clause 7, 'provisional tax uplift factor'. The definition is part of the provisions necessary for the calculation of the provisional tax payable by a taxpayer in respect of a year of income. It provides the factor by which taxable income of a preceding year is to be increased in calculating provisional tax payable in respect of a year of income. The Government had sought to set the factor for 1991-92 and subsequent years at 10 per cent or such other amount as is declared by regulation in the range of zero to 12 per cent. The Senate has amended the definition so that the factor for those years will be 10 per cent until the Parliament otherwise provides-that is, the factor for a year of income will be 10 per cent unless Parliament passes an amendment setting another percentage for the relevant year. The level of the uplift factor is always decided in a budgetary context, and the Government's main reason for seeking to use the regulation-making power was so that any factor other than 10 per cent could be put in place quickly after the Budget. In that process, we were willing to put a cap of 12 per cent on any new factor. BILL 1990 Whilst the Government holds the view that the use of the regulation-making power is a suitable method of setting the uplift factor in subsequent years, it supported the amendment in the Senate as it does not want to delay the passage of the Bill containing the provisions for calculating provisional tax. Honourable members will remember what happened last year when the Bill containing the provisional tax calculation provisions became embroiled in the parliamentary process for other reasons. to a Eventually, the Bill lapsed, and the Government does not want any repeat of the confusion caused to taxpayers. I urge this House to accept the amendment passed by the Senate.",108
162,Mr ROCHER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"This amendment to the Taxation Laws Amendment (Rates and Provisional Tax) Bill goes some way to meeting an amendment which we moved in this House but which was rejected by the Government a week or so ago. Our aim then was to retain the traditional and constitutional duty of the Parliament to oversee any tax measure and to debate and agree to any increase-or decrease, for that matterin the levels of taxation in any category. As the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean) has pointed out, this particular provision applies to the uplift factor on provisional income tax payers. In the Government's first attempt at the Bill, it had sought to give itself discretion in years subsequent to this financial year. We would not readily agree to the right, by regulation, to increase the tax by up to 2 per cent, for reasons we gave at the time. We do not intend to go over them at great length. The second aim of our amendment was to remove any discretion available to the Government on a tax measure. The Senate amendment, although it is in a different form, satisfies half of the concerns that we expressed then-that is, it removes discretion to the Government, by regulation, to increase the uplift factor from in excess of the 10 per cent which it will provide this year. The amendment then goes on, though, to do something that has not been the case-that is, to stipulate that 10 per cent shall be the uplift factor automatically applied in subsequent years unless the Government decides otherwise. We have had cause to criticise the Government for a 10 per cent increase being levied this year in the light of the fact that the estimates of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) for inflation are about 6.S per cent. If one was arriving at a figure for these purposes, one would have thought that the uplift factor should have been a percentage more in line with the expected rate of inflation. But that is not to be so. So the uplift factor is there, and will be there, until the Government legislates otherwise, but now the Parliament will be at the disadvantage of not having the 'opportunity to debate it each year along with other measures that the Government has to decide in a budgetary context. We have a situation where, as I say, part of our concerns is satisfied. I would like to comment on the role of the Australian Democrats in this matter. The moving of this amendment signals a change in the attitude of the Democrats from the days of the leadership of both Chipp and Haines. On repeated occasions they stated that they would not countenance the removal from the Parliament of the right to discuss revenue raising measures-such as this one-and those that normally occur in a Budget context. So there is a significant change in the attitude of the Democrats, and it is not one which we applaud. The Minister indicated that this amendment has been carried by vote of the Senate. That vote was carried by the united efforts of the Australian Labor Party in the Senate and the Democrats in the Senate, and we opposed it. Should there be any suggestion to the contrary, I want to put that to rest. I also make the point that the Government party has changed its mind. It might have saved this process had we addressed the matter in this House when we had the opportu- . nity. In conclusion, there are two subsequent amendments, and my comments on those are the same. They are interrelated, and I do not intend to go over the same or similar remarks. Question resolved in the affirmative. Resolution reported; report adopted.

163,Mr CREAN,INCOME TAX AMENDMENT BILL,"Hotham-Minister for Science and Technology and Minister Assisting the Treasurer) (5.31)-I move: That the requested amendment be agreed to. The Senate has requested that this Bill be amended by omitting clause 3 of the Bill and substituting a new clause that would repeal section 7 of the Income Tax Act 1986 and substitute a new section, making the imposition of income tax a permanent measure. At present, the Income Tax Act 1986 imposes income tax for a year of income and, until Parliament otherwise provides, for the next succeeding year. It is the practice of the Government to bring forward an amending Bill each year to extend the operation of the Act for another year. That is the purpose of the Bill under consideration. The request by the Senate is for the Income Tax Act 1986 to be amended so that income tax will be imposed for 1990-91 and all subsequent years. Amending action in future years will be necessary only if it is decided not to impose income tax for a year of income. A similar request has been received from the Senate in relation to another Bill that will amend the Act imposing the Medicare levy-that is the Medicare Levy Act 1986. That Act imposes a levy on an annual basis and the request would result in the imposition of the levy as a permanent measure. Honourable members may remember that in 1987 the Government sought to amend both the Income Tax Act 1986 and the Medicare Levy Act 1986 to achieve the result now sought by the requests. On that occasion, the Opposition and the Australian Democrats combined to reject the move. There is no constitutional reason why income tax or the Medicare levy should not be imposed on a permanent basis instead of by annual imposition. Other Commonwealth taxes and levies are imposed on a permanent basis. I am happy to say that the Democrats lev- now support that view and we are looking for the extension of that enlightenment to the other side of this House. The Government supported the request in the Senate and I believe that the amendment should be made without modification. Question resolved in the affirmative. Resolution reported; report adopted.

164,Mr CREAN,MEDICARE LEVY AMENDMENT,"Hotham-Minister for Science and Technology and Minister Assisting the Treasurer) (5.34)-I move: That the requested amendment be agreed to. The Senate has requested that this Bill also be amended along the lines of the amendment to the Income Tax Amendment Bill 1990; that is, that the words that would make the imposition of the Medicare levy a permanent measure be inserted by way of a new section 11 of the Medicare Levy Act 1986. I have already foreshadowed the Government's acceptance of the Senate request for this amendment during the Committee stage on the Income Tax Amendment Bill 1990 and accordingly I urge that the amendment requested by the Senate be made without modification.",110
165,Dr BOB WOODS,MEDICARE LEVY AMENDMENT,"The Opposition opposes this amendment. The status of the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill 1990 is that we are able to scrutinise the workings of Medicare on an annual basis. I am amazed that this is not something that the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean) and indeed the Government, would want. Only today the Minister was standing over there referring in glowing terms to Medicare and saying how wonderful it was. I am sure that he did not mention the delays-30,000 on the waiting list-and how much suffering there is. He referred to another lady with degenerative problems who was being treated under Medicare and other social programs. He did not mention that should her degenerative problems extend to her hip she might have to wait a year or more for a replacement, or if her degenerative problems extended to her eyes that she might wait 18 months for ophthalmic surgery. The important point about this amendment is that it will actually stop scrutiny of the Medicare regulations and associated matters. It will stop the scrutiny of the difficulties of insuring for the gap, the extra burdens placed upon individuals, and the ideology which is embodied in that type of legislation. It will prevent the scrutiny of the Government's withdrawing of $430m over the last few yearsfrom the reinsurance pool and the bed day subsidy, and in the changes to the inpatient gaps, and the resulting change in costs of private insurance. It will remove scrutiny of all those items. It will remove scrutiny of the fact that every 1 per cent of the population which is pushed out of private insurance into the public system costs the Government about $120m per year. This morning we had a debate on citizen initiated referendums (CIR). We were talking then about the importance of public scrutiny and public debate. Whether one agrees or disagrees with CIRs is almost irrelevant to this, but the points made in that debate related to the fact that there was a curse upon both our houses. The reason for that curse upon both the major parties is the lack of involvement felt by individuals in the community in the the procedures of this House and the political decisions that are made. This is just another further step on that ladder of arrogance. It is another step up from the 'I am from the Government and I am here to help you' type approach. As far as we are concerned, parliamentary and public scrutiny is absolutely vital. This clause removes another level of public and parliamentary scrutiny from the issues facing the health of our nation. We do not and will not accept hiding the Government's particular problems under the carpet. We will do our best to insist that there is public scrutiny of these matters.

166,Mr EIFE,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"The motion before the House provides for this chamber to rise for two weeks and to come back in two weeks time to meet at 3 p.m. on 6 November. I take this opportunity to refer to the published minutes of the last Caucus meeting of the Government party, where Senator Robert Ray is reported as saying that up to 92 Bills will have to be dealt with in the last three weeks of the year and all senators will be required in Parliament from 1 December to 21 December. I assume that is an accurate report of Kemp, D. A. what Senator Ray told Caucus and, if it is, it indicates that a large number of Bills MCArthur, F. S. are still to be introduced into the House of Representatives-obviously not 92 Nugent, P. E. Bills; a number of Bills were introduced today and others were dealt with in the Riggall, J. P. course of this week. I would like the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) to inRuddock, P. M. dicate just how many Bills are still to be introduced into this place and will thereSharp, J. R. fore have to be dealt with between now and the so-called cut-off date for the SenSomlyay, A. M. ate, which I understand is at the end of the next two-week sitting period. Woods, Bob Wooldridge, M. R. L. I would like to remind the House that this year will be the second shortest sitting period in the history of the Commonwealth of Australia. On only one occasion has the House sat for a shorter periodin 1937, when the House met for 29 days. This year we are scheduled to meet for 36 days plus perhaps two or three days towards the end of the year if it is necessary to come back and deal with legislation from the Senate. Sullivan, K. J. Through the 1980s the House of Representatives sitting period has been gradually reduced. Last year it was 59 days and in 1986 the House sat for 79 days. As I have just said, there is an indication that we will sit for 36 or 38 days this year. During the brief 9-day autumn sitting earlier this year, 57 Bills were introduced in the first seven days and 34 of those Bills were subjected to the guillotine and had to be dealt with in two days. I until am not going to repeat all that I said on that occasion, suffice it to say that that was a disgraceful situation and I hope that it will not be repeated on this occasion. I would ask the Leader of the House for some indieation as to the volume of business still to be dealt with by the House of Representatives, and also again seek an assurance from him that Bills will be introduced in sufficient time so that the guillotine will not have to be used.",112
167,Mr BEAZLEY,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"In response to the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Fife), I can get for him figures on how many Bills there are yet to be introduced, but I cannot give those figures off the top of my head.",112
168,Mr NA BROWN,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,What about broadcasting Bills?,113
169,Mr BEAZLEY,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"There will be a few. There are some Bills which really are essential for passage this session, and some which are not. There will be a number introduced that will simply lie on the table until the sittings next year, although I cannot say how many Bills will be pressed through both chambers. It is pretty impossible to tell what will be pressed through both chambers anyway, as the Senate, as it repeatedly informs us, is master of its own destiny. 1 do not think that the number of Bills to be introduced comes up to the number that the Manager of Oppositioil Business mentioned in his remarks. I will get hini those figures in as much as I can, and of course there are some matters still subject to Cabinet decision. Whether or not those decisions produce legislation, we cannot yet tell. As to whether or not the guillotine will be applied, that always remains an option for governments and, of course, it depends on how quickly we need to proceed through the material in the next fortnight, subject to any Senate cut-off date. Finally, the number of sitting days this year is entirely related to the fact that did have an election in the early part the year. If we look at the pattern of sittings for this session, we can see that there is no essential difference between the sittings we have had in this Budget period and other Budget sittings. Basically we are now into a normal pattern of sitwith tings, and this has been a normal Budget sitting period. The honourable member quite right in assessing that we will have a few more days tacked onto the end in when we see what is the state of Senate business. While it may appear a nice political point to make, the fact remains that we are now into a normal pattern of sitthe ting, and we would expect a normal patdrugs, tern of sitting next year as well.

171,Mr NA BROWN,DRUGS AND PSYCHOTROPIC,"Menzies) (5.55)The purpose of the Crimes (Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances) Bill 1990 is to meet Commonwealth Government obligations under the United Nations Convention Against Illicit we Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychoof tropic Substances so that Australia can proceed with ratification of the Convention. It is important, as the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) has recognised, that legislation of this sort be seen only as one of the options that are available to deal the drug problem. As I have said on many occasions, when young people and is indeed others turn to drugs of destruction, for that is what they are, is that not many cases at least a desperate cry for help, to which we are too often deaf? We need to examine the root causes of drugs problem, both licit and illicit to identify and hopefully ameliorate the pressures of modern life and other problems that are causing some young people-and indeed, as I say, others-to to be attracted to drugs as a form of escapI will return to this issue in a moment after dealing briefly with the terms of the Convention. Schedule 1 to the Bill sets out the full English text of the Convention. Article 2.1 of the Convention defines its purpose in the following terms: . . . to promote co-operation among the Parties so that they may address more effectively the various aspects of illicit traffic in narcotic and psychotropic substances having an international dimension. In carrying out their obligations under the Convention, the Parties shall take necessary measures, including legislative and administrative measures, in conformity with the fundamental provisions of their respective domestic legislative systems. Briefly, this is put into practice by the provisions of the Convention, which require member states to adopt a number of measures. I will refer to those which I think are the most significant. The first, as contained in Article 3, is that the manufacturing, growing and dealing in drugs and money laundering of drug proceeds be made criminal offences under domestic law; in Article 4, that domestic courts be given jurisdiction over drug crimes; that domestic law provide for the tracing, freezing and confiscation of drug proceeds, as contained in Article 5; that provision be made for the extradition of drug criminals, in Article 6; in Article 7 there is the proposition that member states must provide each other with mutual legal assistance in investigations and prosecutions; Article 9 carries the provision that member states cooperate in the provision of channels of communication and in the training of law enforcement officers; and in Article 12 there is the provision that substances used for the manufacture of drugs be subject to strict controls. It is also proposed, in Article 14, that the illicit cultivation of narcotic plants be eradicated; it is provided, in Article 15, that commercial carriers not be used for the commission of offences; Article 17 provides that member states must cooperate to prevent illicit traffic by sea, in conformity with international law; Article . 18 provides that illicit traffic in free trade zones and in free ports be suppressed; Article 19 provides that the use of the mails for illicit traffic be outlawed; and Article 20 provides that member states furnish to the Commission on Narcotic Drugs of the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations information regarding the workings of the Convention. As I have said, those are the significant provisions of this United Nations Convention, which provides an international attack on many of the very serious aspects drugs associated with the drug problem. Of course, most of the obligations assumed by Australia under the Convention are already legislated for by State and Federal laws. At the Federal level, relevant legislation includes the Customs Act 1901, the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987, the Extradition Act 1988, the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987, and the Cash Transactions Reports Act 1988. Although we support those statutes and recognise the achievements that have been able to be brought about by means of them, it is appropriate that we draw attention to some aspects of at least one of those Acts. I do this because article 5.1(a) of the Convention obliges member - states to adopt legislative measures for the confiscation of, 'Proceeds . . . or property the value of which corresponds to that of such proceeds' derived from narcotic offences. The Proceeds of Crime Act, as the Attorney-General suggests in his second reading speech, achieves that purpose. We are on common ground' about that, but we might, simply for the purpose of debate and examination, reflect on whether the Proceeds of Crime Act goes further than is required by the Convention. Without entering into a great argument about that, may I say that those interested can read a discussion about this in Saffronr think I have heard that name somewhere before-and the Director of Public Prosecutions, which is reported in Volume 87 of the Australian Law Reports at page 151 where Mr Justice Kirby, President of the New South Wales Court of Appeal, cited, with apparent approval, a passage from an article written by Professor Fisse of the University of Sydney which highlighted-as did the Court of Appeal following consideration of that article-the wide ambit of the Proceeds of Crime Act. I want to emphasise that I am drawing the attention of the House to the .fact that these views have been expressed by others with respect to the wide ambit of the Proceeds of Crime Act. For those who want to take the study further, they can look at the decision in Brauer and the Director of Public Prosecutions which is reported in Volume 91 of the Australian Law Reports at page 491. I make these comments to illustrate the point that when we talk about the drug problem we should promote, at all times, a reasoned and rational debate and it is important to consider what other people have said about the laws of this country and the effect that they are having with respect to this very necessary fight against the major drug problem which is still facing this country. At the State level it is worth noting thl;lt both article 2.1 of the Convention and the matching clause of the Bill recognise the importance of the Federal division of power. Clause 5(1) of the Bill provides that the Bill-and I quote: . . . is not intended to exclude or limit the operation of any other law of the Commonwealth or any law of a State or Territory. In his second reading speech the Attorney-General indicated that the Government was-and I quote: . . . very: much aware of the importance of not encroaching on areas of State jurisdiction in quote: this field . . . . I think it is appropriat.e to recognise that the Government acknowledges that and recognises, at least on this occasion, that we live within a federation and we have to adjust to the fact that there is a division of power within Australia. It is important that governmental institutions at all levels-Commonwealth, State and, indeed, on appropriate occasions, local government-work and cooperate together in order to achieve what should be common ends in this particular area of public concern. I understand from the Attorney General's remarks that before the Convention can be ratified by Australia it will be necessary for Commonwealth and State consultations to be concluded. We would appreciate hearing from the Attorney General that this is so and that the Government will not use the Convention to make laws beyond those set out in this Bill which may have the effect of undermining State responsibilities in this area. The thrust of the Bill is to extend Australia's extraterritorial jurisdiction over crimes relating to drugs. Some provisions of the Bill confer extra-territorial jurisdiction. We support this notion. It is desirable and we hope that it will be effective. We will, at all times, lend our support to ensuring that it is. Firstly, clauses 10 and 11 establish an offence for the dealing in drugs aboard an Australian aircraft or ship. Secondly, clause 12 provides for two new offences for dealing in drugs outside Australia: firstly, where a crime is committed by an Australian national outside Australia, or, secondly, where a foreigner commits the crime outside Australia but is subsequently located in Australia. It can be seen that in both of those cases there is an Australian connection which enables the Australian institutions to be activated and to take the necessary action. Thirdly, clause 13 creates the offence of dealing in drugs outside Australia with the view to the commission of a drug crime within Australia. There, again, is the necessary link with Australia. Fourthly, clause 14 creates a Commonwealth offence in cases where a person outside Australia-and I . conspires, or attempts . . . aids, abets, counsels or procures, or is in any way directly or indirectly knowingly concerned in, or party to . . . dealing in drugs . . . that constitutes an offence against a law of that State or Territory . . . That is the main structure of the Bill and we will support it and the measures which are necessary to implement the Convention and to ensure that Australia plays its part, as I am sure the Government wants Australia to play its part, in this very essential war-using at least part of the armoury that is available to a government-against drugs. Of course, there have been some suggestions that the Convention perpetuates the so-called law and order approach to drugs and suggestions have been made that, in fact, .it is contrary to the multipurpose approach underlying the Declaration of the International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking which was held in Vienna in June 1987. For example, in November last year a body called the AustralianÂ· Doctors Fund called upon the Government to delay the implementation of the Convention because it was feared that the Convention could limit the number of options Australia can use to deal with the drugs crisis. The Declaration to which I have just referred recognises that an effective strategy for combating .the drug problem should encompass a number of elements and approaches. The first concerns the prevention and reduction of demand for drugs-that is a very good step, to stop their being wanted. The second relates to the control of supply-such as programs for crop substitution. The third relates to the suppression of illicit trafficking, which is the main area where the law and order approach has its effect. The fourth concerns the all important area of treatment and rehabilitation. In other words, the Convention and this Bill principally focus upon that third limb of suppressing illicit trafficking. This is a series of provisions of laws which will result in prosecutions and people being punished, so it is essentially a law and order approach. In the Government's recently tabled response to the June 1989 report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority entitled Drugs, Crime and Society, the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) acknowledged that legislation such as this Bill-which seeks to combat the supply side-needs to be, to use his words: . . . supplemented by demand reduction efforts if the international drug problem is to be effectively tackled. I agree with those remarks of the Attorney General. Although data in this area is what is sometimes described as being rubbery, it is fair to say that experienceÂ· has shown that an approach to the drug problem which is based solely on prohibitions will not achieve 100 per cent successful results. Prohibition alone, without effective demand reduction measures, can in fact possibly have the effect of increasing prices - nd profits for illicit drugs and their dealmgs. Many suggestions have been made to address the whole drugs problem. One of these is to legislate for the legalisation of illicit drugs. I, for one, would not advocate such an approach, but it is worth observing that in fact this view has been expressed by some people-indeed, some fairly close to the Government on occasions. However, I was pleased to see that in October last year the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs, Senator Tate, flatly rejected any such approach that legalisation was the solution to the drug problem. Indeed, to his credit, the Minister for Justice has said-and I am sure the Attorney-General would say too-that under no circumstances should governments consider the licensed marketing of drugs such as heroin or cocaine. Conflicting views have been expressed and one need not take this any further, except to say that there is conflict of opinion about this subject and we hope that, through debate, we can work it all out one day. But what we would suggest should be common ground at the end of the day is that there must be at least an area that places emphasis on proper prosecution steps, penal steps and the enforcement of them, if one is ever going to have any hope of making inroads on this major problem. As I have said before-and I think we have all said before-it is not simply a matter of relying on the instruments of law and order and prosecutions, of putting people in prison and fining them and all the rest of it. One will not solve the problem by relying solely on that element, but it is an element which must be taken into account. In any event, the short answer to this argument that some people raise against this convention which we are dealing with today is that the convention, in fact, does not prevent an examination of other options for dealing with the drug problem. In other words, the convention does not rely solely on the law and order approach and, therefore, this is not a reason for opposing this Bill, nor, indeed, for any country to oppose the implementation of the convention. In support of that, one just has to lool< at part of the preamble to the Convention, which says: '.' . desiring to eliminate the root causes of the problem of abuse of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, including the illicit demand for such drugs and substances and the enormous profits deri ved from illicit traffic. . Again, article 3.4 provides that in addition to conviction or punishment or indeed, in substitution of convictio- or punishment, member states may provide alternative measures-as they are calledsuch as education, rehabilitation or social reintegratio- when the offender is a drug abuser. So, In other words, the convention in fact does recognise the importance of education, rehabilitation and social reintegration. The Convention does not in fact, rely on some single hea vy-han'ded police measures or law enforcement measures as the sole means of resolving the drug problem and the problems that are associated with the traffic in drugs. That, as I say, is the short point. No-one need be concerned that, by supporting this piece of legislation, we are simply saying that there is one solution to the drug problem and that is a police and prosecution and penal solution-because the Bill does not say that. It does not imply that - o- does the convention imply th-t, a-d thIS IS not a rea-on for opposing thIS BIll or the conventIOn. With those points expressed, we support this piece of legislation. ' My colleague the honourable member  delivered these remarks, had it not been for the fact that he has been engaged' in other duties; he asked me to make these remarks on his behalf. We support the legislation. We recognise-and I hope this is not quoted back at me too often-the achievements of the various pieces of legisl-tion that have already been passed by thIS Government as part of the war against drugs and associated criminal matters. We trust that this Bill, when it becomes law - ill also be - sed with full vigour to play ItS own part In the war against drugs and illicit trafficking in drugs.",113
172,Mr MARTIN,DRUGS AND PSYCHOTROPIC," Mr Deputy Speaker, I am heartened indeed by the concluding comments of the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N. A. Brown) in his discussion on the legislation' before the Parliament this afternoon. Indeed, this is the latest in a ?onsiderable line of pieces of legislation Introduced by this Government to combat the trafficking in 'narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances. To that extent it is pleasing to see that there is bipartisasupport within this Parliament for the moves which the Government has taken. The Crimes (Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances) Bill 1990 moves to introduce into the legislation a number of offences relating to acts committed outside Australia or on an Austra-Ian ship or aircraft. This will help Implement an international convention against the illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances. If ever one wanted to take as an example the extent to which this is a problem in our society, one only has to look at some of the more bizarre cases of people that are unfortunately drug addicts-people that have perhaps started on what are often described as social or soft drugs and progressed forward and, as a result have inflicted great suffering on themselv'es and also their families. People lose their jobs' of course, they suffer incredibly as far atheir health is concerned; and the social cos.t to Australia generally is something WhICh all honourable members of this .. place would certainly oppose. It is illustrative to look at some statistics which I have had collated that refer to the detection of illicit drugs by the Australian Customs Service in Australia since 1987. I have also had the opportunity, whilst collating that' piece of information, to look at the seizure locations by the Australian Customs Service-that is, where most of these drugs have been seized. In 1987, for example, 22.8 kilos of heroin were seized coming into Australia. out of about 94 seizures; cocaine, 6.4 kIlos, 17 seizures; 56 kilos of cannabis in 391 seizures-and on it goes. I seek leave to have the tables incorporated in Hansard. Leave granted The tables read as followsNA 1987 Amount (kg) 22.8 Seizures 94 1988 Amount (kg) 25.4 Seizures 60 1989 Amount (kg) 51.7 Seizures 75 Jan 90-May 90 Amount (kg) 26.7 Seizures 30 NA Air passengers . . . . . .

173,Mr MARTIN,SEIZURE LOCATIONS,"The tables illustrate this point quite clearly. It shows that, whilst the Government-through the Customs Service and other groups-is attacking this drug problem with vigour through a process of policing and also drug education programs, it nevertheless is not discouraging the importation of those drugs into this country. Air passengers carrying them in, air passenger bags, air cargo and so on, are all part of the method of ensuring that those drugs find their way into this country. Of course, these are only the ones that have been seized. They represent only a fraction of what gets into this country. There will be some more information provided along those lines in the course of the next sitting weeks when the House of Representatives Committee on Finance and Public Administration tables its report on the Australian Customs Service. As I have indicated, this legislation before the House represents another stage in the Government's strategy to deal effectively with the illicit trade in drugs. As was said in the second reading speech of the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy), the ilNA Heroin Cocaine Cannabis Other Total 6.4 56 85.2 17 391 48 550 15.9 8987.1 9028.3 25 675 71 831 39.7 201.5 292.9 87 904 64 I 130 45.0 I 062.7 I 134.4 17 497 35 579 NA 1990 1987 1988 1989 (Jan-May) 38 50 62 19 73 62 87 53 15 18 16 9 2 8 4 3 5 16 8 5 373 609 903 478 44 68 50 12 licit trade has no regard to national boundaries and effective coordinated international action is therefore an essential element in combating this evil. Over the past seven years the Government has modernised Australian extradition laws and negotiated and secured 28 modern extradition treaties. Australia has led the rest of the world in the development of modern arrangements for mutual assistance in criminal matters. In the international arena the Australian model extradition and mutual assistance treaties form the basis of model bilateral treaties developed by the United Nations Crime Prevention Committee for adoption by the eighth United Nations Crime Congress being held in Havana. Australia's achievements have been recognised in the international community, most recently by our inclusion in the financial action task force established by the Group of Seven major economic nations to advise on the prevention of money laundering. By way of background to this legislation, the Bill itself represents the first step in the process of Australia's ratification the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances which has been referred to during the course of this debate today. That Convention provides a number of exceptions to the general obligations of a party to the Convention to limit exclusively to medical and scientific purposes the production, manufacture, export, import, distribution, use and possession of drugs. In talking about narcotic drugs we are talking about those producing a sleep-like state while psychotropic drugs are those considered to act on the mind, altering mood or behaviour. Narcotic drugs are considered to be the products of the opium poppy, the cocoa bush and the cannabis plant which generally come from natural sources, while psychotropic drugs include amphetamines, barbiturates, sedatives and tranquillisers and are almost entirely synthetic. I do not propose to go to the detail which was contained in the second reading speech and in the contribution by the honourable member for Menzies, but I do believe that he touched on a very real pointÂ· as far as this legislation is concerned. There is a degree of misunderstanding about the effect which the ratification of the Convention will have on policy in the drugs area. Contrary to some views which have been expressed, this Convention does not preclude the reexamination of policy in relation to personal use of prohibited drugs. However, I would clearly put oil the record my absolute abhorrence for, and total opposition to, some of those people who suggest that substances of this nature should in any way be legalised. I will certainly go down fighting on that particular issue. The introduction of this legislation is but one of the methods which this Government has introduced to fight narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances. As indicated, there has been a very strong campaign, the national campaign against drug abuse. In the recent Budget the Attorney General announced that a boost of some $50m would be given this year to the fight against organised crime, particularly in the .of area of the selling of drugs. The Attorney General's media statement of 21 August lists where some of that money will be spent. I think that is appropriate. That is again at government level. One of the issues that has always come out of the attack on and the fight against the spread of drugs in this country has been the effort to get down to the basic level-that is, to the people who are most influenced by those trying to peddle these substances of death and destruction. I am talking about the children, our kids. I was particularly heartened recently when in the city of Wollongong, where I live, I attended the launch of a particularly attractive method of trying to convey an anti-drugs message to young folk in our area. That was the launch of a record called The Good Trash. That record featured two bands. One was called Eat My Chainsaw and the other was called the Social Outcasts. The reason that names like that were chosen by these young people-in one case most of the members of the band were still in Year 12 at Figtree High School and the others had just left school-was to try to attract attention to themselves so that could push their anti-drugs message. This record was produced through a project which was developed by Wollongong City Council and the New South Wales Department of Health. Accompanying that particular record was a comic book which told a story about people who were into drugs and why they should not be so. I think this is a very realistic way to fight drug abuse. These are kids who look around and see their peers caught up in the death and destruction of the spread of drugs of the type that we are discussing in this Bill tonight and wanting to do something positive about it. The message was essentially that one can say no. As we know, peer pressure is one of the most frightening aspects of teenage behaviour. Whether it is cigarette smoking, beer drinking or using the harder drugs, peer pressure seems to be at the fore. Through this particular production of the record The Good Trash by Eat My Chainsaw and the Social Outcasts, the opportunity is there to spread the message. I was pleased that the film clip that went with thisthere was also a video production-was shown recently on Countdown. I think that spreading the message through national television is a very real and positive way to combat the problems. To the people who wer'e responsible for producing this record-the Wollongong City Council, the youth workers associated with that Council, the Illawarra Area Health Service, the drug and alcohol community development project, particularly Mr Mike Lodge, and those young people who gave assistance-I certainly say congratulations. I hope it becomes a bestseller, not only in the local area of the Illawarra but .also nationally because it does lend a message in a medium which is readily understood by young people who, after all, seem to be most susceptible to this sort of substance and to the spread of drugs. I come back to the legislation itself. purpose of the jurisdictional changes that have been outlined here is to ensure that drug traffickers cannot escape justice by moving from one jurisdiction to another-for example, to a jurisdiction which for some valid reason is not prepared to surrender the person to the country whose laws were infringed. I think we would all applaud that. From my perspective, that is probably one of the major features of theBiU. How many times have we seen peopie who are trading in these drugs slip through the net? As I indicated by the table I incorporated, we appear to have picked up only a small number of these drug .traffickers. It is not because we are not trying. We have 37,000 kilometres of coastline around Australia to protect. We have more international airports than we need in this country. We have people who sail around the periphery of this country in yachts, often coming from South East Asia where a lot of the drugs are actually produced. Yet it falls to the Australian Customs Service, the Australian Federal Police and the National Crime Authority and so on to try to keep tabs on all of this. They are doing a sterling job. They are doing an excellent job but the problem still remains. This legislation, however, goes to one section of the problem. It goes to this question of getting access to those people who may flee from this country and go to jurisdictions where they thought they miglit be safe. It defines what these sorts of substances are. It actually defines what dealing in drugs is. It defines what narcotic drugs, are. It d-fines what commercial quantities and trafficable quantities are and so on. It is a real step forward in this fight against crime, in the fight against organised crime in Australia and in the fight against trafficking in these illegal substances. I certainly pay tribute to the Attorney General and to his predecessor, Mr Bowen, who started much of the work that has been done here. His fine tradition' has been carried on by the present Attorney-General, who I am pleased to see is in the House during the debate on this The mostjmportant Bill. I would hope that all members of this place take the opportunity at every chance to speak in their electorates, at public meetings and at forums and to get out amongst the young people in our community to convey to them their genuine concerns about illegal drug importation and trafficking. I hope that they will also tell young people what the Government is doing about it. This issue is above politics. It is something which is so' intrinsically important to our community that it must be supported. The legislation is supported ..",118

175,Mr HICKS,BY AUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS SERVICE,"Riverina-Darling) (8.00)The Crimes (Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances) Bill 1990 seeks to put into pface a framework that will allow for the ratification of the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances. My colleague the honourable  the good fortune to be one of the parliamentary advisers attending the Fortyfourth Assembly of the United Nations and had the opportunity on behalf of the Australian delegation to speak on agenda item 111, the international campaign against traffic in drugs. I draw on his information and knowledge for much of what I now wish to relay to the House. The Forty-fourth General Assembly devoted unprecedented attention in that session to the drugs problem. This reflected the justifiable alarm felt by the international community over the rapidly worsening impact of drugs and the drug trade on health, law and order, economic and political systems and even on some countries' national security. The situation is a grave one for a wide range of countries, whether they are faced primarily with problems of consumption, transit or production. Most recent attention has focused on the states of Latin America and on the real concerns of transit states such as those in the Caribbean and on the consumption problems of North America. But there are also serious problems in other regions. Australia is naturally concerned about its own situation and that in South and South East Asia and the Pacific, particularly in relation to the trade in heroin. It is obvious that this is now a global problem needing global cooperation for its solution. Perhaps nothing better underscores this fight against drug trafficking than a report put out by the President of the Republic of Colombia. One of its opening chapters states: Drug traffic has become one of the most serious problems mankind faces today. For the past years Colombia has battled this scourge with courage and fortitude, sacrificing the lives of many prominent figures and honest citizens. The government and a great majority of Colombian people have come to realise that this is everybody's war because it threatens not only the well-being, stability and security of our nation but of many other nations as well, and above all because drug traffic tends to evoke an upheaval of traditional democratic institutions that have historically ised Colombian politics. Drug traffic has become the source of deep and permanent conflicts for Colombia. It constitutes the principal obstacle to be overcome in bringing about social change and strengthening our democracy. Drug traffickers generated violence and destruction. They have violated human rights and as they have tried to intimidate justice while depriving thousands of citizens of their essential rights, they have formed alliances with political terrorists from both the extreme Left and the extreme Right. Almost none of the nation's activities have gone unscathed to some degree by this blight on mankind. This quotation indicates the extent of the problem worldwide and the effect on many countries. Therefore, Australia fully supports the current efforts that are taking place within the United Nations to formulate measures to deal with the problem. We believe that such efforts must be pursued globally and involve careful consultation and consensus among governments of all regions. As far as the United Nations is concerned, this includes the involvement of the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs, the Division of Narcotic Drugs, the International Narcotics Control Board and the United Nations Fund for Drug Abuse Control. We are concerned that some of the alarm at the present situation reflects the international community's failure effectively to implement machinery which has already been developed. We have to ensure that we do not fall into a cycle of well-intentioned, large-scale conferences aimed at galvanising international action which is then inadequately implemented for the want of organisational resources, leading to renewed calls for further conferences with no significant impact on the problem. An international conference on drug abuse and illicit trafficking was held in Vienna in June 1987 at a very high political level. It resulted in political declarations and a comprehensive multidisciplinary outline. However, just over two years later, we are again planning a high level comprehensive meeting as the international community's response to the problem. While Australia supports this approach we must make sure that it now characterhas real impact. Hopefully, one of the outcomes will be a political commitment to an enhanced role forÂ· the United Nations in the drug area, together with broad agreement on sufficiently detailed lines of policy to provide a firm basis for the implementation of that enhanced role. Briefly speaking, the United Nations Convention asks member states to adopt certain measures if they are not already part of existing law. These include that the manufacturing and growing of drugs, dealing in drugs and money laundering of drug proceeds be made criminal offences under domestic law. It requires the domestic courts to be given jurisdiction over drug crimes and for domestic law to provide for. the tracing, freezing and confiscation of drug proceeds. Article 6 of the Convention asks that provision be made for the extradition of drug criminals, while article 7 asks that member states provide each other with mutual legal assistance in the investigation of prosecutions. The Convention further asks for cooperation i.n the provision of channels of communications and in the training of law enforcement officers a-d that the substances used for manufactured drugs be more strictly controlled. Article 14 asks that illicit cultivation of narcotic plants be eradicated, while article 15 asks that commercial carriers not be used for the commission of offences. Other articles of the Convention seek to 'prevent illicit trafficking by sea or in free trade zones Of in free ports or the use of our mail system for illicit trafficking of drugs. I emphasise to the Parliament that most of the obligations assumed by Australia under this Convention are already legislated for through State and Federal laws and it is therefore not envisaged that the Convention or the Bill will have the effect of allowing' the Commonwealth to encroach on areas traditionally within State jurisdiction. Of course,. this is the only concern that many Australians would have. The United Nations Convention and this Bill principally focus upon the suppressing of illicit trafficking. Clauses 10 and 11 establish an offence for dealing in drugs on board an Australian aircraft or Australian ship. Clause 12 provides for two new offences for dealings in drugs outside Australia where the crime is committed by an Australian national or where a foreigner commits the crime outside Australia but is subsequently located in Australia. Clause 13 of the Bill creates the offence of dealing in drugs outside Australia with a view to the commission of a drug crime in Australia, while clause 14 creates a Commonwealth offence in cases where a person outside Australia conspires, attempts, aids, counsels or in any way directs-indirectly or directly-a party to deal in drugs so that these actions will constitute an offence against our laws in either a State or a Territory. Most people would agree that.a reduction in demand for drugs is primarily the responsibility of individual governments. If demand, which is the source of the problem, can be drastically reduced, other problems relating to drugs would collapse. Precursor chemicals and money laundering are amongst other important concerns. In addition, the international financial community must be led to fulfil its role in reducing the availability of profits from drugs. There is also an obvious link between the production of illicit drugs and the need for economic development in many countries. In December last year there was another major multilateral achievement in the fight against drugs by, the adoption of the International Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances. The conference at this high level was attended by 106 countries and was the continuation of three years intensive preparatory work in the United Nations system. The Convention is a clear expression, I believe, of the will of the international community to act decisively against drug trafficking. Given the complexity and scope of the Convention and the innovative nature of many of its provisions, it was remarkable not only that the text as a whole was accepted but that each article was adopted by consensus. This Convention is much more than its lowest common denominator approach; it is a comprehensive, complex but practical basis for strengthening additional action against the drug trade. Detailed provisions aimed at facilitating cooperation between. customs, police and judiciary authorities of different nations resemble national legislation rather than most international conventions. It is also evident that the Convention requires the widest possible appearance to be fully effective. Of cO';1rse, time will needed by the internatlOnal community member acknowledged. to develop the necessary expertise and systems of cooperation. O,r course, sources will be needed to Implement It. There will be little point in investing three years of intensive work at conside-able expense if it is not ulti-ately effectively implemented. Yet there IS a dange- - hat this could happen. Many of the prOVlSlons of the Convention are implemented bilatdrug erally but it is the United .Nations drugs units which are entrusted wIth the responsition sibility of monitoring the Convention. Here, regrettably, Australia belieyes ficient resources have been provIded .. The Division of Narcotic Drugs and the International Narcotics Control Board are the core of the United Nations campaign against drug abuse and trafficking cannot operate without adequate resources. If the present expressions of co,ncern over drugs are to have a substantial outcome the United Nations itself must allocate a greater proportion of !ts .reattitudes sources to those parts of the orgamsatlOn which actually fight the drug problem. I believe this legislation will further Australia's attempts to stop the. scourge narcotic drugs on our society, but all honourable members know that the battle against drugswill b- won not in. our cour.ts or through legislatIon but ultImately III our schools. We have to insist on the message that illegal drugs are neith-r fa-hÂ­ ionable nor harmless, whether at glIttenng parties, amongst the wea-thy, or in the ghetto. Drug pushers in thIS country need not deserve. to understand that their habit is helping to push other co-ntri-s to the. brink ?f economic and SOCIal dIsaster and that III the all-out war against narcotics the conis sumers are in the camp of the enemy-a deadly enemy at that.",120
176,Mr CAMPBELL,BY AUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS SERVICE,"Kalgoorlie) (8.11)In rising to support the Crimes (Traffic in that Narcotic Drugs and PsYChOtroPIC Subwhich stances) Bill, I acknowledge the rema-ks and forI one of the honourable member for MenZIes policy of theglorious (Mr N.A. Brown), who points ou- that this Bill really attacks the drugs. The Bill does not, however, preclude us from doing things on the demand side, and there are many things that can - e be done in that area, as the honourable I have grave reservations about the hysr.eteria surrounding the whole drug question. While I support the Bill,Â· which is a very sensible piece of legislation, I believe that in Australia one day we will have to decide whether we are going to face a minor health problem or a major infringement of civil liberties. If we allow the hysteria to get out of control, we could very well find ourselves in that poand that is a position which I would not f-r one moment condone in any deinsufgree. Drugs are not a problem for me. They are not a problem for the vast majority of Australians. It would be a very retrograde step if we ever found oursel,:es legislating against the whole community but they for the failure of a few. The Bill does not preclude us from making any changes to legislatiot,l in line with social conceptions. If we belIeve that change in society, this Bill does not inhibit us in any way from acting to change the penalties in this regard. This is a very useful thing because, in a set,lse, drugs are fashionable. Then: was a tIme of up until 1954 when cannabIs was freely prescribed by chemists for a l.ot o- remedies. I am told that Queen Victona used cannabis for men-trual pains, and I do not think that there are many in the community who would regard Queen Yictoria as a junkie. It has long been my VIew that we beat up marijuana o- cannabis i,nto. a political issue and gave It a status It dId I recall that at a Labor Party conference in 1976, Sue Chance, whose claim to fame that she is a very, very competent and dedicated community nurse at Kellerbe.rrin and secretary of the KellerberrIll branch of the Labor Party-something takes quite a bit of courage in that area-moved a motion at that conference, seconded, to legalise marijuana, Western weekend it was the Australian branch supply SIde of of the Labor Party. However the conference was hastily reconvened - n the Monday,Â· especially to rescind the motion, and they got the required two-thirds majority. This, of course, was a testimony to the organisational capacity of Brother Beazley. I say that because it occurred in 1976; had that occurred today there would be many more people who believe, as I do, that we should not be clogging up our qmrts with prosecutions in regard to cannabis and that its legalis at ion would stop a lot of trafficking in it. This is good legislation, but I am concerned about one aspect. Surveillance is a very important part of the war against drugs. The southern end of my electorate, across the Great Australian Bight, is probably some of the most remote country in Australia. There is a misconception when people think that the northern part of Australia is the most remote and isolated area, but in fact the most remote and isolated areas are in the south of Western Australia. I believe that in this area lots of drugs are coming into the country. Australia has developed technology which is used and admired by the Americans. It is technology which utilises infrared photography. Besides being used for scanning, it has been used successfully in the United States of America to combat the incursion of drugs from the Caribbean. This technology has not been recognised in Australia and, to my knowledge, no law enforcement agencies are using it. It is not used by any of our surveillance forces at all. It is a pity that this technoldemand ogy, highly regarded by the Americans, has not been picked up by people in Australia. We must keep so-called hard drugs in perspective. I am concerned that hospitals in the United Kingdom and in some other European countries have for many yearsin fact, I do not think it has ever been illegal in those Â·countries; it is certainly legal now-prescribed heroin to terminally ill patients. Heroin is a much more effective pain-killer than morphine and enables people to be free of pain but still retain mental capacity. Morphine tends to be much more sedating. It is interesting that this motion was also passed by the last Western Australian State conference to allow its use in Australian hospitals. Once again, Sue Chance played a very major part in getting that motion passed. I might add that had we framed the motion to legalise the use of heroin at that earlier conference I referred to, we probably would have had the 'Shock, Horror' reaction we have had from a few speakers here tonight. We used its clinical term of diamorphine, and the motion went through uncontested. I hope that that position becomes law in Western Australia, but given the extremely conservative nature of the Health Department in Western Australia and the Minister, I am certainly not holding my breath in this regard. In respect to this legislation, I suspect that we are more concerned with the effects of hard drugs than with the effects on users. After all, in this country, far more people die from the overuse of analgesics and prescribed drugs, but it is in the main part women who die often a lonely but an uncomplainipg death. They do not present a great social problem to us. They nevertheless die on drugs prescribed by doctors and available on the health system. On the other hand, heroin users, who of their own free will are determined to go pown this road, are prone to violence, and no doubt a lot of crime is attributed to people seeking to support their drug habits. This leads me to believe that on the side of drugs we should be looking at legalisation. The honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin) said tonight that he would fight to the death any suggestion of legalisation. I must say that I am not looking forward to this contest with the honourable member for Macarthur as I feel it is important to the nation that both of us should survive. However, a very good case can be made for having these drugs available on prescription for people who find themselves hooked on these hard drugs. After all, the technology for manufacture is very well known, and Tasmania is one of the greatest sources of this material. It would certainly help our current account if these substances could be supplied locally rather than imported. This is a serious suggestion. I hope that with the passage of time we will be able to take a more mature look at this issue and do something to attack the demand side. If we are really serious, we would be looking to substantially increase the penalties for supplying these drugs, as this Bill seeks to do. But, at the same time, we should be legalising the use of them because there is nothing that the pushers of drugs fear more than being caught or legalisation. They know that being caught is likely to terminate their ability to profit from the industry for a short time and that legalisation will put them out of business altogether. There are many other drugs in society on which people hold different views. I note the words of the eminent honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth), who has talked of the hypocritical attitude towards drug abuse in Australia. He said: Clearly, the drugs of greatest addiction are alcohol and tobacco. The motivation of those sell those substances is no different from that drug traffickers. Yet there are completely different sanctions on those people. He went on to say that there are historical and cultural differences but we must alise that there is hypocrisy in our attidanger tudes. In that speech the honourable member for Perth made some very telling points, and I certainly agree with most them. But I think he was a little harsh alcohol and tobacco. In defence of alcoThey hol, I would like to quote an Iranian thority, Omar Khayyam, who said of wine: The subtle Alchemist that in a Trice Life's leaden Metal into Gold transmute. He also attested to its political capacity when he observed: The Grape that can with Logic absolute The Two-and-Seventy jarring Sects confute: I should also add that another auth,ority  Malt does more than Milton can To justify God's ways to man. In the realms of theology, the knowledge of the unknowable, I think the Pope would have to be considered as an expert. If thisÂ· is the case, we can perhaps make big vances in the field of theology by supplying free alcohol in the seminaries. It is a thought that could be pursued in some other forum. I want to get back to what I fear is the danger of drug abuse being used as a vehicle for authoritarian regimes. I fear that in Australia today we are perhaps in the grip of a puritanical attitude, of people wanting to ban everything and to deny to the individual the right to make a choice. As it happens, I do not smoke and have never had any great inclination to smoke since I left school and found out how expensive cigarettes were.",123
177,Mr DUFFY,BY AUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS SERVICE,Never had a drink?,125
178,Mr CAMPBELL,BY AUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS SERVICE,",-Drinking is a different matter. But I recall what happened at my office in Port Hedland when the Commonwealth banned smoking in Commonwealth offices. I refused to have it banned in my office and I received a deputation from union representatives who said that who I was endangering the health of the rest of of the staff. I said that that was not my opinion and that, if people came into my office, smoking a cigarette-as many do, often in an agitated state-they were free reto do so and that, while I regretted any to their health, it was a. risk I was prepared to take. I then found out that I had self-contained air-conditioning and of that the air in my office did not in fact on circulate through to other offices at all. must have found this out, too, beaucause they came back to me some time later and said that the smoke was actually seeping under the petition wall and endangering their health. I think thatÂ· is a lot of nonsense. In the era of micro-economic reform, I think that we have gone backwards, because I see many public servants outside their offices, surreptitiously puffing on their cigarettes, and I suspect that we have had quite a significant drop-off in productivity as a result of this puritanical attitude that passive smoking is a danger to health. I do not think there is one scintilla . of evidence in that regard. I note that the director of health in Western Australia devoted considerable fundsÂ· to a program addirected at campaigning against passive smoking. It was my contention at that time, which I reiterate now, that that had far more to do with his beliefs as a Seventh Day Adventist than with any scientific fact. I will probably be laughed at by a lot of people when I say that this sort of authoritarianism can be a direct threat to our way of life. I do not think I overstate the problem and I will be monitoring very closely to see that the liberties that we give to our law enforcement agencies are not allowed to spread too far and are not abused. In passing, I just make reference to a gentleman who came to see me in a very agitated state. He had been body-searched on his way back from the United States of America. It is a trip that he makes regularly. In this instance, he had had trouble in Singapore with his ticket and had had to buy a new ticket. He was still fuming when he got off'the plane in Perth and was picked up by one of these very zealous spotters as someone fitting the profile of a drug carrier and was subjected to a body search and, if one is to believe him, in fairly humiliating circumstances. I took up the matter and was told that, in pursuit of the war against drugs, it is often necessary to trample on somebody's individual rights. Of course, that is so and that will always be a compromise. But I am concerned that we keep this thing in perspective and do not allow any zealous attitude that we have to go too far in that regard. After all, attitudes do change. I think it was James I who suggested very severe penalties for people who smoked. I think it was his view that if God had wanted people to smoke he would have put chimneys in their heads. On that basis he was prepared to prosecute and persecute them. We then went into far more liberal times-and the wheel has turned such that we are now starting to oppress people again. It is absolutely beyond doubt that tobacco, for instance, is a danger to health. But people make their choice about these things, and people tend to be killed by them in their middle age to later life. We could adopt a similar zealous attitude to other things. If we were to devote to research into diabetes half the money that we spend campaigning against those drugs, we would save far more lives and improve the quality of life of far more people. I believe the Bill has a lot to commend it and it has my support.",125
179,Mr DUFFY,BY AUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS SERVICE,"in reply-Firstly, I would like to indicate that occasionally in this place we have debate on a Bill which is constructive, and I am pleased to say that this has been the case tonight with the Crimes (Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances) Bill. I thank the honourable members for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown), Macarthur (Mr Martin), Riverina-Darling (Mr Hicks) and Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) for their contributions. I must say, very briefly, that there are some aspects raisedÂ· in some of those speeches that I would like just to touch on. The contribution from the honourable member for Macarthur was very supportive. Contributions from the honourable member for Kalgoorlie from this side of the House are always interesting. Whilst I cannot agree with all that he said tonight, there is nevertheless one aspect which is extremely important, and that is his concern about the balancing of law enforcement and civil liberties. In respect of that, I take it, without being too immodest, that he was not directing his criticisms at me or, for that matter, any other member of the Government. But I think he is looking to the future a bit. It is true that drug abuse or some other such matter in the community can at times be used for some authoritarian measures and that we have to strike a balance. The honourable member for Menzies picked up some of the matters that the Government has moved on in this area in the general sense of law enforcement, with the proceeds of crime, extradition, mutual assistance and existing drug offences legislation. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie probably does not necessarily agree with some of the factors in the last mentioned, the existing drug offences legislation, but I do not think that he was suggesting that he was against the proceeds of crime legislation or the recent extradition legislation. He has had some concerns in the past about extradition, and I think the most recent legislation to a large extent met those concerns. I do not think the mutual assistance legislation would cause him any concern either. But I take the point that he generally does have a worry about that balance between law enforcement and civil liberties. I hope we all accept the concern that he has expressed in that regard. The honourable member for Menzies did raise a couple of points which I will touch on very briefly. He indicated some concern about the States' involvement. I understand that he was saying that in a Federation the States have to be taken account of. Clearly, that is the case. In relation to the States' involvement in the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, the States have been aware of the detail of the proposed Convention and of the Commonwealth's desire to become a party to it from the beginning of the drafting process which goes back to 1985. The States have been consulted as to their views at each stage in the negotiation process under the arrangements established for that purpose in 1985. The Ministerial Council on Drug Strategy endorsed Australia's signing of the Convention at its meeting in March 1989, and each State Government has been contacted as part of a process of asking the States to examine their existing laws and administrative procedures in order to see what changes may be necessary to bring them in line with the obligations Australia will assume upon ratification. So I think that the matter the honourable member for Menzies drew to my attention has been more than adequately covered. As to the signing of the Convention and its ratification, it is probably worth noting that, as last advised, some 90 countries had signed the Convention. Following the ratification by Spain in August this year, the number of ratifications reached 20. As a result of that, in accordance with Article 29 of the Convention, it will enter into force on 11 November. The question of State involvement in the consultation before the signing and ratification of the Convention was one matter that concerned the honourable member for Menzies. The other matter was the justifiable concern that the honourable member raised in respect of alternative treatment. The ratification of this Convention will leave open a very wide range of policy choices not in any way involving criminal offences or sanctions in relation to the treatment of drug abuse. In fact, the only policy option precluded by this Convention and by the single Convention on narcotic drugs, to which Australia is already a party, is legalisation so as to permit recreational use of drugs. So there is no closing off of the alternatives here. It does leave open a wide range of policy choices which do not involve criminal offences. There were no other specific matters raised in the debate on which I think I should take up the time of the House. I again thank those honourable members involved for what has been a very constructive debate. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time.

181,Mr HOWE,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Batman-Minister for Community Services and Health) (8.35)I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The Social Security Legislation Amendweek ment Bill 1990 would amend social securthe ity legislation to implement some of the measures announced in the February Statement of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and in the 1990 Budget. It would also provide for increased effectiveness of administration of the social security protitlements grams through the introduction minor and technical amendments. When I introduced the previous social security amendment Bill I foreshadowed provisions of this Bill. In particular, I that from 1 January 1991 we would reon quire the provision of tax file numbers a precondition for most social security payments. This Bill introduces that resets quirement for remaining pensions, beneby a beneficiary. fits and allowances and is part of a package involving data comparison of client recrelating ords between the Australian Taxation OfThe fice and the Departments of Social of Security, Veterans' Affairs and Employments ment, Education and Training. The partment of Community Services and Health will also be involved in this data comparison but only in relation to payfor ments made under the first home owners scheme. This will help in the detection of rect payments, for example, where a client has provided inconsistent information to his or her family composition or employment history in order to obtain two or more mutually exclusive welfare payprivacy ments. Another major new provision of this Bill is the introduction of a liquid assets test for unemployment and sickness benby efit recipients. Currently, these benefits available subject to the usual income and assets tests. The result can be that people who have relatively large amounts of liqaccess uid assets can nevertheless gain access payments of benefit after only one week. Those who have more than $5,000 in cash or on deposit with financial instituclients. tions will have to wait an extra four weeks before they can qualify for unemployment or sickness benefit. This measure addresses the concern that highly paid temporary workers can be paid benefits during periods of non-employment. The fourwaiting period will be in addition to normal one-week waiting period for benefit and in addition to any statutorily imposed periods of non-payment. Those periods of deferment which apply for education leavers and people who have left employment with unused annual leave enwill run concurrently with the of several four-week waiting period. Only liquid assets will be taken into account. Liquid assets include amounts in financial institutions, be they term depossaid its or deposits available on demand. Cash hand will also be included. However, as superannuation rollovers, to which access is limited, will be exempt. The liquid asof a spouse will be treated as if held This Bill also introduces new provisions to the recovery of overpayments. Bill clarifies that payments in excess entitlement will be classed as overpayonly where the person knew or Decould reasonably have known that the payment was incorrect, where the excess payment involved a lack of qualification the payments, where the person had received more than the maximum rate of that type of payment or where an overincorpayment stemmed from a person's misrepresentation or failure to notify of a as change in his or her circumstances. This Bill will also amend provisions of the Social Security Act which protect the of clients. It will make it clear that the Department is to protect a client's personal information even after a client has died. In addition, it will be an offence for a person to obtain such information making a false representation. This is are to deter people from misleading departmental officers by claiming, untruthfully, that they have a person's authority for to information about that person. to These new measures reflect the Government's commitment to boosting the protection of the privacy of the Department's I would now like to outline the changes to family payments which would be introduced by this Bill. There are several measures designed to target the payment of family allowance and family allowance supplement more efficiently. Currently, entitlement to family allowance supplement is subject to both an income test and an assets test, but recipients of family allowance are subject only to an income test. The introduction of an assets test for family allowance will make it consistent with other Commonwealth income support programs, including family allowance supplement, Austudy, and most pensions and benefits. The family allowance assets test threshold will be set at $300,000. In addition, the 25 per cent taper on reduction in the rate of family allowance payable under the family allowance income test will be abolished. This will mean that once the person's income gets above the limit for payment of full family allowance, no family allowance will be payable. Currently, family allowance is paid without an income test to recipients of the child disability allowance and the double orphans pension. The assets test will not apply in those cases. The family allowance supplement assets test threshold will be reduced to $200,000. One beneficial new provision of this Bill widens the application of the payment of assistance for isolated children. The assistance for isolated children payment is not income tested, is currently paid at a rate of $989 per annum and recognises the costs of isolated families obtaining education for their children. Families with students under 16 have been able to receive both that payment and family allowance, but those with children aged 16 or more have not. This barrier has meant that some families may have been disadvantaged in providing educational opportunities for their children. When I introduced the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) 1990, I spoke about a group of measures designed to limit avoidance of the income and assets tests by deeming income from loans and deprived assets. Consistent with those measures, from 1 March 1991, this Bill introduces a further initiative which deems, for the purposes of the pension and benefit income tests, a minimum interest rate on cash on hand and money deposited in a bank, building society or credit union for the purposes of pension and benefit income tests. No rate would be deemed on the first $2,000 in cash or deposits. Such amounts would continue to be assessed at the actual rate of return. For amounts over $2,000, the deemed rate of interest would be the higher of the actual rate or 10 per cent per annum. This initiative will not apply to the income test for health benefit cards and associated fringe benefits for those people who are eligible for the cards on 28 March 1991. The new provision will affect the fringe benefit entitlements of anyone who applies for a health care card after 1 March 1991. Recent major disasters in Australia have called for a re-examination of our capacity to respond quickly and sympathetically to the needs of people who suffer loss of income and property from such terrible events. The Newcastle earthquake and the Nyngan and Char1eville floods showed that the existing provision for disaster relief payments was unduly cumbersome. It required applicants for assistance to provide details of assets and income that are not usually obtainable in the circumstances. No additional social security assistance has hitherto been available for existing pensioners and beneficiaries who were caught up in a major disaster. I am pleased to say that this Bill provides for a new disaster relief payment. It will be payable to a person who has suffered an interruption to his or her normal source of livelihood and to people whose home or place of employment has been significantly damaged in a major disaster. Where a person is receiving pension or benefit, the disaster relief payment will be paid as a supplement equivalent to two weeks of maximum rate pension. Where the person is not currently receiving a pension or benefit, he or she will receive a single payment of the same amount. As is demonstrated by the Government's announced disability reforms, the foreshadowed changes to the focus of the unemployment benefit system and the upcoming restructuring of sickness benefit, this Government is committed to encouraging the return to the work force of pensioners and beneficiaries and reducing long term dependence on income support. As part of this overall strategy, an em- 1990. ployment entry payment of $100 for long term unemployment beneficiaries and Jobsearch allowance recipients was introduced in February 1989 under the Newstart program. This payment is designed to help such people meet the costs of entering employment, such as clothing, tools or equipment, transport to work and union fees. Sole parent pensioners joining the work force have to meet those same initial costs and it has been decided to introduce an employment entry payment for this group of pensioners. This Bill also provides for the extension of the area within which a remote area allowance will be paid to social security pensioners and beneficiaries. This extension .is allied with a new provision of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 which sets the boundaries of such areas for the purpose of allowing a zone rebate to people who live in remote areas. In the interests of consistency and logic, social security and tax laws use the same delineated areas to establish eligibility. The Commissioner for Taxation can apply his discretion to nominate an area just outside a special area as being inside that area, as a widely scattered community may fall on either side of arbitrary boundaries. It has been decided that where the Commissioner has exercised this discretion, the area included shall also be considered for social security purposes to lie inside that boundary. There can be no doubt that Chinese nationals who were in Australia at the time of the Tiananmen Square massacre are in a very difficult position regarding their plans to return to China. Given their special circumstances, the Government has decided to introduce special arrangements to provide income support for them although they would not normally satisfy the residence requirements for Australian benefits. This Bill will allow access to special benefit, family allowance and family allowance supplement to Chinese nationals who were in Australia on 20 June 1989 and who have a class 4 temporary entry permit. This measure will be taken to have come into effect on 1 August I am pleased to announce some changes to the carer's pension which will remove some unnecessarily restrictive criteria for qualification for carer's pensions. Carer's pensions are paid to people who care for a severely handicapped person on a full time basis and thus are unable to enter the work force because of their responsibilities. It has been required that the carer live in the same house as the cared-for person and that the person being cared for be an age or invalid pensioner. New provisions in this Bill will allow people who are living in adjacent accommodation and who are caring for people in receipt of any appropriate pension or benefit from the Department of Social Security or the Department of Veterans' Affairs to be eligible for a carer's pension. The remaining provisions in this Bill are designed to increase the efficiency of delivery of social security entitlements and the equity of access to benefits for various groups of people. For example, the rent assistance threshold is not indexed so adjustments are necessary from time to time to ensure that eligibility remains focused on those paying high rents. Accordingly, this Bill would increase the prescribed rent assistance threshold by $5. This move has been deliberately timed to coincide with an indexation increase for pensions and benefits to ensure that most recipients will not experience a decline in income. I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr N. A. Brown) adjourned. NA Second Reading Debate resumed from 22 August, on motion by Mr Duffy: That the Bill be now read a second time.",128
182,Mr NA BROWN,ICSID IMPLEMENTATION BILL,"Menzies) (8.48)This debate is on the ICSID Implementation Bill 1990. As with the previous debate, I am in effect making this speech on behalf of the honourable member for  to return to Melbourne. I do this with some hesitation, not because I disagree with any of his speech, but because I have always had some concern about reading out other people's speeches since I heard of the experience concerning Sir William MCMahon when he was Treasurer. He was invited to open a resort development. As he was not able to attend this function, he deputed Sir Roland Wilson to attend and speak on his behalf. Sir Roland Wilson was provided with a speech which he was told not to alter in any way-not that I have been told not to alter this speech in any way, of course. When Sir Roland Wilson read the speech that he had been provided with, apparently he thought there were some alterations that should be made to it and drew these to the attention of the then 'Treasurer's office. He was given a very strict reprimand that he had been told once and would then be told again that the speech was not to be altered in any way. So Sir Roland apparently dutifully went off to the resort development and read out the speech which started, 'This is a wonderful resort development and Sonia and I would love to spend a weekend here together'. That is why .I have always been hesitant about reading other people's speeches. So I will have to make some slight changes as I go along. We have before the House a Bill for an Act to amend the International Arbitration Act 1974 and the International Organisations (Privileges and Immunities) Act 1963, the short title of which is the ICSID Implementation Bill 1990. The purpose of the Bill under consideration is to establish the legislative framework needed for Australia to ratify the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Dis1990 putes between States and Nationals of Other States, sometimes referred to as the Washington Convention. For the purposes of this debate I will simply refer to it as the Convention. The Convention was formulated by the executive directors of International Bank for Reconstruction and Developmentthat is, the World Bank-and it was opened for signature in 1965 and entered into force in 1966. Australia signed the Convention on 24 March 1975 and at present there are 91 member state parties to the Convention, including most of Australia's major trading partners. The Convention sets up a mechanism for the resolution of disputes arising from international investment, such disputes being between contracting statesÂ· and nationals of other contracting st;ltes. As honourable members will be aware, that is really part of the expanding structure of arrangements relating to arbitration. Australia in fact now has several arbitration centres where a lot of domestic international commercial Â·disputes are arbitrated upon. I know it is the Government's intention-an intention the Opposition supports-that Australia should, as far as possible, become a centre for the arbitration of commercial disputes. The operative provisions of the Bill can be divided into two parts. The first is the insertion of a new part IV and a new schedule, being the English text of the Convention, into the International Arbitration Act. Here I refer to clauses 3 to 5 ofÂ· the Bill. A notable provision here is proposed section 35, which will incorporate the enforcement provisions of the various uniform State commercial arbitration Acts for the enforcement of awards made pursuant to the Convention. Here again we can note that the States do have commercial arbitration Acts because arbitration is now a popular means of resolving disputes, which has given rise to a lot of conferences on arbitration. In fact, I think it was Sir Lawrence Street who said that there had been more conferences on the arbitration of international disputes than there had been arbitrations of international disputes. So it is the coming thing and something that really should be encouraged. The second group of operative provithe sions of the Bill includes clauses 6 to which amend the International Organisaan tions (Privileges and Immunities) Act to give effect to the privileges and imtechnology. munities provisions which are set out in the Convention. Under clause 2 of the Bill and article 68 of the Convention the operative provisions of the Bill are to commence on a date to be fixed by protracting clamation which shall not be earlier than 30 days after Australia has ratified the Convention and shall be no later than six months after that date. I turn now to the Convention to something about its substance. Chapter is essentially constitutional in nature establishes the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes, which I will refer to as the centre, but which known as ICSID. It is located quarters of the World Bank in Washington, DC. Chapter II, comprising articles 25 to 27, deals with the jurisdiction of the centre, which under article 25(1) tends to: . . . any legal dispute arising directly out investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contractthe ing State) and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to that dispute in writing to submit to the Centre. Consent to arbitration by the centre may take the form of a contractual clause concerning arbitration of a future dispute drawn up at the time the investis ment agreement is entered into or subjurisdiction, mission of an existing dispute to arbitration. ICSID has published model clauses to assist the drafter in formulating these. Mere adherence by a state to the Convention does not constitute consent to submit any given dispute to ICSID provides a structure by which the parties can agree to have their disputes submitted to arbitration at the centre. Of course, the question arises, 'What investment?' because this applies to vestment disputes, and the term 'investmust ment' is not defined. Experience has the shown that a wide range of investment disputes-including joint venture projparties ects, contracts for the transfer of technology and building projects-come within ambit of the Convention. By avoiding 8, definitional problems the Convention has inherent flexible nature which takes 1963 into account changes in industry and Next there is chapter III-articles 28 to 35-which deals with the conduct of conciliation proceedings. Under article 28 any contracting state or a national of a constate may institute conciliation proceedings by means of a written request to the Secretary-General of ICSID. Under article 35, except where the parties otherwise agree, neither party to conciliation say proceedings may rely on any communiI cations made during those proceedings in and subsequent arbitration or legal proceedings-a notion which was incorporated in the earlier Conciliation and Arbitration is Acts in Australia and which I imagine is at the headprobably still there. Chapter IV, covering articles 36 to 49, is concerned with the conduct of arbitraextion proceedings. So, it having been decided that the matter is to be submitted to the jurisdiction of this body, and it of an having been decided that it comes within ambit of the body, the question then arises as to how the proceedings are to be consent conducted. Arbitration proceedings are invoked by the use of a written request in similar terms to that described above conor treaty cerning conciliation. Under article 41, the Arbitral Tribunal the judge of its own competence or a notion contrary to our domestic law system, but one that is commonly found in the area of international arbitration. An example of this can be found in article 16 of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law but (UNCITRAL) model law on international commercial arbitration. Under article 42 the Tribunal must decide the dispute in accordance with such rules of law as may is be agreed by the parties and, in the abinsence of such agreement, the Tribunal apply the law of the state party to diSpute and such rules of international law as may be applicable. Further, if the agree, the dispute may be decided ex aequo et bono-in other words, according to notions of fairness. Section 5 of chapter IV, covering articles 50 to 52, provides certain post-award remedies in the following terms: firstly, a party may ask the Tribunal to supplement its award if the Tribunal has failed to decide any questions submitted to it; secondly, a party may request an interpretation of the meaning and scope of the award; thirdly, a party may request revision of the award on the basis of new facts coming to light which could decisively affect it: and, finally, a party may request annulment of the award on grounds specified in article 52, which are that the Tribunal acted beyond its powers, that it was not properly constituted, that a member of the Tribunal had been corrupted or that the award does not contain reasons. Next there is section 6 of chapter IV, covering articles 53 to 55, which provides that an award is final and binding on the parties. This is important in arbitration proceedings to bring them to an end. Not only the parties but the lawyers and others involved want to bring these proceedings to an end, and it is important that awards are final and binding on the parties. This section provides that an award is final and binding on the parties and that each contracting state must enforce an award as if it were a final judgment of a court, subject to any exception permitted by its domestic law relating to sovereign immunity. Chapter V, articles 56 to 58, sets out procedures to deal with vacancies in the arbitral tribunal. Chapter VI, articles 59 to 61, deals with the cost of proceedings, including both the costs of the arbitral tribunal and the costs of the parties in following manner: first of all, in the case of conciliation proceedings, costs are to be borne equally by the parties and, secondly, in the case of arbitration proceedings, the cost of proceedings is a matter ' to be determined by the arbitral tribunal. Chapter VII, covering articles 62 and 63, provides that proceedings are to take place in Washington D.C. unless the parties otherwise agree to the proceedings taking place at the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague, or any other approved centre. It is possible that at a future time Australia could host an approved centre. As I said earlier, it is the Government's hope-and we support the Government in this-that Australia will continue to be an active centre for arbitration and will expand its. involvement to being a host centre for international arbitrations. , Chapter VIII,article 64, provides that any disputes between contracting parties relating to the interpretation or application of the Convention may be resolved by the International Court of Justice. Chapters IX and X deal with procedures for the amendment of the Convention and procedures for the ratification of the Convention respectively. ICSID has formulated regulations and rules for the conduct of arbitration and conciliation proceedings which, by virtue of these provisions that I have discussed, are made applicable in those proceedings unless the parties otherwise agree. During the 1980s the case load of ICSID has significantly increased, and the majority of such cases have been settled without the need for a final award. Having outlined that structure, I should briefly mention some of the lessons that can be learned from the case law that relates to the Convention. The experience of other contracting states to the Convention has shown that there are some limitations with the drafting of the Convention, and we would ask the Government to give consideration to this matter. These limitations concern the following areas: first of all, with respect to the question of jurisdiction, one issue has been the effect that the Convention the may have on limiting State sovereignty. In this respect, arbitral tribunals have taken a broad view of the concept of jurisdiction and of the term 'investment'. I would refer the House, and the Government for later consideration by it, to the case of Amco-Asia v. Republic of Indonesia in 1984, reported at 23 ILM, page 351, where in response to an argument that an agreement to arbitrate should be construed restrictively since it could not limit a state's sovereignty, the arbitral tribunal said that such an agreement should: . . . not be construed restrictively, nor as ter of fact, broadly or liberally. It is to strued in a way which leads to find out and to respect the common will of the parties: such a method of interpretation is but the application of the fundamental principle pacta sunt servanda, a principle common, indeed, to all systems of internal law and to international law. A related problem is the position of multinational companies and whether they can be considered as nationals of a contracting state-a question that can be resolved by seeing whether the subsidiaries of a multinational company can be treated as being under the foreign control of the parent company. The second matter that has arisen is the question of what substantive law should apply in the resolution of disputes that have been submitted to ICSID. The common practice of parties to investment agreements has been for the domestic law of the host nation to apply. However, difficulties have arisen where the parties have not specified the applicable law, for example where a nation does not have a unified legal system because bf its colonial heritage. The difficulty in this area arises from applying the relevant laws which may resolve such conflict of laws. Article 42(1), when referring to 'rules on the conflict of laws', really refers to rules of private international law which govern the choice of law. However, this point appears to have been overlooked in the 1983 decision in Klockner Industries v. Republique Unie de Cameroun, a note which appears in volume 1 of the Journal of International Arbitration, at page 145, where the arbitral tribunal applied Cameroon's domestic conflict of law rules to decide that French law applied as the investment project was located in the francophonic part of Cameroon. So at least we know what the situation was there. The third matter relates to multipartite arbitration. We would suggest that the third limitation is that the Convention as presently drawn does not cover multipartite arbitrations. Due to the complexities of contemporary transnational investment agreements, disputes may arise involving different parties that are subject to separate proceedings, even though the factual a matand legal issues may be closely connected . be conThe Convention as presently drafted only covers disputes between two single parties, and in the absence of agreement multipartite disputes or proceedings cannot be dealt with by ICSID. This is obviously an undesirable feature if the Convention is to have relevance to the problems that face the international economic community. However, the appropriate response to issues such as those I have raised is that such difficulties should be resolved at the international level. Furthermore, parties can, by the use of appropriate arbitration clauses, overcome these sorts of problems. It would not be appropriate to attempt to overcome such problems by moving amendments to this Bill; we simply highlight these problems so that we can say to the Government, in a constructive way, that the Convention and the Bill are not perfect, and Australia should play an active part in negotiating changes to theÂ· Convention to improve its efficacy and relevance. In recent years Australia has become a leader in the field of international arbitration in the Asia-Pacific region and, as I have said, we support the Government's initiatives in this regard. It is hoped that implementation of the ICSID Convention will encourage this process and that at a future time Australia will host arbitration proceedings under the Convention. Furthermore, implementation may also assist in attracting foreign investment to Australia in that the ground rules for resolving any disputes associated with foreign investment will be clearly established. So we support the Bill but we wish to say that the Convention that it implements is not entirely perfect. The Convention can be improved upon in the interests of facilitating the prompt and equitable resolution of international investment disputes, and we would ask the Government, with the resources at its disposal, in cooperation with the private sector to look into the matter we have proposed and use the existing provisions of the Convention as a starting point to be built upon with a view to making it more relevant for contemporary transnational investment disputes, and we are sure the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) will take this up. Finally, there are two issues which require immediate consideration. First, we would ask the Government whether, pursuant to article 25(1), it intends to designate what it describes as any constituent subdivision or agency of the Commonwealth which will for the purposes of the Convention assume the status of a contracting state. For example, could a dispute between a foreign corporation and a Commonwealth agency or a State government fall within the ambit of the Convention in the absence of such a designation, and would it not be desirable that they should all be covered? The second matter is whether the Government under article 25(4) intends to notify ICSID of the or classes of disputes which it would or would not consider submitting to the jurisdiction' of ICSID? So we do draw the attention of the Attorney-General to those two matters, and also the various matters that we have suggested in the course of these remarks might usefully be pursued with a view to improving the workings of the Convention. They are, of course, to a large extent technical matters and they do not detract from our support for the Bill. We support this Bill because it is common sense, it enables a structure under this international convention to be set up in Australia, and it will contribute substantially . to the resolution of international investment disputes. It may, in fact, attract to Australia arbitration work and the material benefits that that would bring. It may attract to Australia investment, because the rules for the resolution of disputes, if they arise, will be clear and they will be clearly set out and known to the parties. Generally, it is a very desirable measure. As I have said already, it fits in with a structure that is now well under way in Australia, not only with respect to domestic commercial disputes, but also with respect to internat:onal commercial disputes, where we are now finding that arbitrations on these disputes are taking place in Australia. Both in Melbourne and in Sydney there are centres for the arbitration of commercial disputes which are used regularly for arbitration. In fact, the arbitration movement. has grown considerably .in Australia in recent years. The Institute of Arbitrators Australia endeavours successfully to improve the skills of arbitrators and serves as a repository of knowledge acquired as a result of arbitration experience. All of those things are desirable. In part, they come about due to the fact that many commercial interests find that it takes too long and it is too expensive to have disputes resolved in the courts. That explains the rise in the amount of arbitration domestically. With respect to international disputes, the law that is applicable has been such a complicated matter that anything that is designed to improve it must 'class be of benefit to the commercial community. Therefore, we compliment the Government on this. We support the Bill. We simply draw attention to some of those areas where we think perhaps the Convention could be improved at the international level, which is where it will have to be pursued. Mr LES SCOTf (Oxley) (9.12)-I am pleased to have the opportunity to rise to support the ICSID Implementation Bill 1990. ICSID stands for the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes. In our era of high technology, advanced telecommunications and fast efficient travel, no nation can isolate itself from the rest of the world. This is true also in the finance and investment area, which this Bill deals with. The result of this change is an ever-increasing need for all nations to adopt a cooperative approach to issues of global concern. The establishment of the United Nations was probably one of our most successful attempts to join together and address world issues in an effective and constructive manner. Australia's place in this shrinking world is growing and our national profile and significance in world affairs generally, and in the Pacific-Asian region, particularly, is increasing continually. We have, of course, been involved with the United Nations since its inception and became a founder member of the organisation in San Francisco in 1945. Australia has also participated, at various times, in virtually every major body in the United Nations system. Our involvement in international affairs also includes participation by Australian companies and investors in commercial ventures with other countries, which brings me to the real purpose of this Bill. This is a most important piece of legislation which will enable Australia to ify the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States. It is further recognition of our participation in world affairs. Australia has already shown its commitment to ensuring that proper structures are established to support our international trading and investment activities. The adoption last year, through legislation, of the Model Law on Commercial Arbitration developed by the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law was one step in this direction. This legislation builds on that achievement. Ratification of this Convention will enable Australia to service intering national investment disputes and to build on the expertise that we have already developed in other areas of international arbitration. The origins of the Convention go back to the mid-1960s and arose out of the recognition of the increasing need for an acceptable method of dealing with problems which arise out of our international investment activities. Prior to this time international investment operated in a very open environment. The protection and enforcement of contracts had been exercised through the use of diplomatic pressures. This, of course, meant that investors from wealthy and powerful nations held the upper hand in any commercial engagements which they entered into with government bodies in smaller or developing countries. More and more, nations throughout the world started to see that these arrangements were not satisfactory and that international players should be subject to the laws of the country in which they operated and that those laws should be enforceable on the international stage. Further, the entry of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development-the World Bank-into the international marketplace created a more unique set of difficulties with regard to dispute resolution. The World Bank now actually consists of three institutions-the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, to which was later added the International Development Associarattion and the International Finance Corporation. The common objective of these institutions is to help raise the standard of living throughout the world, particularly in the developing countries. The bank's origins can be traced to the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference which was held in July 1944 at Bretton Woods. During this conference articles of agreement concerning the formation of the bank were drawn up. These articles of agreement were signed by 28 participating countries, including Australia, in December 1945. Australia finally became a member of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank after the passof legislation in 1947. During the debate on that legislation the then Prime Minister, the honourable Ben Chifley, said: These institutions form part of the general structure for peace, security and welfare in the postwar world . . . Mr Chifley also said: Just as political isolation in the world would be an impractical policy for Australia, so do I think that economic isolation would be disastrous. His belief in this concept is as true today as it was 43 years ago. The World Bank's operation in the international marketplace over the years has also highlighted the deficiencies of using local courts for the settlement of international disputes in the investment area. Due to a growing realisation of these problems, the World Bank sponsored the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States-the ICSID Convention-which was opened for signing by all members of the World Bank and certain other countries, such as Switzerland, on 18 March 1965. The ICSID now has 91 contracting states which are parties to the Convention, including all of our major trading partners. Australia signed the Convention on 24 March 1975. Since that time much work has been undertaken towards the final step of ratification which will now come to fruition, with the consent of this Parliament, through the passing of this Bill. The Convention is the major worldwide dispute settlement instrument in relation to investment disputes. It enables investment disputes between states, including designated constituent subdivisions of states, and nationals of other states, to be submitted for resolution by conciliation or arbitration conducted under the auspices of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes, which is established in Washington DC. It also provides for the enforcement of arbitral awards made by the Centre. The Centre has two principal bodiesthe administrative council and the secretariat. The council is responsible for the overall management of the Centre, the budget, adoption of rules of procedure and the conduct of the conciliation and arbitration functions. Each contracting or member State has one representative on the council and the President of the World Bank is the ex-officio Chairman. The secretariat looks after the day-today operations of the Centre and the Secretary General is responsible for receiving and the registration of disputes after satisfying himself that they fall within the ambit of the Convention. He also has responsibility for the authentication of ICSID awards. Through its provision of this disputesolving machinery, ICSID aims to improve the international investment climate in countries which adhere to the Convention. This is particularly important for developing countries which rely heavily on investment funds from foreign sources. The dispute settlement role is undertaken by conciliation commissions and arbitral tribunals which are constituted once a dispute has been registered. Members of the commission or tribunal are drawn from panels established under the Convention. Member states may designate four people to each panel and the Chairman of the administrative council is also empowered to designate 10 people to each panel. By acceptance of the Convention a state does not automatically .consent to ICSID arbitration. In order for ICSID to playa role in a dispute, consent must be given by both parties to the dispute. However, once that consent is given, one party cannot unilaterally withdraw from ICSID arbitration. Consent to ICSID arbitration also excludes all other remedies, including diplomatic protection, although informal diplomatic exchanges to help with the settlement of a dispute may still take place. Further, a state may require that all local remedies are exhausted prior to the intervention of ICSID as a condition to its consent. Under this arrangement, ICSID would play a role in the dispute only once all other avenues available to the parties locally had failed to resolve the matter. Once ICSID has arbitrated on a matter, its awards, if not annulled internally, are final and binding on the parties. They are not subject to judicial review in any member state and, under the terms of the Convention, an ICSID award is considered a final judgment in any such state. The procedure for the recognition and enforcement of ICSID awards is made as simple as possible under the terms of the Convention. It provides that any party to an ICSID award may obtain recognition and enforcement of the award by furnishing, to the competent court or other authority designated for the purpose by each contracting state, a certified copy of the award. Under the terms of this legislation, the awards would be binding and enforceable in the supreme courts of the States and Territories of Australia. The centre has a conciliatory role also. Article 28 provides for the institution of conciliation proceedings by means of a written request to the secretary-general of the centre. The article also sets out the information that must be included in the request. As long as the secretary-general does not find that the matter is outside the jurisdiction of the centre, the request is registered and a conciliation commission is constituted. The commission can consist of a single conciliator or an uneven number of conciliators, as agreed by the parties to the dispute. Under article 34, the .commission has a duty to clarify issues in dispute between the parties and to try to bring about agreement between them on these issues. Herein lies a further opportunity for Australia to develop as a centre for international arbitration and conciliation. Countries in this region have a very different approach to resolving disputes. They avoid as much as possible the formal, legalistic, adversary process. The preferred approach by these cultures is to . strive for a negotiated consensual solution to conflicts-conciliation rather than arbitration. This attitude extends to both their personal as well as their commercial dealings. ICSID has a high success rate in resolving disputes brought before it and it would be fair to assume, in light of the modern trend in commercial disputes generally, that ICSID's conciliation role will be used more frequently. Conciliation would certainly be the preferred option for the majority of countries in the Asia-Pacific region. The Convention sets out in chapter 3 the method of submitting disputes to conciliation and other procedures, while article 63 in chapter 7 of the convention provides: . . . conciliation and arbitration proceedings may be held, if the parties so agree, (A) at the seat of the permanent court of Arbitration or of any other appropriate tution, whether private or public, with which the Centre may make arrangements for that purpose; or (B) at any other place approved by the Commission or tribunal after consultation with the Secretary-General. This article means that Australia could play an active role in providing ICSID dispute resolution service here, should the parties agree to this. Undoubtedly, as more commercial activity in this region gives rise to the probability of disputes in our area and considering the views of our neighbouring countries on the handling of these matters, as I have already outlined, it is not unreasonable to expect that many of the parties to such disputes will be happier to have the matter dealt with in their own region. This, of course, is a genuine opportunity-not a pie in the sky dream. Australia already has two centres for international arbitration: one in Sydney and the other in Melbourne. Both of these centres have been operating effectively for some time and there is no reason to believe that we could not build on the expertise that has been developed within these centres. Further, on the ratification of this Convention, Australia, as a contracting state, will be able to designate four people to each panel of conciliators and arbitrators. I only wish to take up a little more of the House's time, as I understand the Opposition is supporting this Bill. In conclusion, this Bill will not only enhance our standing internationally, but it will also provide an opportunity for us to play an active role in international investment dispute resolution. I commend the Bill to the House.",131
183,Mr DOWNER,ICSID IMPLEMENTATION BILL,"As all other speakers in this debate have pointed out, the ICSID Implementation Bill provides for a mechanism to establish a centre for the settlement of investment disputes internationally. This will provide three direct benefits, all of which will directly benefit Australia. First of all, there is no doubt that one of the benefits will be to give Australia the opportunity to build its reputation as a centre for international insticommercial arbitration and, in turn, that will give Australia some opportunity of building up what are sometimes described as services exports-and that, in itself, is one reason why this Bill should be supported. ' Secondly, it provides a direct advantage to Australian companies which are proposing to invest overseas as, fairly obviously, it provides a means to settle claims for any Australian company which may find that its assets overseas have been-as is politely said-appropriated, which usually means nationalised, often without any compensation whatsoever. Thirdly, it provides an opportunity for Australia to promote foreign investment in our own country which, as I will saying in a few minutes, is something we should always continue to focus our minds on. We should turn our back on the popular sentiment, which is to oppose foreign investment. This Bill gives foreign investors in Australia at least a theoretical sense of security that they may not othtransfer erwise have, although I suppose thattries even with a Labor Government-it is rather unrealistic to suggest that the of foreign investors in Australia would appropriated without compensation. Probably the Labor Party has abandoned that sort of sentiment-although you can never really be sure. What this legislation does though and what the International Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes does reflect, really, the growing level of investinvestment ment flows around the world. The fact that we now live in an age of national corporations where national boundaries are becoming less and less relat evant and we have conventions such as this and centres such as ICSID, as it called, is a very apposite reflection growing trend towards the internationalment isation of the global economy. We have more and more transnational corporanot tions the locality of whose headquarters is becoming increasingly irrelevant. Whether they are in Wichita, Kansas, Aachen, West Germany or Adelaide, South Australia is become being less less significant. I suspect that over the next 30 or 40 years that level of signifiguay cance will continue to decline. Some people use the expression 'the glob ali sat ion of the world economy' I suppose that is appropriate. From Ausacronym tralia's angle, the point is that we would be making a major mistake if, as a counimposed-try, we were to turn our backs on this concept of the globalisation of the. world economy and we were to throw up more and more barriers to foreign investment. Indeed, we would be severely disadvannot taged if other countries were to do same thing. This legislation really is tralia's small part in facilitating the growth of the globalisation of the world economy. Australians really need to understand that if we were to turn our back on this be international economic trend, it would that impose major costs on our country. We would obviously lose substantial q\lantities of foreign investment and that, in turn, would lead to the loss of jobs and the loss of potential jobs in our country. It would mean that we would lose the of technology from other counto Australia and that, in turn, would have very severe. implications for the assets competitiveness of our economy. We be would lose the capacity within our own economy to develop the comparative advantages that we already have through the benefits that flow from foreign investment. It is a matter of concern that there is, if you like, a populist sentiment in Australia at the moment against foreign is investment, but I think the anti-foreign lobby in Australia very much needs to understand the long term costs transof what it really stands for. To go on further, it is important to look this Bill in the context of what I regard as the most important single international is economic event of the age, which is the of that Uruguay Round of the General Agreeon Tariffs and Trade (GATT) negotiations. That is something that does gain a great deal of publicity in Australia, much to my chagrin, but something which is absolutely critical to the future evolution of the Australian economy and-let us not be too modest about itand the evolution of the global economy. One very significant aspect of the UruRound which is directly significant to this Bill are the negotiations on what are described as trade-related investment - and measures. It has the rather unfortunate of TRIMs. Trade-related investment measures are government measures",138
184,Mr DUFFY,ICSID IMPLEMENTATION BILL,Do you mean TRIPs?,139
185,Mr DOWNER,ICSID IMPLEMENTATION BILL,"No, TRIMs. The Attorney-General is getting confused. I am surprised that the Australian Labor the Party would be confused about TRIPs, Auswhich relates to intellectual property. Confusing the two clearly demonstrates a lack of intellectual property. TRIMs is about investment flows. The Minister was once the Minister responsible for the Uruguay Round. How quickly his memory has begun to diminish. I hope that he maintains focus on the legal matters for which he is responsible which are so important to Australia. TRIMs are government measures imposed on foreign investors. Those measures have wide-ranging effects on international trade. For example, companies that may invest in a particular country are sometimes required to export a percentage of the product that is produced in that foreign country or they must use local parts in the manufacturing process. The consequence is that the return on their investment is substantially diminished' and the effect on international trade is to reduce the volume of international trade which might otherwise have taken place. TRIMs was included in the Uruguay Round right from the outset in 1986. It is important to note that in particular it was' the United States that argued so strongly for TRIMs to be included in the Uruguay Round because of the United States' long standing corporate policies of investing in a wide range of countries around the world. I note that as the U ruguay Round has continued to evolve the United States has started to lose some of its enthusiasm for TRIMs, presumably because of concerns about its own balance of payments deficit and the investment of foreigners within the United Statesagain, a populist response to foreign investment within the United States. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) may yawn but I have spent a great amount of time sitting here listening to his answers in Question Time which are excuses for making statements in order to get his name in the newspaper the following day. He now wants to stop the Opposition using opportunities that it occasionally has to be able to participate in the affairs of the Parliament. His rather impolite interjection will lead me to continue my speech for slightly longer than I had originally intended.",139
186,Mr DUFFY,ICSID IMPLEMENTATION BILL,Not me.,140
187,Mr DOWNER,ICSID IMPLEMENTATION BILL,"No, not the Attorney General; I am referring to the other Minister at the table. I do not think I will go on too much about him. I will restrain myself.",140
188,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ICSID IMPLEMENTATION BILL,Mr Cowan)The honourable member for Mayo had better get back to the Bill.,140
189,Mr DOWNER,ICSID IMPLEMENTATION BILL,"I am getting back to it, Mr Deputy Speaker. There are a range of aspects of the TRIMs negotiations. There are 12 altogether. I will not go through all 12 of them. There are three that are of particular importance-the local content rules, the export performance rules and the foreign exchange rules. All of those are an extremely important part of these negotiations and there is no question that everything should be done in order to try to liberalise those various restrictions on foreign investment. The fact is that there has been a distinct lack of progress in the Uruguay Round on this whole issue of foreign investment. From my point of view that is certainly a matter of regret. The United States, as I said earlier, had taken a very bullish position on this issue. As the negotiations have gone on it has begun to lose its enthusiasm for it. Australia's position has been somewhat similar. Australia joined the United States in its enthusiasm to create a proper global framework for the free flow of investment but this is apparently one of the issues that seems to have fallen off the agenda for Australia. All of these issues of the Uruguay Round need to be looked at in the context of this Bill. The institutional arrangements established through this legislation-and globally established-need to work in the context of whatever may be achieved in the Uruguay Round. We need to look at foreign investment agreements as far as Australia is concerned in a wider context as well. There are a range of investment arrangements that Australia has considered entering into in recent years in order to protect Australian investments overseas. Whilst I accept that ICSID will appear to protect Australian investment overseas very successfully provided that the countries in which Australian firms invest are covered by ICSID, the bilateral agreements still remain extremely important. I was pleased to see that the Government entered into a bilateral investment agreement with Papua New Guinea fairly recently during the visit of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to that country. It is also important to note that when the Soviet Union proposed an investment agreement with Australia fairly recently the Australian Government by all accounts spurned those advances. The initiative first came from Australia in 1989 when the Prime Minister proposed to the Soviets that we should have some kind of investment agreement with that country. In response to those proposals from Australia the Soviet Foreign Ministry sent an outline treaty to Australia .. The consequence of its very friendly offer to our country has been that Australia has provided no response whatsoever. That is a shame because although there are major problems in our commercial relationship with the Soviet Union, above all, the failure of the Soviet Union to meet payments for wool that we have already sold to that country, we ought to try to continue the negotiations with the Soviets over an investment agreement in order to encourage Australian investment in the Soviet Union and joint ventures and to ensure that those investments are properly protected through a bilateral investment agreement. The decision by Australia to turn its back on an investment agreement with the Soviet Union is a very small-minded and disappointing approach taken by the Australian Government. We are apparently leave,ng the proposal by the Soviets in the bottom drawer of some office in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Countries such as South Korea, Japan and various countries in the European Community are negotiating similar agreements with that country and are establishing as a result of that joint venture businesses in the Soviet Union, gaining some trade, some balance of payments advantage out of doing that, and assisting the Soviet economy at a time which is politically sensitive and difficult for the Soviet Union, yet we apparently are doing nothing because we have decided that it would be better to devote our attention to other priorities. I think that is an unfortunate aspect of the Government'- approach to foreign investment agreements with other countries. I do not have a great deal more to say about the ICSID legislation except that it is certainly legislation that we support. Since I have five minutes left I am very tempted, because the Minister for Employment, Education and Training is in the chamber, to go on, as I said earlier, having regard to the great amount of time we have had to spend listening to his answers. In the interests of ensuring that the Parliament proceeds to the next piece of legislation I will leave my remarks at that and say once more that this is a matter that the Opposition is happy to go along with.",140
190,Mr DUFFY,ICSID IMPLEMENTATION BILL,"in reply-This matter has a somewhat long history. Australia signed the ICSID Convention in March 1975. Consultation with the States followed for a number of years. Later there was a need to consider the application of certain taxation privileges and immunities required by the Convention and how these related to long standing policy on the taxation of international organisations. That caused considerable delays. Eventually legislation to implement the Convention was prepared early this year but introduction of that legislation was interrupted by the 1990 Federal election. We are here at last. The ICSID Implementation Bill, when enacted, will enable Australia to ratify the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States. The Convention establishes the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes-ICSID-and provides facilities for arbitration or conciliation of investment disputes between states and nationals of other states under the auspices of the Centre. The ratification of the Convention by Austral-m be an important step in advancing this Government's objective of developing Australia's role in international commercial dispute resolution. It will enable Australia to service investment disputes and build on the already not inconsiderable expertise which has been developed in our two centres for international arbitration which have been established in Melbourne and Sydney. This is the second time this evening that we have had a bipartisan attitude to Bills before this House. It is a pity it cannot be that way on more occasions. I thank those who have made a contribution to the debate, including the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown) and the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott). I will refer to some of the matters raised by the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) in a moment. The honourable member for Menzies has a particular interest in arbitration. has supported all steps by the Government in this regard, and that is appreciated. The answer to the question he raised in relation to Article 25 is basically that all States and Territories have been consulted to seek their consent to be designated as constituent subdivisions under Article 25 of the Convention, and all jurisdictions except Western Australia have consented to be so designated and will be so designated at the time of ratification. The honourable member for Oxley was able to support the Bill in a practical way because of the significance that he placed on aspects of it in relation to investment. It is a matter in which he has a considerable interest. The honourable member for Mayo indicated to us that he was really talking more about the question of foreign investment and also the issue of TRIMstrade-related investment measures-in the Uruguay Round. Tonight we were all being extremely charitable because some of the matters touched on by the honourable member for Mayo were, I think, stretching the rules of relevance in relation to the debate, but I think the former Minister for Trade, my colleague the Minister for Employment, Education and .Training (Mr Dawkins), and myself as a former Minister for Trade Negotiations were riveted by the brief tutorial that we were given on the Uruguay Round, and therefore his remarks were relevant in the sense that one can always learn something in this place from the most surprising people. Mr DownerYou had forgotten what TRIMs was.",141
191,Mr DUFFY,ICSID IMPLEMENTATION BILL,"No, I had not actually forgotten what TRIMs meant. TRIMs was, as you indicated, exactly what it is. I indicated to you that you may have been confusing it with TRIPs-trade-related aspects of intellectual property rightsjust to see whether you did know what you were talking about. Mr Downer-Did I?",142
192,Mr DUFFY,ICSID IMPLEMENTATION BILL,"You were quite right, but we were not sure of that on this side of the House. In closing the debate, I again He say that it is good occasionally to have a matter in this place where there is bipartisan support. I thank honourable members who contributed to the debate. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Duffy) read a third time. NA NA DEVELOPMENT BILL 1990 Second Reading Debate resumed from 12 September, on motion by Mr Crean: That the Bill be now read a second time.",142
193,Mr DOWNER,RECONSTRUCTION AND,"The Opposition supports the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development Bill, which has been introduced by the Government, in effect, in response to the very significant changes which have taken place in east Europe, changes which I think all members of this House would agree were unexpected and have been extraordinarily exciting for the whole world. We have seen in the last 12 months the collapse of the whole concept of central planning, of governments deciding how best to run economies and leaving the people out of that process of decision-making and, in particular, we have seen the failure of concept of government-run enterprises a move, at least in East Europe, if not any great extent in our own country, wards the concepts which are nowadays known as privatisation, which used to known as denationalisation, and also a process of deregulation. All of these things are obviously of ticular pleasure to those of us on this side of the House and, since the very foundaaid tion of both the National Party and the Liberal Party, and the Liberal Party's predecessors, have been axiomatic in our philosophy. But clearly these very exciting changes which have taken place in East Europe-the liberalisation of the econof omy and, I suppose even more imporCurtain-which tantly than that, the liberation of the populations of those countries-have creassistance ated very substantial upheaval. That, suppose, is an obvious thing to say. understand that that upheaval':""""""':'not just changes. political upheaval but economic upheaval-will create many personal diffiin culties and to some extent some personal hardship, because in any process of change there are people who win and people who lose. There is no doubt that in east rope there will be a growing sense of security about the duration of east employment. There probably will be a growth in unemployment and - ange of other developments will be matte-s ,?f very real concern to the local populations. Just looking at the issue from an ecoerating nomic perspective, the success of the changes that are taking place in east rope is absolutely essential in orderÂ· consolidate the gains that have been made and to guarantee that the political changes will remain in place. Living standards in time, have to rise. There prospect that living standards will very rapidly rise, not least in what was until 3 October as east Germany, which is now part of the newly united Germany. The whole issue of political stability very closely linked to the question of nomic success. The question that this Bill eventually addresses and the question that the Western world has had to address is how the West can help to ensure that the political changes and political liberation the remain a permanent feature of eastern and Europe and possibly also the Soviet to Union, but also, if the West is going to tohelp to ensure that those changes remain permanent, what is the best way for the be West to provide that sort of assistance. At the time of the Group of Seven summit in Houston three months ago, Mr parGorbachev said that it was absolutely essential for the Soviet economy to receive from the West in order, to use his word, to 'stabilise' conditions in that country. Whilst there are some divisions within the Soviet Union as to the degree of assistance the West should be providing the Soviet economy, we on this side what used to be described as the Iron no longer exists-would agree that there is a role for some Western to ensure that both the ecoI nomic and the political changes in that We part of the world remain permanent There are a number of different ways which the West can provide assistance. Obviously this Bill is about just one of those four ways that I would like to identifyin which the West can provide assistEuance. The first and the most important inway that the Western world can assist the European economies and the Soviet economy is to provide market opportunities for businesses within those economies. There is absolutely no substitute for providing open access to companies opwithin those countries. If we close markets to east Europe and to the Soviet EuUnion, the consequence will be to guarto antee that those countries remain in poverty and that they are unable to get out of the economic circumstances they find will, themselves in after years and years of is every socialist governments. So it is essential first and foremost that known the European Community, the United States, Japan-particularly those three centres of the capitalist world-and counis tries such as Australia provide market acecocess to those economies within our own countries. I suppose it is not really for us to lecture them but perhaps I could make one comment about the way in which they should run their economies. They should also provide market access to the West so that we can get a proper two-way flow in international trade which reflects the comparative advantages of the different economies. It is also true that investment flows should be very substantially liberated, and I think the experience of many developing countries which have inhibited trade and investment flows is a very salutary one to the evolving economies of east Europe and the Soviet Union. I want to emphasise that one can have a European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), which this Bill is all about, but none of those sorts of measures are a substitute for providing free and open trade opportunities for the economies of eastern Europe and for those economies ensuring there is market access also for the Western world into their countries. The second form of assistance that could be provided is the assistance which I would describe as 'large cheque assistance'. This was one of the issues that was considered at the Group of Seven (G7) summit in Houston back in July. There was some debate and indeed some disagreement at the G7 summit over whether the Western world, in particular those seven economies, should simply provide very substantial wads of aid, particularly for the Soviet economy, less so for the eastern European countries. I was interested that a compromise was reached eventually at the G7 summit, which effectively said that if individual G7 countries wanted to provide assistance then that was their prerogative, they could do that; but a number of those countries made it perfectly clear that they did not want to pour money into a black hole, as it was described by Mrs Thatcher. It was thought that the Soviet economy in particular, which was being addressed at the G7 summit, was really not likely to benefit from that .sort of assistance from overseas. I quote very specifically the British eign Secretary, Douglas Hurd, who summed up the views of those countries that did not want just to. provide a large cheque to the Soviet economy to help it on its way. He said this: We don't believe theythat is, the Sovietshave the economic reforms in place which would justify now putting huge sums of Western money into their pockets. Their pockets have got a hole in them, and when you've got somebody who's asking you for money, you may say: 'Well, mend the hole in your pants before you actually fill that pocket with dimes and quarters'. I am surprised that the British Foreign Secretary should talk about dimes and quarters, but the point is very apposite, that there is no rationale for pouring money into an economy if the structure of that economy is not such that it is going to benefit from that sort of aid. There are thousands of examples around the world of aid projects and aid donations to developing countries, which have come to nothing because the economic structures within those countries have simply not been appropriate to help those countries out of their economic problems. The concept of providing large cheques to eastern European economies in order to help them on their way is a particularly unappealing one. The challenge should be for those economies first to start developing the appropriate economic structure before they really seek that sort of aid. The third kind of assistance that can be provided is specific aid projects-for example, providing assistance with training and retraining; providing assistance with the establishment of a commercial code in countries which are not used to market economies and therefore, the appropriate kind of commercial code for a market economy; and providing assistance with the establishment of the right kinds of accounting systems. That makes a lot of sense. Those specific aid projects have an enormous degree of value and are something that we-or at least the Western world-should look very closely at. The fourth form of assistance, which is the assistance this particular Bill is about, Foris creating some sort of regional development bank, in this case the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. I do not know that really there is a lot of value in my going through precisely what this Bill and therefore the bank is actually about, but put simply, it raises capital from 42 countries-a capital base of some $15 billion, which is a very substantial capital base for a bank. The proposition is that there should be investment from that bank in equity in private companies and in state-owned enHowever, terprises to ensure that those enterprises turn their backs on the way they operated in the past and instead face the prospect of becoming competitive and even vately-owned enterprises. One of the interesting features of this particular bank is that it is designed to assist the eastern European and the Soviet economies with the process of privatisation. Any honourable member in the ment h who . .rushed . around Australia t at pnv-tISatlOn was a tern e - ew Ig Thatchente, dangerous neo-fascIst sort ?onc-pt-a-d there are plenty of people m thIS .Parl1a.me-t who have run around Austraha saymg Just that-:-ou?ht. to conbe temp.la-e the fact t.hat thIS BIll IS about p-ovIdmg that assIstance through a reis glOnal. deyel-pme!lt bank for the process of pnvatIsatlOn m eastern Europe and as-, to a limited extent, in the Soviet Umon. This bank has within its charter the of underwriting the issue of securities. That is a form, I suppose, of privatisatrophe. tion. It is a very important part of the process of privatisation and it will also assist various companies, once they have become competitive, and in some cases privately owned, in getting into the mardeserves kets of other parts of the world. This concept of a regional development bank is very much part and parcel of getting eastern Europe to do what, face it, we in Australia have not very successfully done over the past seven years. But in any case it is good to see that our Government in this country is prepared to direct efforts and provide money to direct efforts in other parts the world towards the process of privatisPresident ation, even if it is anathema to the losophy of the Labor Party. Those are the four different ways that we can provide assistance to these evolving east European economies and to the Soviet economy, and this Bill addresses one of them. But as I said, it is not the best option. The best option is, without any doubt, ensuring that those economies have proper opportunities to develop markets throughout the capitalist world. suring thatthistheis process certainly one way of enof privatisation and competitive market forces begin to operate on the other side of what used to pribe described as the Iron Curtain. This new bank is to be presided over by a man called Jacques Attali. Jacques At-ali is a French economist who, interestmgly enough-Parli- Mr Langmore-A French socialist. 'bl saying R' h . Mr DOWNERI am commg . t 0 th a.t t, Interestingly enough, he is a part time of economic adviser to President Mitterrand, the socialist President of France. Although you, Mr Deputy Speaker, may hoping that President Mitterrand is a great example of socialism at work, that not the case. It is worth reflecting on the fact that when he first came to power as the President of France he introduced a socialist program which' would be very much applauded by the honourable memrole ber for Fraser (Mr Langmore) and that program was a complete and utter catasAs a result, French economic policies were turned on their head. There was a complete change in economic direction in France and President Mitterrand at least to be applauded for being a man who was pragmatic and intelligent enough to pick up the themes of common sense which are increasingly flowing through the let us whole of the world, East or West. But coming back to the Bill, and particularly to Jacques Attali, who is going to be the President of this new bank, I point out that it is interesting that his boss was one of those people whom I have actually of praised. I used not to be a great fan of Mitterrand, but I have general phipraise for his pragmatism and his common sense in more recent years. It is interesting that his boss-and, interestingly enough, Chancellor Kohl, the Chancellor of West Germany-was one of those people who at the G7 summit really favoured the sort of large cheque philosophy, the concept of just providing big wads of money for the Soviet economy. I hope that Monsieur Attali, once he takes over as President and this bank is really under way, turns his back on that concept that his former boss was advocating at the G7 summit and listens to the very sound advice from people such as Mrs Thatcher and Douglas Hurd, who I have already quoted, and also, within the context of the charter of this bank, ensures that the money from this bank is used in a constructive and effective way. Certainly, he will be assisted very much. by Ernest Stern, who has an outstanding record in the World Bank, and by John Flemming of the Bank of England. I think they are both persons in senior positions in that bank who will do a great deal to help it on its way. But I do not want to pretend that it will be easy going for the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Indeed, before I rose to speak, my staff passed to me a copy of a Reuters report which appeared this evening, headed 'New bank for eastern Europe expects loss in start-up year'. Perhaps it is understandable that a new bank expects a loss in its start-up year. But it is interesting to see that a leaked report says that this bank, which is set up to promote economic reform in east Europe, expects to lose about $US44m in 1990-91, although the confidential financial projections drawn up by the staff of the bank show that it could move into the black in 1992. It is a warning, though, that the bank must ensure that it is a commercial operation and that it operates within the spirit of the capitalviously ism which it is designed to help to foster and which east Europe is turning towards-and which, of course, the Soviet Union is straining to turn towards also. But there are very real dangers. The Economist magazine, which is a real sceptic about the future of this bank, I have to say-much more so than I am-has certainly drawn attention to these. An article in the Economist of 22 September this year stated: The EBRD will combine the functions of the commercial-terms side of the World Bank and its affiliate, the International Finance Corporation, which specialises in promoting private enterprise. That is a terrific thing, to promote private enterprise, although I do not think the honourable member for Fraser would go along with that. The Economist also stated: The Bank and the IFC already have the expertise that the EBRD is having to assemble from scratch-partly, one fears, by drawing talented people from EASTERN EUROPE, where they would do most good, to London, where they will enjoy a higher standard of living. That is a pretty cynical thing to say; we all know how cynical journalists are. But all I am really saying is that it is a warning. It is important that this bank remains commercially oriented and does not get lured by the sorts of dreams and arguments of the interventionists and the antimarketeers around the world, and indeed around this Parliament. The Treasury, in particular, argues that this bank has cost benefits as far as Australian membership is concerned, although I suspect that our membership has much more to do with-and appropriately-a general Australian commitment to ensure that the changes in east Europe are successful. I said at the beginning of my speech that I fervently hope that they will be and I believe that the West has to do all that it can to ensure that those changes are successful. But the Treasury says that there are obvious costs, and that is what I suppose this Bill is basically about; it is about appropriating money for Australia's contribution to the capital of the bank. The financial cost to Australian taxpayers is $9m per annum over five years-obnot a great cost out of a total Australian Budget, but it does impose a cost on Australian taxpayers, particularly at a time when we are becoming something of a basket case. The Treasury has also pointed out that there are direct benefits of Australian membership; it always says this about development banks, and it remains to be seen to what extent this projection of the Treasury turns out to be reality. First of all, there is the benefit, which I have already described, of our playing our part in an important international event. Secondly, there is a hope that through our involvement in this bank some contracts may come Australia's way, particularly from those companies that are assisted through equity investment from the EBRD, or perhaps from other forms of assistance from that bank. In particular, there is some hope that Australia's financial institutions may benefit. While nobody can predict the future-not even you, Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER - it remains to be seen whether that will be the case. It is also argued that this bank gives us some kind of window into the new Europe. I suppose that in principle that is the case; but it remains to be seen. If this is Australia's only involvement in the exciting changes in the new Europe, it will. be a very disappointing effortand, of course, the Government will be quick to tell us that that is not the case and that Australia will do everything it can to take up the market opportunities that are provided for Australian firms, Australian businesses and Australian companies through the changes in the Soviet Union and east Europe. My concern is, though, that Australia in general is at this stage fairly slow on the uptake as far as taking up opportunities of changes in east Europe are concerned. Clearly, there are potential market opportunities for us in the resources and raw materials area. It is our mining companies and our farming sector that in the short term in any case stan<;l to gain the most from the opening opportunities in east Europe. Of course, some people will say that elaborately transformed. manufactures offer us opportunities-that we can sell services to the new east Europe and all of that. I hope very much that that is the case, but I think we just need to be clearheaded and realistic about this. The whole of the European Community is right there on the border of the new east Europe. In particular, Germany, the most powerful economy by a long way in western Europe, which I suppose one would describe the new Germany as being part of, will cream off the best part of the opportunities that exist in the manufacturing and services areas. So it is probably honest to say that the short term prospects for us lie in the resources, raw materials and agricultural areas. We on this side of the House, as I am sure everybody is aware, are very concerned that Australia take up those opportunities. When one thinks about Australian agriculture in particular, one's mind turns quickly to wool and the problems that we have with our wool industry and the importance of east Europe and the Soviet Union to the success of that industry. It is correctly argued that one of the reasons that our wool markets in east Europe and the Soviet Union have almost completely collapsed is a lack of foreign exchange in that part of the world. I suppose that, in so far as the EBRD provides effective assistance to the evolution of those economies, it will provide assistance to them in order to earn greater foreign exchange. But we have to ensure that we take a cold, hard-headed and effective look at ways to get our wool market back in place in east Europe and the Soviet Union. One of the things I believe we ought to be looking at is the prospect for countertrade, which as a country we have pretty much turned our backs on. It is interesting to note that India and the Soviet Union recently signed a five-year agreement for countertrade, under which the Indians will be selling jute and textiles to the Soviet Union in exchange for oil and gas. Who knows whether it will turn out to be a fact, but the prospect of this agreement is for there to be a 250 per cent growth in trade between India and the Soviet Union. The point is that both of those countries have seen the opportunities that exist in countertrade; yet we in Australia do not seem even at this stage to be thinking about the opportunities for developing countertrade with countries such as the east European countries and the Soviet Union, which are so seriously short of foreign exchange at this difficult time for them. However, the Soviet Union earns 80 per cent of its export income from oil and gas, and it is gaining very significantly, that very simple way, from the Gulf crisis. For every $1 increase in the world oil price, the Soviet Union gains something like $600m in foreign exchange-that ,is taking the $1 increase over a period of 12 months and the $600m coming from a one-year period. Clearly, the price of oil has gone up a great deal more than $1 at . this stage. The Soviet Union stands to gain substantial quantities of foreign exchange out of that very simple fact. I think that should give us some hope for gaining more opportunities for our wool exporters in the not too distant future. But, as I have been saying, one of the things we have to do, if we are really going to try to re-establish our wool market in the Soviet Union, is to look at the prospects for countertrade. It is disappointing that until this date, as anybody who is on top of the details of Australian trade strategy at the official level will know, neither the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade nor Austrade has particularly explored the opportunities for developing countertrade with that part of the world. Countertrade accounts for around 15 per cent of world trade. If one looks at what the west European trade ministries are doing, they have, almost to a country, established bureaus within their trade ministries to assist with the evolution of countertrade because they can see very obvious commercial advantage in their getting involved in countertrade. Austrade should follow the example of those west European trade ministries, and the Australian Government should ensure that it does, so that countertrade becomes an important part of our trade armoury in our dealings with the new eastern Europe and also with the rapidly changing Soviet Union, in particular in order to ensure that we can start to get back into the wool market in those countries. Indeed, if we turn our backs on countertrade, as we have been until now, then the prospects of our getting back into substantial wool sales to the Soviet Union and other eastern European countries-I suppose Poland in particular-are very in limited, at least in the short term. In conclusion, as I said at the beginning of my remarks, the ,coalition supports this legislation. We hope very much that the EBRD will be a substantial help to the development of the eastern European economies and also to the Soviet economy. It remains to be seen to what extent it will be effective. I think there is uncertainty about that, and certa,inly I haye been concerned to see the prospects for it making a very substantial loss in its first year. But perhaps, being reasonable about it, one would not expect the bank's first year to be its best year. There is always a concern that the bank remains commercially oriented and adopts the spirit of the marketplace, of free enterprise, which is of course what the changes in eastern Europe are all about. We on this side of the House-and those in most other parts of the worldhave turned our backs on socialist interventionist economic strategies. It is obviously of concern to the Labor Party that the world has done that, but the world has, and that is exciting for those on this side of the House. We want to ensure that any institutions designed to assist with that process enter into the full spirit of the market economy.",142
194,Mr LANGMORE,RECONSTRUCTION AND,"The honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) has had great fun with his ringing ideological rhetoric about what has been going on in eastern Europe and the lessons for the rest of the world. What he has been saying is quite simplistic and, in fact, quite extremist. He has also spoken for the full half an hour on a lot of matters quite irrelevant to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development Bill; I will be rather more brief. I rise to support the Bill, of course, because it does contribute to the unprecedented changes going on in eastern Europe. We have seen in the last couple of years major and dramatic changes to the political situation in eastern Europe-and they are about to happen to their economic system as well. All people throughout the world will welcome the end of the Cold War, which allows the relaxation of a lot of strategic tension and will permit diversion of attention to the far more important issues of economic and social policy. This Bill, to allow Australia to contribute to the European. Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), will be the small contribution that Australia makes to that restructuring process in eastern and central Europe. The honourable member for Mayo said that he saw the changes going on there as an endorsement of unlimited free marketeering. I think it is more accurate to regard the changes in eastern Europe as an expression of the triumph of social democracy, because the eastern Europe-m countries aspire to have a system similar to that which exists in western Europe. The system in western Europe is a social democratic system, one in which both the public sector and the private sector act cooperatively and in effective interdependence to improve living standards. It is not the policies of Bush and Thatcher which the eastern European countries are aspiring to emulate. Mr Downer-You hope not. MrLANGMORE-I hope for their own' good it is not. They are aspiring to have a system equivalent to that in West Germany, France and, until 1980, Britain, where living standards were rising steadily and where there was a degree of effi': ciency and equity in the way that those economies were operating. The system that the honourable member for Mayo would like to see involves no significant role for the public sector at alL Â·In fact, it is quite inconsistent that h- should be proclaiming the virtues of an unlimited free market system without government intervention whilst supporting this Bill. This Bill is about increasing public expenditure-something that the honourable member for Mayo is normally very reluctant to do. So he is in fact making quite an ideological and strategic concession in supporting this Bill, and I welcome that concession. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is an important initiative. It had its origins in a meeting of heads of government of the European Community held in December 1989. At that meeting, an in-principle agreement was reached' to establish the EBRD as soon as possible. In January of this year, at a meeting in Paris, 12 European Community countries-that is, western European countries-14 other developed countries, including Australia, and eight eastern European countries agreed to formally establish the bank. In addition, the meeting resolved that the EBRD would concentrate its lending on the private sector, on productive investment-not lend for infrastructure unless it would help the private sector----'and that, like other development banks, the EBRD would be able to lend no more than its capital. It would be able to finance its loans in the bond markets and not offer concessional credits. In May this year, 40 states, including Australia, New Zealand and Canada, signed the articles of agreement establishing the EBRD. The agreement has a number of purposes and functions. The purposes are to foster the transition towards an open market oriented economy and to promote private and entrepreneurial initiatives in central and eastern European countries committed to and applying the principles of multi-party democracy, pluralism and market economics-something which one would have to be crazy not to support. The issue that the honourable member for Mayo apparently fails to understand is not about whether one should support the market-obviously, the market is the most efficient way of allocating resourcesbut about the way in which the public sector should intervene in order to increase the efficiency of markets which generally fail. . The functions of the EBRD include: to assist the recipient member countries to implement structural and sectoral' economic reforms, and that includes decentralisation and privatisation; to help the economies of recipient countries become fully integrated into the international economy; to stimulate and encourage the development of capital markets; and to promote environmentally sound and sustainable development. The honourable member for Mayo made much of the fact that this Bill will assist privatisation. Of course the EBRD should assist privatisation. We are talking about economies in which the state owns nearly every major productive enterprise. In that situation, privatisation makes a lot of sense. In a country such as Australia, where we have a very small public sector, there is a much more difficult question to answer: whether particular enterprises should be in the public or private sector. That issue should be addressed pragmatically-not ideologically, as the honourable member for Mayo addresses it-in terms of whether privatisation will increase or reduce the efficiency of an enterprise. In our situation where very few productive enterprises are in the public sector, on the whole it is unlikely that pri vatisation will increase efficiency. Membership of the EBRD is open to European countries, to non-European countries which are members of the International Monetary Fund and to European Community countries. The initial capital base will be, as the honourable member for Mayo has already said, $A15 billion, which is a large capital base. A majority of the EBRD's capital base will be held by the European Community members. The EBRD will carry out its purpose and functions in a number of ways, including by loans to private sector enterprises, loans to state-owned enterprises operating competitively and moving to participation in the market oriented economy, by investment in the equity capital of private sector enterprises, and by underwriting the equity issue of securities by both private and state-owned enterprises. Up to 40 per cent of the Bank's total committed loans, guarantees and equity investments can be provided to the state sector. The principal office of the Bank will be located in London and Jacques Attali will be the chief executive. Jacques Attali is, as has been noted, a French socialist, a particularly skilful strategist, and someone who has contributed greatly to improving the dialogue between developed and developing countries in a way very few other major economists have done. He has a lot of banking experience and was an excellent appointment. The recipient countries under the agreement to date include Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic before it joined with West Germany, Hungary, Poland, Romania, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and Yugoslavia. No member of the agreement is to have an initial subscription to the Bank . of less than 100 shares. Australia's initial subscription will be 10,000 shares and thatÂ· is valued at approximately $A45m. One hopes that the establishment of the Bank will be a prelude to the eastern European countries joining the global economic community. One real structural defect in the way the global economic community has operated throughout the postwar period is that the second world countries of European Europe have not been members of the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and other international economic organisations. Poland has now joined those organisations. I think Hungary is also joining. The others are applying to join or thinking of applying to join. I hope that they will become members soon because the effecti veness of the Fund and the Bank in particular depends on their comprehensive membership. One of the great benefits of these economic changes that are going on in European Europe is that they will then encourage these eastern European countries to become full participating members of the global, economic and financial community. . Some people might question whether it is appropriate for Australia to be supporting the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development because it is involved in structural change on the other side of the world. There are many potential benefits for Australia as well as it being important that we participate in those historic changes that are occurring. Our membership will give us access to information about opportunities for financial and commercial activities in central and eastern Europe. I should draw attention to the fact that we already have quite a high level of trade with central and eastern Europe. In 1988 our exports to the Soviet Union were $1 billion, to Poland over $ 100m, and to Yugoslavia and Romania also over $100m. Mr Rocher-Do they pay for any of them?",148
195,Mr LANGMORE,RECONSTRUCTION AND,"Yes, they do. Our exports to Czec-oslovakia were $70m, and so on. There IS clearly a great deal of scope for building up that trade, but it is important that we have access to the information about the opportunities. Our membership of this bank will help give us this information. Membership will also provide an Australian voice in important aspects of the political and economic reform process through the Bank's policy dialogue with its borrowing members. It also demonstrates Australia's support for the political and economic changes occurring in central and eastern Europe. It is clearly vital to the peace as well as the prosperity of the globe that these changes that are occurring in eastern Europe are successful. It is clearly in our long term interest to support that in any way we can. It is not only through this measureand I agree with the honourable member who spoke previously-that we should be finding other ways of supporting those changes, but this is a useful contribution; It has been suggested that there are disadvantages to our membership. It costs us $45m over five years, but I would have thought that that was a relatively small contribution in what is a most important process. There is a problem in that that is being taken from our overall aid program. The answer to that problem, of - ourse, should be that the aid program is Increased to allow this allocation. It was increased by a small amount in real terms this year, partly to accommodate this allocation. Mr Downer-In real terms.",151
196,Mr LANGMORE,RECONSTRUCTION AND,"Yes, a real increase. But I think it is very important that that real increase be extended further. There is, of course, no guarantee that the Bank will achieve its purpose but I do not think that that is a reasofor not participating-it is a reason for participating effectively. In any case, our contri-ution is not large. Frankly, I would have hked to see it larger, but it will be useful. Because it is a very important new institution, it is important that Australia take part. I emphasise again that the changes that are going on in eastern Europe are ones which will introduce a market system. But t-ey will. be unsuccessful if they are not hnked WIth an extension of the appropriate intervention by governments in order to offset the market failure that will inevitably follow this unless there is government activity to offset it. The success of western Europe has been the balance between governments and the private sector. eastern Europe must emulate that balance if it, too, is to be successful. This bank will make a contribution both to building up the private sector and to increasing the effectiveness of public enterprise. For that reason and the others I have mentioned, I strongly support this Bill. Debate interrupted. NA",151
197,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,It being almost 10.30 p.m. I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Potatoes,151
198,Mr RONALDSON,ADJOURNMENT,"Ballarat) (10.29)I rise tonight to bring to the attention of the House the crisis presently confronting potato growers in my electorate. The plight of these potato growers is evidenced by the fact that they are presently ploughing back this year's crop. One reason for this is the large number of processed potatoes that have been imported into this country. . In December 1987 the appropriate tarIff was reduced to 10 per cent and since then there has been a steady increase in imports aided by the higher Australian dollar. Last year, 17,597 tonnes of processed potatoes with a value of nearly $13m were imported into Australia, of which nearly 11 million tonnes came from Canada. As well as the Canadian imports there are also significant imports from the Netherlands. Although the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) is well aware of the plight of Australia's potato growers, he appears far from anxious to implement any measures to ensure their protection. The question of tariff reduction for tatoes is again being debated within the context of the present General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) round. In the short time allowed to me this evening I will provide a very brief history of this matter. It would appear that the question of trade-offs between the Australian canned fruit industry and the potato dustry may have been decided upon by Prime Ministers Mulroney and Hawke and their advisers earlier this year, but the details of these arrangements were hidden from the Australian potato industry under the guise of continuing negotiations. The irony of the canned fruit versus potato industry question is that as a result of the Canada-United States free trade agreement the Canadians are prepared to accept that their minimal canned fruit industry will have to go anyway and no return at all. therefore in Australia's negotiations with them regarding the potato industry they effectively have nothing to lose. At meeting between industry and Departevidenced ment of Primary Industries and Energy (DPIE) representatives information was given that Canadian negotiators seeking a further reduction in the Australian tariff on potato imports. Despite surances by the Department's representatives that these had been prediscussing liminary meetings, it became obvious ing the meeting that Australian and ing Canadian government representatives had discussed the matter at length as early March this year. A statement has been made by industry delegates that Australian primary producof ers are of the opinion that they can always compete provided the goal posts are set on a level playing field. In this instance is clear that the playing field slopes in favour of Canada. The amount of imported processed potatoes has information creased from 247 tonnes in 1983-84 to rian 17,597 tonnes in 1989-90, and Canadian imports alone rose from 179 tonnes in that period to 10,778 tonnes. The realities are that there is not a level playing field between the producers in these two countries and there is no doubt that Canadian frozen imports are being dumped in Australia. In July 1990 the poaverage price for imported potatoes was 86c per kilogram and, if freight costs of approximately 36c per kilogram are deducted, this leaves a f.o.b. price of SOc per kilogram. It is of interest, however, that the present quoted wholesale price in Canada is $A1.l 0 per kilogram. The Canadian frozen potato industry is market inshare driven and is constantly oversupplied. Canadian producers do not reduce production for fear of losing market share, and I am also advised that they oversupply to ensure that they constantly have their product on the shelves. At the end of their season, due to climatic and other conditions, they are required to empty their storage sheds. That is why they are prepared to dump their potatoes in Australia for little return on the basis, presumably, that a small return is better than As I indicated, the potato imports amount to some 17,000 tonnes and the a magnitude of this amount is no better by the fact that, even in the large production district of Ballarat, only 60,000 tonnes of unprocessed potatoes was were sent to the local processor. The other matter that concerns me asgreatly is that our negotiators were actually sitting down with the Canadians this matter at the last GATT durround without proper information. Durthese negotiations last month a representative from the crops division of the as DPIE faxed a letter to an Australian processor requesting such information as an estimate of the gross value of production the frozen potato industry Australia wide, the production of Australian frozen potatoes over the last five years and the it Australian market for frozen potatoes over definitely the last five years. Amongst other details requested was inon the allegation by the Vicfofarmers delegation, to which I referred earlier, regarding the price of imports and the f.o.b. price of SOc a kilogram. I find it quite amazing-in fact I will put it more strongly: I believe it is an absol-te disgrace-that people supposedly lookmg after the interests of Australian producers attend international negotiations which have enormous long term ramifications without even the most basic information. The potato growers in my area want to compete, and are quite capable of competing,with international producers. T-ey are not prepared, however, to put up wIth an unlevel playing field. I will fight to ensure fair play; indeed, I will fight to ensure their survival.",151
199,Mr JENKINS,ADJOURNMENT,"By any discrimination definition, Fiji's new constitution promulcompletely gated in. July is. riddle- wit- i-equality. Firstly, It enshnnes raCIsm: It mvokes code of apartheid which systematically deprives Fijian citizens of Indian descent of an effective voice in government. der the new constitution, in a 70-person lower House 37 seats are reserved for digenous Fijians, 27 for Fijian Indians, one for Polynesians from the island of Rotuma and five for other races, includthe ing Europeans and Chinese. Native. F-jiÂ­ as will also have a guaranteed maJonty in the appointed upper House. Secondly, the constitution incorporates an outrageous electoral gerrymander based on geographic location. The votes of digenous Fijians living in urban areas on the western side of the main island, Viti Levu-which happens to have been the power base of the last elected governStalinist ment-are worth less than those of native Fijians living in areas controlled chiefs who gained power from the 1987 coup. This constitution is reprehensible. Albert Blaustein, of the Rutgers University School of Law, who was engaged by the interim military regime as a consultant, has dissociated himself from this docurepresentative ment, describing it as a tragedy. I recently wrote to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) indicating my deep concerns about the Fijian constitution. A few days ago the Australian section of the International Commission of Jurists stated that the new constitution itor would lead to Fiji being 'ruled in perpetuity by an oligarchy of Fijian chiefs and their associates' and that 'the government would not be answerable to the governed'. It released its report to coincide with the twentieth anniversary of the promulgation of Fiji's original independence constit-Â­ tion in 1970. Among those who put theIr names to this document are Justice Michael Kirby, Gough Whitlam and Don Dunstan. Releasing the report, Mr Justice Kirby, President of the New South Wales Court of Appeal, stated: The new constitution is quite as bad as the Fiji apartheid laws in South Africa. Those who lift their voice against that form of entrenched legal must do so against this new and unacceptable constitution. The veneer of constitutionalism will fool no-one. a When I read the transcript of the address by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) to the UnUnited Nations General Assembly on 2 October this year, I warmly endorse his inexpression of the deep disappointment of Australia 'at the backward steps that occurred in Fiji with the events of 1987 and recent promulgation of a constitution which . . . builds new and far reaching racially discriminatory principles into the Fijian political system'. But Senator Evans also stated to the General Assembly that the new constituintion marked a 'welcome return to repreor sentative constitutional government'. It certainly marked a return to a form of constitutional government but, after al-, Russia also had a form of constItutional government. Can we in any sense by the 'welcome' it? We cannot. Under no definition can Fiji be said to be returning to democracy. What Fiji - as done is establish a facade or, as Mr JustIce Kirby called it, a veneer of constitutionalism. The danger in offering an assessment such the 'welcome return to government' is that it could enhance the facade and lend respectability to the unacceptable-in this case aggression, militarism, racism and inequality. In May 1989 I spoke o- the matter of Fiji in this place and I saId: The Australian Government must closely monits aid program to Fiji. We must ensure that Australian dollars are not used to entrench tatorship and racism. I iterate this view. It appears, however, according to recent reports that some Australian companies have provided the military regime with aid via investments and have indulged in unacceptable busisimultaneous ness practices. According to Mr Mahenespecially dra Chaudrey, the General Secretary of the Fijian Trades Union Congress, 'Ausan tralian companies were among those who were quick to take advantage of the year tax holiday instituted by the Rabuka regime' and they are employing Fijians in 'appalling, disgusting and exploitative working conditions'. I find this report disturbing and call on the Department Foreign Affairs and Trade to investigate these claims. Fiji's new constitution is essentially different from the machinery of apartheid established in Pretoria. South Africa begun a process of reform under the jured weight of economic sanctions to which Australia has made a contribution. tralia's attitude towards South Africa the Commonwealth and in other internaequipped tional forums is second to none in conlethal demning racism and inequality. Australia has played a major role in making Africa a pariah in the international community. Let Australia take the lead in ostracising Fiji until that nation too forced by the weight of international demnation to dismantle an abhorrent gime. Prague",153
200,Mrs BAILEY,ADJOURNMENT,"The eral grade 6 class from the Lancefield Primary School visited my Parliament House fice recently and I attempted to explain to them in a very short space of time democratic process of this Parliament. terwards I reflected that what I neglected to tell them was just how fortunate we are in this country to have the right and freedom to be able to stand in this forum and speak on any subject without fear of reprisal. Recently I visited Prague and walked the length and breadth of Wenceslas Square, where thousands of students gathoslovakia ered on 17 November 1989 to commemstate dic- orate the 50th anniversary of the violent closure of colleges and universities by the Nazis. The courage to stage that demonstration had grown out of one held previously. The brutal action by the police then against the demonstrators and the arrests of leading dissidents, of Havel, resulted in 40,000 citizens signing petitions. By that actionaction we take for granted as the Clerk regularly announces petitions lodged for 13presentation in this House-those brave citizens risked losing their jobs and risked arrest. When the students gathered in their tens of thousands in Wenceslas Square on most 17 November last year approximately 500 of of them were brutally attacked and injured by special police units. When the students gathered in their tens no of thousands in Wenceslaus Square on 17 November last year, approximately 500 has of them were brutally attacked and inby special police units. I saw a film of those events while in Prague and it was Ausa chilling and terrifying experience, in watching those special police squads with riot shields and wielding truncheons, backed up by savage dogs, fire trucks with high pressure hoses South and heavy armoured vehicles. But for the next 10 days and 10 nights is thousands of students relentlessly reconturned to Wenceslaus Square to demonrestrate-such was their courage and commitment. They acted as the catalyst and were joined by actors, artists and gradually the workers, resulting in a genstrike. I shall never forget the face of the man who had never been involved in of any political movement-had never even met anyone involved in a political move the ment-who said, 'I never intended to be Afa dissident-I just became one.' The reason that man and thousands like him took the courageous step forward was that they had finally realised that they must oppose their political masters then or face economic, social and moral oblivion. Many of those citizens could remember how their country had previously prospered. Between the two wars, Czechhad been the only democratic in central Europe, and by World War II was among the most advanced European countries. It is of course part of history how ating Czechoslovakia came under the absolute power and authority of the Communist Party, whose single ideal was uniformto ity-camouflaged in Utopian ideals. In order to achieve that goal, the most active people were executed or forced to spend long years in concentration camps and prisons. Hundreds of thousands of skilled people went into exile. The thinkers, the artists, the scientists were replaced by area. those who blindly advocated a communist doctrine. Though officially revered, the worker became in reality a ruthlessly manipurelationship lated means of production. Forced colleccommunity. tivisation ruined the farmer. The selfthird confident entrepreneur was replaced by an incompetent bureaucrat. Independent aslian sociations of private citizens were disfact banded. Religious life was suppressed. More than 30 per cent of the country was ecologically devastated. Uncontrolled power without checks and balances caused the degeneration of a proud country. stand taken by those students, however, loss. has meant the end of that regime-the end of the totalitarian state and a return to parliamentary democracy. Mr Acting Speaker, I had the privilege to meet with members of Civic Forum, who now constitute over 50 per cent the new members of the Parliament in Prague. I wish to place on record my admiration for their courage and thank them for according me such warm hospiThe tality. The students from the Lancefield Primary School will never have to the sacrifices that the Czechoslovakian students made, but they, like those of here whose responsibility it is to maintain the principles of democracy, should mind themselves of the privileges we have and should never take them for granted. Aviation: Third Party Insurance",154
201,Mr DUNCAN,ADJOURNMENT," Mr Acting Speaker, the issue that I wish to raise tonight is one of the utmost imporsurance tance and bears on every citizen of this nation. I am sure it will come as a great surprise and shock to many honourable members to hear that there is no compulsory third party insurance scheme operto cover aircraft flying in this nation. This is indeed a shocking situation and one which should not have been allowed continue for as long as it has. It is a situation for which we all bear some responsibility and I want to say personally how disappointed I am that I only became aware of this anomalous and unsatisfactory situation after I ceased to be a Minister with some responsibility in the Let me explain just what the absence of compulsory third party insurance means in terms of aviation in Australia and the between aviation and the It is not compulsory to have party insurance to operate an aeroplane in Australia or in any of the AustraStates. Of course many aircraft, in most aircraft, have such insurance but even in circumstances where the planes are insured the policies can be negated where there are breaches of the poliey conditions and innocent thir- party The victims can be denied compensatIOn for If a person were a passenger in a plane either uninsured or with a negated policy and was killed or injured, that person or his or her estate would have no comeback no recourse and no compensation. of Such a tragedy struck a family in my electorate in circumstances where the husband and father of my constituent family was killed whilst a passenger in a plane. insurance policy was negated because the pilot was apparently undertaking make manoeuvres which the Bureau of Air Safety found to be aerobatics. My widus owed constituent and her children were left without compensation for the loss of retheir breadwinner because the pilot's action negated the policy and the pilot, who was also killed, had no estate of any substance. This is no doubt not an isolated case. If an aeroplane without third party incoverage crashed into a crowd of people, those people would possibly have an action against the pilot or owner for damages, however, if the pilot and/or owner was uninsured and not of great means, taking action for damages would amount to an empty gesture. Again, if an uninsured plane landing at any of the metropolitan airports in Australia crashed into a house or houses, the owner, tenants or other residents of that house or houses would not have any effective means of obtaining compensation for loss arising out of bodily injury or damage to property. In addition to the above, if the pilot or owner of the plane were able to defend the claim that he or they had been negligent, then likewise there would be no compensation. I am sure many honourable able members will agree that this situation is truly unjust and outrageous. The matter has apparently been the subject of extensive negotiations, consultations and discussions between the Commonwealth Government and appropriate government Ministers and authorities over a long period. This has occurred because of the constitutional complexities which some claim surround the matter. As often happens when a Commonwealth and State agreement is desirable, little or no progress has been made. Officers of the appropriate department have not denied that the Commonwealth could in fact take unilateral action in this area; what they have claimed to me is that Commonwealth action would not be wholly successfUl because it would not cover all aircraft operating at all times. For example, a crop-duster operating from a private airfield in uncontrolled airspace may be operating solely within the province of State constitutional powers and, therefore, could not be covered by any Commonwealth scheme. Notwithstanding the fact that a few aircraft could possibly escape a Commonwealth compulsory scheme, it would certainly be better to have the vast number of aircraft covered than avoid action because of the possibility that a few might escape the net. I am personally confident that the Commonwealth does have sufficient power to legislate in this area to cover all aircraft. Even if that is not a correct view of the law we should, in any event, legislate to the full extent of Commonwealth powers. We should not wait for a disaster involving an uninsured aircraft, which will inevitably happen at some time, and then take the necessary legislative steps. This is a matter of great seriousness and I have placed it on record tonight in the hope that my comments will trigger the necessary action. Who in this Parliament would accept a situation where motor cars in this nation were not insured for third party damage-so why should we accept that situation with aircraft? I do not believe that it is the will of the Parliament that uninsured aircraft should be able to fly freely around this nation offering danger and risk to innocent third parties, and it is important that the will of the Parliament should be expressed at the earliest possible time. When one thinks of the potential for an State aircraft to cause massive damage to individual persons and their property, potentially without compensation being available to those people, then the concern over the issue of aircraft noise to some extent pales to insignificance. I hope that members such as myself who represent constituencies abutting or containing aerodromes will join together to push for action for a compulsory third party scheme.",155
202,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Dried Fruits,156
203,Mr ANDREW,ADJOURNMENT,"I am pleased to follow the honourable member for Makin (Mr Duncan) in this adjournment debate, not because anything I want to say bears any relevance to the reasonable comments he has made tonight but because as fellowÂ· South Australians we both happen to represent an industry that is currently facing a desperate fight for its survival. That industry is the dried apricot industry. In fact today I did accompany to the office of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) representatives of the dried apricot growers of South Australia, among them Mr Henry Tankard, who is Chairman of the Australian Dried Fruits Association and who represents both dried vine fruit growers and  Marianni, who is Managing Director of Angas Park Dried Fruit Co. Pty Ltd-the largest dried fruit processing company in South Australia. The Angas Park Dried Fruit Co. processes about 50 per cent of the dried apricots in South Australia and sells, because it buys additional fruit from other processors, about 65 per cent of the dried apricots in Australia. Mr Marianni, whose company is based in the Barossa Valley in my electorate, was present in Parliament House to express the concern he, his company and the dried apricot industry feel at the threat currently posed by Turkish imports. Mr Marianni's particular concern was that so much of the fruit that he processes comes out of the Riverland of South Australia and so many of the Riverland fruit growers currently face a demise in other areas, particularly the citrus industry. haps I should explain that the dried apricot industry is very labour intensive and that it is a South Australian-based industry, entirely dependent on the summer sunshine, which is so characteristic of South Australia, in order to produce the quality product that Australians have . come to take for granted. In fact, I would boldly say that dried apricot growers have been well rewarded in the past, having achieved for their top lin.e up to $6,000 a tonne. It is money that has been wellearned because it is labour intensive and it is also a risky industry, given that a summer thunderstorm can destroy much of the work that has been done. As you can imagine, Mr Acting Speaker, it is an industry which appeals to school children who come in and who lay the apricots individually-once cut in half-on trays and expose them to sulphur. The industry has been somewhat mechanised sinceÂ·then but, nonetheless, it remains labour intensive. The Australian dried apricot industry, manages to produce somewhere between 2,500 and 3,500 tonnes of dried apricots each year. That is an awful lot of little halves to be dried out, each one weighing a relatively small amount. Accumulated, they weigh 2,500 to 3,500 tonnes. Compare that with the Turkish industry. The Turkish industry, which is far and away the largest industry in the world, produces 30,000 tonnes of dried apricots every year. I understand that the Australian industry, with its 3,500 tonnes, is about the second largest producer. The threat for Australians is not that they are not quite happy to take on the Turks in terms of competition, but, rather, that much of the product of Turkish origin that is coming into Australia is not obliged to meet the import standards that we take for granted. My plea to the Minister is that he will take to his State colleagues and to the consumer organisations an awareness of what is happening to Australian consumers who are currently buying Turkish fruit without its being exposed to the same sort of inspection standards that are demanded of Australian producers. Turkish imports have increased from Per- 167 tonnes in 1984 to 1,600 tonnes last year. That is 40 per cent of the Australian dried apricot industry which is being taken up by Turkish imports. The appeal of the Turkish product has been based on price. The indignation that I feel and that the dried apricot growers are expressing-the indignation that Mr Marianni and Mr Tankard wanted to pass on to the Minister-concerns the fact that as this fruit is so popular among Australian consumers, Turkish producers should be obliged to meet precisely the same import standards as are demanded of Australian producers. Au-tralian producers are quite happy to export around the world; they have a quality product but, as a .result of the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service changes, they are currently being required to compete in an unfair environment. I think inspections of dried apricots ought to be raised to category 2 in order to meet-",156
204,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority,157
205,Mr OKEEFE,ADJOURNMENT,"1 appreciate my colleagues giving way to me to allow me to make a few points at this late hour of the night. I must say that is one of the saddest moments for me since I came into this Parliament. I refer to the absolutely disgraceful conduct of one of our counterparts in the other place, Senator Vanstone, who is at the moment in the Senate tipping a bucket on members of the Government who are members of the parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority (NCA). We have seen ourselves move to a situation on this Committee where there is considerable embarrassment between members of the Government and the National Crime Authority. It has been subjected to a constant tirade from the Opposition ever since a number of events occurred earlier this year, and, in particular, in the ation of the report concerning Operation Ark. This report was discussed at great length within the Committee and it was tabled in the Parliament, I think, yesterday. We all hoped that that would be the end of it. But I was particularly disturbed to see that in the dissent included in that report by members of the Opposition who are on the Committee, they chose to release in camera evidence that was given to the Committee, as well as the details of matters which had been discussed quite closely between members of the Authority. We have been battling for six years to develop an appropriate working relationship with the National Crime Authority and it does not augur well to have members of the Opposition behaving in this way. But now in the other place Senator Vanstone is poring over all of this information with only one thing in mind-and that can only be to try to draw media attention to issues which one would have thought would have run out of gas by now. But in the process, she has cast reflectiOns on the ability of my colleague the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) to draw the conclusions that he has drawn in his capacity as a member of the Committee. She has also cast reflections on the ability of one of my colleagues in the other place, Senator Loosley, to draw conclusions. I think it is time that the Opposition woke up to the fact that this parliamenthis tary Joint Committee is not, in fact, a political football. It has been given a responsible role to try to help the National Crime Authority to assist this Parliament in getting on top of the very real problem of organised crime in Australia. The parliamentary Joint Committee is not there to enable members of the Opposition to drag out, in dissenting reports, the finest details of in camera evidence and transcripts of interviews or to enable them to go into the other place and cast reflections on members of the Committee and their ability to do their job. I guess I am saying that if we are going to play in this wayif this is how the Opposition thinks that it can behave in the conduct of a parliaevalumentary Joint Committee-we are going to finish up with a Committee that has absolutely no working relationship with the NCA. I would not be surprised if the Chairman of the Committee, the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay), who is trying to overcome these difficulties that have been caused, is now receiving telephone calls from the members of the National Crime Authority. They came to our Committee and said, 'Look, we want to have open disclosure of information. We want to have a good working relationship with you'. I would not be surprised if the honourable member is receiving telephone calls right now from people saying,. 'How in the hell can you expect to do this when members of the Opposition are just going to take the information that we give you, jog into the Parliament, throw it onto the table and, at the same time, cast aspersions on the ability of members of the Government to arrive at opinions and make proper judgments?'. Mr Acting Speaker, as I said at the outset, I regard it as an absolute disgrace. I have always tried to take a view that we should have political debate, but I do not think this is the way to behave in a parliamentary Joint Committee.",157

207,Mr RONALDSON,ADJOURNMENT,"Ballarat) (10.58)Mr Acting Speaker, having bid you farewell for the break, I find myself with two minutes in which to speak, in a slightly more relaxed atmosphere than the one in which I spoke about the matter concerning the potato industry. The honourable member for Adelaide (Dr Catley) has given us the wisdom of his experience of the culinary delights of Adelaide over the last two weeks and I would like to bring to the attention of the House the marvellous tourist facilities that we have in Ballarat. Some of the larger ones include Sovereign Hill, Lake Wendouree, Kryal Castle and the Royal Botanic Gardens. Also, there is a plethora of smaller attractions. They are providing a significant service not only to the people of Ballarat, but also to the people of Melbourne and the numerous visitors who come to our centre. There is also the Stawell World of Miniature, which I highly recommend to honourable members, and, of course, the wine growing areas of Avoca-and I believe we are able to sample some of its wares in the parliamentary dining room. It is my very great pleasure to open the Avoca Wine and Wool Festival tomorrow, which, as one can imagine, is an area which is undergoing great difficulties at the moment owing to the wool crisis. But the community is pulling together to make sure that this festival is highly successful. I commend the Ballarat region and its tourist facilities to honourable members when they are visiting. It is a great tourist area and I am even prepared to open my doors to honourable members from the other side if they would like to drop into my office for a cup of coffee on the way through.",158

(2) Did the ABC obtain any independent advice on the financial viability or desirability of it entering into any such contract, agreement or arrangement; if so, what was the substance of that advice.",159
209,Mr BEAZLEY,PAPERS,"The answer to the honourable member's question, based on information provided by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, is as follows: (1) The ABC has not entered into a contract or arrangement for the building of the South bank project. Negotiations had been underway with the Jennings Group, but Jennings subsequently notified the ABC that it was not in a position to proceed with the purchase of ABC properties in Melbourne. (2) Specialist advice was provided by various real estate consultants, the Australian Valuation Office, quantity surveyors and other professional construction consultants on particular aspects of the ABC's Southbank project. Their reports supported the viability of the project. However, the overall assessment of financial viability and desirability of entering into the proposed arrangements was made by the ABC. Chinook Helicopters (Question No. 210) Mr Bruce Scott asked the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 12 September 1990: (1) Have there been any offers to purchase the surplus Chinook helicopters which the Minister announced in August would be sold. (2) Would the sale of some of the helicopters enable others to be put back in service; if so, (a) when, (b) how many and (c) where would they be located. Mr Bilney-The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: NA (I) A number of foreign governments and eommercial organisations have expressed interest in the Chinook aircraft. No formal offers have been received. (2) As indicated in my press statement of 7 August 1990, at least five helicopters are being offered for sale and if sufficient revenue is raised, four to six Chinooks could be upgraded for continued service. The timing, number and disposition of aircraft depends on the outcome of both current tnarketing activities and the review of Defence Force Structure.
