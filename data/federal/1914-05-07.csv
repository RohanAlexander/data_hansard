5,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The statement is that exporters from America have an advantage over exporters from Canada because they can get backloading in coal, and that the Canadian lumbermen are virtually shut out of this market. As Ministers are supposed to favour preferential trade, will the Minister of Trade and Customs see that something is done, to place the Canadian exporters of lumber on as good a footing as the Americans ?",11

9,Mr BRUCESMITH,Unknown,"In this morning's Age, there is a short article dealing with the proposed action of the Government regarding the Meat Trust. It contains the statement that Ministers have under consideration the imposition of an export duty on meat. I ask the Prime Minister if there is a grain oftruth in that silly suggestion ? Mr JOSE PH COOK - The Government have under consideration matters relating to export and import, but the imposition of export duties of any kind is nob contemplated. ROYAL COMMISSION INQUIRIES .",11
10,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"As the Government propose to appoint a Royal Commission to inquire into the operations of the Meat Trust in Australia, I ask the Prime Minister whether, having regard to the decision of the Privy Council as bo the rights of Royal Commissions to ask questions, it is hoped to thus obtain in formation of value? Mr JOSE PH COOK - I believe that we shall acquire a great deal of useful information; otherwise, I would not confcemplate the appoinbment of a CommisVancouver, 5th May. sion. Possibly the Judge could have acquired more information had not the Privy Council given the decision which it has given, but, notwithstanding that decision, the Royal Commissions Ac t enables reasonable inquiries to be made..

17,Mr THOMAS,TELEPHONE AND TELEGRAPH,"Will the Prime ister allow a motion, of which I have .given notice, for the appointment of a Select Committee to examine the officers and records of the House to ascertain if the third reading of the Loan Bill was carried on the 31st October, to go as unopposed business? Mr J OSEPH COOK - I a in nor aware that that is a matter of so much urgency as to require that special facilities shall be given for its discussion. have not the slightest desire to go hunting in the musty tomes of the past, as the honourable member is a past-master in doing.",12
18,Mr THOMAS,TELEPHONE AND TELEGRAPH,"May I have a straight answer, yes or no?",12
19,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TELEPHONE AND TELEGRAPH,The answer is no. Later,12

21,Mr FENTON,TELEPHONE AND TELEGRAPH,"Will the Prime ister expedite the payments due to many sibly infect other persons. men who are small contractors to the - various Commonwealth Departments. Some of those contractors have been furnished homestead standing out of their money for mouths, and I would like the Prime Minister promise to expedite payment, so that men may be able to compete for these contracts. Mr JOSE PH COOK - There is an assumption underlying the question prompt payment is not being made the present time, and if the honourable member will furnish me with instances we will take care that all reasonable despatch is shown in making the payments. ROYAL COMMISSIONS.",12
22,Mr ARTHUR,TELEPHONE AND TELEGRAPH,"I should like to ask the Attorney-General if the Privy Council has not declared that the present Royal Commissions Acts are invalid ? If so, is there any power under the Constitution to create a Commission with compulsory powers, particularly is there any power to create a Commission with compulsory powers to inquire into the Beef Trust? Mr W . H . IRVINE - W it h regard to the first part of the question, the honorM in- able member has no doubt read the judgment, and knows that the effect of it is to declare the two Royal Commissions Acts invalid. In regard to the remainder of the question, it is uot the practice, certainly uot my practice as Attorney-General, to give opinions on matters of law in reply to questions asked in the House. I DIPHTHERIA ATDUNTROO N.  Home Affairs give the House any information in regard to the outbreak of diphtheria at Duntroon, and the steps taken to cope with it?",12
23,Mr KELLY,TELEPHONE AND TELEGRAPH,"The question might more properly be addressed to the Defence Department, but from knowledge in my possession I can inform the honourable member .that there is only one case of actual diphtheria at the military college, but about forty carriers were found, who, though not suffering from diphtheria in a malignant form, are M i ncarriers of the malady, and might posA question arose as to the best means of isolating those carriers, and I have placed the large at Yarralumla, which is at present unutilized, at the disto posal of the military authorities, who, I poor understand, are going to use the house. I think about thirty carriers were removed from (he hospital at Duntroon the other day, but, if the military authorithat ties desire the use of Yarralumla, the at Home Affairs Department will be delighted to place it at their disposal. NA RAILWAY. CONTRACT RATE FOR EARTHWORKS.  Home Affairs in his possession any documentary evidence or proof from any officer in the South Australian Railway Department that the Government of that State are paying 2s. 6d. per yard for the removal of spoil from cuttings' in which they are paying 4s. 6d. for the cutting itself?",12
24,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Yes . The honourable member has hardly put the question fairly, although I know he did not intend to .be unfair. We have received a telegram, and also a schedule, I think, from Mr Moncrieff, Commissioner of Railways in South Australia, showing conclusively that, both for excavations and formation work, the prices paid on the MinippaStreaky Bay railway were higher than those paid to Mr Teesdale Smith under the contract recently allotted to him. BRISBANE TELEGRAPHISTS' GRIEVANCE S.",13
25,Mr FINLAYSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"In regard to the grievances of the telegraphists at the General Post Office in Brisbane, is the Postmaster-General aware that correspondence which passed between the telegraphists and the Postmaster-General has appeared in the press, and, if so, what action has been taken ?",13
26,Mr AGAR WYNNE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I received the correspondence only this morning, and I propose to inquire into it. I NFORMATIONFROMATTORNE YGENERAL.",13
27,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Does not the Attorney General consider that 30,000 or more electors, speaking through their representatives in this House, are entitled to the fullest information from him, as Attorney-General, regarding any matter of public importance? Mr W . H . IRVINE - I think they are entitled to the fullest information on any matter relating to the administration of my Department which it is open for me to give. I have said previously, and I say again, that I have never considered it part of the functions of the Attorney General to advise honourable members generally on matters of law in reply to questions in the House. That practice has never been followed in the House of Commons. It is the duty of the Attorney-General to advise his colleagues, and, in matters which are brought by the Government before the House, such as Bills, honourable members may well look to him to guide them in matters of law, but not generally in reply to questions. NEWHEBRIDES CONTROL.",13
28,Mr SAMPSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Arisin g out of a discussion during last session, and also out of the fact that negotiations have been taking place between France and Great Britain respecting the control, of the New Hebrides, I ask the Minister of External Affairs whether the Commonwealth Government have been consulted by the other two Governments, and whether he is now in a position to inform the House of the result of the negotiations?",13
29,Mr GLYNN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The position is that a Conference has been arranged between Great Britain and France, but advices I received, about a fortnight ago, were to the effect that the exact date of the Conference had not been fixed. We may take it that a Conference will take place in regard to the amendments that may be necessary in the Condominium and the administration generally of the island.",13
30,Mr SAMPSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Will the Commonwealth be represented?,13
31,Mr GLYNN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I noticed in the press a statement that Mr Harcourt, in February last, when replying to a question put to him in the House of Commons, said that it was not intended to invite the Commonwealth to be represented on the Conference, but that we should be consulted before any change was made. That assurance has also been communicated by despatch to the Commonwealth Government. I assume that the Conference will take place shortly, and that no change will be made without prior consultation with the Commonwealth. LIGHT ON SMITH ' S ROCK.",13
32,Mr FINLAYSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Press reports have appeared to the effect that the Queensland Government have decided to provide a light on Smith's Rock, Moreton Bay. I wish to ask the Minister of Trade and Customs whether this decision has been arrived at without consultation with his Department, or with his concurrence ?",13
33,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I heard of the proposal for the first time when it was mentioned yesterday hy the honourable member. A telegram was despatched yesterday to the Premier of Queensland to ascertain the facts. TELEPHONE CONSTRUCTION: GUARANTEES.,14
34,Mr MCDONALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I wish to ask the Postmaster-General whether residents of Bendoc have made any payment in connection with the construction of a telephone line between that township and Dalgety - The Department estimated originally that there would be a loss of £209 per annum on the line. Will the Postmaster-General say whether that line bas been constructed without any payment being made by local residents?,14
35,Mr AGAR WYNNE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I shall make inquiries into the matter.,14
36,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Will the Postmaster-General also place before the House information as to the applications which the honourable member for Kennedy is making for the construction of telephone lines in his own electorate ?,14
37,Mr AGAR WYNNE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I shall look into both matters.,14
38,Mr MCDONALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Will the Postmaster-General ascertain why in a number of instances residents of the electorate of Kennedy have been called upon to pay certain guarantees in connection with the construction of telephone lines while no charge has been made in respect of the line from Bendoc to Dalgety?,14
39,Mr AGAR WYNNE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Thos e who enter into a guarantee should be prepared to observe it. It is a mean thing for. people in any district who ask to have a telephone line erected, and give a guarantee against any possible loss, to try to escape from it when they are called upon to bear it.  master-General make inquiries as to who was responsible for the cancellation of the order for the construction of a telephone line from Port Lincoln to Streaky Bay, and also from Port Lincoln to Cowell? The money was provided on the Estimates, tenders were called, and the contract accepted for a lot of the material for the work",14
40,Mr SPEAKER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable member is now going' beyoud the asking of a question.  master-General state who was responsible for the cancellation of that important work ?,14
41,Mr AGAR WYNNE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I probably was responsible for it. I shall look into the matter, and ascertain the actual position.",14
42,Mr MCDONALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Is the Postmaster-Gerieral prepared to lay upon the table of the House a return showing the number of telegraph and telephone lines which have been constructed without any guarantee during the last twelve months ?,14
43,Mr AGAR WYNNE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"We do not ask for the payment of a guarantee in respect of lines which if is reported are likely to prove payable. I shall look into the question, and if I find that the preparation of such a return will not involve any great difficulty I shall be glad to supply it . . NORTHERN TERRITORY SHEEP.",14
44,Mr MATHEWS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Will the Minister of External Affairs state whether his Department has yet traced the flock of sheep which it sent some time ago to a station in the Northern Territory?,14
45,Mr GLYNN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The sheep arrived at their destination about three weeks ago, and I can assure the honourable member that the mortality was very low. NEW STANDING ORDER.",14
46,Mr WEST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Has your attention been drawn, Mr Speaker, to a new standing order passed by the House of Commons, under which any honourable member may be named for frowning at the Speaker ?",14
47,Mr SPEAKER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It is not in keeping with the reputation of honourable members, or with the dignity of the House, that questions of a frivolous character should be either asked or answered. MILITARY HORSE DEPOTS: SUNDAY WORK.",14
48,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Will the Minister representing the Minister of Defence make inquiries into complaints which have been made that at some of our military horse depots men are called upon to work unnecessarily long hours on Sunday, because, seemingly, some, superior officer wishes to bring along a friend in the afternoon to inspect the horses? Will he see that this excessive Sunday work is stopped ?",14
49,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I shall ask my colleague, the Minister of Defence, .to ascer-tain whether there is any justification for the statement made by the honourable member. ELECTOR AL ROLLS.",15
50,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Is ' it a fact that Government have arranged with the Goconducting vernment of New South Wales that the services of the State police shall be used for the purification of the Commonwealth rolls-that is, that the police shall make - a canvass, and strike off the names of persons who are not entitled to enrolclaim ment? Will the Prime Minister give instructions that the police shall put - on the rolls the names of those who are not now enrolled, but are entitled to rolment ?",15
51,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I have no such notion regarding the purification of the rolls as dominates the mind of my honorties able friend. My idea is that to make clean roll you must enroll all whose names ought to be recorded, and remove all. names which should not be recorded.",15
52,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Will the Prime ter promise to issue instructions that all names entitled to be on the rolls shall put on the rolls?,15
53,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I will inquire as to what is the practice. I do not know the matter. what is the point of the honourable ber's question.,15
54,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"They are only taking error. the names off the roll, and not putting them on. That is the information I have received by telegram. Mr JOSE PH COOK - I can only say again that we will try to put on the roll every name which ought to be there. cannot say anything more definite.",15
55,Mr WEST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I understand that the police are being employed in New Wales in the compilation of the lists, and I desire to ask the Prime M i nister whether he will see that the police are furnished with claim cards, to be lef t at the'residence of any person not to be enrolled ? Mr JOSE PH COOK - I shall be glad matter. to do anything that is necessary in order that this work may be properly out. My own impression is that a card is usually left at a residence in the circumstances stated by my honourable friend.",15
56,Mr WEST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,No ; the police do not cards with them. Mr JOSE PH COOK - If we can facilitate the work in any way we shall be glad to do so.,15
57,Mr ARTHUR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I desire to ask the Prime Minister a question relating to the cleansing of the rolls and the facilities for enrolment. I am informed that in the the electorate of Bendigo the police are a canvass, and that they advise those whom they find not to be enrolled that they must go to a post-office to obtain application cards. ' Will the Prime Minister give instructions that the police shall be furnished with a supply of cards, so that the enrolment of also electors may be facilitated ?",15
58,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I shall be very glad to make inquiries into the matter, enand to ascertain why persons are being sent to post-offices to secure claim cards.",15
59,Mr FALKINER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Will the Prime Minister ask the Electoral Office authorito compare the names on the rolls in a adjoining electorates and in the various States? Since this subject was referred to the other day I have been supplied with names which appear on both the MinisRiverina and the Hume rolls, and one of the names is that of a person who left be the Riverina electorate six years' ago.",15
60,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I shall call the attention of the electoral officers to I am afraid, however, that memeven when we have done our best there will always be the element of human VACCINATION.",15
61,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Will the Prime Minister consider the advisability of in I stituting a searching inquiry into the effect of the vaccination that took place during the last small-pox scare in Sydney, South so that we may know the number of electoral people who have suffered?",15
62,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I think we had better leave the past alone, and congratulate ourselves that this trouble is lessenfound ing somewhat. I do not see my way to institute a searching inquiry into the carried REVENUETARIFF : REMARKSB Y SIR JOHN FORREST. Mr M o DONALD - H as the attention of the Minister of Trade and Customs take been drawn to a statement which was sent by telegraph from Western Australia, and which appeared in the Argus this morning, to the effect that Sir John Forrest has expressed his preference for revenue duties as against any increase in income or land taxation? Was the right honourable gentleman echoing the policy of the Government when he indicated that they were going to introduce a revenue Tariff at an early date? Sir JOHN"" FORREST - I only wish to say that the information is absolutely incorrect. The newspaper report was not printed in the way suggested by the honourable member-at any rate, not as I read it-and , in any event, the honourable member misrepresents what I said. NA STEAMERS.",15
63,Mr JENSEN,WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY ON,"Now that there is a Navigation Act will the Minister of Trade and Customs communicate with the Union Steam-ship Company, and, with a view to the preservation of human life, point out the desirability of their three boats, now voyaging between the mainland and Tasmania, being fitted with wireless telegraphy?",16
64,Mr GROOM,WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY ON,Unti l the Act is proclaimed we have no power over the shipping companies.,16
65,Mr JENSEN,WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY ON,Will the Minister do as I request in order to preserve human life?,16
66,Mr GROOM,WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY ON,"I shall, of course, take the honourable member's request into consideration. ADJOURNMENT (Formal). BEEF TRUST.",16
67,Mr SHARPE,WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY ON,"Oxley) [3.5] - I desire to move the adjournment of the House to disguss a definite matter of urgent public importance, viz., "" the operations of the American Beef Trust in Australia."" Five honourable members having risen in their places, Question proposed.",16
68,Mr SHARPE,WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY ON,"Honourable members on this side may congratulate themselves on having awakened the Government to the significance of the operations of the American Beef Trust in Australia. There is no doubt that the criticisms uttered from this side had something to do with directing the Government's attention to the matter, and evoking the intimation from the Minister of Trade and Customs of what the Government policy is to be.",16
69,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY ON,That is what honourable members opposite could never doin the case of their own Government!,16
70,Mr SHARPE,WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY ON,"The honourable gentleman's Government is our "" own Government "" at the present time, and it is his duty, and that of his colleagues, to look after the public interests. The public press has left us in no doubt as to theserious position in which our meat supply is placed by this trust. Irrespective of whatour opponents may say, we are more than satisfied that the Beef Trust is here, and is operating extensively, and that, in consequence, the people are paying a high price for their meat today. This trust will visit every house in the Commonwealth and extort tribute from the-tables of the people; and there is no doubt that it is its intention to batten on Australia as it has on other countries of thcworld. It is rather refreshing to hear that the Minister of Trade and Customs, even at this late hour, realizes his duty to dosomething in the interests of the people. Although the suggested Royal Commission is not very likely to be of much benefit at the present time, we have, at least,, a guarantee that the Government propose legislation of some description. Whether or not that legislation will prove effective it is, of course, very hard to say; but, at any rate, it will show the public that this Parliament, on whom the responsibility in such matters rests, is determined to stop these predatory operations. Therois no doubt that, owing to the Beef Trust, the Aberdeen works, in New South Wales, which have been in existence for a great number of years, and which depended, to a large extent, on Queensland for the supply of cattle, have been closed down. Be that as it may, Mr White, the Minister of Agriculture in Queensland,- has been telling the people of thenorthern portion of that State that he is highly delighted with the operations of the trust there-that he is pleased to know that the price of meat as going up.",16
71,Mr HANS IRVINE,WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY ON,"What did the honourable member for Maranoa say? - Mr SHARPE - That honourable member said that the trust is not responsiblefor the high price of meat, but I hope to be able to prove that it is - When we find a State Government, as represented by their Minister, applauding the operations of the trust, and offering it every assistance in driving out competition, we may imagine that those who for m the trust are looking forward to a fair l y rosy time. When We have the Minister for Agriculture in Queensland saying that he will be delighted to know that the price of meat in Australia will be higher than now, we can imagine that before long the Commonwealth will be visited by an overplus of unemployment and poverty. I oan quote an authority in each capital of the Commonwealth as to the cause of the increase of prices. Mr Walker, of the Sutton Forest Butchering Company, Sydney, says that the high prices realized at Homebush are due to the. fact that no cattle are coining forward from Queensland, which in the past has practically been responsible for the supply of half the meat slaughtered in Australia. It is on account of the shortage in cattle coming south that the. people in the southern States are paying so much for their meat today. Mr Walker, who is one of the most reputable butchers in the Commonwealth, says that he has to pay £ 1 5 and £ 1 6 per head for cattle which he was buying three or four months ago for £ 1 0 and £ 1 2 . Our opponents tell us that the high prices realized for cattle are due to the increased wages paid to slaughtermen, but Mr . Walker says that these have not interfered ^with the trade in any way. Mr . Angliss, of - Melbourne, gives a similar opinion. He says that it is impossible to continue the export trade on account of the high price of cattle in Australia and the low price of meat on the London 7 market. I shall be able to prove that the American Beef Trust controls the London meat market as well as the American markets. It controls two-thirds of the meat sent to the London market, and therefore is in a position to control and regulate the prices.",16
72,Mr RODGERS,WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY ON,Is there not a season for freezing in Australia that always ends in June?,17
73,Mr SHARPE,WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY ON,"Some of the big companies operate all the year round. Angliss and Company do so as a rule, but now they say that it is impossible to operate - on account of the high price of cattle here and the low price on the London market. We have a similar opinion from Mr Either, of Adelaide, who has heen in the business a great many years. When these men say that it is absolutely i m possible to continue the export trade, and that the tra'de is practically ruined, we must come to the conclusion that it is due to the presence of the Beef Trust.",17
74,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY ON,Mr H i the r did not say so.,17
75,Mr SHARPE,WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY ON,"Unfortunately , I have not sufficient time to read the quotations showing Mr E the r ' s opinion, but he says it is because no cattle are coming from the sister States that the people of Adelaide are paying such high prices for their meat, and we know that the greater portion of the cattle passing through the South Australian cattle yards come from Queensland. Agents tells us that prices are likely to go still higher because there are not sufficient cattle coming forward. They tell us also that the prices are likely to be reduced in the spring, but, in my opinion, instead of the prices beuig reduced, they arc likely to increase, because the Beef Trust, if they have not already bought four of the meat works in Queensland, have made sufficient arrangements to have their cattle treated when they come into the slaughter yards; in the same way that the arrangement was made by the South Australian Government to oblige Armour and Company. The honourable member for Werriwa, in trying to make a case for the Beef Trust, and justify their presence in Australia, showed that the number"" of cattle in America had fallen very considerably. He quoted from a publication issued by the Agriculture Bureau in Washington, and he showed that the cattle of the United States had fallen to the extent of about 13,000,000 head in four years; but the same publication shows that dairy cattle have maintained tlieir numbers, also that there is sufiicient land i u the United States to supply cattle to meet the requirements of the whole of the United States aud England, provided ""the stock-raiser can get a ready market for his cattle. Our opponents tell us that cattle are bringing excellent prices in the United States, but I can quote figures to show that the price of cattle is not as high as is obtained in Australia, while the price of meat wholesale is about double what it is in Australia. The figures I shall quote first deal with the London market. Our oppowill nents are continually telling us that the to better advantage. high cost of the meat in Australia is brought about by the high price of meat on the London market; but, as a matter of fact, the price in London is not as as it is in Australia. The prices I shall quote were published in last Monday's Age, and apply to last Saturday's sales. American In London, on Saturday last, the followThey ing prices ruled:-Ligh t lambs, 5gd.; Berlin market. fair average quality, 5£d.; mutton, 3§d. 3^d.; frozen beef fore-quarters, 3 £ d hind-quarters, 4 3-16d.; Argentine lambs, 5d. to 5-jjd.; muttou 3$d. to 3 f d . tine frozen beef, fore-quarters, 3-Jd.; hind-quarters, 5:ld. Although! Argentine produces half the meat that goes to the London market, it is in the happy posito tion of getting the best prices on that ket. New Zealand lambs brought for light, 5§d. for medium, 5 5-Sd. f heavy; New Zealand mutton brought 4.M. down to 3§d.; and frozen beef, hindlegislation quarters, 4 5-16d.; and fore-quarters, When we compare these prices with those on the American markets, we shall find how anxious our friends are to try serve the American markets for their use and control. I shall quote the wholetrust sale prices in Chicago on the 21st Februfor ary of this year, about the latest statistics it was possible for me to obtain. I shall here. read merely half-a-dozen of them to show the high price paid in America f o meat, and the low price for cattle. The quotations are from the New Yor k and Chicago National Provisionr.r of the 21st February, 1914, a cent being equivaearliest lent to our halfpenny: Prime native steers, 13Jto 13$ cents, to 6Jd. Good native steers, 12J to 13J cents, or 6jj-d. to Cg-d. Native steers, medium, 12J to 13$ cents, 6Jd. to 6£d. Heifers, good, 13 to 13J cents, or 6Jd. Cows, 10i to 11 J-cents, or 5-}d. to 5jtd. Hindquarters, choice, 1(5 cents, or 8d. Forequarters, choice, 11$ cents, Or 5§d. We are told that these people are coming to Australia because of the London meat market, but immediately they secure a monopoly of the Australian trade, prices on the London market will double. their intention to keep the London prices low at present, thus creating a gradual rise in the price of cattle in which will prevent Australian from operating. Then with the supply which they get from the Argentine Mr Sharpe. be able to exploit the London market But when they have driven their competitors out of the trade in Australia, prices in London will increase. They have stalls in Smithfield, high and shops in many parts of London; in deed, they have absolute control of the London meat market as well as of the and Australian markets. have also practically control of the They have made arto rangements to go to Brazil, New Zealand, . ; and South Africa , and if the legislators of the countries in which they propose ; Argento operate do not show a keen anxiety to protect the welfare of the people, and control the trust, instead of paying 6d. per lb. as we do here now, they will have pay Is. 6d., Is. 8d., and Is. lOd. per marlb., which are the American prices 6£d. Having regard to the prices that the o r trust pays for cattle in America, our friends opposite should be satisfied that to control the trust should be 3§d. passed as soon as possible. During the week ended 21st February, 1914, cattle sold for ?8 25 cents, or about 34s. per to precwt.; pigs from §8 65c, sheep from $5 own 70c, and lambs from $7 55c. each. The does not pay as much in America cattle as is paid in Australia, but it gets twice as much for meat as is got We are told that the trust will have competition to face in Australia, r but that is not so, because those in the trade here are few, and comparatively weak financially, and rather than put up a fight, many of them will get out at the opportunity, knowing that they have no chance of successfully opposing the trust. Swif t and Company have on or 6|d. the Brisbane River the biggest and the most up-to-date works in the world, and, according"" to the manager, will be able to or treat 1,000 head of cattle and 5,000 head of sheep a day. It is rumoured that to 6{j-d. they have also secured the Ross River works near Townsville, and the Lakes Creek works near Rockhampton. It is said, too, that they have secured the adjoining property, which was owned by Messrs. J . and R. Scott, and have thus 1000 miles of what is admitted to be the finest cattle country in the CommonIt is wealth. I am not in a position to say positively that these rumours are true, but, judging by the tactics adopted by Australia, the trust, I conclude that they have some exporters interest in the works I have named. They have also secured the Alligator Creek they works and the Biboohra works. It is admitted by every one in the north, although denied by the Biboohra shareholders, that the Beef Trust has not secured these works. The people in the northern parts of Queensland are not prepared to believe that the trust has not some interest in , and will not have cont r o l over, these works. The Burketown boiling-down works have recently been taken over and renovated by some one, a great deal of money having been spent on them; and it is concluded that the Meat Trust-o r some one connected with it , probably some of our young law clerks in Brisbane-ha s allowed capital to d r if t up there to re-establish these works. are also ready to think that the trust has more than a controlling interest in the operations of the Union Cold Storage Company thattis about to open works in the Northern Territory. Word was received from Brisbane yeserday that the trust has bought the business of Messrs. Baynes Bros., the biggest butchers in Queensland, who do a wholesale and retail trade. Mr Baynes has told me on several occasions that he would rather sell to the trust than engage i u competition with it . Everything points to Swif t and Company having acquired these works. Messrs. Armour and Company had control of the Rosewarnes Meat Works, on the Brisbane River, for a considerable time, and every ounce of meat that left those works bore their brand. arranged with B i r t and Company, on the Brisbane River, to treat cattle whenever they were overstocked at Rosewarnes. That has been admitted by the manager of the works. There is only one works on the Brisbane River which they have not secured. In Sydney, the Colonial Meat Export Company is operating very extensively, and it is the opinion of every person in the meat trade of New South Wales that the American Beef Trust has control of that company. We are told that a firm at Geelong is operating very extensively in live* stock, and exporting every ounce of meat that it can lay hands on. It is the idea of many in the trade that our little legal friends in Brisbane have distributed capital in Victoria, and have given people here 'carte blanche to act in connection with shipments of meat. Thus Queensland is well represented by the trust, as is also New South Wales, and we have the South Australian Government acting for it on every conceiv[29] able occasion, treating cattle for Armour and Company whenever that is necessary or desirable. We have ample evidence that the trust is operating in Australia. Nofc withstanding all our opponents may say, there has been a great deal of forward buying. The trust has secured the whole of the cattle that it is possible to get, and that is why we are paying such high prices for meat. It is preventing stock from travelling to the southern States, which cannot export if they cannot get Queensland cattle. During 1912 Queensland possessed 180,000 more beef cattle than all the other States put together: It had a surplus of 137,000 over 1911, We but the Commonwealth showed a reduction during the year of 251,000. The figures show that we have gone back, and that the Government should take into consideration the desirability of maintaining our cattle statistics; otherwise, in a year or two no other companies than the Meat Trust will ba able to export, and we shall not be growing enough,, meat for our own people. If the Government is anxious to take action, I would point out that one thing to be done is to preserve the young stock of the dairy farmers, which is now slaughtered. It is useless to tackle this matter unless it is intended to handle it in a practical and thorough manner. I had many figures to submit, but time will not per- ' mit me to say more. I hope that the They Minister of Trade and Customs will consider the facts that I have laid before him , and will take steps to prevent the people of Australia from suffering. If the trust is allowed to remain in Australia, it will fatten on the tables of the people, and bring about here poverty similar lo that which it has caused in America.

137,Mr GROOM,WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY ON,The Prime Minister was emphasizing the fact that the honourable member knew of the existence of the alleged trust.,22
138,Mr TUDOR,WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY ON,"That is not so. The Prime Minister has said again and again that I fostered the operations of the trust here. He was compelled yesterday to withdraw the statement that I had given it my blessing, but he repeated it once more today, and was again required to withdraw. The facts are that Mr. Malkow, who I believe to he a representative of Swift and Company, of Chicago, brought to the Department, not only plans of the works, but models of the buildings that it was proposed to erect, his object being to ascertain whether they were in accordance with the requirements of the Commerce Act. No building approved under that Act was as good as those which it was proposed to erect, and approval could not be withheld. The Prime Minister asked whether it was not a fact that one of the solicitors of the company interviewed me while I held office. It is a fact that Mr Thynne or Mr Macartney, one of the solicitors, called to see me. But here ? for what purpose? His ascertain whether it would not be possible for the rolled iron or steel, shaped, which it was intended to use in the construction of the building, to be admitted under other line in the Tariff, which would mean that a lower rate of duty would have to be paid. The item it should come under was doubtful, and naturally the Company desired to come in at the lower rate. I refused to allow it admitted at the lower rate, and the ComPrime pany, or Trust, had to pay the duty. As to the honourable gentleman's asserlished, tion that these people had practically the run of my office, I have only to that I never refused to see any one desired to interview me on public business. The humblest man in the community the biggest employer was treated alike me, whilst I held office. I saw all desired to interview me on public business, and those who saw me will admit, I that I made no wrong suggestion, and that no wrong proposal was made to me. As far as this Company is concerned, the statements that are being repeatedly made by the Prime Minister, I feel that my reputation is at stake.",22

141,Mr TUDOR,WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY ON,"I cannot lose sight of the fact that he is, even if it is by dent, the Prime Minister, or, nominally, the Prime Minister of Australia. He has made against me the imputation that I fostered this Beef Trust; that I coddled it, and that some of its directors viewed me. As a matter of fact, Mr. Malkow was the only director who saw me. He had previously seen Mr Lockthis yer, then Comptroller-General of CusPrime toms, and a record was made of all that was done. The plans of the buildings were approved, and, no matter who owned everything them, that approval could not have been refused. That was admitted by the Attorney-General in his speech on the censure amendment.",23

144,Mr TUDOR,WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY ON,"No . I did not have my private secretary taking notes of the aninterview. It was not a deputation. Mr. Malkow I think will say that I saw him once and once only. That is my recollection. I certainly did not see him, as the Prime Minister suggested, many times. I should not care if the whole to be of the papers were printed. If the Minister thinks it will serve the purpose of his party to have them publet him move that they be printed and I will support the motion. I have say nothing to be ashamed of-nothin g to who hide; and I repeat that no honourable member could have acted other than I or did. I could not refuse to approve of by the plans and specifications submitted by who these gentlemen who are supposed and whom I believe to be the representatives think, of the - Beef Trust in America.",23

The honourable member admits all this.",23

147,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY ON,"I did not. I did accinot impute the slightest wrong, at any time, to the honourable member for Yarra. All that I sought to establish was that he was perfectly aware of what was transpiring in this connection twelve months interbefore he left office.",23
148,Mr HUGHES,WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY ON,"West Sydney) [3.58]. - I do not desire to deal generally with question, but certain phases of the Minister's reply to the honourable member who moved this motion seem to call for some comment. The Government, we are told, are proposing to do that humanly can be done to deal with the great question. It is very remarkable, when one looks back upon the various attitudes which the Government have assumed towards this trust, that at this juncture they should have come . at length- I say ""at length"" advisedlyto the point which we reached in 1910. In other words, they now admit the danger to Australia from this great trust, and they will shortly havs to admit their utter lack of power to deal with it. It is something' that they should have admitted what they have. The rest will inevitably follow. Until quite recently they denied that there was any danger. The Prime Minister went through the last campaign denouncing the perfervid imaginations of the Fisher Government, and more particularly my own, in regard to these trusts, which he elegantly described as "" Billy's bogies."" declared thab they really did not exist. They were nothing, or if they were anything at all they were not only harmless, but beneficial. But the honourable gentleman now lashes himself up to fever heat, and would have us believe that he is not only alive to the danger but that he proposes to do all that a man can do to deal with it . I intend to show what he can do, now that he is alive to the fact that this great trust is in operation here. Shortly put, he can do nothing. He is very much like a man who, having allowed some dreadful calamity to approach within striking distance of him, having all along stoutly declared that there was no such thing, suddenly realizes its existence, and says, "" I see it now, and I shall do all that is humanly possible to avert it , "" bub knows at the same time that he is no more able to avert than he is able to stop the earth going round the sun. The Prime Minister says he proposes to do all that is humanly possible! And that is-until the Constitution is amended-nothin g ! It is just as certain that this trust will do what it wishes, so far as we can prevent it, as it is that night shall follow day. How may we deal with this trust? I speak now, not of a hypothetical thing, or of trusts in general, but of a trust which the Minister admits is here, and which every member of the Ministry says must be dealt with. But how to deal with it: that is the question! The Minister of Trade and Customs "" has his eye on it,"" and one of the coruscations from his eye has materialized on the business paper. He proposes to amend the Australian Industries Preservation Act. Mr Hughes. But though he should amend every Statute, he would be just as powerless as he is today. There is no means by which this Parliament can deal with this trust, unless the Constitution be first amended. I propose to prove that. The Government tell us that they intend to deal with the trust in two ways. The first of these is by an amendment of the Australian Industries Preservation Act,, with the exact nature of which we are not yet familiar. The other is by the appointment of a Royal Commission. Let me deal with these two proposals in turn. For what purpose do they, propose a Royal Commission? To inquire whether He the Beef Trust is a menace to civilization and to the producers and consumers of Australia? Surely that is not necessary? It is no more necessary than it would be to appoint a Royal Commission to ascertain whether fire burns, or water, in sufiicient quantities, drowns. It is as certain as anything in this world can be that the Beef Trust is here, not for the benefit of the Australian consumer or producer, but for the benefit of the Beef Trust. A Royal Commission is not necessary to inquire into that. If , however, the object of the Government is, by means of such a Commission, to get evidence to prosecute the Beef Trust, then I can only say that the Royal Commissions Act is just about as effective for getting evidence as would be the attempt to gather the constellation Hercules into a butterfly net! The Royal Commissions Act, even before the decision of the Privy it Council in the Sugar Company's case, proved to be a miserable failure - The Sugar Commission was told everything that we knew already, and all that there was no difficulty in finding out in other ways. But directly it began to ask questions necessary to ascertain material facts upon which to base a prosecution under the Act, or further legislation which would incriminate the Sugar Company, the witnesses declined to answer. Proceedings were then taken in the * High Court, and an injunction was granted restraining the Commission from ' putting those questions. In the Colonial Sugar Refining Company and Others v. The Attorney-General and Others, as reported in the Argus Law Reports, Vol. 18, 1912, page 435, the High Court decided that a Royal Commission may ask no questions on the internal management of the affairs of a company; on the operations of a company outside the Commonwealth; as to the operations of the company as a corporation formed under the State laws, and lawfully exercising its corporate functions within the Commonwealth; relating to the value of particular parts of the property of the company, except such parts as are actually and directly employed-in this particular casein the production and manufacture of sugar within the Commonwealth; and as to the details of salaries paid to officers except so far as these are relevant to the actual cost of such production and manufacture. That is to say that no answers to questions going to the root of monopoly or attempted monopoly by any company of the manufacture or sale of any commodity could be enforced. That - was the position before the Privy Council delivered its judgment in the same case. The Privy Council judgment, reported in the British Law Reports, Part 1, 14th March, page 327, held that the Royal Commissions Acts of 1902-12 were ultra vires so far as they purport to enable a Royal Commission to compel answers to questions, or order the production of documents, or otherwise compel compliance by members of the public with its requisition. Their Lordships, in delivering judgment, said, as reported on page 257Without re-drafting the Royal Commissions Acts and altering them into a measure with a different purpose, it is, in their Lordships' opinion, impossible to use them as a justification for the steps which the Royal Commission ou the Sugar Industry contemplates in order to make its inquiry effective. They think that these Acts were ultra vires, and void so far as they purported to enable a Royal Commission to compel answers generally to questions, or to order the production of documents, or, wise, to enforce compliance by the members of the public with its requisition. That is the position today. No answers can bo enforced to material questions under that judgment; and, in any case, the Acts themselves are declared to be xiltra vires, and beyond the ""power of the Commonwealth to have passed. So much for the Royal Commissions Acts. There remains now the question of amending the Australian Industries Preservation Act. When we went to the country, the Labour party were asked why they had never used the 1910 Act; and that silly question was asked again last night by persons who ought to have more sense and knowledge of the law than to put it . We did not use the 1910 Act to prosecute the Coal Trust for the simple reason that it is not usual under British law to try people under an Act when the offence has been committed before the passing of .the Act. I never in my life heard of that being done; and it would be such a startling and monstrous perversion of the customary procedure under British law that the very suggestion would create a revolution. The reason we did not prosecute under the 1910 Act was that the offence was committed before that Act was passed. But, in the light of the High Court judgment in the Vend case, I say deliberately that the 1910 Act would not have secured a conviction in that case, and cannot help the Government in this present difficulty. I say, too, that no amendment of the Act could in any way assist the Government to deal with this trust. Of course, if the Government propose to impose an export duty, that is another matter; but to that end an amendment of the Australian Industries Preservation Act is not needed. The Government have only to bring down a Bill imposing an export duty, and there would be an end of the matter-and of them. I should like to see the faces of the primary producers, who have spent their money to place the present Government inoffice, if an export duty on their produce were proposed. When the Government muster up enough courage to take such a step, they will not be on the Treasury bench, but in heaven, or othersome other place where translated politicians go. But they will not impose an export duty on produce, and we may put that remedy aside. What remains? As I have said, no amendment of the Australian Industries Preservation Act would enable the Government to deal with this trust; and when the Prime Minister says they will do all that men may humanly do, he simply says that they will do nothing. Yet something ought to be done, something, indeed, must be done. The matter is one of extreme urgency, and the one straightforward plan would be to lay on the table of the House such amendments of the Constitution as are absolutely necessary to enable effective legislation to be passed. Let us sweep away all these shams-thes e test measuresand references to gentlemen having their eye on the matter, and keeping it under consideration; come to the bed-rock and amend the Constitution, and then this great trust will disappear, so far as being a menace to the country is concerned. Once the Parliament is armed sufficiently, the trust knows its own business better than to fight the whole people. It is because our hands are' lashed behind our backs that the trust is carrying on its business in defiance of us. I hope that whatever is done will be done quickly and openly, and in such a way that we shall be able to deal with the trust, and not merely talk about it .",23
149,Mr GROOM,WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY ON,"""Darling Downs-Minister of Trade and Customs) [4.12] - In the first place, I wish to say that the Prime Minister made no insinuation against the honourable member for Yarra. What-the honourable gentleman said was that in July, 1912, the then Minister of Trade and Customs, and later the then Attorney-General, knew of the possibility of the Meat Trust coming into Australia. The honourable member for Oxley, from the day he entered the House, has drawn attention to the fact. He has told us that everybody knows that this is a Beef Trust, in which we find that Swift and Company are supposed to be also associated. The honourable member for Yarra, as M in ister of Trade and Customs, and the exAttorney-General must have known that Mr Malkow was connected with the United States, and that it was American money that was coming into Australia.",26
150,Mr HUGHES,WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY ON,"Of course, we knew.",26
151,Mr GROOM,WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY ON,That is the first point.,26
152,Mr HUGHES,WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY ON,If we could have prosecuted them we should have done so.,26
153,Mr GROOM,WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY ON,"The reason that there was no prosecution was, I presume, .that there was no evidence of any breach of the existing law.",26
154,Mr HUGHES,WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY ON,It was purely a Queensland institution.,26
155,Mr GROOM,WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY ON,"The honourable member knew, from his own knowledge, that application was being made to have this place appointed a place for export, and that, therefore, it was intended for the export trade, and not for internal trade only.",26
156,Mr HUGHES,WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY ON,It was not an offence to export.,26
157,Mr GROOM,WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY ON,If the honourable member looks at the Act he will see that it applies to Inter-State and external trade.,26
158,Mr HUGHES,WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY ON,Of course.,26
159,Mr GROOM,WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY ON,"And , in connection with the export trade, it is an offence to unduly restrain trade or attempt to monopolize it .",26

163,Mr GROOM,WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY ON,"That is quite true j but the honourable member will admit that it was known the company came here with the intention of exporting. Why did they desire to come under, the Commerce Act if they were not going to engage in the export trade? I ask the honourable member for West Sydney whether, when by an .alteration in the Constitution he gets the complete control he desirea, he will have any more control over the export trade than there is under the law today? The honourable member must admit that, so far as the Constitution is concerned, there is absolute and sovereign control over the exports and imports of Australia.",26
164,Mr HUGHES,WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY ON,Is the control over exports sufficient to control the trust? We have ample power over exports.,26

167,Mr GROOM,WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY ON,"Our complaint against the honourable member for West Sydney is that, kndwing the company was here to engage in nothing but the export trade, and that it .was alleged they would endeavour to obtain complete control over, and to monopolize, that trade, he did not, with a majority in both Houses, attempt",26

An amendment of the Constitution would not remedy the evil, because it only gives authority to introduce an Act of Parliamembers ment. Although the late Government knew the evil, and although they were the three years in power, they made no atall tempt to legislate in relation to it. All they did was, in 1910, to introduce an amendment which omitted the words havpeople of Australia. ing reference to intent and the detriment to the public, and left the onus of proof on the defendants; that was the whole sum of their legislation.",27

191,Mr MCDONALD,WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY ON,"The honourable member is now trying to twist and twirl his remarks, but he cannot escape them. He saw his difficulty when he approached the point, and immediately steered away from it ; and now he says, ""Why lash yourselves into all this fury?'.' What about the innuendoes of the Prime Minister a few minutes ago about the late Minister of Trade and Customs-whic h honourable gentlemen knew were not in accordance with fact, and which he had no right to make-as much as to say that some action on the part of the late Minister of Trade and Customs was not all it should have been in his position as ister? It was a base and unworthy im- putation that should not have been made. The present Minister of Trade and Customs tried to defend that sort of thing, and immediately advised honourable members to treat the matter in a philosophical way. As a matter of fact, the Prime Minister never gets up to make a statement of any kind, and at any time, without his whole object being to try to impute motives to honourable members, and twist their statements, so as to leave an. endo, and cast a slur on them. He puts me in mind of a fellow who went down, the street, and said, ""Look here, Jones; I heard you told some one that I was the biggest liar in town,"" and Jones replied, "" No, Smith, I did not say. that; I thought he knew it .

It is impossible to do anything with our Constitution as it now stands. Who were those loudest in their protests against amending the Constitution when we asked for the necessary power to deal with these trusts? Honourable members opposite. Did we not hear them from one end of the country to the other saying that there was no trust in Australia; the Attorney-General said that the only trust about which there was any evidence was one in relation to confectionery; but now honourable members opposite are beginning to realise that there is something in the trust business of which they should take notice. Now that the matter is one which is affecting the peoMinple to such an extent that they are demanding that something should be done, the Government turn round, and they are going to give us an inquiry, just like the late leader of the party opposite- Mr . Deakin. He had another method of dealing with matters; he used to write a memorandum, and that was all we heard about any matter. The present Government, when they realise that a thing is seriously and vitally affecting the people, innu- turn round and say that they wall appoint a Commission of some kind, a Commission that has no power to ask one single question of vital importance bo the people.

194,Mr FINLAYSON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I rise to a point of order. Last night the House passed a resolution in regard to the days of sitting which the Prime Minister said was to operate next week. Mr W. H . IBVINE - It operates at once, except as otherwise ordered.",29
195,Mr FINLAYSON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I wish to have a ruling as to whether the resolution is in operation today. Unless it is brought into operation today the business before the House under the existing rules should be called on, and that business is private members' business.",29
196,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The House did order that we should meet today at 2.30 p.m., but it ordered that before we passed the resolution that on Thursdays the House should meet at 10.30 a.m. As_ the decision to meet at 2.30 p.m. was arrived at previously it cannot take any effect so far as today's sitting is concerned, and private members' business must stand.",29
197,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"It cannot, because it has not been provided for.",29
198,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"That is another point. My contention is that the resolutions we passed swept away everything decided previously, and therefore it swept away the decision to meet at 2.30 p.m. today. I can realise what the Prime Minister says, that we have not provided for private members' business. Mr W. H . IBVINE -""Wit h regard to the - objection that the sessional orders moved - by the Prime Minister rescinded the prior declaration of the House that we should meet today at 2.30 p.m., the only effect, if that were upheld, would be that we should have met at 10.30 a.m., and in all - other respects the sessional orders would remain. But what good would that do to my friend? It would not mean that we were sitting illegally, but that Mr Speaker had not taken the chair at the right time. The answer to the point taken hy the hon- or able member for Brisbane is that the sessional orders provided that the days of sitting should be so-and-so until otherwise - ordered, but the House had immediately prior to passing that resolution made a special order as to the hour of sitting for today.",29
199,Mr WEST,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,""" Until otherwise ordered "" - means a subsequent decision.",29
200,Mr FINLAYSON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The word should be unless."" Mr W. H. IBVINE - Naturall y we should expect the use of the word ""unless,"" because "" u n t i l "" indicates a further order, and there was inconsistency between the two resolutions on the same day. This being so, the general rule governing the interpretation of documents should apply, namely, that where there is an inconsistency between a general provision and a,special provision, the general provision must give way. The honourable member for Batman recognises that as a perfectly well-known rule of construction. If either honourable member is right, all that has been proved is that the House ought to nave met at half-past 10 a.m. But as it did not, there is nothing that can be done.",29
201,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"We had no quorum at half-past 10. Mr W. H . IBVINE - We know nothing at all about that. We are here, and the question is, what shall we do? I submit that the sessional order must prevail, and that the business set down for today must be proceeded with.",29
202,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Properly , the point of order should have been taken yesterday, when the House was discussing the proposed sessional order; it is not customary to consider points of order which are raised retrospectively. However, the point is an interesting one. With regard to the first contention of the honourable member for Brisbane, the House undoubtedly intended, and by special order directed, that on this Thursday the hour of meeting should be half-past 2 o'clock in the afternoon. I take that to be the general decision of honourable members, as it was come to by the passing of a special motion moved by the Prime Minister, and, therefore, it became a special direction of the House. The resolution passed later, creating a sessional order, was intended, I take it , to deal with, not today's sitting, but all subsequent sittings for the remainder of the session. It did not purport to rescind the special motion passed in regard to today's meeting.",29
203,Mr MATHEWS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,It must have superseded it .,29
204,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Such a resolution could not, under our Standing Orders, be rescinded by a subsequent motion later in the day, as seven days' notice of rescission is required. I think that honourable members generally will agree with me when I say that the wish of the House was that we should meet - today at half-past 2 o'clock, and that the sessional order fixing half past 10 as the hour for meeting on Thurs- days should apply to all subsequent meetings on that day. As to the second contention, the House yesterday directed that Government business should take precedence of ail other business, and in pursuance of that resolution Government business has been placed first on the notice-paper for today. I would remind honourable members that no provision has yet been made for private members' business , and there is nothing in the Standing Orders making it obligatory to have private members' business considered on Thursdays. The consideration of private members' business has always been arranged for by a sessional order; but that has not been done so far this session.",29
205,Mr MATHEWS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,On the order,30
206,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Is the honourable member raising a fresh point of order?,30
207,Mr MATHEWS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Yes . I submit that this House is sitting illegally.,30
208,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I have decided that point.,30
209,Mr MATHEWS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"You did - specially with that point, and the honourable member did not raise it . I maintain that the motion submitted by the Prime Minister, fixing the hour of meeting at 2.30 today, was nullified by the subsequent sessional order fixing the hour of meeting at h a l f p as t 10 o'clock a.m.",30
210,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I have clearly decided that point. If the honourable member dissents from my ruling there is a proper course for him to follow, but he will not be in order in traversing the r u ling.",30

It is intended to convey to the people of Australia the idea that it is the desire of this Government to prevent favouritism and discrimination in Government employment.",30
213,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Why not wait unt i l you see the Bill?,30
214,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The motion practically gives the provisions of the Bill . i what has been said by the honourable member for Bendigo, that the motion, like the Bill , is a f r a u d upon the Constitution, and that what is being done is not the action of a straightforward Government. The intention of the Attorney-General is clear, and he has never hesitated to place his views on this matter plainly before the country. He is associated with the Prime Minister, who, all his life, whether mistakenly, because his judgment Was wrong, or because he was misled, has adopted a view directly opposite from that embodied in the proposal before us. But now, as head of the Government, he proposes to do what he declared to be Wrong, unjust, and bad, in the earlier days of his political career. No one has a right to reflect on another for any change of opinion, provided that there has been a change Of opinion; but point of we have no evidence that there has been such a change in the case of the Prime Minister. I am of opinion that this Government, instead of wishing to do justice in connection with appointments to the Public Service, intends injustice. The last Administration, in declaring that it would give .preference to unionists, rid' not deal itself of even the shadow of partiality, Ministers stating that (heir policy waspreference to unionists by the Courtsand by the Parliament. For the last nine or ten years, a majority of thoseelected to this Parliament have been in favour of. preference to unionists, given,, not only by the Courts, but by the Parliaments and by the Executive. Different Parliaments have affirmed the p r in ciple of preference, and it is inconsistent,, when We have empowered the Courts to give preference under certain circumstances, to say that the Executive Government may not do so. I would have nohesitation in telling my electors, as I told them before the last election, that the straightforward - course is for Parliament to give effect to the principle of preference to unionists through the Executive. The Government now in power aremisleading innocent people into the belief that no preference is to be given to a n y one-^certainly not to unionists-and M in isters will , without any qualms of 'conscience, brush out unionists and take in their own friedds. If applicants for employment are not unionists, they are to have preference. This is exclusion of unionists. It prohibits the employment; I echo of unionists. Mr. JOSEPH COOK. - It does not.",30

Behind the blind of impartiality the Liberal party will be able to put on itsown'employees. A unionist will not desert his union. In nine out of ten of the employments that would be affected by the' Bill a unionist, as the Prime M in ister knows, would not work with a non-unionist. Therefore, the real effect of the measure would be to create industrial The strife, and a conflict between the unions and the Government, and debar unionists absolutely.

"" We are immaculate., and no one wil l be penalized for his rowdy political opinions."" No one, since I have been in Parliament, has ever used such terms of insinuation and innuendo towards electors of the Commonwealth who I cannot happened to be unionists, as the Prime Minister has used.",31
237,Mr RODGERS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Has one unionist resigned because of his fears since the present Government came into office? It is not in Mr FISHER - The unionists are not built that way. They do not resign and run awav when they are fighting for a principle. If the honourable member had been unfortunate enough to have to fight for his existence in industrial employment, and he' had the capacity which his present position indicates that he has. not be he would probably have occupied a prominent position in a union, and he would have found great difficulty from time to : time when fighting for the rights of himself and his fellow men. And if , after the honourable member had fought, for - his rights, and won them, and the Democracy had, at three separate elections, endorsed the principle he advocated as the policy of the country, would he find himself supporting a Government who wish, under the guise of treating everybody palike, to deny to unionists even the right of employment? What is the difference between the hypocrisy of the Government and our proposal? We said that unionists, as an organized party, with set tions of employment that are fair and reasonable, with 'remuneration that is sufficient to enable a man to keep himself, his wife, and family in that reasonable comfort which civilized beings ought to have, should be entitled to preference in Government employment. We did not say, and never shall say, that they should be employed to the absolute exclusion of others. ,. Mr W. H . IBVINE - That is extremely kind of you. You have gone as far as you can; but you have not quite' the audacity to do that.",31
238,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"As a party, we have a political record and an industrial record, and both are cleaner than the records of gentlemen sitting on the Government benches.",32
239,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,""" I am not as other men are.""",32
240,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"You are a ""Sort of Pharisee, I should think.",32
241,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The Attorney-General interjected very kindly, in that gentle tone of his-so judicial in terms, and, I suppose, specially selected for the occasion. I repeat again that, reviewing my twenty-eight years connection with the Labour movement in Australia, the work accomplished in that movement will bear favourable comparison with anything done by any other organization. The Labour party have done more, in Parliament and out of Parliament, to ameliorate the hard conditions of the toilers, and to do justice to one and all, than all other parties together. Liberals say, "" We did this, and we did that."" Many of the things the Liberals say they did were never heard of until the Labour party came into Parliament; or, if they were heard of, they were only placards to catch a few fleeting votes. But the Liberals became very agile after the years 1891-2-3. There was a mental agility that was unknown previously, and social legislation came to pass. However, I do not want to go into that matter now. I oppose the proposal before the House, and I shall oppose the Bill. The Bill itself cannot be discussed now, although we know what its contents are. This motion means just'what I said it means. It is, in my opinion, a placard for a purpose other than it purports to serve, but underneath it is the deliberate intention of the Government to get a political advantage for themselves by encondi- abling them to employ all the casuals from, not among the unionists, but from amongst the non-unionists. In reply to an interjector, I have nothing to say  We have our principles of unionism to uphold, and we shall uphold them despite all the Packers that ever came into existence. But when we see the Prime Minister and other Ministers conciliating and  know that is only an additional instance of the desire of the Government to break up the real unions which have done so much for the country, and it is evidence, if it is not proof, of. their determination to discriminate against the real unionists, and not against the bogus unionists. The Prime Minister knows that better than I can tell him. I orjpose this motion, and I hope that the Bill, if it reaches the House, will not pass. I fought my last election everywhere in favour of preference to unionists as a just, sound, honourable and straightforward principle of organized society. Civilized Democracy cannot exist without it , and the man who does not know that is ignorant of the first rudiments of democratic government. Organize, organize; organize. Aa the honourable member for Bendigo pointed out, we do not believe in preference to only unions of employees, but also to unions of employers. The employers, as well as the employees, are mentioned in the Act, and we want all to be treated alike. I have always said that preference should be given to the employers as well as to the employees. Mr W. H . IBVINE - "" All things being equal "" ; do not forget that.",32
242,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"That makes no difference to me. But certainly "" all things being equal"" is a phrase that even the Attorney-General cannot take exception to. Mr W. H . IBVINE - I do not take ception to it ; it is a splendid phrase.",32
243,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The suggestion of the Attorney-General is that the phrase should not be taken notice of, and it is a proof of my allegation' that even the phrase "" all things being equal "" will not prevent the Government from employing other than unionists. The Government want to remove the possibility of unionists being employed, even if all things be equal. I have seen a few Governments in Australia, both in the States and under the Federation, and may I tell the At torney-General that, when the first Labour Government in the world was formed in Queensland in 1899, there was not a single representative of Labour in the nominee Upper House who would speak for the Government, and that nominee Upper House was then, as now, supposed to be of a non-party character, and representative of all the interests of the country. The Labour party were polling then nearly 43 per cent, of the votes recorded, and yet we had not a single representative in that House. Honourable members yet talk about justice, and freedom, and their treatment of unionists. So far as they are concerned, justice and freedom have nob begun yet. The influences behind the Government have driven them to take this action, which I believe to be wrong, with the object of hitting at the unionists, and not with a. view of bringing about impartiality in Government employment. There are some people who think that this proposal will affect the employees under the Public Service Act. I do not think so. Tliere are certain casual employees whom it will affect. But the opportunity which it will alford the Government to give patronage bo their own friends and supporters will make it difficult for any unionist to be employed by the Government, although Ministers may not say so. I stand by the policy that the Labour party have adopted, and I am willing to accept the challenge of the Government to fight them on their own ground, and to consult, the people on this measure.",33
244,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Capricornia) [5.2] - I am * sorry that at this early stage of the session I have to protest against the introduction of this Bill. I have many reasons for protesting against it , and I am quite opposed to giving the Attorney General leave to introduce a measure of this character. What does the AttorneyexGeneral want the Bill for 1 According to the Prime Minister, any preference to unionists that existed when he took office has been abolished, and I have come to the conclusion that the only reason that the Attorney-General has for asking leave to introduce this Bill is that he desires to place before the public something which he thinks will arouse the passions of people who know nothing about political economy.",33
245,Mr ATKINSON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,You know that is not the reason.,33
246,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I am sure it is the reason. The Attorney-General's horizon is limited to Victoria, which has been very good to him. I do not think he spends much time in the other States of this great Commonwealth. His horizon is limited to Victoria, and to a very Conservative section of the people of Victoria. Unfortunately, we have in this State two great dailies with a circulation of about 130,000 today which are not supporters of the national Labour party. Mr ABTHT/B - The circulation of 0 the Argus is not nearly 130,000 a day ",33
247,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The Argus, which is an outspoken enemy of our party, represents the Conservative section of the community-thos e who have grown rich under the present system, and do not desire any change; those who hope to be rich, and those who think that to buy the Argus is a very respectable thing to do. It has misrepresented our aims to these people, telling them that we are endeavouring to do something unjust in connection with our proposal that where, say, two men of equal qualifications-on e a member of the Amalgamated Carpenters and. Joiners Association and the other a non-member - appl y for employment, the preference shall be given to the association member. Honourable members opposite who have accused the unemployed workers of Australia of asking for work, and praying to God that they may not get it, now think it necessary to bring in a Bill to prevent the making of any distinction between two men who are eager to obtain work. Why is such a Bill necessary? Evidently, although the Ministerial party has denied it many a time, the workers of Australia are most anxious to get employment. By this Bill honourable membert opposite say, in effect, that there are two men after the one job. If that be so, what are they doing for the unemployed",33

253,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"No ; afraid to exhibit it, because of the influence of the society paper, the Argus. The Attorney-General is quite wrong in his view that he will be successful in his appeal to the society prejudices of the people of Victoria. doubt he and the Prime Minister believe that if they can only have the next electhe tion decided on this question-and that is why they speak of this as a "" test"" Bill-the y will win. The Attorneyformity General, in his political enmity to the workers of Australia, however, has overmunity. reached himself. He has abandoned the as attitude of the man who desires He takes up, quite conscientiously, I believe, the stand that he wishes to give fair play, and declares that the Government desire that there shall be a fair field and no favour. But if that is so, why does he ask for leave to introduce deals only with, the industrial classes, and does not apply to his friends of the Bar Association? Why does not this Bill apply to the professional classes?",34

259,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Quite so. When one of men engaged in industry, one has in mind carpenters and joiners, plumbers, stone-masons, and so forth. We do not regard our ""high"" friends, the honourable member for a Bendigo and the Attorney-General, as bea longing to an industrial organization. They belong, as I am reminded, to one of the learned professions. Where are the learned professions under this Bill?",34

263,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The society classes regard the Attorney-General as the embodiment of fair play. They do not see him,34
264,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,My electors do not so re,34
265,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"That is because they read the Age. I ask the Attorney-General to be fair - Last year there appeared in t an Adelaide newspaper the statement that the Government intended to introduce two - test Bills to bring about a dissolution. They were to contain only two clauses. The Attorney-General must have a very poor opinion of honourable members on this side. I heard him say once that members - of the Labour party 'seemed to come to - the top like corks on water, the suggestion being that they had very little ibrains. Mr W . H . IRVINE - When did I ever - say or imply anything of the kind? I should have thought it was sufficiently - obvious in regard to some of the party, but I should not apply such a statement to all.",34
266,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Havin g described thirty six members of our party as incapable, and the remaining one as a capable man, the Attorney-General as a lawyer would say he was justified in asserting that he had not applied such a remark to all of us. Mr W . H . IRVINE - But I did not say anything of the kind.",35
267,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Eve n if the honourable member did not, his actions suggest that he has but a poor opinion of our intelliin gence and experience. He said in effect, "" We will bring down two test Bills taining only two clauses, push them through the House of Representatives, and send them on to the Senate, they will be rejected. We shall then get a double dissolution."" Are not the Standmember knows so much, really! ing Orders for the protection of the minority? The Attorney-General thought that if the Bill were restricted to two clauses, we should be prevented prachave tically from moving any amendment. N doubt it was for that reason that frained from providing for the imposiman tion of penalties. If this Bill is the as that before us last session, then it is of only one. not worth the paper it is printed on, because it does not provide for any penalty. Are we to permit offending public serperfection. vants to be sentenced to some punishment by the Attorney-General, in whom I can see a likeness, in some respects, to Judge Jeffreys of seventeenth century fame. Mr W . H . IRVINE - Did the honourable in a perfect body."" member know him ?",35
268,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I have read of him. That Judge, when a prisoner claimed benefit of the law, replied, "" I shall give you the benefit of the law "" ; and immedithe ately turning to the executioner said, "" See that the execution is carried out successfully."" I do not wish for a moment to attribute all the characteristics of Judge Jeffreys to the Attorney General, but the honourable gentleman is that type of man.",35
269,Mr WH IRVINE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I do not know why the honourable member should not do so, because that is no worse than much that has been said about me.",35
270,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The Attorney-General is a forceful character, who believes in rough and ready methods; and I should not like to trust him with the power of dealing with and sentencing an officer who violated the provisions of this Bill should it become law. That is why I am availing myself of this opportunity given by the Standing Orders to object to leave being given to introduce a measure of the sort. The honourable gentleman, is the idol of society, as represented by the Women's National League; and councillor somebody or other, a little time ago, described him as a man of "" grit, go, and gumption."" He is regarded as the natural leader of the Conservative forces this House, simply because he is in a position to say to his party, "" If you do connot do as I desire, I shall burst up the party by resigning from politics altog e the r ""; indeed, that is what the honwhere orable gentleman has said. Mr W . H . IRVINE - The honourable He ought not to "" g i v e a w a y "" all this!",35

There he reis no doubt that the honourable gentleis in a position to do as he threatens, same because the Liberal party has a majority However, I am afraid I am getting a little away from my subject. The society classes, as I have in timated, regard the Attorney-General as Even my own friend and political enemy, the honourable member for Parkes, does so-that gentleman who the lectures on the desirability of a sound mind in a sound body, and invites his audience to "" Behold in me a perfect mind All of us who have any regard for the fair sex. must feel a very high admiration for the leading the members of the Women's National League; but if those ladies saw and heard Attorney-General answering questions in this House I am sure they would say, "" I really think that Mr Irvine ought to be more fair . "" On the 18th November, 1913, I asked the Attorney-GeneralI wish to know from the Attorney-General whether he intends to provide for the punishment of any person who fails to observe the provisions of the Government Preference Prohibition Act should the Bill now before the House become law? I do not see anything in the measure providing penalties for the punishment of any official or other person who refuses to carry out the law. Is it proposed to provide penalties, and, if so, what are they to be? I ask honourable members now to listen to the answer given by this idol of the society classes in VictoriaI do not intend to answer questions relating to measures which are before the House. To answer questions as to what is meant by or intended in regard to the legislation actually before Parliament would turn question time into an opportunity for debating at almost interminable length business which ought not to be discussed until called on in the ordinary course. I naturally thought, in view of that answer, that the Attorney-General intended to impart some information when the Bill was before us; but on the very next day he "" gagged "" the Bill through the House without any penalty clauses being attached. What would a Court of Law think of such an answer? able gentleman is well aware that, under the Standing Orders, there can be no debate at question time ; and if he had replied plainly, "" I do not intend to in troduce any penalties,"" there would have been an end of the matter. torney-General, however, is like the Prime Minister; he, as it were, has a bucketful of political dust alongside, and every now and then he takes out a handf u l and tries to throw, it in the eyes of the people of Australia. ties are set fort h in the Bill , who will decree the punishment o£ any officer of the Commonwealth who may happen to grant preference? Is it to to the Attorney-General? judge of what the honourable gentleman would do to those officers, by what he proposed in his notorious Coercion Bill in the State Parliament? I have forgotten the penalties under that Bill , hut I know they were extremely drastic.",35
272,Mr ARTHUR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,It never became an Aet.,36
273,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I know it did not. Mr W . H . IRVINE - Because it did its business.,36
274,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"That is, the mere threat of such a Bill "" did its business."" Mr W . H . IRVINE - Yes , and very effectually too.",36
275,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Then , I suppose the At torney-General thinks that the threat i m plied in the Bill now before us, is also going to "" do its business "" ? Is it in tended to rouse the passions of people who probably have never had occasion to j o in a union? The ladies of the Women's National League, doubtless, were never in any union but that most estimable union known as the marriage tie. They have no idea of the struggles of trade unionists ; - they know nothing of the troubles of builders' labourers, stonemasons, lumpers, and other waterside workers, shearers, and rouseabouts, like those unfortunates who have to pick up the fleeces of the honourable member for Riverina. Does the Attorney-General expect to inflame the minds of those ladies, and other supporters of the Liberal cause, by a proposal which will "" do its business "" as di d his Coercion Bill ? I was in Melbourne at the time that Bill was introduced in the Victorian Parliament, but I forget whether the railway men were actually on strike, or had merely threatened to strike. The honor- Mr W . H . IRVINE - That shows how much the honourable member knows about the matter!",36
276,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Muc h water has run under the bridge in the intervening ten or eleven years, and one may be forgiven The At if the incidents are forgotten. At any rate, my memory is good enough to enable me to say that the Bill to which I refer made it a penal offence for a sympathetic person to contribute half-a-crown in aid If no penal- of the strike f u n d . Such a Bill is worse than any passed for the settlement of troubles in Ireland. Knowing the disposition and character of the Attorneybe left General, it would, in my opinion, be a Are we to great shame to entrust him with the power to penalize and throw out on a cold world any civil servant who, having regard to equity, justice, and the substantial merits of the case, might give preference to a unionist. The Attorney General may claim this power, because the inference is that the measure he proposes to introduce is similar to that which was before the House last year, leaving it quite open as to who shall punish these individuals, and what their punishment shall be. A r e they to be immersed in boiling, oil? Sometimes, when our imaginations become particularly fevered, we may imagine the At torney-General pouring molten lead into the ears of these unfortunate civil servants.",36
277,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I think it is beyond the limits of the Standing Orders to accuse an honourable member of an atrocity of that kind.,37
278,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I beg to withdraw the suggestion. If you remember, sir, I only said that we might imagine it at some period in this session when our imaginations might be worked up to a fever heat by the happenings in the Chamber. The Attorney-General may pass away, and another Attorney-General may be there who may be of a more severe disposition, and may drive a nail into the ear of an unfortunate civil servant who offends in this respect. I do not derive very much inspiration from contemplating the Postmaster-General. I am not able to get a lead from contemplating his countenance, because I know that he cannot have sympathy with the introduction of a Bill of this kind. The Amalgamated Society of Carpenters was formed sixty years ago, when men were receiving, in some cases, 4s. 6d. a day for goodness knows how many hours' work, and the carpenters decided that, in the interests of themselves and their families, they should unite and form a union, paying 6d._ or is. a week into funds to provide against unemployment, ill-health, and accidents. This union has paid out more than £3,500,000 sterling in these directions, and I am sure the Postmaster-General recognises that a member of that body should have preference over one who will* not join the union, and will not pay 6d. a week towards these funds. When the Commonwealth has some casual work to offer for a few days here and a few days there, and two men, both equally good workmen, come seeking employment, the one a member of this union and the other one who says he will not join it , in ness, I am sure, the Postmaster-General would give the job to the unionist. The Minister sees the justice of giving preference to the man who belongs to a union. If any one is under the impression that there is a huge obstacle in the way of a man joining a union, let me disabuse his mind of it . I think that a man can join the Carpenters Union for 5s.",37
279,Mr BOYD,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,To join the Wharf bourers Union a man has to pay £ 5 .,37
280,Mr FLEMING,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,At one time you could not join the Wharf Labourers Union in New South Wales no matter what you offered.,37
281,Mr LAIRD SMITH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,You have no proof of that.,37
282,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Order I,37
283,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Any carpenter who has served his time, and knows his trade, and possesses 5s., can join the Carpenters Union. I think that the subscriptions for the Builders' Labourers Union, the Australian Workers Union, and similar organization, are about £ 1 per annum.",37
284,Mr MCGRATH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,And the.members of one union get a paper for that money.,37
285,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Yes ; every year they get'fifty-two issues of a very good paper. No one seriously believes that the payment of an entrance fee of 5s. or £ 1 is an obstacle to any one joining a union, and when men can join these unions and get all the privileges embodied in the term ""preference to unionists"" why should they not join in the interests of civilization? Under the Arbitration Act we have provided that the Judge acting according to good conscience and equity can give preference, other things being equal. I believe that the honourable member for Kooyong, ex-Minister of Trade and Customs, and ex-Minister of a lot of other things, voted for that provision.",37
286,Sir ROBERT BEST,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"At that time it was surrounded by a vast number of safeguards, all of which your party swept away.",37
287,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable member supported that provision, and so did several other honourable members who were then followers of Mr Deakin. Are they now going to reverse their form and follow the example of the present Prime Minister, who has reversed his form on so many occasions, and is more agile than fair- an acrobat or one of those gentlemen who loop the loop ? Do the honourable member for Kooyong and the Postmaster-General think it is fair to push through the House a Bill which excludes from its operation lawyers, and the medical profession and architects ? We shall require a large number of draughtsmen and architects in connection wich the building of the Capital at Canberra, and a host of other professional men will get employment from the LaCommonwealth, yet they are not to be brought under the operation of this Bill.. Is not that class legislation of a very bad type ?",37
288,Mr RILEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,But honourable members opposite are here to represent a class.,38
289,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The Attorney-General is here mainly to represent the society classes, whose idol he is. There are some honourable members who are here to give fair play, but generally, as regards honourable members on the Government side, no matter what their. hearts may say, their heads tell them to follow the lead of the Attorney-General. I never utter threats, and I do not say it as a threat, but on every possible occasion I shall oppose any attempt at class legislation. The unfortunate man who has to work with bowyangs has as much right to - justice at the hands of the Commonwealth as the Attorney-General, who goes into Court with his wig and gown. But the Attorney-General, however, does not think so, and in his brutal methodspolitically brutal-h e seeks to drive a steam roller over the House and rush this Bill through, regardless of all forms and ceremony. Honourable members who support him in this course are unjust. Whether the Attorney-General will succeed in his desire to mislead the people of the Commonwealth, even with the aid of the Argits, is problematical. I am not going to give him a chance, if I can avoid it , of getting his so-called test dissolution. That brings me to another point. I wish to know whether the honourable member who comes from the Richmond River, possessing the confidence of the Ministry, was accurately reported when he said that it was the intention of the Government, the moment they took office, to force a double dissolution.",38
290,Mr MASSYGREENE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I am credited with making that speech at Murwillumbah, but I never made any speech there, and I have never said any such thing.",38
291,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I have seen no contradiction.,38
292,Mr ATKINSON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,You have it now. hope you will accept the assurance of the honourable member.,38
293,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Accordin g to the Standing Orders I must.,38
294,Mr BRENNAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Stil l it is very cleverly put in, because he has admitted that he said almost the same thing in another place.",38
295,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The Prime Minister, the Attorney-General, and other responsible members of the party opposite have said, "" We are going for a double dissolution."" I oppose leave for the introduction of this Bill, because it is to be introduced to bring about a double dissolution. Has the Government no regard for the taxpayers? Probably every election costs £70,000, and Ministers are such plungers in finance that the next election may easily cost £100,000.  a day.",38
296,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,They are worth a great deal more than that.,38
297,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The speeches of the honourable member for Calare will not cost much.,38
298,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"He would make speeches if he were permitted to do so. But, although the Liberals went to the country bearing a flag with the word "" Liberty "" emblazoned on it, they have very little more liberty in this Chamber than have the prisoners in Pentridge. When the honourable member gets back to Calare he will find difficulty in explaining to those who sent him here why he has been one of the dumb driven cattle.",38
299,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The honourable member is wandering from the point.,38
300,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"You , sir, will excuse me if I do not hurry. It is for this House to put on the brake when legislation is proposed by a gentleman of the political instincts and history of the Attorney General, nephew of John Mitchel, and a distinguished member of the Bar, LL.D., M.A., and several other things which I need not mention. I may repeat, without being guilty of tedious repetition, that this is class legislation, and that the At9 torney-General, in his bitter animosity to reform, and in his desire to act up to his reputation for "" grip, go, and gumption,"" is attacking the working classes. Of course, every one works, though the idea is prevalent that it is only the wielders of picks and shovels who are workers. I Mr ATKINSON - The honourable member himself is labouring now.",38
301,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"That is not too bad for the honourable member. He has tried on many occasions in the past ten years to say something funny, but this is the first time that he has succeeded. I may appear to he labouring, but under the Standing Orders each member has a certain time in which to speak, and in the performance of our sacred duties we are entitled to proceed at as leisurely a pace as we may choose. The Attorneycharacter, General, in his bitter antipathy to every man who wears dungarees and bowmeasures yangs, to every unfortunate who wields the hoe, has - introduced a Bill which affects only the industrial classes, takseen ing no notice of the architects, draughts Mr. men, civil engineers, barristers, solicitors, surveyors, doctors, and others prise what are known as the professional classes. I emphasize the to prick the little political balloon that the Attorney-General hopes to float. The sense of justice of the fair ladies the Women's National League, and even of the society people who read the will , when they know this, prompt them' to turn down the honourable gentleman a political leader, as well as many of who are following him so sheepishly. do not know why honourable members opis posite-som e of whom seem to be kindney-General hearted fellows-allo w the Attorneyready General to rule them in this way. Where is their professed independence? is the rising hope of young Australia, that man of strong individuality-the able member for Robertson?",38
302,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The question the House is the motion for leave to in troduce a Bill .,39
303,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"It is that which ing me to take up your time, Mr Speaker. I object to the motion, first, because Attorney-General wishes to introduce Bill , and, secondly, because that B i tains a provision to which I am opposed, and does not contain other provisions which it would contain if the honourable gentleman desired to be fair, and to up to his reputation. I have no that the time will come when he will adorn the Bench of this country, and I should be very willing.to appoint him to self into another man's place. a judicial position now.",39
304,Mr RILEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Where would his party be then?,39
305,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"They would be where want them to be. The Attorney-General is, no doubt, justly and rightly amsuch men. bitious; but is he not doing wrong in allowing his party bias to lead him to in troduce a measure of the kind I am ready to make excuses for party politicians who do things that they ought not to do; but there is no reason for action of the Attorney-General. We are quite willing to assist him and the Prime anything. Minister to pass measures of a national for which the people are waiting, and if he promised to introduce such I should at once sit down. I hope that, when the Attorney-General replies, if he so far condescends-and we have exhibitions of temper here that you, Speaker, have had to reprove, as when you told him that he ought to stand who comup when answering a question",39
306,Mr BOYD,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The honourable member is fact in order doing it very well.,39

310,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I do so, and express regret that I used the words objected to. is causThe moving of this motion shows the hatred of the Attorney-General to the the working classes of Australia. The Bill is a aimed at them alone, particularly at that l l consection engaged in the building trade.

One purpose in in this Bill as one of the so-called in ""test"" measures is that the Government know may find it a good election cry when they go before the people. They will go on the platform, and talk about British freedom, and say that everybody is to be treated alike, and no favouritism is to be a shown, and no doubt such assertions may some influence with some people. If there should be an ' election-and I very much doubt that there will-this story be told to the electors, not only on the platform and in the Conservative journals day after day, but by that more that insidious and almost contemptible method that the of sending paid canvassers from house to On platforms the speakers have to confine themselves to the object the Bill , which is to abolish preference; but these men and women n time who are sometimes compelled by dire circumstances to sell their political souls to the Liberal party, and become paid canvassers, will not sayafo the electors that the Bill affects only about 2,000 people throughout the Commonwealth. They will put the position to the electors in this manner, "" This Bill will affect everybody throughout Australia, and the Liberals are fighting for a great principle. If the Labour party is returned to power, every domestic servant will be compelled to belong to a union."" say that the term "" s e r v a n t "" will disappear from use in time as the social status of those workers is raised. securing of domestic help is an acute problem in Australia, but it would disappear if the social status of domestic assistants were improved. vassers will also tell the farmer that his son, unless he belongs to a union, will not be permitted to work for him, and other tales, even more dreadful than those that were ' scattered throughout Australia at the last election, will be whisjiered into the ears of the electors. If the Government really wanted a double dissolution, they would have brought down a Bill of more far-reaching importance, and then, if it was rejected by the Senate, no Governor General could refuse to grant a dissolution. Why are the Government not courageous enough to bring down a Bill ^ i c h would do away with preference to unionists entirely ? They dare not do so, because they' know that they would arouse the animosity and active opposition of the great unions throughout the length and breadth of Australia. those unions, the Government were not game to bring in a Bill of that character, but are simply introducing what has been rightly termed "" nothing but the shadow of a sham."" At any rate, it is a measure which can have no effect, because the object it purports to effect has been already achieved by a simple act of administration. If the Ministry had any courage, and any real desire to bring about reform, would it not have been better to haye proposed a reform in connection with unionism which would have almost made industrial strife in the Commonwealth impossible? opinion that it would have been preferable if the Attorney-General had introduced a measure that would not only give preference to unionists, but unionism compulsory. Mr W . H . IRVINE - Y o u are logical, at any rate.",40
324,Mr DANKEL,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I know the Attorneyknow. General has a logical mind of a kind, and, therefore, I appreciate his interjection. As the honourable member is looked upon as one of the strong men in Australian politics, I hope he will lose no time in bringing forward a Bill to make unionism compulsory throughout Australia. I feel certain that, if that were Here let me done, nearly all the unpleasantness of industrial strife would disappear. I will admit that that is a big thing to say, The because, in all our legislative efforts, we must always consider human nature,'and the characteristics of humanity; but I am prepared to say that compulsory unionism These can- would be a solution of many of our present industrial troubles. On this question I do not speak from a party standpoint at all. I have a true desire to bring about industrial peace, as far as is broadcast possible, by legislation, and I am suggesting a means by which I believe in dustrial peace could be brought about. Mr W . H . IRVINE - Is your party in favour of compulsory unionism ?",41
325,Mr DANKEL,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I am speaking only for myself. I have not ascertained the opinions of other honourable members, but I have advocated this principle on more than one occasion in South Australia. I shall give some of my reasons for believing that compulsory unionism would secure, or very nearly secure, industrial peace. What is the cause of many, if not most, of the strikes of the present Fearing day? Is it not that non-unionists are working with unionists? Sometimes these non-unionists may be mere contrary individuals who will not join a union. A woman in South Australia told me the other day that she would sooner see her husband and three sons in their graves than she would have them j o in a union. Sometimes because of mere caprice, and sometimes for sentimental reasons, people will not join a union. Some cannot see the advisableness of joining a union to help themselves and to better their condition. They refuse to do so, and if they are working in some industry in It is my firm which a number of unionists are engaged industrial strife takes place. Finally, unless the employer steps in , and practically compels them to j o in a union, make a strike occurs. The refusal of a few men to join a union when they are engaged in some calling in which the rest of the workers are unionists brings about morestrikes than does anything of which I W it h compulsory unionism that: would be done away with. The very fact of a person being a wage-earner mean that he or she must be a member of a union. There could be no such individual as a non-unionist. Then, again, in such circumstances workers would not have thrown at them slurs such as we often hear, but of which I utterly They would not have applied to them such a word as "" scabs."" expressions are used at the time, but the trouble does not end there. Some of the less enlightened of the worker-8 go even further and inflict injustice upon the members of the family of the non-unionist. How often do we find them going to the length of showing contempt, perhaps, for the wives, the daughters, or the sons of non-unionists? And yet these men might be non-unionists for reasons for which we must give them credit. They might conscientiously object to join a trade organization as we have people objecting, on religious grounds, to compulsory military From their point of view they are quite justified in refusing to join a union, and, if they are at all sentimental, prepared to suffer very gross rather than become unionists. would be done away with if we. had compulsory unionism. It may be asked, Why force a person to become a unionist?"" ""Why force a Quaker to defend Australia?"" The religious objection is the strongest of all forces. members of the Society of Friends, for instance, think .that if they enter army and shoulder a gun-that they are employed in the non-combatant portion of an army-they are endangering their immortal souls. They because of the teachings of their church, that, in such circumstances, leave this mundane sphere of ours, and reach the other side-whatever may be-they will suffer for all eternity. At the outside, we are here for only 80, 90, or 100 years, but a member of the Society of Friends thinks that if he enters the army he will suffer torment for all time in the next world. Can any one blame such people if they feel on the subject? If any honourable member implicitly believed that such retribution would be his lot after he would suffer eternal torments for doing something contrary to the doctrines of his church-what would he do in the circumstances? Any man who conscientiously Mr Dankel. held that belief would be a fool if he rewould frained from doing all that he possibly could to prevent amy worldly authority from forcing him to bear arms. We must admit that this is the strongest of all sentiments, yet the law of the land says, -"" You must bear arms,"" and a man who disapprove. fails to comply with that law is incarcerated. We in Australia are not so Such strict as they are in other parts of the present world, but we make it impossible for an individual to evade military service.",41
326,Unknown,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Sitting suspended from 6.29 to 7.£5 p.m.,42
327,Mr DANKEL,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"When we rose for dinner I was pointing out how much improvement there would be in the condition of industrial affairs if there were a law to compel every worker to join a union. I understood the Attorney-General to admit that this was a logical proposal, and, therefore, I hope he will embrace the just earliest opportunity to bring in a Bill with the object of effecting this most deservice. sirable reform. At the present time many people, who in their hearts do not approve of unionism, are compelled to join they are trade organizations, and thereby suffer indignity what they feel to be an injustice and in All this dignity. W it h compulsory unionism all that feeling would disappear. Before the law we are all , theoretically at least, equal; and it would be impossible for a strong unionist to taunt a non-unionist, and, on the other hand, the man who at The present is a unionist only by force of circumstances ' would feel no outrage to his the feelings by having to f all in line with his even if fellow workers. Many honourable members opposite, Or perhaps all of them, object to this idea on the ground that its think, realization would merely have the effect of compelling the people who were forced when they into the unions to subscribe to Labour political organizations and to vote for the that Labour party. As to the last-mentioned objection, it is chimerical, because the secret ballot leaves it free to every person to vote as he or she pleases. It would, of course, be unjust to compel people to contribute to any political party in whose policy they did not believe; but with comstrongly pulsory unionism we could no more compel people to do this than we can now compel them to contribute to a church or death-that any other religious institution. Of course, I know that there are people in our midst who would be only too pleased if everybody was compelled by law to go to church-and particularly the church to which they themselves belongand to put nothing less than threepence in the plate every Sunday. There is however, no such law; and with compulsory unionism unionists would not be compelled by other than moral suasion to contribute to any political organization. The Australian Workers Union, for instance, will , in course of time, consist of half-a-million members; and, with compulsory unionism, a ballot could be taken to ascertain how many were willing to contribute towards, say, the Liberal party's organization. Of course,, we may take it that the great majority would declare for the Labour party, but matters could be arranged so that everybody would feel absolutely certain that not a penny of his money would go towards any political object of which he did not approve. In the present condition of affairs, I say unhesitatingly that it is absolutely essential that preference should be given to unionists, fbr without preference they would suffer even more than they have in the past. We know that even in Australia, where we are 'all supposed to be free, victimization goes on where there are no strong unions. I have always set my face againsb any attempt on the part of the workers to retaliate by means of victimization of employers. Some time ago, at a meeting in a country district of South Australia, some turbulent spirits advocated that a local tradesman, who was against the Labour party, should not have the custom of his political opponents, but I there and then urged that two wrongs did not make a right, and that the proper method was to show the tradesman that he was taking up a wrong position. If that plan were adopted more generally, victimization of the workers would not be in evidence, very long. There is, however, as I say, victimization going on; and I remember that at a meeting I held in a country place many workers were absolutely afraid to attend to listen to what a Labour man had to say. It is true that they listened, but it was from outside the building ; they contented themselves by peeping in at the door like rabbits looking out of a burrow. The reason for this attitude was found in the fact that some of the employers had made it their business to attend the gathering. When I was about to depart by train next morning, a friend of mine said that it was a pity I had not held an out-door meeting, because he had noticed about 150 men who had not had the pluck to enter the hall. He then explained that several of the large employers of the district had been at the meeting, and that this had had the effect of keeping the men outside. I pointed out that if the men had been afraid to attend the indoor meeting, they would have been equally afraid to attend the outdoor meeting; but my friend said, "" Not at all ; you have a powerful voice, and, as it was a dark night, these men would have listened to you from shady nooks and corners.""",42
328,Mr EODGEKS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,It is very different in my electorate.,43
329,Mr DANKEL,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Thes e matters do not come under the notice of the honourable .member as they do under the notice of the Labour member. People, under present circumstances, have to lower themselves in their own self-esteem in order to escape victimization. Of course, if the workers were all of one mind, and boldly demanded their rights, the victimization would cease at once; but, as I say, as things are now, victimization goes on, especially in country districts. I have often noticed that direct victimization of the individual is indulged in . The other day, when I was travelling to Adelaide by train, a contractor in a large way of business, who was in the same carriage, was speaking on the subject of unionism. I know that this gentleman treats his workmen very fair l y from a monetary point of view, and does not impose on them any very great tasks; but what was the attitude of even this well-intentioned person? He told me that when he has a big job on, he makes it his business to go round at the dinner hour; and if he sees one of the men reading a newspaper and explaining the article to his fellows, he calls his ganger and orders that the man shall be got r i d of at once. He said to me, "" If people once start, thinking, you never, know where it is going to stop. If they once begin dropping in the poison"" - thes e were his words- "" get r i d of them there and then."" When I was in Western Australia the other day, I found that the employers in the sawmilling trade were able to do as they pleased with some of the men who, through no faul t of their own, but through misfortune, were benighted in their views, and unable to help themselves. It is only common sense that people in that position should be shown a better way of living. I am a believer in the divine gospel of discontent, because contentment never made for progress. I do not, of course, favour discontent unsupported by common sense; but it is the duty of every lover of humanity to show the ignorant that there is something more worth living for than their present miserable existence. It may be that those people are quite happy in what appears to us to be their degradation. seen people going into the coal mines in Russia with a carrot and a piece of dry bread for dinner; and it is no wonder, when they leave the mines, that, in their misery, they rush to the nearest vodkashop, for that is about the only recreation that they had when I was there, or, so far as I know, that they have now. These people are really children from a social point of view, and should be treated as such. Just as we should call our children from playing in the mud, and point out how much happier they would be on the lawn, so we have to show those people, who have not the common sense and intelligence to see for themselves, how to better their condition without bringing about industrial strife and turmoil. I have for long advocated compulsory unionism-indeed , I believe I am the only one who has done so-as a great step towards the gradual improvement of our present industrial and social conditions. We compel people to bear arms. Every law on the statute-book tells people to do, or not to do, something. United' Kiugdom, and on the Continent of Europe, there is compulsory industrial insurance against unemployment and all kinds of things. Even women assistants in households must bear their share of it , and if it is right to - compel people to insure, it is equally right and just to compel every wage-eamer to belong to a union, by reason of the fact that he or she is a wage-earner. Compulsory unionism would not only have undoubted advantages for the workers, but it would also be to the welfare and general well-being of the community. For instance, the cost of unionism would be much less. If there are 5,000 workers in a certain industry, and half of them, as they may Mr Dankel. do under the present non-compulsory unionism, decline to belong to the union embracing the other half of those engaged in the industry, it not only brings about' discontent, but it makes the union dues fall more heavily on the individuals comprising the union. Subscriptions to unions' funds would not be, under compulsory unionism, a tenth part of the money necessary to be subscribed under the existing conditions, because there would only be secretaries to pay, and there would not be the need to employ the hosts of other officials that, unfortuI have nately, the unions are now compelled to have in order to get members and keep going. Our friends opposite object to the organizers employed by unions, and contend that men should be left alone, and allowed to please themselves about joining a union; but as there can be no progress without organizing, necessarily the unions must employ these men, even though it ruus away with a certain amount of money. All this expense would be a thing of the past with compulsory unionism, and on that score the dues to be paid by. the workers would be infinitesimal in comparison with what they are now. The objection is raised that some unions make it next to impossible for new members to join by making the entrance fees too high. I do not know whether there is any truth in the assertion, but I was told that one union charged new members £20. I was also told the other day by a man in the train that the Townsville Wharf Labourers Union is charging new members £50, making it manifestly impossible for any working man to enter that union. In the I have not ascertained whether that statement is correct, but if it is true, these heavy entrance fees are imposed in order to protect the unions from a financial point of view. It must be remembered that these organizations commenced operations many years ago, and their older members have paid large sums to Bring them to their present financial position. The members of the Port Adelaide Working Men's Union have, for many years past, regularly contributed to the union through weekly payments, and levies, and special calls on the death of members. Some members of this organization, which is now fairly wealthy as unions go, have paid in hundreds of pounds, and naturally they contend, as the older members of a lodge would contend, that a lieavy entrance fee should be charged to those who wish to partake of all the benefits the union can give them. In fact, they would be doing wrong if they did not act in such a way. That is the explanation of some of the high dues which may be demanded by unions in Australia, but all that sort of thing would absolutely disappear with compulsory unionism. Here in Australia where we have a compact continent, populated by the same class of people, to all intents and purposes, it would be, comparatively speaking, easy to bring about compulsory unionism, whereas in other parts of the world the task would be much more difficult. Of course, in unions there are at times some bellicose spirits, but the most part their members are people of peace, who do not desire strife, turmoil, and anarchism. The Labour party stand for industrial peace. They are the only party in Australia standing for industrial peace, and anxious to do away with strife and strikes. It is our opponents who are the anarchists of Australia, because by preventing the workers having their legitimate demands seen to they bring about a spirit of antagonism and class hatred such as is in evidence even in this House.  for that.",43
330,Mr DANKEL,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"That is not the case. There will be none of it if the unions given the opportunity of having their grievances redressed before a properly constituted tribunal. At present a case cannot be settled for, perhaps, three years, as is the case with the Tramway Unions. The bootmakers had to spend three or four, thousand pounds before getting a verdict. Would not the honourable member for Echuca get sick of the delays of the law if over a case of his he were kept dillydallying for three years? Would not the honourable member far rather choose to use his own strength instead of obeying the law of the land? The people are beginning to see this now, and I feel sure that the next time the referendum is put to them it will be carried. The abolition of preference to unionists in the Government service would bring about a bad feeling among the workers employed by the Commonwealth. Those not belonging to unions might be taunted hy those belonging to unions, or the non-unionists might boast about being free and independent persons, and thus make the unionists feel not too kindly disposed towards them. However, I am afraid that while the Conservatives are in power there will be no preference to unionists-it will be preference to non-unionists such as many private employers impose in those avocations where there is little unionism. In the case of warehouse employees and clerks, among whom unionism is not so fully developed as I am sure it will be in the course of time, the employers practically tyrannize the employees, and the man who belongs to a union, or intends to belong to one, is dismissed. The other day a for man, not an organizer, hut one interested in unionism, went into an office in Adelaide and spoke to the girl typist, eighteen years of age. One of the girl's employers heard this man asking her whether she had any intention of belonging to a union, and, calling her to him afterwards, he told her that if she joined a union she would have to go out of the office. That sort of thing can take place under the present system. It is compulsory nonunionism, and is a great deal worse than having a law to compel people to belong to a union would be. Civilization is so complex now that we must have complex laws. In past centuries the people did not understand enough to feel the need for legislation in this respect. Less than 100 are years ago it was as much as a man's liberty was worth to try to form a trade union. People were deported to New South Wales and Tasmania, where I saw, the other day, those dreadful instruments of torture used in the early days in connection with convicts. They were deported for terras of not less than seven years for trying to help themselves and their fellows by improving their social and industrial conditions. That took place even during the reign of the late Queen Victoria. In those days people thought that if the workers had any education it would he a bad thing. The statement was-it was not an argumentthat if the workers had too much education no one would do the dirty work. The absence of universal education brings about the idea of there being degradation in doing any kind of manual labour. The attribute "" degrading"" in respect of work, however, will disappear from our dictionary in course of time; "" menial occupation"" also is a phrase that will disappear, and the only people who will be looked up to will be those who do honest toil of some kind or another. The laws must be made to meet individual cases as they arise, instead of remaining general as in the days gone by, and as some political economists still think they should be. That is the view of the laissez faire school, the old Manchester doctrine. Tempora mutantur nos et mutamur in Mis. We must change with the times, or the times will push us along willy nilly. As the Attorney General said, when speaking at Nhill on the 12th March last, this Bill is to be introduced to bring about a double dissolution. I must not touch on the prerogative of the King's representative, who is now on his way to Australia, and no one knows how' he will decide this matter, but I doubt that he will grant a double dissolution if these trumpery measures are rejected by the Senate. They are not trumpery from the Government point of view, but in the eyes of Labour members and of the Labour press of Australia, which, unfortunately, is not yet very strong, although it will, in the days to come, be of dominating power. The Melbourne Punch, which is a long way from being a Labour organ, has ridiculed the idea of it being possible to cure a double dissolution by means of these so-called test measures. Of the two, the Bill to prohibit preference to unionists is .the more important. As to the postal voting, the difference of opinion between the two parties is so trifling as to have no weight at all. The Liberal party sets great store by the mea- .31st May last. sure which it is now sought to introduce. Members opposite think that the Bill may bring about a double dissolution, and that if it does it will provide them with a ripping good cry for the election. Used by a skilful rhetorician it would do so.",45
331,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Use d by a good liar!,46
332,Mr DANKEL,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Yes . The real truth would not be told. The Bill affects very few persons, but the attempt will be made to persuade the people that a grand principle is involved. To bring a great principle into issue, members opposite should declare against all preference to unionists, whether in the Courts of Law or elsewhere. No doubt, if the Liberals were in a majority, there would be no preference to unionists; it would everywhere be a thing of the past. But what would be the consequence? The honourable member for Wakefield on one occasion told the people of South Australia that if the referendum were carried, and the Labour party got into power, Australia would see a time like that of the French Revolution, and blood would flow down the gutters of Adelaide. That would not have happened; but something like it might easily happen if the party in power repealed the portion of beneficent industrial legislation that the people now enjoy. That would create widespread discontent, so that the organizer would have a good soil to work upon, and it would be easy to work up a revolutionary spirit. I ask our friends opposite to be wise in their day and generation, and to provide against that. Our mission, above all things, is to provide for peaceful evolution and progress, so that the generations to come may have better and more equal opportunities, and may lead a life worth living, which many persons cannot do now. It is our duty to prepare the way for the Australia that is to be. We all say that we do not care whether there is to be a dissolution or not; but I do not mind admitting se- that for personal reasons I do not desire a dissolution. I am afraid, too, that another election would not be a solution of our trouble, except if the party on this side gets back into power, and Australia would again have the progressive and common-sense administration which she enjoyed during the three years prior to",46
333,Mr HOWE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Dalley) [8.25] - The question under consideration is of such importance that I must attempt to apply myself to it in a humble way, though I shall not waste the time of the House with any extended utterance. When the Minister in chaTge of the Bill has explained its provisions in his second-reading speech, I hope to be able to make a reply from the stand-point of a working man's advocate. Why preference prohibition ? Does the Leader of the House recognise that preference is given at all times to those who are organized and stand shoulder to shoulder, upholding law and order. The leader of my party said today, "" We must organize, organize, organize."" We must not alone do that; we must also educate, educate, and educate. The essence of our Public Service is organization, yet honourable gentlemen opposite desire that a section of it shall not be organized in the way that we wish. All those in the Public Service are organized and under the control of the Public Service Commissioner; but when we ask that preference be given to organized men who wish to join the Service, honourable members opposite say that it should not be given. Every man in the Public Service today is getting preference because of some qualification he possesses that makes him better fitted for his work than those outside. We say that every unionist belonging to an organized trade or industry is more closely related to that trade and industry than a man who is a'non-unionist, and that it is to the advantage of the community to give such men the preference as against the non-unionists who are disorganized, undisciplined, and not associated with their fellows. Does the Attorney-General desire to have under his control unorganized individuals, so that he or his officers may do with them as he pleases, as he did with another set of men some years ago in Victoria? Why should he object to preference to men who are organized and prepared to observe law and order? He is a pleader for law and order, and so are we in this immediate issue. Y e the has the audacity to say to those who are combined in the field of unionism that they shall not have preference as against disorganized men. Will it not conduce to the well-being of the community if those who are organized are given the preference that we ask for? Some years ago, when leader of the State House, the Attorney-General stated that men could not be allowed to stop the wheels of progress. That is what he said when the railway strike was on. We remember how effectively he dealt with the situation which occurred then. Now he is seeking to stop the wheels of progress in connection with our industrial development. He cannot do it . He may do it if he carries his Bill through, but he will not carry it without a fight from one end of Australia to the other. If the honourable member places his Bill on the table in order to frighten us, we will kick it under his feet, and fight him for all he is worth. We are ready to take up his challenge. I am sorry I have to disagree with the honourable member for Boothby in regard to compulsory unionism. I am prepared to see compulsion in connection with unionism, just as we have compulsion in every phase of our social l if e ; but the honourable member is mistaken when he says that compulsion means industrial peace. I want peace if I can get it ; but t I want industrial organization and compulsory unionism that will bring our people so closely together that we will be ready for political warfare whenever it arises. I am not so much concerned about peace; there is no possibility of peace while there is wrong in the world. As a Labour party, we are here to rectify wrongs, and if we cannot rectify them, we have no right to be here. Therefore, I differ from the honourable member for Boothby when he says we are here to obtain industrial peace by compulsory unionism. No man desires more than I do peace and agreement in regard to our industrial difficulties; but I am not here to make peace at any price. I am here to fight, if fight be necessary, and I will not stand by the honourable member in saying that compulsory unionism will bring us peace. If we can obtain peace, well and good, but if we cannot, I will take compulsory unionism as a means of consolidating the industrial forces, in order to fight those who sit on the Government side. That is plain t a l k ; it is what I mean, and what I hope my fellow members on this side of the House mean. What have the Government done in regard to preference to unionists? Have they not done already what they desire to do ? They have, by administrative action, rescinded all that the Labour Government did by administrative action. Did we pass a Bill to impose on the country preference to unionists?",46
334,Mr ATKINSON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Y o u did it without a Bill.,47
335,Mr HOWE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"And the Government have done the same thing without a Bill , and then, like fools, they bring in a Bill . For what purpose? What is the game?",47
336,Mr RODGERS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,To block your party manipulating the Public Service.,47
337,Mr HOWE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I guess that the manipulation is on the Government side. I do not manipulate the Government service, and will not attempt to do so; and I am sure honourable members on this side of the House do not intend to. A great issue is supposed to arise in connection with this question of preference to uniontion ists in the Government service. But is unnecessary for me to traverse all that has been said; the whole question has been threshed out. How many people are involved? A few thousand indithe viduals in the Public Service of the Comt monwealth out of a total population of about 5,000,000. Yet that keen-brained gentleman and Leader of the Ministry, the Attorney-General, a reputed great authority on constitutional law, is today utilizing that petty little situation in to build upon it a constitutional crisis, and lian people, to the wind. an appeal to the country by a double dissolution. A single dissolution will not suit the honourable gentleman;, he must have two chances for his money. honourable member for Parkes said that we on this side also want two chances; so we do; we want twenty-two chances. A r we to understand that the Government other side. are lacking in force and in reasons for attack upon our party and what we have done that they have to resort to a double dissolution on a question of prethe ference (to unionists, involving a few thousand men, in the hope of achieving some victory at the polls ? How great! What keenness; what understanding is behind such a suggestion! And forsooth, upon such a proposition as this the Go the vernment will ask for a dissolution both Houses! Who created Parliament as it is constituted today ? Was it Labour party, or was it the Government Bill . and their forebears, who. thinking that the hob-nail boots of Labour could not enter the Senate, adopted the ConstituB tion which they are now so anxious to amend ?",47
338,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,-'That is what they said.,48

The Conservatives is organized capital. succeeded; but today, when we, by our determination and organization, have fight possession of the Senate, and hold it a Labour House, our opponents are crymay. ing out for an alteration of the Constitution. When we asked them for an alteraof the Constitution on lines that it would conduce to the interests of Australia, they would not agree to it . No ; the referenda proposals were damned by them. They fought tooth and nail against proposed amendments of the Constiu t i o n; but now, when they are asking for something which they imagine will help them to a conservation of their Conservative privileges, they ask for an amendment of the Constitution, and they would throw that sacrosanct document, order which is almost the Bible of the AustraThey would deal with it as they please, and alter it to meet their own immediate ends. They The may or they may not; it all depends. We are ready to fight at any time for an alteration of the Constitution that will e help this side of the House, and not the I say that deliberately. I am out for that every time; and I am quite prepared to have an alteration of the Constitution, after a referendum of people,' that will enlarge the powers we have, and which the Government will begin to recognise should be enlarged. The debates in the House, during the past few days have proved that the Ministerial party are beginning to bow their heads to facts; they are either too blind to see, of or too much interested to deal with them. In conclusion, I wish to enter my the protest against the introduction of this No more shameful proposal has ever come from any Administration than is manifest in the attempt to introduce a ill of this nature. I speak of unionism with heart-love and respect., and I speak of preference to unionists as an essential principle, which no man in the House dare attempt to k ill without my voice l - and effort being arrayed against him . u e Preference to unionists means organization of the industrial world ; it means putting those men on a safe and certain We propose to exclude no one. was Every man can join a union, and become unit in a great party that will u l t i take its part in the fight that must the take place. There is no getting away the fact that on the one hand is organized labour, and on the other hand The two will not assimilate, and cannot assimilate, and a will come-come , I hope, by intellias gence and intellect, but come as best it Carlyle, when asked in regard to the French Revolution how many revolutions there would be, whether one or more, answered, "" There will be just as many as are necessary."" That is the position in which we stand today; and 1 urge the Ministerial members not to take the step they propose, because it will only mean that the moment they do so our cohorts will come together; we shall be welded in one great fighting mass. If we meet our Waterloo, we will come again; if the Government meet theirs, they will be done for all time.",48
340,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Cook) [8.45] The Attorney-General has moved for leave to introduce a Bill entitled "" The Government Preference Prohibition Bill,"" and although it has not yet been placed in the hands of honourable members, we know perfectly well that it is the selfsame measure that was before the House last session. This Bill, on the face of it, is a fraud and a sham.",49
341,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Order ! The use of such an expression has already been ruled out of order several times.,49
342,Mr HIGGS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The Bill, if it is not a fraud, is certainly a delusion.",49
343,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"It is a delusion and a snare. It purports to do something which those who are putting it forward know perfectly well it does not do. They know full well that everything that it could do has already been done. They tell us that they desire to go on with the business of the country; yet they put before us a Bill which is designed to bring about a dissolution, and so to prevent business being done in this House- a Bill which seeks to have business done in some House other than that at present constituted. That being so, the introduction of this Bill is an indication that the Government have no desire to do the business for which the country is calling. The Government are not anxious to advance the business of the country one iota, and are really extending to us an invitation to take up time in discussing this measure. The only object they have in view is to secure the immediate dissolution of both Houses. If we on this side are not agreeable to that-if , in other words, we do not desire immediately to send to the country the members of the Senate, where we haye twenty-nine, as against seven on the Liberal side-the n we have in the proposal now before us an invitation to adopt any tactics that will delay business. If the Government had brought forward business that the country desires should be transacted-if , for instance, they had submitted a scheme for some developmental work in which both parties could join-then , I venture to say, there would have been a whole-souled effort made on this side to have it passed. But when the Government refuse to do anything of the kind, when they simply come down to the House with a proposal to dissolve the Parliament, we can come to no other conclusion than that they have no wish to transact any business of national importance. Their desire really is to transact business of party importance^-busines s which will give their political party some advantage. They do not wish to advance the interests of the nation. This Bill is also designed to supply them with an election cry which will enable them to misrepresent their opponents, and to create in the minds of the people a belief that there is some danger to be feared which does not actually exist. The Bill, in short, is something like the scarecrow which the farmer places over his crop. The Ministerial party are notorious for their scarecrows. At an election held some time ago, when they saw that the party opposed to them was growing in numbers and increasing in influence they put up the scarecrow of Socialism. Sir George - the n Mr - Rei d toured the country with the scarecrow of Socialism at the end of a stick. Every one was told to beware of it . Mothers were warned that with this Socialism they might have their children taken from them, whilst the people were told also that the sanctity of the marriage tie was to be ignored. We faced that scarcecrow fairly and squarely and succeeded in laying it in the dust. Then they came along with scarecrows of other kinds. To-day they tell us that they are seeking a dissolution so that they may go to the constituencies, and, at the same time, they are seeking for something by which they can misrepresent the situation to the people and put up yet another scarecrow. The public mind is such that, where the citizens do not thoroughly grasp the situation, they are influenced by these scarecrows, and by the time they see through one, yet another is invented. In this respect the Government are resorting to the same old dodge which the farmer plays on the parrots that hover over his orchard. In the first place, the farmer puts up a stick with a cross piece on which he hangs a coat. birds that are after his cherries fly over it a few times and, having looked at it carefully, conclude that it is only a scarecrow and come down and have their feed of f r u it . Then the farmer says, "" I must change my scarecrow, I must make it resemble a man -"" Taking some straw from his stack he makes up the figure of a man, paints a face on it , and surmounts it with a hat, and, fastening it to a pole, sets it up. The same old birds which had dropped to his device of a few days before are thus scared off once more. They perch on the trees near by and finally come to the conclusion that this is only another scarecrow. The farmer, however, has only to resort two or three times to this dodge and he has his crop garnered. And so with our opponents. They put up a scarecrow and the public at the beginning are fooled by it . Before they can see through the device the election is over and the scarecrow has served its purpose. When the next election comes along up goes another scarecrow. . The people who do not understand the situation are afraid of it , and it serves its purpose. That is what the Government are doing in this case. Before the Prime Minister came into this House-whe n he was pursuing his candidature in the country-h e misrepresented the position, and it is being misrepresented today. It was misrepresented a few days ago by the Minister of Trade and Customs in the local press, and it has been misrepresented to-night by the honourable member for Wannon. I propose to quote from the policy speech delivered by the Prime Minister, Mr . Joseph Cook.",49
344,Mr MCGRATH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Polic y speech?.,50
345,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I livered by Mr Joseph Cook at Parramatta and reported in the Sydney Morning Herald on 4th A p r i l , 1913. It was supposed to be a policy speech made by him on behalf of the party he was leading. Under the heading of "" Public Service Appointments"" there is in it this statementLiberalism arrays itself against the principle obtaining today in Government employment by means of which the citizens of Australia are classified, and political opponents declared ineligible for Government employment because of their political creed. That is a misrepresentation. The only preference that was given was in conThe nexion with what is known as the day labour system. It was given in connection with temporary employees and applied only to those employed on what are known as public works in the Department of Home Affairs, on the railways, and i u connection with the building of the Federal Capital. Outside of that, there was no suggestion of any interference with employment; and yet Mr . Joseph Cook was leading his hearers to believe that this preference affected the whole Public Service. The Minister of Trade and Customs, Mr Groom, did the same thing the other day. He led the people to believe that it affected the Public Service as a whole, and the honourable member for Wannon, by interjection tonight, has suggested that this preference was an interference with the Public Service generally. Before the Labour party entered the political arena, what was the position? Liberals kept their seats in Parliament because of the number of jobs they were able to find for their political supporters. Labour had no representation in Parliament. We were dependent upon the Conservative party, then divided into Free Traders and Protectionists, when we made the demand that appointments to the Public Service should be by public examination, and that fitness, and not social influence, should be the only test.",50

There never has been any interference with the old-established rule of entrance by examination, apart from public works; and yet this falsehood, for it is nothing less, is put iato the mouth of the Governor General and is published to the country.",51
356,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable member will see that he is imputing something of a dishonourable nature to Ministers, and that, under the Standing Orders, with he has no right to do.",51
357,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"If you direct me, his Mr Speaker, to withdraw the words I is shall do so.

It is marvellous that a statement like that or could be palmed off on an audience of oraldinary intelligent Australian citizens; but, made by a public man in an authorithe tative position, wild and reckless as the 'statement is, it is believed by some people. I do not fear the issue of preference to unionists, but I do fear the misrepresentations of the party opposite. The Liberal party have tremendous funds at their disposal, with Liberal organizers at every door, and millions of newspapers to carry their misrepresentations throughout Australia ; and these facts do give me some ground for fear. There can, however, be no denial of the facts I have stated. The honourable member for Wannon in terjected to-night to the effect that this Bill is intended to stop honourable members on this side "" from manipulating the Public Service "" ; but the honourable member knows perfectly well in his heart that it is nothing of the kind, for everything that the Bill can do has already been done. Even if the Bill be passed, and the present Government, at the next election, are again placed in control, they will be in no different position then from that in which they are today without the Bill , because they have prevented, and can by administrative act prevent, preference to unionists. On the other hand, if they are defeated at the polls, the succeeding Government may wipe out this legislation just as fast as the forms of the House will allow; and we shall be exactly as we were before. From every point of view this measure is nothing less than - well , the Standing Orders do not permit me to use the only English that can be employed to properly describe it .  honourable member the phrase-rip e legislation. ' Mr JH CATTS - It is over-ripe to bursting, and the smell of it can be detected from one end of Australia to the other. There is another aspect of the matter that is worthy of consideration. If the Government, for instance, in the construction of the transcontinental line, found that certain work could be performed only by rhaking terms with a union which in cluded preference to members of that organization, it would be in the public interest that they should be able to do so. Yet they introduce this Bill to tie their own hands, and prevent them entering into an agreement with an organization, when probably circumstances might render it absolutely necessary. The only case in which this Bill can have any operation 1 whatever is such as I have cited; and, as a matter of fact, I think a situation of the kind has already arisen. In the South Australian Herald of the 24th A p r i l this year, there appears the following:- Australian Branch of the A.W.U., has received the agreement which has been entered into between the branch and the Home Affairs Department of the Commonwealth Government regarding the wages to be paid to the men constructing the Transcontinental Railway. The rates of pay will govern those working from the 50-nule peg to and including Tarcoola yards. The agreement will be binding only as regards members of the union and the classes of work organized by that organization, and it shall only apply on work done by the Department itself, and not to any contract work. It shall come into force immediately, and shall be retrospective as from 1st April Then follow the rates of pay. I have made inquiries, and I have word from the secretary that the agreement referred to has been signed on behalf of the Commonwealth, and is now in active operation. Now, if this Bill be carried, the Government will not be able to enter into such an agreement, although they may believe it to be necessary. The rate of pay is attached to the agreement, but I have not quoted it , because it is not so much to the point. We have here preference to unionists of the most extreme type I have ever seen, and I have been connected with unions for a number of years. The rate of wages set down is not to be paid to any but members of the union. If a non-unionist goes there to work he is not entitled to that rate, and if he gets it it is not because of the agreement, but as a matter of grace. This is preference to unionists and compulsory unionism combined.",51
360,Mr KELLY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I should read the paragraph again if I were the honourable member!,52
361,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I notice that the Honorary Minister, who is in charge, of this work, does not deny the statements, and they are such music to his ears that he would like them read again.' I have no doubt that the paragraph will beread a good many times before the campaign is over, but as the Honorary M in ister desires, I do not see why I should not repeat it now.",52
362,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable member has already read the paragraph, and he would not be in order in reading it again.",52
363,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I am sorry that that is your ruling, Mr Speaker, because the Honorary Minister apparently would like to commit the paragraph to memory. At any rate, it is a piece of news which brands this legislation for what it really is- a piece of political make-believe and political buffoonery. I sliould now like to say a word or two as to the attitude of the Prime Minister himself in regard to preference to unionists. .Last session, when the matter was under consideration, I quoted from .a speech by the Prime Minister, made in 'the New South Wales Parliament, on ,2nd August, 1900, just before he became a member of this House. There has never been a more effective speech in defence of the great principle of preference to unionists than that made by Mr Joseph Cook on the 2nd August, 1900. Even the bril liant ex-Attorney-General has not made - a stronger speech upon this great principle. It has to be remembered that at this time the honourable gentleman had deserted the Labour party who put hi m into Parliament, and had already been a Minister in a Liberal Administration, and he was giving his opinion on preference to unionists as a Liberal. could be nothing more emphatic. was in 1900. We had another speech on the same subject from the honourable gentleman in 1904. He is reported on page 7846 of the Commonwealth Hansard for 1904 to have said in this ChamberThe honourable member for Newcastle referred to me as an old-time secretary of a trade union. The honourable member is quite right. When I was secretary to a union we always insisted on preference to unionists, and in a very summary fashion.",53
364,Mr CBOUCH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,What was the union T,53
365,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The Coal MinersUnion. We had no difficulty in doing that; and I am free to tell the honourable member that if I were in the same position today I should do the same again. Then in answer to a question as to how long he was secretary of this union, he said-For some years. If I were in that position again I should adopt the same attitude. I have no sort of sympathy with the man who will work alongside another man and see that other paying every week of his life into an organization to protect his rights and to maintain his position whilst he himself is skulking, and deriving the benefits for which the other is paying and working. I have no sort of sympathy with that kind of thing. [30]- z That is how in 1904 the present Prime Minister described non-unionists. He described them as a lot of skulkers. And it seems quite appropriate that the honourable gentleman, who has espoused every political cause that has ever been before the public, should now wheel right round to the opposite position and lead the forces of anti-unionism, forces that are being directed, and whose funds are provided, by the employers' organizations in an effort to strangle the prin ciple of preference to unionists. After all, while the measure before us today is the sham that it has .been shown to be Mr [SPEAKER - Order !",53
366,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"If that is an unparliamentary expression, I withdraw it . I shall call the Bill an unsubstantial thing, an unreal thing, a mythical measure. We know what Ministers would do if they could, because in their policy statement in the Governor General's Speech of July, 1913, they saidIt is proposed to amend the law relating to conciliation and arbitration in such a way as to prohibit preference being granted by the Court to members of any organization, any part of whose funds are directly or indirectly applicable to political purposes; and also to restore the exemption of rural workers from There the operation of the Act, believing that the That conditions of their employment ought to be left to the States. That is what they would do if they had the courage to do it , but they have not the courage, and they have gone back on what they said they would do, and come along with this mythical measure by which they will lead the people to believe that they have done the other thing, and will misrepresent the qualifications for entrance to the Public Service. I have no doubt that if this kind of political pea-and-thimble rigging has the desired result, and Ministers come back with a 1 sufiicient* majority to give effect to what they desire to do, there will be a general attack on the organized workers of Australia. They talk about the unions using funds for political purposes. Is there anything in the objects of any union which is not the subject of political intervention? The movement for shorter working hours, which is incorporated in the members and the public to take notice of political action. The minimum wage question and the establishment of arbitration tribunals to decide every condition of service in any employment are subject-matters of political action; but, according to honourable members opposite, thousands of men who supply their weekly pence for the purpose of advancing the objects of their unions are not' to use any of their funds for the purpose of assisting to ""bring those objects into force in a constitutional way. Apparently the only way in which they are to use their funds is to support a strike, or to break the industrial peace. If they seek constitutional methods to have legislation passed, and if they have agitations with that object, they are to be deprived of preference even at the hands of the High Court Judge, though he may think that they have put for t h such a case as, in the interests of the community, to warrant bheir having preference. The present Prime Minister has been driven from one point to the other on this question« of preference to unionists, and when he is bailed up in the corner, what does he say ? He does not say that he has gone back on his opinions. Speaking on the 12th June, 1912, at Lithgow, the town which gave him political birth-and this brings me a littl e furthe r up-to-datehe is reported to have saidHe believed in having his own opinion, and would not allow any caucus to think for him or come between him and his constituents.' He had not altered his position; the others had done the jumping round, and now imagined he had. It must be remembered that he was speaking at Lithgow, in the midst of a great industrial district, a great union and he was explaining to this which had put him in Parliament at the very beginning, which had practically taken him from the coal pit and given him political birth, that he had never done any jumping round, but still held to his opinions, and that others had done the jumping. Later on, when he was asked how he justified his attitude in reference to preference to unionists, and as to why he believed in preference unionists formerly, and was now taking steps against it, he explained-I have not the reference with me-that the unionism of today was different from the unionism with which he was engaged when enforced preference to unionists; that the unions of today had political objects, and used some of their funds in advancing those political objects, whereas in the days to which he referred the unions were Mr J. H. Catts. purely industrial, and compelled preference to unionists in a purely industrial way. During the recess I have been looking up a littl e more of the history of the Prime Minister, and now I am in a position to show that the preference to unionists he sought for was preference to Labour bodies taking an active part in politics. In Lithgow it was Mr Joseph Cook who went to the unions and invited them to come together for the purpose of electing a member of Parliament and baking political action. The following letter, which was written by him, I wish bo have placed in the pages of Hansard, where the public can have access to it . It is as follows: Having regard to a communication which recently appeared in the daily press purporting to have been written by the secretary of the Drivers' and Firemen's Association to the Trades and Labour Council, suggesting the fusion of the Labour forces of the district, with a view to returning a representative to Parliament whose sympathies should be entirely with the worker, I am directed by my delegate board to submit for your consideration the following proposition :-That two (2) representatives from each Labour organization of the Hartley district meet, at a time and place to be hereafter arranged, for the purpose of taking the necessary steps for the return of a Labour candidate at the next general election. The need for this has been emphasized by the unsympathetic, and actively hostile attitude assumed, by our present member throughout the long and wasting strike, in the midst of which our own organization is plunged at the present time. During the present criBis, Mr. Hurley has not failed whenever the opportunity presented itself to declaim against the tyranny and unrighteousness of the methods of our prodistrict, cedure, as well as having gone out of his way to be brutally offensive towards those members district, upon whom only we can rely to furnish us with the means of voicing our complaints in the Parliament of the country. Not only so, but very recently Mr Hurley gave expression to words in the House which can only be construed as containing a direct challenge to the Labour organizations of this district. Furthermore, since the commencement of the present struggle Mr Hurley has never evinced the slightest desire to help in any way those of his constituents and supporters whose fortunes have been so adversely affected by the to continuance of the strike, and, indeed, has shown in every possible way and manner the strong sympathy with those who in this struggle must be regarded as the' opponents r.f trade unionism. In view, therefore, of the unquestionable attitude taken up by Mr. they Hurley with respect to the progressive developments of the Labour forces of this colony, my Board is anxious to express its cordial agreement with the action taken by the Drivers and Firemen's Association, and urge the earnest consideration of the above proposition as the best means of giving effect to that sympathy which exists amongst the various workers of the Colony, and which can only find fitting expression in that unity of action which shall secure to us direct representation in the Parliament of this Colony. Hoping you will give the'matter your best attention, and do me the favour of an early reply. (Sgd.) Jos. COOK, Miners' General Secretary. This shows Mr Joseph Cook as the very gentleman who, at the time when the unions were not taking part in the politics of the country, urged them to do the very thing for doing which he now seeks to penalize them, and yet he says it is honourable members of the Opposition who have done the jumping round, and that he has not altered his Opinions from the time he was taken from the coal p it and put into Parliament. He is like the man who goes about and says that everybody else is mad, and he is the only sane man. We generally take such a man to the reception house, and have him examined at once. I have shown these statements of the Prime Minister from the time he first entered the New South Wales Parliament, in 1890, to 1900, when he gave forth his f a it h in regard to preference to unionists in as strong a speech as could be produced on a floor of a Parliament, and had the proofs of the report presented to him the next day, and went over them with a pen to see that they were correctly registered, in the imperishable records of the country, his opinion on this great question. In 1904, as a member of this House, he advocated preference to unionists; and in 1912 he went back to his old district, and told the people there that others had jumped round, but that he had not, his beliefs being the same as they had always beeu. But a year later he put a passage into the Speech of the Governor General which shows that he would, if he could, annihilate the unions of Australia, so far as this vital principle is concerned; and again now he is engaged in this unworthy attempt, although it is attempted in an indirect and stealthy way. The Prime Minister, in the speech from which I have quoted, recogourselves nised the need for preference to so unionists, and stated what is known to be a fact by all connected w it industrial organizations, that the alterthey native to preference to unionists is prefercourage ence to non-unionists, the encouragement of those who will not join organizations, whom he has characterized as the "" skulkers of society."" The employers are in business for the purpose of making money, and the unionists, by banding together, lessen profits. By concerted action, they compel employers to pay more than they would ""pay to individual workers, bargaining each for himself. The employers know that they cannot deal with an organized body of 1,000 or 5,000 men as they could with an individual who did not belong to a union. When the individual who is not in a union asks an employer for work, the employer says, "" How much do you want?"" One man replies "" £ 2 a. week,"" another "" 35s.,"" and at h i r d , perhaps, "" 30s.""; and the employer takes the cheapest. These figures will serve to illustrate the practice. Y o u can read in the newspapers every day advertisements asking applicants for positions to state the wages required. When men are disorganized, out of work, hungry, with the cupboard at home bare, they will cut each other's throats to get work. I do not blame the employers altogether; they are not in business for benevolent reasons. They are not in business to give the highest wages they can. Their object is to obtain a competency for themselves; and, consequently, when of two applicants one offers his services for 10s. a week less than the other, he is taken on if he can do the work required to he done. But employees who are members of unions cannot be dealt with individually. These combinations of workers say, "" We need so much a week to pay our rent and to keep our wives and families,"" and they fix a minimum wage, and will not accept anything less for their services. Naturally, the employers as a body seek to discourage the organization of workmen who are banded together to secure the advantages of collective bargaining. For this reason, employers give preference to non-unionists, that being the only alternative to preference to unionists. The employers are now organizing all over Australia. They say, "" We must band together in bigger battalions, that we may be able to face the opposing armies of workers."" Realizing that h unionism is a menace to their profits, naturally do what they can to disi t by giving employment to those who are not unionists'. They are even creating organizations to do this. There is in Victoria a Liberal Workers Club, or Independent Workers Federation.. The honourable member for Ballarat produced a letter from the secretary of that organization, written to the Tramway Company of Ballarat, in which it was stated that he had workmen prepared to accept lowerrates than were being demanded by the union workmen. This organization bas been proved to be a union-smashing organization, subsidized by the employers; and the other day the Prime Minister, having a few words to address to the country, attended one of its meetings, and to give his blessing on its uniondissolution smashing business. The desire of the employers to oppose unionism has crystallized into this union-smashing movement. There are, of course, employers who say, '.' The most competent men are unionists, and we shall avoid trouble by applying, to union secretaries for the workers weneed."" They find that they get on most comfortably in that way. But, generally, there is a movement among employers to oppose collective, bargaining,, and to get back to the old days of so called freedom, of contract, under which system the employer had the individual worker at his mercy. It appears to be the intention of the Government to assist this movement. That is indicated by the Bill.. As my time has nearly expired, I shall have to avail myself of further opportunities to deal with a number of matters on which. I wished to speak. It is not the intention of the Ministry to advance any real, public interest by introducing the proposed Bill. The measure is not one to sanction the construction of any public work. It has no constructive use.",53
367,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I ask the honourable member not to discuss the Bill, the motion being for leave to bring in a Bill.",56
368,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Althoug h the Bill has not been brought in, we know its purpose. We knpw that it is sought to be introduced to serve the party needs of honourable members opposite. They wish to bring about another election, and intend then to misrepresent the aims and hopes of their opponents, with a view to getting back to Parliament in larger numbers than at present. The proposed Bill is to be brought forward to provide the so-called Liberal party with a policy of misrepresentation and abuse.",56
369,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Gwydir) [9.41] - I rise to enter my emphatic protest against the method and manner in which the Government is trying to put before the House what Ministers allege to be a measure of some practical use. It is intended to introduce two such measures, but that which forms the subject of the motion under discussion is regarded as the more important. It is, however, merely an imitation of a measure, a mere myth. It has no substance, and its object is merely to delude the people, and to obtain a double dissolution. I could understand the demand for a double on the rejection of a measure that was a reality and not a sham. What is the purpose of the proposed Bill ? The abolition of preference to unionists. Preference to whom ? To those who already enjoy it ? No. To those in the Public Service? No. To the casual employees of the Government? No. To whom, then? To no one. The Minister of Home Affairs in the Labour Administration gave preference to unionists, believing that that was in the best interests of the Commonwealth. Every contractor who desires to get the best results from the labour which he pays, employs unionists. As a toiler, and as an employer, I know from experience that the unionist is the better worker. Every employer who wishes to get work done with profit to himself, and with peace and contentment, engages unionists. The unionist presents a certificate guaranteeing that he understands the work he is about to be engaged upon. Twenty contractors out of twenty-one, nay, ninety-nine out of one hundred decent contractors or employers of labour, will tell you that in the interests of peaceful working, and for the sake of the best results both for the employer and the employee, they would not hesitate for a moment about giving preference to men who had proved themselves, by their membership of a union to be capable of carrying out work satisfactorily. Here we find a. Government supposed to be possessed of more brains than the average Administration, and capable not only of directing the destiny of the country, but also of restoring what they call responsible government, and clean and pure administration in the affairs of the Commonwealth:-me n who claim that all the virtues which attach to a political pai'ty or political principle lie within the grasp of their ambition or within the power of their consummation, and yet out of that mighty intellect, what have they produced ? They have produced a pure myth, something that has not substance or anything else in it, and they ask us to agree to measures which mean nothing, apply to nothing, and effect nothing, so that they may bring about a conflict between the two Houses, and subsequently ask for a double dissolution. I have no hesitation in saying that a Government who seek a double dissolution on those two measures are not only treating the public as if they were absolutely children in their comprehension of the affairs of their nation, hut are treating members on this side as if they had no recognition of their responsibility or of the obligation cast upon them as representatives of the people.",56
370,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"""Why abuse the measures at such length if they can effect nothipg ? Mr Webster' - A man who will sit in Parliament as a public representative and allow the Government to make a farce of Parliament",57
371,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Order ! I ask the honourable member to withdraw that remark.,57
372,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I withdraw the word farce, because evidently it is unparliamentary to use that term, but I say that a Government who are prepared to delude Parliament and the people hy such confidence tricks as are embodied in these measures deserve no other fate than to be hurled from the Treasury bench, and even from the Parliament of the country, as being men who do not realise their responsibilities to the people. We are asked as a party, sent here - by our constituents, the people of Australia, to assist the Government to deceive the people. T have been in the Labour movement from its inception, and so far as my knowledge goes, we have never tried to put before the people that which the people could not clearly understand. This measure that the Government seek to introduce to-night is capable of endless misrepresentation when placed before the ordinary public, who are not seized with the machinations of a Government of this kind. It is characteristic of the men who are fathering this measure to bring forward something which has no reality in it in order that they may not be tied down to anything definite at the elections, and in order that they may secure a double dissolution. For what? This House was elected only a few months ago. The people of Australia spoke, and with such effect that they returned to this House a majority on the Liberal side> a majority that sits in the chair to-night; hut in another place they sent such a majority as has converted the Senate into a citadel of Labour, instead of the harbour for worked-out politicians and derelicts, which it was thought it would be when the Constitution was. framed. The people of Australia, voting on the same franchise, manhood and womanhood suffrage, returned to Parliament an overwhelming majority of Labour senators. ",57
373,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Not with less votes. The Government are in office with less votes of the people behind them than the v Opposition have. They have a freak majority of one, in spite of the fact that they have a minority of the people behind them. The honourable member for New England is continually interjecting. Why does he not rise in his place, and address himself to this question] The electors of New England want to know what he thinks about thismyth. They have had their attention drawn 'to his precocioUsness in this Chamber, and they are expecting something more from him. This honourable member, who is supposed to be a student of law, supposed to have passed an examination in the mysteries of the law, and to know something about constitutional questions, sits in his place, and does nothing but yap, yap, yap, like a little pup barking at a mastiff. And this is the sort of man who constitutes the party which is to bring about purity in politics, and a restoration of responsible government. This measure which we have before us was introduced last session, and, by unfortunate circumstances, over which we on this side had no control, it was bludgeoned through this House. The Government got their Bill through this Chamber, not by legitimate debate and discussion, not by allowing members to fulfil the functions they are supposed to fulfil, namely, of expressing their views on legislation proposed here, but by the same tactics as a man who takes a watch out of a person's pocket by reason of having knocked him stiff, or practically paralyzed him beforehand. The Government got their Bill through the House last session by the use "" g g»"" a ^ e bludger uses when tryin g to down his fellow man in. the park, and elsewhere. The Government pursued those tactics, not once, but with determination and villanous intent to destroy the liberties of the House, and rob members of their just privileges, by using the "" gag "" time after time, by turning members out of the House, and reducing the voting strength on this side in a manner which I trust will never be repeated in this Parliament.  passed the ""gag.""'",57
374,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Unfortunatel y they did, but it is to their credit that they have never yet applied it. When the other party were on this side of the House during the three years that we ,were in office they were allowed to debate every question at full length.",58
375,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Order ! The honourable member is digressing from the question before the Chair!,58
376,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I was wondering whether the Government were going to try to ""gag"" this measure through as they tried to "" g a g "" the other. What I have said arose from the interjection of the honourable member for New England.",58
377,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I ask the honourable member not to discuss the ""gag."" need not follow an interjection.",58
378,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"You will remember, sir, how hard you found it as a private member to resist the temptation. sure you cannot help sympathizing with me.",58
379,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"As a private member I could sympathize with the honourable member, but, as Speaker, I must enforce the Standing Orders.",58
380,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I bow to your ruling. At the same time interjections are cowardly, when a member who has the righ t to speak is not prepared to rise to his feet and say what he has to say. 1 come back to this grand effort of the Liberal party that has taken so long to produce. Weeks of time have been spent on it already during the lif e of this Parliament. If we tried to waste time by introducing a measure of this kind, we would be howled at by .the press and by honourable members opposite. We would be reminded of the cost of debates in of the Parliament, and held up to scorn in every same thing as the leading article in the press, and especially take by' the honourable member for Parkes.",58
381,Mr RODGERS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Do not stir him, or he will shake you up.",58
382,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I do not think the Government .want him to be stirred up again. The last time he rose his speech cost them dear. It is quite fair to judge this measure by the source from which it has come. There are some men from whom one can always accept things knowing that they are offered in a wise and generous spirit; but when a measure of this kind is put forward by a gentleman of the calibre of the Attorney-General, we have every right to scrutinize it , to doubt it , and to suspect it . If it emanated from another man who had nob his unsavoury political reputation we should not be so suspicious of it ; but we know from his past history that the Attorney-General is capable of tryin g to take away, not only preference bo unionists, but every other vibal principle that has been fought for during the last twenty or t h i r t y years by the workers of this and other countries.",58
383,Mr HOWE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,He cannot do it .,58
384,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"He will try to do it as he has tried before. It is reasonable to judge the motives of the measure by its sponsor, and its sponsor by his record. He stopped all the increases to the Public He servants while he was a Minisber in Victoria, and if he would do that, how do we know that if he gets this mythical measure through he will not use the platform I am to tell the rural workers, the women's leagues, and all those infamous' organizers who go round the country propagating his doctrines, that it abolishes preference not merely to 2,000 men in the Public Service of the whole Commonwealth, but to the whole of the industrial army, of Australia? Those organizers went round long ago telling the people that the Labour party were going to abolish the marriage tie, and subdivide all the wealth of the people. Of course all those stories have been exploded long ago, and so the party opposite must have another cry for the next election. This is the cry that the Attorney-General brings forward. He reduced wages when he was in a high position in this State, and the Prime Minister tells us to-night that ha has done some magnanimous action for the benefit of the - working man which will stand to his credit. If he has done it must be the first time. I have never heard of any action of his that has favoured the worker in the days gone by, nor does this Bill favour the worker. It is against the interests of the worker. The greatest, most vindictive, and most relentless enemy of the worker in this country today is the honourable member who is fathering this Bill, and the workers have a right to doubt him because of his record. The leopard cannot change his spots, nor can a politician change his nature. In days gone by he refused to recognise trade union rates of pay. That is the man whom ""we have to trust to decide the issue upon which we shall go to the country. There is not a worker in this country who does not understand the true character of the man who is prepared to reduce the rates paid to Government employees below those paid in outside occupations. The honourable member in this very State told the men that he had more hard knocks in store. I have no doubt he had. haps this Bill was incubating in his mind at the time. If so, it has taken a long time to hatch, but he has brought it forth at last, and expects to breathe into it some kind of life if we on this side of the House are suicidal enough to allow him to do so. It was the Attorney-General who told us that this was a harmless little measure to deal only with employees within the Public Service of the Commonwealth. He knows that *they have already been dealt with by regulation-that the Government, by regulation, have already cancelled the preference granted by their predecessors in office. That being so, the Bill is a sheer mockery, possessing no substance whatever. There is nothing in it, and the Speaker should rule it out of order. It can serve no' object. It is of no use to any one save political manoeuvrers, and those who have not the courage to put their real views before the people. It is of use only to those men who, if they dared, would abolish not only preference to unionists in the Commonwealth service, but preference to unionists throughout the whole industrial world. The Attorney-General would do that if he dared. When he was in the Victorian Parliament he induced the Governor to grant him a dissolution because of a blank created in a Bill-it it , was just as big a blank as this Bill isand on it he carried the House to the country. He is trying the same game again-this political manceuvrer.",58
385,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Trickster !,59
386,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I may not use that word. I have to be very careful at present, because we are in the danger zone, and I wish to avoid an explosion. The Attorney-General swept away factory legislation in Victoria. It is to such men that we are to entrust the destinies of this country. When they had power in this State they swept away factory legislation. That meant that many workers in factories were deprived of those safeguards to life and limb, and of the conditions of employment, and everything else they had won by tlieir exertions and self-sacrifice. The Attorney-General robbed them of those rights when he was in power in the State Parliament, and today he is trying to rob the people of this Per- country of the right to enjoy the result of the last election. He is trying to break down the power of another place, where the Labour party is entrenched, and where, if we have any sense, we shall remain entrenched until the Senate is sent to the country in a legitimate manner in the days to come.  honourable member and his party are frightened of.",59
387,Mr WEBSTEE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"We are not going to allow the honourable member or his party to do anything which, in our judgment, will not mean a fair deal for the public. Let honourable members opposite put aside the two test Bills, and we will show them whether we are frightened to meet them in the constituencies. We are prepared at any time to meet them on an equal basis. They seek, however, to bring down another place, which is really their nightmare. The Democracy of Australia has returned to the Senate, on the same suffrage as that upon which we were elected, a sufficient number of men to guard their interests, and they expect the Opposition in this House to maintain that strength in the Senate for the protection of their liberties against men of the type of the Attorney-General. They do not expect us to he gulled, misled, or fooled by the tricksters on the other side. I make no bones about it, but say at once' that the duty of this party is to fight this measure at eveiy stage. Indeed, I go further, and say that the man who does not use every parliamentary weapon of which he may avail himself in this fight to prevent men like the Attorney-General from throwing dust in the eyes of the electors, from ceiving the mass of the people, is not carrying the badge of our party as it should be carried. This great reformerthe 'Attorney-General-ha s produced, in this Bill, an addled egg. Even when hatched it will produce nothing.  member is frightened of the hatching.",59
388,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"We are not frightened of anything. When the hatching does take place, the honourable member will be glad, probably, to get out of the way, lest he be poisoned by the odours that arise from it. The Attorney-General, when in State politics, reduced the old-age pensions. It is to him that we are asked to entrust the destinies of tralia. We are to entrust them to the man who would deprive of their little pensions the old and infirm-the pioneers of this country who have stood the heat and burden of the day, and have made it possible for him to enjoy the emoluments that he wins out of the troubles and trials of the people.",60
389,Mr BOYD,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Is this the same old speech ?,60
390,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"No ; unlike the honourable member, I never repeat a speech.",60
391,Mr BOYD,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,This is the same old speech that we had on the Address-inReply. Give us something new.,60
392,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable member, who has just come into the chamber after looking after his own business all day, should allow those who have been here throughout the sitting to proceed without interruption.",60
393,Mr BOYD,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I have been attending to all that correspondence about which the honourable member was talking the other day.,60
394,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"If honourable members opposite had their way, we should find business men coming here at half past 9 or 10 o'clock at night to talk' together quietly over the laws necessary for the emancipation, of the people, and they would doubtless regard the country as quite safe. We know business men who give one hour of their time to their public positions, and all the rest to their own affairs - The Attorney-General, with his cold-blooded characteristics, swept away the State factory legislation and reduced old-age pensions. He made it imperative, de- before the old people could take their meed of assistance, that their sons and daughters should be degraded and humiliated by being dragged into the public Courts to expose tlieir poverty. There were many who refused to undergo this ordeal, but there were many, also, who, to the detriment of their own children, were called upon to pay towards the pensions of their parents.",60
395,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I cannot connect the honourable member's remarks with the subject under discussion.,60
396,Mr BOYD,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"As a matter of fact, no one was dragged into Court unless he was able to pay.",60
397,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"They had to go to Aus- the Court before their ability to pay could be known. As to the remark of Mr Deputy Speaker, it is desirable, when discussing proposed legislation, to look atits source, and to keep that in mind. If we saw in front of us a man with a gun, and we knew him to be a good, marksman, we should, get out of the way; and the Attorney-General is "" the man behind the gun,"" with which he has proved his skill as a. marksman at the target of Democracy. In addition to reducing old age pensions, the honourable gentleman raised the passenger fares on the railways - a glorious piece of reform",60
398,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I am quite unable to connect the honourable member's remarks with the subject under discussion.,60
399,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I thought I had made it clear that I was referring to the subject behind the subject under discussion.,60
400,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I think that is too remote.,60
401,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The Attorney-General, as a State Minister, then, turned to the farmers, and charged them £d. additional for each bushel of wheatthey sent over the railways to market. . Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER - The honourable member is. taking a line which is quite out of order, and I ask him to confine himself to the subject under discus.sion. Mr W . H - IBVINE - I hope Mr . Deputy Speaker will not stop the honourable member.",60
402,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,There are some men so case-hardened that their hides could not be pierced with a Martini-Henry bullet. The honourable gentleman also prohibited organization among the public .servants of the State.,61
403,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I think these matters are quite irrelevant.,61
404,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"We shall see whether the fact I have just mentioned is irrelevant or nob. The Bill before us is an interference with the r i g h t of organisation in the Public Service of the Commonwealth. If ib means, anybbing, it means the undermining of the unionistic principle in casual employment by the Government. In the measure we see the same characteristics that appeared in the State measure many years ago. The Government, througn the Prime Minister, have declared m favour of arbitration laws, which were brought into existence to end the disastrous strikes by which men had formerly to fight for their rights. Men were advised to join unions so that they might speak through their officers to the Court, as against the employers, and thus bring about a peaceful and equitable solution of the questions at issue. Y e t the Ministry are endeavouring by this th in end of the wedge to undermine that unionism, which is the basis of our Conciliation and A r b i tration Acts. Without unionism arbitration would be impossible; for, unless there be combination, there can be no systematic and intelligent representation of the cases to the Court. Years ago the workers were advised to take political action, because the community was tired of strikes; and that advice was taken with such good effect that there have been evolved the arbitration laws of the State and the Commonwealth. Although our arbitration laws have not done all that was expected of them, they have greatly minimized the troubles that arose from the adoption of the old barbarous system of the strike. torney-General desires now to undermine the principle which makes arbitration possible. By proposing to prohibit preference to unionists, he is endeavouring to undermine unionism. If a man finds that - he can secure employment as readily if he is a non-unionist as if he is a unionist, he will not take out a union ticket, or, if he is a member of a union, he may "" scab "" upon his union as some do under an incentive of this kind. The honourable gentleman would bring us back to the barbarous conditions which in the past devastated the homes of our people, broke the hearts of our women, and starved our children. We have to look below the surface in dealing with measures of this kind. We cannot take them at. their face value.. The man who was prepared in the Victorian Parliament to prohibit the organization of the public servants is today pursuing the same course by saying that if a man belongs to a union, no matter how good a tradesman he may be, he shall be given no preference over a man who has not got a union ticket. The Government proposal applied only to about 2,000 men, but it applies now to'no one, because they have cancelled the regulation giving preference to unionists in the Public Service of the Commonwealth. The Bill would not be such a mockery as it really is if it ap1 plied to any section of the community. The Attorney-General knows that it will not apply to any one, but he seeks to steal a march upon the people. He hopes bo be able to induce the electors to rescind the votes they gave on the 31st May last, and by which they returned to the Senate eleven Labour senators as against seven of the other side. The honourable gentleman would undo the work which we have been doing f b r nearly twenty years to safeguard the liberties, rights, and freedom of the workers of this country. Years ago we took the advice of those who were opposed to the Labour party. They told us to organize, and asked us not to resort' to strikes, but to political action, to redress the wrongs of the people. From that time we have worked consistently forward with our legislation. There is not one part of the legislation which the Labour party has been successful in placing on the statute-book that the presenb Government have the courage to touch. It is because they dare not touch it that they The At - are now putting forward an. unreal reform in this proposal for the prohibition of preference to unionists in the Public Service. I can look back to the time when I was a boy sixteen and a half years of age, and took part in the first strike that I ever had experience of. I know the obstacles that the workers had to face in the Old Country in those days. They were not united, because the people had not free education, and the masses were unable to comprehend their power as they do in these later days. I remember the helplessness of the men who at that time fought against oppression. When they used the only weapon which they could use in order to demand their right, their children had to go without food, the mothers were unable to give sustenance to their offspring, and the fathers were not only unable to provide food for their families, but suffered great privations themselves. I know that the men on the other side have steadily opposed the arbitration laws which the Labour party have desired to enact. They fought us in the New South Wales Parliament where such laws were first introduced. They fought us later in this Parliament, and I remember the bitterness with which they carried on the fight. To-day, for the first time in the history of this Parliament, the party opposite have been returned with a majority of one in this House. Hitherto the Conservatives have not had even a decent minority in this House, though they have sometimes been in office as the result of combinations and fusion. I ask honourable members what the Government, with a bare majority, are prepared to do? They are prepared to restore the evil conditions that prevailed years ago. They are prepared not only to prohibit preference to unionists in the Public Service, but, if they dared, to take away preference from every unionist in this country. That is what we must bear in mind when we are considering this make-believe measure; this preposterous imposition, submitted, I will not say by an .imposter. If this gentleman believes it is right to abolish preference to unionists in the Public Service, then, in the name of all that is holy, why is it not right to abolish the principle anywhere? Is he going to apply one law to the Public Service, and another law to men who are outside that Service? Is this the type of government that we are to get from this reformer, whose history is blackened practically with his efforts in the days gone by? Is Mr Webster. he game, I ask, to do the right thing to carry out his principles to their logical issue? Instead of him bringing in a make-believe of this kind, let him go out and advocate the abolition of preference to unionists throughout the industries of this country. No, he is not built on those lines. He is hiding the dagger till a more opportune time arises. Why is he not prepared to carry out a principle to its logical issue? He knows that if he would throw down the gauntlet as he should do, and say, "" I want to abolish preference to unionists altogether,"" it would be of no use to him to cry out for a double dissolution, for every union man would be not only a voter but an anxious and bitter worker against him. Therefore, he is trying to deceive these men by this pretentious measure. He thinks that he will delude them because he does not affect them personally. He thinks that they will not realise that their turn will come next. They will be up and doing .to fight for the liberties they have already won by the sacrifice of labour, money, and in cases, life. The honourable member hides himself in a coward's castle. He shelters himself behind a. make-believe measure, when he ought to come forward if he is a man at all. He was never known to have any courage except when he got full power. It would not be a Bill to abolish preference to unionists in the Public Service that he would submit if a double dissolution occurred, and by a great miracle the Liberal party were returned to power in both Houses. Then we would see what his game was. Then we would be able to form our opinions and realise that this man has not only been a deceiver in the past, but also a destroyer. When I think of the manner in which the Prime Minister can, with brazen effrontery, face a question of this kind, I am reminded of an old trade unionist whose reputation was built up whilst he was fighting for the principle of preference to unionists. He would never have heen in public life had he not got on the backs of the workers and made them believe that he was going to retain their rights and privileges. He. would never have seen public life at all had he not taken that course in the early nineties, as we know he did. When I think of the Prime Minister in the days gone by",61

408,Mr JOSEFH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,That is my name.,63
409,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Ah ! But it ought to be spelt another way.,63
410,Mr BOYD,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,You r name ought to be spelt Jeremiah judging by this speech.,63
411,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I think that when the electors.of Henty have an opportunity of reviewing the marvellous services rendered by the honourable member they will be likely to ask him what his name is and what he calls himself.,63
412,Mr BOYD,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,They will not ask me about my lamentations.,63
413,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"We do not expect the honourable member to lament over a matter of this kind. He has been a noted strike-breaker in his time. He has gone out to break down the worker,. and to break up his union.",63
414,Mr BOYD,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,What has this to do with the question before the House ?,63
415,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"It has something to do with the honourable member's observation. It well becomes a man who is supporting a Bill to take away preference - to unionists when we realise that he is hound to support even more dastardly measures - the honourable member for Indi need not grin, because he is not game to get up to speak. The people of Indi wonder what he is doing here.",63
416,Mr BOYD,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Is the honourable member in order, sir, in casting a reflection upon honourable members on this side by saying that they are supporting dastardly measures, that they can only vote for the Bills because they are forced to do so?",63
417,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable member is not in order in making these reflections, but they are to some extent provoked by the interjections from the opposite side. I have to request forbearance from all sides of the House in order that the rules may be observed.",63
418,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Whils t I am not only anxious, but really interested, complying with the mandate of the Chair, still I am only human, and cannot at all times allow a man to put interjections into my speech without me putting the acid on them, so that people may see both sides. The honourable member has indeed something to talk about when he talks about preference to unionists. The company, the unionists employed by which were broken by his efforts, has never returned a dividend since then.",63
419,Mr BOYD,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Yes , quite a lot.",63
420,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The company has never been able to return a dividend since then, because it has not been worked by men who understood their business. However,- let that pass.",63
421,Mr BOYD,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I should think so. It is a dangerous subject.,63
422,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The Bill which was introduced last session was designed to take away from members of the Public Service the right of preference, irrespective of whether or not they were members of political or labour unions. I was wondering whether the Bill which the Government now wish to bring forward will apply to Packer's Independent Workers Union.",63
423,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Order ! The honourable member's time has expired.,63
424,Mr FINLAYSON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Brisbane) [10.46]. - - I have no desire to appear to "" stonewall "" this motion. Indeed, I am anxious that the proposals of the Government should be tabled so that we may know exactly where we stand. If honourable members opposite will follow me, I will tell them what they agreed to last year. It was then stated in the Governor General's Speech, at the opening of ParliamentIt is proposed to amend the law relating to conciliation and arbitration in such a way as to prohibit preference being granted by the Court to members of any organization, any part of - whose funds are directly or indirectly applicable to political purposes. The Bill which the Government submitted in redemption of that promise was one of two clauses. The first clause was the title of the measure, and the second declared that no ' preference or discrimination should be made against any person",63
425,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Order ! I ask the honourable member not to discuss the details of the Bill. The motion is one for sir, in leave to introduce the measure.",63
426,Mr FINLAYSON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The Bill which was introduced last session in no sense proposed to prohibit the granting of preference to unionists. The measure which the Government now ask leave to introduce must be based on exactly similar lines, because ib is being submitted for a specific purpose. My aubhority for thab statement is contained in paragraph 3 of the Governor General's Speech at the opening of this session. That paragraph readsDuring the first session of this Parliament, my Ministers, for reasons whioh they advise me were beyond their control, were unable to pass legislation on many subjects outlined in their policy statement presented to you on 12th August last. Those subjects comprised Bills dealing with the prohibition of preference or favouritism in Government employment, and the restoration of the electoral provisions for voting by post. Then paragraph 4 readsThese measures failed to pass, and it is intended to make a further effort to pass tbem in the short session now commencing. There caii be no doubt, therefore, that the Bill which the Government propose to in troduce is identical with the Bill of last session. I say unhesitatingly that that measure should not be allowed to see the light of day again in this Parliament. It means nothing, because-as has been pointed out over and over again-it cannot effect what it proposes to effect for the simple reason that its aim has already been accomplished. To introduce a Bill to accomplish something which has already been accomplished is asking us to degrade our intelligence, and for that reason alone ib ought not to be submitted.",63
427,Mr BOYD,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,That is a pons asinorum.,64
428,Mr FINLAYSON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I am sorry if the struction in South Australia. honourable member stumbles over problem number five, because he will be completely befogged by the time. I reach objection number fifteen. Ha d the Government in troduced a Bill to amend the Conciliation and Arbitratio n Act by abolishing the right of the Court to grant preference to unionists, honourable members upon this side of the Chamber could not but have accepted their challenge, because a measure of that description would have meant everything. We are prepared to stand or fal l by the principle of preference to unionists. If the Bill proposed to do anything in the direction I have suggested, we should not object to its introduction. I am somewhat inclined to think that the Bill of lasb session is not quite the hollow sham which some honourable members appear to think it is.",64
429,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Order ! The honourable member must not designate the Bill a hollow sham.,64
430,Mr FINLAYSON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Then I will saythat it is not quite what ib prebends to be. The Government are undoubtedly, striking at the principle of preference tounionists. The Bill presenbed last session, was evidently meant to challenge the Labour party on the question of preference to unionists. But it did not do it . If the Bill which the Government now seek bo introduce means nothing, or if it . means everything, it stands condemned,, and ought not to be presented.",64
431,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I showed to-night, that the Government are granting preference to unionists on the transcontinental' railway.",64
432,Mr FINLAYSON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I am obliged to the honourable member for reminding me that the Government have decided togrant preference of a most decided character' to the members of a certain union - no t only preference in regard to employment, but also in regard to the conditions of-labour. No non-unionist is guaranteed by the Government the preferencewhich they are extending to the unionist.",64
433,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,To what is the honourable member referring?,64
434,Mr FINLAYSON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"To-night , the honourable member for Cook, in the presence of the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs, read a statement which showed that the Government had entered into an agreement with the Australian Workers Union in regard to certain railway conUnder that agreement, employment is not only guaranteed to the members of that union, but wages and hours are guaranteed to them as a preference. The Prime M in isber will find the facbs recorded in the speech delivered by the honourable member for Cook. The Assisbant Minister of Home Affairs was asked to deny the truth of the honourable member's statement, and he could not do so. When this Parliament was summoned last year, we were told bhat cerbain acbion was to be taken in regard to preference, to unionists. That action was not taken. AB ill that did not come up to the protestations of the Government was introduced, and failed bo pass. What hope has the Prime M in ister of getting his Bill passed on thi» occasion ? He knows that the measure will not pass. Therefore, I ask honourable members and the public to take notice of a Government deliberately asking for leave to introduce a Bill which they know very well will not pass. Yet they talk about wasting time and delaying public business, about the parliamentary machine beng defunct, and about there being a dead-lock in legislation. If bringing down a measure which Ministers know will not pass is not an effectual way of delaying public business, what other way could be adopted ? Leave to introduce this Bill should not be granted, because the measure will not accomplish what it suggests. It does |not carry out the promise the Ministry made last year when they first met Parliament, and it will not affect the question of preference to unionists, as they then sought to deal with it . If Ministers would at this late hour undertake to bring in a Bill , as they promised to do last year, to take away from the Arbitration Court the power to grant' preference to unionists, honourable members on this side would immediately grant the necessary permission to introduce it , so that the matter might be fought out. At this stage, little need be said in regard to the general question of preference to unionists. Other opportunities will present themselves of going exhaustively into a discussion of the whole question. If the G-overnment, and particularly the Prime Minister, are in a decent humour, we may have opportunity to discuss the merits of the matter on the second-reading stage. However, I wish to call attention to one or two things. When the preference to unionists administrative order was issued by the Fisher Government, there was a meeting held in the Melbourne Town H all . It was organized by the Free Workers Association, and the Lord Mayor presided. According to the newspaper report, the hall was well filled. This was the motion that was proposed by a Mr VarleyThat this meeting of Commonwealth citizens enters its strong and emphatic protest against the action of the Federal Government in declaring its intention to adopt the rigid policy of giving _"" absolute preference. to unionists "" in connection with the engaging of all temporary and casual employees required by the Commonwealth service; and, further, as Australian citizens, we strongly protest against the partisan use of public money, and uphold on the principle of justice and fair play, the right to work for all workers, whether unionist or non-unionist, in either private or public employ. The remarkable thing in regard to most of those gentlemen who talk so glibly about the right of non-unionists to work, and the right of unionists to let them do so, who talk so freely about the freedom of all, is the commendable way in which they talk about unionism. According to the newspaper report of this meeting, Mr Varley saidHe had not one word to say against unionism. No one had a stronger admiration than he had for genuine unionism. It had saved the Empire sixty years ago from revolution. Mr Varley proceeded to eulogize the services the early unionists had rendered to the workers, and the fight for the women and children in cotton factories and mines. There had' been expressions used recently which would be a disgrace to brigands or Turkish soldiers. Whether the Stead interview were true or not, that Government stood for the weakening of the ties which bound us to the Mother- > land. Have I leave to continue m y remarks tomorrow ?",64
435,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I wish to hear the end of this argument. You are not tired of the "" s to n e - w all"" yet, are you?",65
436,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Order ! ,65
437,Mr MCDONALD,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"You do not call this a "" stone-wall.""",65
438,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,It looks like a solid b it of concrete.,65
439,Mr FINLAYSON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"It is wonderful how sweetly these gentlemen refer to unionism, and express their appreciation of it . History, proves that it was because of the action of the ancestors of the Tory party in politics that unionism became necessary. It was that action that compelled our ancestors to form trade unions; that compelled the action of industrial associations; that brought about the improvement in the position of the workers throughout the world. It is the continued action of the same Tory party that has driven the workers int o political unionism.",65
440,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,For how many years have you been in a trade union ?,65
441,Mr FINLAYSON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I have never been in a trade union.,65
442,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Did you ever try to form a trade union?,65
443,Mr FINLAYSON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Yes . The matter is easily explained. I was never in a trade in which we could have a union.,65
444,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I was merely thinking that you knew a great deal about the matter.,65
445,Mr FINLAYSON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I am a member of the Australian Workers Union.,65
446,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Yes ; since you came into politics.,65
447,Mr FINLAYSON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I had my ticket before I came into politics.,66
448,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,A l o t of you have done the same thing.,66
449,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Order !,66
450,Mr FINLAYSON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The conduct of the ancestry of the Tory Governments compelled workers to join in industrial trade unions, and the Tory Governments of modern times have compelled them to extend that unionism and take an active part in politics. The honourable member for Maranoa last night told us again the well-known tale of how, some years ago, after the maritime strike and the shearers' strike, the workers weretold not to depend entirely on industrial unionism, but to take an active part in politics. advice has been so well taken that the we might. workers of the world today are finding that, instead of depending on one side their activity, they should strive with both newspaper:wings full y stretched; and with the indust r i a l wing beating time with the political wing, they stand a fair chance of getting recognition of their claims. As they were driven into industrial unionism, so they have been driven- I say it advisedly-int o taking political action, and there is no hope in the world of smashing industrial unions or political unions. contrary, every attempt made to break approach up unionism is foredoomed to failure. was You are commencing a fight that will he cause the biggest cleavage imaginable in fellows, the communities of Australia. Nothing would create more division, and more class prejudice, than an attempt to separate the right to work. the workers of the community into two sections.",66
451,Mr BURNS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I think that the Ministry wants Syndicalism.,66
452,Mr FINLAYSON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I have already ence charged Ministers with being Syndicalists, blackleg because it is the Syndicalists who are opposed to direct political action, who beof lieve in force, and are agaiust constituyour tional methods. The country have realized that the proper line of advance is by way of constitutional procedure. The Prime Minister and associates might as well try to sweep the waters of the ocean with a broom as unionists. try to prevent the advance of unionism i Australia. There is no more hope breaking up the unions of this comthe munity, or depriving the workers of their termed summary fashion. right to take political action, or of ening their determination to employ that March last. right, than there is that this Parliament will dissolve tomorrow. Cannot the Prime Minister accept the facts of the case? He knows that he is engaged in a hopeless fight, which will cause trouble, strife, disorder, and unrest. Instead of quarrelling as to whether unions should exist, and as to what they should do, let us try to guide them, and make use of them. Let us try to solidify the workers on the one hand and the employers on the other, so that each side may work mutually for the benefit of in dustrial conditions. It is in this way that we shall reach industrial peace. The method now being adopted will defer that happy result.",66
453,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"We could not beat That your record for industrial unrest, try as",66
454,Mr FINLAYSON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The following is of an interesting extract from a Scottish A case of great public interest was heard in the Glasgow and South Western Police Court recently, when George Strang, labourer, appeared before Bailie Riddle to answer a charge of having used threatening and abusive language towards Alexander Slack, labourer. Evidence having been called, it was found that the case arose out of a strike. The accused was one of the strikers, and hiB accuser was a "" blackleg."" Witnesses for the On the prosecution spoke to having seen the accused Slack, and, after quietly talking for a minute, they became noisy.
