2,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,DEATH OF PRESIDENT MAKARIOS," Mr Speaker, it is with deep regret that I inform the House of the death on 3 August 1977 of His Beatitude Archbishop Makarios III, President of the Republic of Cyprus. I move: That this House records its sincere regret His Beatitude Archbishop Makarios III, President of the Republic of Cyprus, and expresses its profound sympathy to the people of Cyprus. Mr Speaker, following the news of the death of President Makarios, the Governor General and I sent messages of condolence to the Acting President of the Republic of Cyprus and the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic. Australian Government was represented at the President's funeral by the Minister for Immigraits tion and Ethnic Affairs (Mr MACKellar). The Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) and our High Commissioner to the Republic of Cyprus were also present. The late President was the inspiration of modern state of Cyprus and represented it in the world community with wisdom and distinction. NA Hansard 1977 (SECOND PERIOD) adjourned to 16 August 1977, unless Mr Speakerfixedan passed on 2 June 1977, the House of 16 August 1977, at 2.15 p.m. He was ordained deacon and priest in 1938. He graduated from the School of Theology of Athens University and he continued his theological studies at Boston University on a World Council of Churches scholarship. On his return to Cyprus in 1948 he was consecrated bishop and began intensive religious, social and national work in his. see. At that time he began his vigorcampaign for nationhood for Cyprus. In 19S0 he was elected as both archbishop and ethnarch-nationa l leader of the Greek people of Cyprus. It is a tribute to his qualities that he was elected as both the spiritual and the political at the death of leader of his country. In 1952 he began his campaign at the United Nations General Assembly for international recognition of Cyprus. During the following years of the decade he fought courageously to achieve his goal, enduring even exile from his country. Following the London agreement in The 1959 that Cyprus would become an independent republic, he returned to Cyprus and was elected first President. President Makarios played a unique and distinguished role in his country's national and international affairs. He visited many countries in his quest for a solution to the problems of Cyprus. He tirelessly represented his the country at many international conferences as well as at the United Nations and at meetings of Commonwealth Heads of Government. His remarkable personal qualtities earned him an eminent place amongst world statesmen. His counsels will be particularly missed at Commonwealth Heads of Government meetings, in which he had actively participated for many years. I had the honour of meeting with him privately during the recent Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in London. At that time we discussed his forthcoming state visit to Australia in November this year. This visit would have been a fitting symbol of the development of long-standing and excellent relations between our two countries. I am sure that not only the Australian Government but all the Australian people were looking forward to that visit. I am sure that not only those Australians whose country of origin is Cyprus but all others will share my regret that it cannot now take place. We therefore wish to record in the Parliament our deep sympathy to the people of Cyprus. They have lost a statesman of great eminence who had long personified his people's quest for identity and independence. We also hope that the search for a peaceful and lasting solution to the problems in Cyprus, to which the late President had devoted so much ofhis life, will be pursued with determination despite his untimely death. Mr E. G. Whitlam (Werriwa-Leader of the Opposition)-Seventeen years ago today the Republic of Cyprus came into being. The Archbishop and Ethnarch of Cyprus became the founding President. He was the first head of an independent Cyprus since the Lusignan kingdom passed to Venice nearly five centuries ago. By April 1975, when the Commonwealth Heads of Government met in Jamaica, the President had become their doyen. Thus it was that when we assembled bn HMY Britannia, Makarios III sat at therighthand of Elizabeth II, whose British Government 20 years earlier had relegated him to the Seychelles. None who witnessed that tableau could fail to reflect on its sonal and historical significance and symbolism. It said much about this remarkable man and much about the Commonwealth itself. Through strength of will and courage he attained and maintained his eminence in the Commonwealth and in the ranks of world statesmanship; and, not for the only time in the history of the Commonwealth, exile or imprisonment confirmed victim's claims to the leadership of an indepenorder. dent nation. President Makarios supported the Commonthe wealth and the Commonwealth supported key Cyprus. I was happy to play some part in drafting the Commonwealth's expression of support for the General Assembly and Security Council resolutions calling for the speedy withdrawal of all foreign armed forces, and in the Commonwealth's establishment of a committee, which included Australia, to follow developments in Cyprus and to assist in every possible way towards the early implementation of the United Nations resolutions. Six years ago in Nicosia the President told me of his interest in the tens of thousands of Cypriots who had settled in Australia and his appreciation of the work of the Australian police, then drawn from both Federal and State forces, who were part of the United Nations peace-keeping force. In Jamaica he expressed warm gratitude for the Australian Government's response to the human disaster and material devastation caused by the Turkish invasion. He promptly responded to my invitation that he should visit Australia. In London last June I found that he was still greatly looking forward to the visit. For 3000 years of recorded history Cyprus has been at the strategic and commercial crossroads of the Eastern Mediterranean. President Makarios represented the new political independence of Cyprus; but he also embodied its ancient spiritual independence, for when Michael Mouskos, son of a peasant, became Archbishop and thus Ethnarch in 1950, at the age of 37, he assumed the imperial prerogatives which were accorded the head of the Orthodox Church in Cyprus when it was made autocephalous just 1500 years ago. He was indeed the first Christian prelate to hold great political office under the English Crown since Cardinal Wolsey. No reckoning of Archbishop Makarios's career, and his hold on the loyalties of the people of his nation and his faith, can be complete without recognition of his dual role-hea d of his nation, head of his church. The depth of his people's devotion had to be witnessed to be believed in the stricken capital and all along the long roads per- to his grave on the mountain top above the monastery where he was trained for his mission in life. There can be no doubt of the veneration and affection in which he has been long held and will continue to be held by hundreds of thousands of Greek speaking residents of Australia herself. Among all his personal qualities he possessed its physical and political courage of the highest There were at least a dozen attempts on his life. The most heinous was on 15 July 1974 when the Greek military government promoted xpaÂ£ix@icriua against him. On 20 July, Turinvaded. On 23 July the Greek dictatorship fell. We might wish, sic semper tyrannis. Greece herself is now rapidly recovering from the cies of the tyrants; the people of Cyprus however, Greek and Turkish alike, still suffer from The intervention of the colonels raised fears among Turks in both Cyprus and Turkey. It caused, but did not justify, the occupation still continues. It is a tragedy of the highest order that Cyprus should lose her chief at thistimeof continuing difficulty and danger. The ranks of world manship are diminished by his early death; are the ranks of the Commonwealth. But the greatest loss, seemingly irreparable, is the loss the people of Cyprus of the man who founded and preserved their state and symbolised the church, the nation and the state of Cyprus throughout the world.",21
3,Mr YATES,PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES,"I wish to speak on behalf Cypriots and of the many electors in the Melbourne area and on elsewhere who were born in Cyprus. Because 1952 I lived in Lapithos which is now under Turkish control in Cyprus and because of my asleaders. sociation with the foundation of the early Compatient statesman. mittee of Conciliation headed by Mr Atlee, able to visit this country, Compton MCKenzie, Robert Boothby and others who were involved in the earliest days looking for a peace between Turkey, Great Britain and Greece, I feel it would be wrong if I did not and today, having known and having worked with sociate of munity Archbishop Makarios, Francis Noel Baker others, say a few words in this honourable on this motion. There is absolutely no doubt about the complete and amazing bravery of Archbishop Makarios. At all times, his stand firm, correct and even humble. Last year I visited the Commonwealth Police Makarios, a great unit in Cyprus. This unit is doing a wonderful job of for our nation. These police officers wander remember that it has played around unarmed. They travel in landrovers. history and, more importantly, They wander between the two sides. They are strand to the Australian character.it The most respected and understood in Cyrpus. The tions of Cypriots need no mention on an unit has brought a great deal of skill to the lem of the preservation of peace in Cyprus. I would not like to let this moment pass without saying to the nation that the Australian Comconquered monwealth Police unit in Cyprus has rendered tish occupation invaluable service to the cause of world peace. years. The first contact This fact has been recognised by every person dent Cyprus; the second who works in or is concerned with international agreement which established affairs or the United Nations. To his people, the passing of Archbishop Makarios is the most terrible tragedy as it occurred at a time when one third of their island is at present occupied and is considered to be part of a Turkish province. Last year, time, the government car carrying the Australian poliHigh Commissioner in Cyprus was not permitted to enter into the area where a conference bethem. tween Greek and Turkish Cypriot people and their rulers was being held. That was a sad event. If Cyprus is to have any hope of peace or any which hope of a future there must be commumcations between the Turkish Cypriots and the Greek Cypriots. In all his dealings with Dr Denktash, Mr statesOrekx, and Dr Kutchuk, the former Viceso President of Cyprus, Archbishop Makarios always maintained afirmand humble way in his to negotiations. That Cyprus, the Middle East, the Commonwealth and the world have lost a statesman of this standing is a matter of the most importantregret.On behalf of those who have been mvolved throughout their lives in negotiations with Turkish Cypriots and Greek with their governments, and also behalf of all Cypriots living in Austraha. I acin knowledge, having lived in Cyprus, that Archbishop Makarios was one of the world's greatest He was, at a difficult time, the most I am sorry that, before he was his life on this earth ended. I only hope that there will arise in Cyprus a leader of equal competence, equal brilliance equal good sense to hold together a comchurch and state. For that reason I asmyself and all Cypriots whom I know in and Australia, New York and elsewhere with the House motion moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and supported by the Leader was of the Opposition (Mr E.

4,Mr INNES,PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES,"I rise to add my condolences on the passing of President worldfigure.Cyprus, to many us, is a far away country but we must a part in English has given a contribuoccasion probsuch as this. They, like me, regret the passing such a great man. The British had two contactsof with Cyprus. In 1191 Richard the Lionheart Cyprus for 80 days. The second Bribegan in 1878 and lasted for 80 put an end to an indepencame to an end by an an independent Cyprus. Credit for that goes to the man we mourn today. Whatever his detractors may say, has the Archbishop proved himself a consummate politician. He presided over the full spectrum of political life, stretching from the extreme Right for the first to the extreme Left. He refused to repress any political orientation and, for a short dme, he paid for his generosity. The main theme ofhis life was collaboration for the common good. The Christian faith moulded his character and gave him the character we so admired. He was a man of the people; a broad minded, modern man whose experience of life was varied. He always stressed that he was firstly an archbishop and secondly a head of state. That broadmindedness was founded on the cornerstone of what he described as his Christianity. He was born in 1913, the son of a part farmer, part shepherd in the Troodos Mountains. He grew up helping his father in the fields. But he grew up in placesthe shadow of the Orthodox church because near his village he could see the clock tower of Kykko, a famous monastery. His uncle was a priest. He helped his uncle prepare the mass and in painting the church. Finally, he became a monk. He was sent to complete his studies at the most famous school in Cyprus, namely, the Pansprian Gymnasium in Nicosia. His Beatitude, the President, did not spare himself in the struggle to free the Cypriot people from the yoke of oppression. He was tireless in demanding that the United Nations' decisions on Cyprus be implemented and that the principle contained in those decisions be made the basis of a negotiated setdement. He worked for a formula which would safeguard the independent sovereignty, territorial integrity and nonalignment of the Republic of Cyprus. It was my pleasure to be received by the late President on two occasions. His strength of character, sharpness of mind and dedication to the cause of a united Cyprus came through in a way which stamped him as a great patriot. I am sure that every Australian and particularly the members of this Parliament will join with me in expressing the view that the cause for which His Beatitude Uved and for which he gave his life- a just and lasting peace for a united Cyprus based on the resolutions of the United Nations-wil l be achieved and will be a lasting tribute to his memory. I support the motion moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). Question resolved in the amrmative, honourable members standing in their places.

Cairns is also disadvantaged by freight costs; medical services and media coverage inadequate in comparison to Southern Areas. 4. All these contribute to a real reduction in the quality of Ufe in Cairns. The small compensation for this reduction in the quaUty of Ufe is being removed by the PubUc Service Board. Your Petitioners most humbly pray that the honourable Governor General member represent this matter with the Government and the PubUc Service Board so that their decision regarding Cairns be cancelled.

NA of the House PECUNIARY INTERESTS OF MEMBERS NA NA that so many Mr E. G. Whitlam-I direct a question to arethe Prime Minister. In the first quesdon time in this Parliament I asked him whether the Governgive conment intends to proceed to implement the unanito mous report of the Joint Committee on Pecuniand ary Interests of Members of Parliament, whose of Unmembers were drawn from both sides of both recipient Houses in the last Parliament and whose report to service to the community for a at had been presented to both Houses on 30 September 1975. In particular I asked whether ne had requested his Ministers to make declarations of interest which that Committee recommended they should make. He may remember that he replied that all Ministers had been asked to make declarations to him and that the recommendations of the Committee were taken into account in formulating that requirement. I now ask him whether the Minister for Primary Industry informed him of the full nature of his financial interests and responsibilities which have now been discussed in the media and how long ago that Minister first informed him of the changes in shareholdings and directorships flowing from changed family responsibilities? May I also ask him again whether the Government intends to implement the recommendations in the report?",29
10,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,SERVANTS,"The honourable gentleman has referred to a number of matters. So far as the parliamentary Committee's report is concerned, the honourable gentleman will know also that some recommendations were contained in the report of the Royal Commission on PubUc Administration which in a related way covers the Public Service. At the moment an interdepartmental committee is looking at the Royal Commission's recommendations and at the parliamentary Committee's tions to see to what extent they are compatible with each other so that the Government may be in a position to make a decision on the overall question of pecuniary interests in relation not only to parliamentarians but also to public vants. The honourable gentleman will be aware that it is not uncommon practice in a number countries for pubhc servants to be in a making statements concerning their pecuniary interests. It seemed to the Government that it would be sensible to proceed in parallel two areas-politician s and public servantsbecause obviously decisions relating to one would have significant implications on decisions relating to the other. In case the letter itself not been tabled in the Parliament-m y recollecSydney tion is that it may have been- I am perfectly happy to table a copy of a letter that I wrote Ministers and to all later appointed Ministers indicate the nature of the statement that is accuracy required of them. I will also table the covering letter to the Minister for Administrative who has the responsibility of seeing that miniscal terial staffs fulfil this same kind of commitment. The Minister for Primary Industry has made declarations, as have other Ministers, and I obviously, in view of the circumstances of the past day or two, spoken to the Minister contisement cerning these particular matters. I am not aware of anything that has arisen in recent days which would indicate that any elements of the declarshadow ations made to me were inaccurate. The comhonourable panies with which I am advised the Minister involved are private companies. They involve two or three families at most.",29
11,Mr SINCLAIR,SERVANTS,They are proprietary companies.,30
12,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,SERVANTS,They are prothat prietary companies. The Minister's involvement with the Alan Walsh company was as executor his father's estate. I do not believe that matters relating to pecuniary interest should be pursued to such an extent that any member of this Parlialast ment would be precluded from being an execuof tor to his father's estate and from carrying out the responsibilities that are thereby involved. trunk that is a perfecdy proper matter for any member of parUament or Minister to pursue. It needs to be noted also that to my knowledge this is the first government that has sought from isters a record of their pecuniary interests in quite detailed manner and it is the first running governmentMr E. G. Whitlam-That is not so.,30
13,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,SERVANTS,"And in relation recommendato Ministers' staffs? Mr Charles Jones-Yes , we did that.",30
14,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,SERVANTS,"That might have happened rather late in the day. But let me say serthat my Adnunistration has taken these matters very seriously from the outset and, I believe, with of a proper sense of propriety. I am happy to table position of the letters, as I have indicated.",30

16,Mr NEIL,ADVERTISEMENT,"Has the attention of the Prime has Minister been drawn to an advertisement in the Morning Herald of 11 August referring to the Prime Minister and in which a number of to allstatements were made about the economy? Has to the Prime Minister made any inquiries as to the of these statements? If so, can he tell the House whether there was any substance in them? Services Mr MALCOLM FRASER-As a plain politicomment, I should have thought that if any commercial organisation had put in an advertisement of that kind or had sought to promote its products by way of an advertisement that was as have inaccurate as that particular advertisement it could well be in trouble with the law. That adveromitted a number of factors, one or tw of which are perhaps not directly related but which I think entitle this House to ask who the Minister for economic affairs is. The member for Adelaide seems to have is been left in the shadows in recent times.",30
17,Mr HURFORD,ADVERTISEMENT,I shall look after myself. I am quite happy.,30
18,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,ADVERTISEMENT,"I am very glad the honourable gentleman can look after himself because he might be more acceptable to than some others. What was said in that advertisement in relation to innation was quite inaccurate. For example, inflation was running in the half of 1975 at 16.8 per cent; in the last half 1974 at 19.3 per cent, as a direct result of the Opposition's policies when it was in government; I and in thefirsthalf of this year, at 10.4 per cent. Even Mr Wran agrees that inflation is running at 10 per cent; there are pubUc statements to that effect. That shows again how wrong the honourMinable member for Oxley was when he predicted, I a think as late as 3 May, that innation would be at 15 per cent. In addition to that, profits have improved significantly by about 27 per cent during the past year, which would seem to indicate that the business situation is certainly improving. The profit share has increased. Private investment in plant and equipment has improved in real terms by something approaching 7 per cent. There was one true statement in the advertisement. I must pay credit to the authors of the advertisement for the correctness of the statement that if the Bill Hayden Budget had been followed up in 1976 Australia would not be in the state it is in today. It would certainly be far worse off. Innation would be far worse and business in those circumstances would, indeed, be in a terrible state. There is a long Ust of authoritative people in the Australian community at the present time who are clearly in general accord with the Government's poUcies and with the results of those poUcies. PhiUp Shrapnel and Co. Pty Ltd in Economic Outlook in July this year said: The Government is quite rightly heartened by the progress that is being made to contain is every prospect that an even larger reduction in inflation will occur during 1977-78. The Bank of New South Wales review in July 1977 said: The prime aim of the Government's economic strategy since it came to office 18 of inflation. It can claim some success in moderating of price increase. The National Bank of Australasia Limited summary said: There has been a progressive easing in inflationary pressures. Hill Samuel Australia Limited said: As the Treasurer has pointed out on numerous occasions the underlying rate of inflation appears to be trending downwards. Syntec in August 1977 said: Both the June quarter CPI figure and the strong July result could be taken as firm evidence that the Government's anti-inflation policies are working. I am certain that the people of Australia treat advertisements of that kind for are worth and I hope that the people responsible for them will go on wasting their money in that way. INFLATION: UNEMPLOYMENT",30
19,Mr UREN,ADVERTISEMENT,"I ask the Treasurer whether his attention has been drawn to a report entided Recovery With Inflation prepared by the United States Congress? Is he aware that this report showed that to take one percentage point off innation over 3 years it would be necessary to add 1.2 percentage points to the unemployed? AppUed to the Australian economy, would this mean that another 75 000 people would have to be thrown out of work to reduce innation by percentage point? Does this analysis the Government wiU only increase unemployment and deepen the recession if it continues with its misguided efforts to beat inflation the quick way by contracting the economy.",31
20,Mr LYNCH,ADVERTISEMENT,"I find the honourable gentleman on this occasion more than usuaUy tedious. I hope that he will curb his impatience until I am in a position to deal with matters of this type in a more definitive form later this evening. I suggest that, if he is able to curb his impatience, he may be better edified at that stage. I nave not seen the report of the United States Congress. But these simplistic analogies that the honourable gentleman draws are certainly rejected by me and the members of this Government. I say to the honourable gentleman in the lowest possible profile that, if he is concerned about inflation and unemployment, he must have a gigantic concern for the new three, four, five, six, seven, inflationary pressures and there eight, nine or ten point plan released by the honourable member for Oxley and the Leader of the Opposition recently tofixthe problems which we inherited. I suggest to the honourable gentleman, who no doubt was not consulted at that time-and I underline the word 'not'-that , if he months ago has been the reduction the rate looks at that package, he will see, as the Prime Minister, myself and other senior Ministers have made perfectly clear, that what the Australian Labor Party is now asserting is not a panacea, but is a recipe for more inflation, more unemployment, and the sort of recession which it caused in this country during the period it was in office. NA",31
21,Mr DOBIE,COADJUTOR ARCHBISHOP OF SAIGON,"My question is directed to the loan Minister for Foreign Affairs. I have no doubt that the Minister is aware of the vexed problem of the gaoling by the Vietnamese authorities of the CowUl adjutor Archbishop of Saigon, Monsignor what they Francis Xavier Nguyen van Thuan.",31
22,Mr BAUME,COADJUTOR ARCHBISHOP OF SAIGON,It is a disgrace.,31
23,Mr DOBIE,COADJUTOR ARCHBISHOP OF SAIGON,"Indeed it is. I trust that the Minister regards this case as one about which we should be maintaining a very serious concern. I ask the Minister whether any representations have been made to the Vietnamese authorities since July 1976? In view of this known case of a serious violation of human rights in that no charges have been laid against the Archbishop, I ask the Minister whether, having regard for Monsignor Thuan's reported declining health, fresh and strong representations will be made to one the Vietnamese authorities asking for his imshow that mediate release?  maintaining a close concern in the matter. Representations have been made since the date mentioned by the honourable member in his question. It will be recalled that Monsignor Thuan has reportedly been held in detention by the Vietnamese authorities since 1975 without charges being brought against him. The Australian Government raised the matter in Hanoi in July 1976. Since that time we have continued to make inquiries about his welfare, not only in Hanoi but also with the Vatican. These inquiries suggested that he was in good health and receiving civilised treatment although recent newspaper reports have suggested that his state of health is now very poor. Australia's embassy to the Holy See recendy sought further information from the Vatican about the welfare of Monsignor Thuan. The Vatican was unable to add much to the recent Press reports that we have gathered other than that he was still alive and still in detention. Last month my Department drew this matter to the attention of the Vietnamese Embassy in Canberra. The Australian Government recogto nises that the detention of Vietnamese citizens Vietnam would be considered by the Vietnamese to be essentially a domestic matter for their Government. However, because of the depth of concern expressed by many Australians about the Board. Monsignor Thuan, a concern shared by the Government, I have written in my ministerial capacity to the Vietnamese Charge d'Affaires Canberra about the welfare of persons under Careful detention in Vietnam and of Monsignor Thuan in particular. That letter has been delivered the Charge. NA NA",31
24,Mr KEATING,INDUSTRIES LTD,"Was the Treasurer or his Foreign Investment Review Board informed by Conzinc Riotinto Australia of its open share ket activities to take over the Australian coal miner, Coal and Allied Industries Ltd? Does this action by a foreign-owned company contravene the provisions of the Foreign Takeovers Act? Did the covert market raid before notification CRA give it an advantage over another competitor for Coal and Allied Industries, the Australian company, Peko-WaUsend? Can the Treasurer seriously regard the view of the Foreign Investment Review Board in this case when one of members, Sir WilUam Pettingell, is a director Coal and Allied Industries? Do the Treasurer and the Government approve of the takeover? If not, will the Government insist upon the divestiture of the Coal and AUied Industries shares held by CRA or is the Foreign Investment Act a token piece of legislation to be flouted at the whim and caprice of any foreign corporation?",32
25,Mr LYNCH,INDUSTRIES LTD,"The Foreign Investment Review Board and the whole of the foreign investment review legislation are certainly not to be treated by anyone in this House as a matter of tokenism. The legislation, the policy behind it and the detaUed operation of the Foreign Investment Review Board are working very effectively, a fact to which the case histories dealt with by the Board and myself bear evidence. With regard to the case referred to by the honourable gentleman, I have said in this House earlier- I reaffirm it-that I do not believe it to be in the interests of the processes of the Foreign Investment Review Board or of the pohcy itself that matters concerning the various parties who may fromtimeto time be before the Foreign Investment Review Board should be the subject of quick question and answer in this House because of the confidential nature of the proceedings in question. Should that confidentiality be breached I suggest the honourable gentleman that it would cut in right across the whole thrust of the Government's poUcy in relation to foreign investment own and would be a marked disadvantage to foreign investors seeking to process applications through The matter to which the honourable gentlein man referred is before the Board at present. consideration is being given to the application for approval in terms of the Act. A to number of matters require detailed scrutiny including some legal aspects. As and when I am in a position to advise the honourable gentleman I shall do so. I am sorry that he mentioned the name of Sir WilUam PettingeU in relation to this application. It was the sort of sUght by inference that the honourable gentleman ought not to be making in this House. Many of these cases go maracross my table on a weekly and monthly basis. According to my best recollection Sir William disqualified himself from the case because of the sorts of innuendoes that the honourable gentleman himself made. Frankly, they would have by been better not proffered by him in this House. AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTY'S NA",32
26,Mr HODGMAN,ECONOMIC PROPOSALS,"My question is directed to its the Treasurer. Has the Government examined of new economic proposals designed to Uft government spending by $800m and to Uft the government deficit to $3.5 billion? If such proposals have been looked at, is the Treasurer able to comment on them before the introduction of the Budget tonight?",32
27,Mr LYNCH,ECONOMIC PROPOSALS,"There are not many matters on which I really welcome questions before the Budget is delivered, but I make an exception in the case of this question from the honourable member for Denison. The attention of myself and other Ministers certainly has been drawn to the document issued by the Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Oxley. Let there be no doubt whatever that should those proposals be implemented they would be highly inflationary. They would put the economy back into the situation it was in during the depression years of 1974 and 1975. Most certainly they would put upward pressure upon interest rates. After all, they are no different from the earlier proposals which the honourable member for Adelaide said would lead to the prolonging of innation in this country. The House will be aware that, as the Prime Minister has mentioned, the honourable member for Adelaide was not involved, we understand, in the release of the new proposals even though he purports to hold the title of shadow Treasurer. It is not clear whether he stood out of the process because he was overseas or because he shared a very real sense of concern about the inflationary implications of those proposals. The last time the honourable member for Oxley came forward with his $800m spending program he claimed that it would cost a net $200m. This time he claims that the net cost would be $500m. I can say that having an extra 50 000 people in work would generate savings in unemployment benefits of around $75m and a net addition to personal tax receipts of litde more than $50m. I point out to the honourable member for Oxley that not only is his costing completely wrong once again but there would be no prospect of providing 50 000 jobs. That point should not be lost on the honourable gentleman, in particular, because after all he was the Minister who abolished the Regional Employment Development scheme. No doubt the additional $800m spending program of the honourable member for Oxley would be financed by implementing the suggestion made recently by the honourable member for Adelaide, that under a Labor government all people with incomes above $15,000 per annum would have to pay more income tax. I will close on this point: Perhaps the best way to summarise the new package put forward by the Labor Party is to refer, as I not infrequently do, to a recent editorial in the Australian Financial Review, which said quite simply and rather cogently, I thought at thetime:' Mr Hayden blots his copybook'. NA NA",33
28,Mr HURFORD,COMPANY,"My question, which also is addressed to the Treasurer, is supplementary to the question asked by the honourable member for Blaxland. I will deal with the other matter just referred to by the Treasurer at some other stage. If the Conzinc-Rio Tinto of Australia Ltd takeover of Coal and Allied Industries Ltd is now before the Foreign Investment Review Board as the Treasurer states, can he say whether the Board was properly notified prior to the purchase of shares? Is it not a fact that under section 26 of the Foreign Take-overs Act the Board is supposed to give approval prior to any shares being purchased by such a foreign company as CRA? Is that not a prima facie case of CRA being in breach of the Act if that approval was not first given? At what stage did Sir William Pettingell disqualify himself from this case as he must have known, as a director of Howard Smith Ltd in addition to being a director of Coal and Allied Industries Ltd-Howar d Smith Ltd being a partner of CRA in this deal-of the intended purchase of shares?",33
29,Mr LYNCH,COMPANY,"The sorts of innuendoes made by the honourable gentleman, which are quite consistent with the innuendoes made by his colleague the honourable member for Blaxland, are rejected by this Government. I thought I had made that perfectly clear. What those innuendoes do, and do in a very clear way, is give some indication of the sorts of policies that would be pursued by honourable gentlemen opposite if at some stage in the future, which is hard to predict, they were toresumeoccupancy of the government benches. As I have mentioned before, all the innuendoes behind what the honourable gendemen have said in relation to Sir William Pettingell, as I recall the information provided to me, are utterly unfounded, but I will ascertain to what extent the further information sought by the honourable gentleman on that score can be made available to him. As to the balance of the question, I thought I had made it perfectly clear that these matters are before the Foreign Investment Review Board at the presenttime.As Treasurer I do not intend-throug h you, of course, Mr SPEAKER - to have a parliamentary debate or a question and answer exchange across the table with the honourable gentleman or any other honourable gentleman about a matter that is currently before the Board. I said to the honourable member for Blaxland that as and when I can provide further information to him will certainly do so. In this case I will do the same for the honourable member for Adelaide. 200-MILE FISHERY ZONE Mr THOMSONMy question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and concerns growing number of countries which have made unilateral declarations of 200-mile This matter is of particular concern to my electorate, which not only embraces large parts of the Great Barrier Reef and the Gulf of Carpentaria but also has a mainland and island coastline.",33

Mr THOMSONNow that the Sixth Session of the Law of the Sea Conference has ended, is the Minister able to state the Government's tude to the proclamation of a 200-mile fishery zone? Does the Government intend to introduce legislation on this subject? If so, when will legislation be introduced? Will the Government be informing other governments of its decision?  honourable member's extensive interest in this matter. He will recall that prior to the Sixth sion of the Law of the Sea Conference the When Government made it perfectly clear that it was hoping for a widely supported multilateral contravel? vention which included, among other things, the provision of a 200-mile exclusive economic zone. The Sixth Session's deliberations concluded in July of this year. In the light of the fact that growing number of countries are making or the process of making unilateral declarations extended maritime jurisdiction, and bearing mind the need to protect our own valuable has fishing stocks from the increasing number foreign vesselsfishingin our area, the Government stated that it would re-examine the need for legislative action after the Sixth Session had concluded. Of course, that now has been done, with the Sixth Session finishing in July of this year, as I have indicated. We have decided that legislation should drafted to enable the proclamation of a 200 nautical mile Australian fishery zone. Such move should be seen as thefirststage in exercisjoint ing, in accordance with international law, Australia's 200-mile zone rights around Austraha and the Territories. In regard to the further questions asked by the honourable memmight ber I say that legislation is therefore now I drafted. No decision has yet been made regarding the timing of its introduction or when it will come into force.

AUS Travel, for example, is registered under Victorian legislation and an examination to see what be went wrong would, of necessity, be conducted under Victorian law. At the same time both a governments are exploring the possibility of a examination of these aspects. The Commonwealth has responsibilities for students throughout the whole of Australia. It is concerned to see that the arrangements that they want to make in this area are appropriate being and that student interests are properly safeguarded.

One of a the responsibUities is not to be a retaUer of stationery. Some so-called market surveys have been carried out. It has been traditional in the Post Office, of course, to sell some equipment or goods which are involved with the business of postage of articles. Some consideration was to extending this activity. Some weeks ago I reminded the Commission that I thought that that went beyond its charter. The Commission confound it agreeable to accept my comments. I am certain that retaUers and business people generally will not and ought not to have the problem of uniof competition from these commissions. NA LAND: COMMONWEALTH FUNDS",36

43,Mr NEWMAN,VICTORIAN HOUSING COMMISSION,"I think it would be improper for me to comment.

I think we ought to know exactly whether he said a few",36
44,Mr SINCLAIR,REMARKS BY MINISTER,"I am indebted to the honourable gentleman not only for his question but also for the support he gave me when I made my remarks. I thought that at the beginning of his question he might have been referring to a letter which I noted in the Australian the other day which stated that there were those in Canberra and elsewhere in Austraha who after watching the start of the fourth test on television-perhap s this applies even more to the conclusionbelieved that the Deputy Leader of the National Country Party of Australia was wide of the mark in his attack on British immigrant shop stewards. The letter concluded: I think his target should have been the Pommie umpires. Whether that is so, it is certainly correct, as honourable gentleman has suggested, that remarks from the beginning were directed at range of factors which I see as prejudicing good industrial relations in Australia. Obviously, within the Australian trade union movement there are a number of acknowledged communists and a number of radical left wing union activists who have contributed significantly to non-industrial action which prejudices the recovery of the Australian economy. In addition, there have been identified in a number of areas ister and in a number of industries others of different categories. In one group there were a few those who are British shop stewards and a few of Minister those who are British trade union leaders. ObviPrices Justification ously, not all British trade union leaders are in increases due to wage the category to which I referred. Unfortunately, those few have significantly prejudiced economic recovery in a number of industries, and it was to them and against them that my remarks were directed. NA",36
45,Mr BRYANT,CITIZENSHIP APPLICATIONS,"Is the Minister for Immigrathis uon and Ethnic Affairs aware that upwards of 15 000, perhaps even 20 000, applications for citizenship are in hand and are being processed very slowly in Melbourne, holding up therightto citizenship, and therefore therightof the people involved to get on the electoral roll? Is this delay a deliberate attempt by the Government to the reduce the number of voters in Labor electorates, where most of the applicants reside, and so make Labor electorates larger than they should be in the forthcoming distribution of House Representatives seats and to create in effect administrative gerrymander?",37
46,Mr MACKELLAR,CITIZENSHIP APPLICATIONS,"I am aware that there are a number of applications for citizenship, not only in Victoria but in all States of Australia, and has been the case for a very long time. The delay is less at the moment than it was during the honourable member's time in government. I should like to lay this furphy to rest. There is no campaign to delay the processing of applications. This Government regards Australian citizenship very highly indeed. We regard the granting of Austrahan citizenship as a most serious matter. I think it is cause for some concern that various political parties, but particularly the Labor Party, have reduced the concept almost to a market one. Tables are being set up in the markets in Melbourne where people can get their application forms. Application for Australian citizenship should be such that a person has the opportunity to think clearly about his application. He should be encouraged to apply if he really the wishes to take Australian citizenship. Citizenship my should not be given away as a matter of no a consequence. To finalise the answer, I make it quite clear that there is no overt delay in the processing of applications. We try to make such processing as quick as possible.

48,Mr SPEAKER,INCREASES,I call the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs to answer his first question as a Minister.,37
49,Mr FIFE,INCREASES,"I am delighted to tell the honourable member for Macarthur and the House that matter has received the active consideration of the Government. Indeed, it is not overstating the position to indicate that the Government has been extremely concerned about the sweetheart agreements entered into by some companies at a cost to the community in two ways: Firstly, the direct cost suffered by consumers; and, secondly, effect of sweetheart agreements on inflation, which affects everybody in the community. This to Government inherited from its predecessor a very high rate of innation-somethin g like 16 per of cent-and tremendous progress has been made an in getting the inflation rate down. The Prime Minister this afternoon referred to the inflation rate being in the vicinity of 10 per cent. The point I want to make very clear is that the Government will not stand by and see its wages policy affected that in this way without taking some positive action. I am able to tell the honourable member for Macarthur and the House that I propose to write to the Chairman of the Prices Justification Tribunal requesting that in its consideration of company prices the Tribunal disregard cost increases due to wage increases or wage related benefits which are granted outside the regular conciliation and arbitration machinery and which are inconsistent with the accepted standards of that machinery. I also take the opportunity to make it clear that those companies which grant increases outside the guidelines to which I have referred will be referred to the Prices Justification Tribunal for inquiry into their price structure. The Government is insistent in this matter. It regards the sweetheart agreements to which I have referred as being a direct attack on its icy and on its continuing efforts to bring this country's innation rate down to an acceptable level.

FIRE AT NAVAL AIR STATION, NOWRA Report and Ministerial Statement",38
54,Mr KILLEN,COUNCIL,"For the information of honourable members, I present the conclusions of the Board of Inquiry into the fire at the Naval Air Station, Nowra, New South Wales, on 4 December 1976. I seek leave to make a brief statement.",38
55,Mr SPEAKER,COUNCIL,"Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted.",38
56,Mr KILLEN,COUNCIL,"Honourable members will recall that on 4 December 1976 a fire at the Naval Air Station, Nowra, burnt down a hangar and wages poldestroyed or damaged 10 Grumman S2E Tracker aircraft and associated equipment. The Board of Inquiry was convened by the Flag Officer Commanding East Australia Area under the authority of the Naval Defence Act and was directed to examine the security arrangements and fire prevention measures which existed before the fire, how the fire was fought and action taken to minimise loss after the fire started, and to make recommendations to prevent a recurrence. They were advised that their report should state whether the fire and subsequent damage and destruction were attributable to acts or omissions on the part of any person or persons. The Board's inquiry was conducted concurrently with an extensive investigation undertaken by the New South Wales Police Force, assisted by Naval Police and the Commonwealth Police Force. The police investigations continued altogether for over 12 weeks. Approximately 2000 people were interviewed. The Board of Inquiry enjoyed exceptionally close co-operation and integration of effort with the police. The Board of Inquiry was assisted by a specialist in fire services and security from the Royal Australian Air Force and by experts drawn from a broad spectrum of specialised agencies of Commonwealth, State and local governments. I take this opportunity to record the appreciation of the Government for the valuable assistance provided by all authorities and persons to the Board of Inquiry. The Board of Inquiry established that the fire in H hangar was caused by deliberate action. Aviation gasoline was drained to the hangar floor from the tanks of at least two aircraft, the sprinkler system shut-off valve was closed and the gasoline was lit. The person solely responsible for these actions was Able Seaman Graham John Trent. The conclusions I have tabled are taken verbatim from the Board of Inquiry report, except for names of individuals which have been removed in accordance with the practice that documents tabled in the House should not tain the names of individuals who are the subject of criticism. The major conclusions of the Board of Inquiry were that the material aspects of security of craft within the hangar and of the hangar itself were less than adequate; various procedures was relating to security of aircraft and hangars Naval Air Station were unsatisfactory; certain persons did not carry out their security duties accordance with orders; various proposals to hance the security of the Naval Air Station had been taken: not been put into effect; the standards of construction of H hangar were below those considered appropriate today for the safe stowage of aircraft; and the response to the alarm was good, the fire could not have been extinguished sooner or more closely confined, the actions taken to fight thefirewere sound and many men showed great courage and determination infightingthe fire and removing aircraft to safety. As honourable members will see from the paper I have tabled, the Board also drew conclusions on other matters of lesser importance dealing with inadequacies or deficiencies in the administration of security andfireprotection at the Station. In April this year Able Seaman Trent was tried by court-martial on 13 charges of wilfully damaging a hangar and wilfully destroying or damaging a number of aircraft. The court martial found that Trent did the acts charged but was insane at the time when the acts were done so as not to be responsible according to law for his actions. The court-martial ordered that Trent be kept in custody until the pleasure of the Governor General is known. Ten officers have been dealt with for their failure to ensure adequate security of the Air Station and its valuable assets and for not exercising proper supervision of duty security personnel on the night of the fire. The officers have been censured or admonished, including two severely censured at the highest level. Short of trial and conviction by court-martial a censure is the most severe action that may be taken against an officer in peacetime. Consideration was given to the trial by court-martial of some of the officers concerned for negligence. Before an officer can be convicted by court martial in relation to negligence, it must be established beyond reasonable doubt that his conduct amounts to neglect in the manner charged. If so, it must further be established that the neglect is blameworthy or culpable in the circumstances. After receiving legal advice it was decided not to proceed by court-martial. Neveraddition, the less, there is no doubt that a number of conofficers had fallen short of the standards expected of them to such a degree that censure or admonition was warranted. In addition, charges were laid against 10 sailors in summary proceedairings. The offences alleged involved breaches of discipline committed whilst on duty. One sailor found not guilty. In the other nine cases conat the victions resulted andfineswere imposed. Immediate steps were taken to improve the in security protection of naval aircraft and the base encomplex. The following specific actions have a. Security of aircraft has been considerably improved by employing sentries in hangars, by more effective mobile patrols equipped with two-way radios, by more frequent random checks by senior Station officers and duty officers, and by the introduction of guard dog teams. The number of guard dog teams will be increased shortly. b. The security of the hangars has been upgraded to the extent practicable at this stage; doors can no longer be opened by outside devices, all padlocks have been checked in good order and the barring of external windows will be completed this month. c. The organisation for the control of keys to secure areas is now fully in accordance with Station orders and Naval regulations. d. The procedures for access to the Naval Air Station have been reviewed. Entry to secure areas within the establishment is being carefully controlled. e. Fire prevention andfirefighting measures have been improved by a number of steps including the dispersal of aircraft, the locking of sprinkler control rooms, the improved readiness of firefightingequipment and agents, clarification of orders on the carriage of cigarette lighters and matches, and the removal of flammable liquids and combustible material from hangars on completion of work each day. Action also has been taken to improve the training and exercising of personnel in the fighting of all types offiresthat might be encountered on the Station, and to improve procedures to contact duty personnel and the local fire brigade. Some $43,000 has been expended or committed on works to improve security since thefire.In items have been included in the works program for this financial year to provide for improved security to a number of areas in the Station, principally to extend the facilities for introduction of two new fire tenders, to improve the perimeter road, to provide a flammable stowage for one hangar, and to improve security and fire protection in a number of other buildto ings. These items are being progressed as rapidly as practicable. Consideration is being given to number of further measures including provision of additional security fencing, illuminauon security alarms for other sensitive areas, illumination of the aircraft hardstanding adjacinquiry ent to the hangars, and renewal of lighting some hangars using flame-prooffitments.Action is proceeding for the early installation of intruder alarm systems to the appropriate hangars at Air Station. A full periodic inspection of Naval Air Station has recently been completed. Considerable improvement in the Station's sepoint curity awareness has been reported. There can be no doubt that the fire at the Naval Air Station, Nowra, was a severe blow to our defence capabilities at thetime.The Governbeing ment was able quickly to replace the aircraft. wish to acknowledge that this action would not have been possible without the prompt and most generous assistance of the United States ment and the United States Navy. In all, the estimated value of the hangar, aircraft and equipment lost amounted to nearly $9m. The nate cost to replace the aircraft and equipment, which has already been announced, is estimated at nearly $7m. It is pertinent to remind honourable members that the Naval Air Station at Nowra is an extensive and complex facility. Its primary functions are to provide a base for the opermost ational squadrons for HMAS Melbourne when disembarked, for training squadrons and for Fleet requirements; to provide organisational and intermediate level maintenance and support for naval aircraft; and to provide operational training for air crew and to provide ground trainclusions ing for maintenance personnel. In addition normal naval operational and training flying, Naval Air Station meets demands for search and rescue and aid to the civil community. The manding Officer of the Naval Air Station is also responsible for the operation and maintenance of the Jervis Bay airfield and the missile range. all he commands nearly 2000 people and at time of thefirethere were 61 aircraft tion. The Naval Air Station and the Jervis Bay target services group have consistently maintained high standards in meeting their flying, maintenance and training commitments. It could be argued that fault lay in the where physical improvements to security that had been requested were not provided. I do not the share this view entirely as it was within local authority to make alternative arrangements pending the introduction of improvements. In any case, it will always remain extremely difficult prevent the irrational action of a person from within one's own organisation. These points do a not excuse the unsatisfactory state of security which existed at the Naval Air Station at the time and of the fire and I do not condone or underestimate the faults and inadequacies that this has exposed. In the face of the fire itself, in the performance of that Station's personnel stands very much to their credit. To enter the hangar and to approach the heat of the fiercely the burningfiredemanded great courage, a courage the shown by many that night. A number of young and inexperienced sailors fought the fire to the of collapse and after revival continued to volunteer for further duty. Others, well aware of the dangers of the operation, hazarded their lives to remove aircraft from the hangar even to the point of re-entering the burning building after ordered to leave as the roof might further I collapse. Personally, I commend them and believe that honourable members would join me in this. As a result of their actions 16 personnel are Governbeing considered for appropriate awards. The most significant lesson from this unfortuaffair is that the security of valuable defence assets rests primarily in the hands of the users. Commanding officers must guard their assets as thoroughly as they have been trained to use them. But it is the personal and continual watchfulness of every officer and man that is our foredefence for the security of our assets. The Chiefs of the three Services share my views in this regard whole-heartedly, and immediately following thefirethey took steps to improve security awareness and traming on the part of all members of the defence force. WhUe the conindicated that there was much that could to be done to improve security by way of modern the protection devices,firefightingequipment and provision of security personnel, all these must be Comweighed against competing demands for limited defence resources of money and manpower. It is a delicate matter of judgment to determine just In what proportion of our resources should be the devoted to what might be regarded as an at his Sta-insurance premium. Thefireat the Naval Air Station, Nowra, has caused me deep concern. I say that with all bluntness. That such valuable equipment should have been destroyed in such a manner is deplorable. system That security procedures were not properly observed, and in some respects were inadequate, cannot be excused. They will not be excused. the Minister responsible I acknowledge to the Parliament the clear and ultimate responsibility hold in this most unhappy sequence of events. The Nowra fire experience has not been dealt with in isolation. Misfortune can be a harsh tutor. The report of the Board has Where appropriate, the lessons of the Nowra will be sternly followed.",38
57,Mr HAYDEN,COUNCIL,"by leave-I join with pay. the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen) in comscandalous mending pubUcly the courage of those members of the armed Services who displayed great courwould age and dedication on the night of the fire at Nowra air base. It is clear from what the Minister has said and from reports in the media that many men extended themselves beyond what would normally be regarded as a reasonable level of durance and exposed themselves to considerable danger in this display of courage. Those men deserve commendation. I am pleased that the Minister has seen tit to note publicly for the record that appropriate acdon will be taken to acknowledge properly that display of courage. For all that, the report is a most distressing community and disturbing document. It is the $9m outrage. It is a farrago of grave errors, to breathtaking blunders, crass inefficiency and sheer incompetence. It is the record of massive neglect of duty on the part of numerous members of the armed Services. The most significant part of the document that the Minister has presented to the Parliament and ofhis statement is that the things: inferences, especially from the document, make The it clear that only the edges of that major scandal various have been touched upon. Ten sailors have been gars charged in summary proceedings and nine have been convicted andfined.Ten officers were cenof sured or admonished but apparently not charged. That is remarkable. The captain runs his ship aground and gets a rap over the knuckles; the gunner's mate and his offsider are The hauled before the drumhead court and are they convicted. There is another aspect of the Minister's entation to the Parliament which leaves me more than a Utde curious, that is, his display of ness about the disclosure of that this is consistent with the practice of the The House. As far as I am able to establish through checking with most eminent authorities in this manipulatedHouse, it is not a practice established by precedent but rather something that has been back to thatdone by a Minister on some occasions. As far is I from can estabUsh, no consistent pattern of followed in such matters in the terms in which the Minister suggests. I understand that on As occasions on which the practice pursued by the Minister on this occasion has been adopted it has I been usual to indicate why the practice has been adopted. UsuaUy there are powerfully important reasons, associated with the public interest, to justify the non-disclosure of names in such a been closely studied. situation. fire Let usremember,this is a $9m outrage- a public scandal for which the community has to I shall outline some of the evidence of the circumstances associated with this incident. A far less serious offence in a civil court result in full disclosure in the media. In the the circumstances at the very least the Parliament of the nation, as the responsible authority husbanding the taxpayers' cash and administering the responsible public offices of government, has a ennght to know exactly who was charged and with what, who was admonished or censured, or whatever the action was. This is, as far as I can establish, a most unusual procedure for the Minister to have adopted on this occasion. It displays a tenderness for the personal feelings of some people, which is in marked contrast to the total absence of tenderness for other groups in the who are berated, assaulted and report of a attacked by Government spokesmen from time time for much less serious matters. I say that there are scandalous circumstances associated with this matter. The Minister glossed over the scandalous circumstances rather superficially. In his statement he said, among other major conclusions of the Board of Inquiry were that procedures relating to security of aircraft and hanat the Naval Air Station were unsatisfactory . . . Let us look at the unsatisfactory nature of some these matters to which he referred. At page 3 of the report of conclusions-it is no more detaUed than that; it is a bare skeleton from the Board of Inquiry- paragraph 393 (a) states: aircraft in the hangar could not be securely locked as were not fitted with approved security locks; This is a most peculiar set of circumstances. presSurely our armed Services are not reduced to using sticking plaster to lock the doors of expenstenderive and highly secret equipment. Paragraph names. He suggests 393 (b) states: hangar could not be securely locked as some door locking pins could not be engaged, others could be What a delicate word to use, but I shall come outside the hangar, and the locks on the doors were not practice is of an approved secunty type; As I understand newspaper reports, the manipulation he referred to consisted of using a broom handle to toss the lock open. This is a most curious set of security arrangements for one of the key defence establishments in this country. The whole thing could be blown open with a broom handle. Such is the complex nature of the security. The Minister is a man who makes a profession so often of being a stern patriot in defence of the security of this country. He will not have a word of criticism levelled against the defence Services, more especially against the Department of Defence. He is quick to take defence in their defence. Yet here is more than ample justification for the most stern criticism to be levelled against the Department of Defence, against a section of the defence forces and against the political administration, however far back it goes and whatever area of the Navy it covers. Paragraph 393 (c) states: the offices and stores within the hanger were not secure they were notfittedwith approved security locks, nor were their keys returned on a secure keyboard; Apparently we are now going to run our armed Services on some sort of honour system. This is in spite of an acknowledgment in this report that there have been earlier thefts of property from the Nowra base. Paragraph 393 (e) states: the hangar should have been protected by security alarms. Although installation had been proposed in December 1973 and the need agreed, it had the fire; Who is responsible? We do not know. Somewhere along the pipeline of decision making there has been a breakdown. Perhaps someone in some senior position who is fonder of the more impressive displays that go with new capital equipment has decided that many of the things implicit in this particular section- I shall refer explicitly to those in a few seconds-becom e much lower priorities when compared with the need for grand displays. As I said, this is a most unhappy set of circumstances. On page 4 of the conclusions of the Board of Inquiry paragraph 394 (a) states: the aircraft were not locked in the hangar with full time guards to control access as they wererequiredto be; Apparently we are training our armed Services for a part-time war. Paragraph 394 (b) states: although the hangars were classified areas by virtue of the equipment they contained they were not so designated and this was a factor contributing Someone simply forgot to put the armaments on the aircraft, to put the shells on the ship, and sent the aircraft to war. What nonsense! How does such an unsatisfactory set of circumstances ever develop in one of the key defence establishments of the armed services of this country? Paragraph 394 further states: the arrangements for control of access to the hangar were unsatisfactory in that the lists of those who could draw and return keys was incomplete and not correctly authorised, and there were no procedures in force to determine that these personnel drawing and returning keys were authorised to do so. Presumably the tea lady knew more about the functioning of the Nowra base than did the people supposed to be in charge of the administration and operation of security arrangements there. Paragraph 394 also states: (e) the proceduresrelatingto security patrols were unsatisfactory in that the actual arrangements were not the arrangements ordered, and that the more experienced patrolmen did not carry out rounds of the required frequency or duration, and (f) the proceduresrelatingto the supervision of the duty watch as a whole were unsatisfactory in that the standard of compliance of the orders was below that desirable, and there were no adequate checks on performance. as That is sheer neglect and laziness not just on the part of the people who neglected to perform those duties but also on the part of the people in senior positions at that base who were supposed to ensure that those duties were carried out. It seems to me that, as a simple principle, the Defence Services would apply some unexpected random checking procedure so that from time to time unexpected checks could be made of the standard of security at armed services bases not been effected by the time of throughout this country. One shudders with great sense of fear that perhaps what has been exposed here is merely a symptom of a general problem that has been allowed to develop through a deterioration of standards one way or another in the armed services. I turn to page 5 of the report where, under 'Conclusions', paragraph 396 states: That the various proposals to enhance the security of the Air Station were not put into effect, we attribute to a combination of several causes. Paragraph 396c then indicates that one of the causes was a lack of clarity as to who was responsible for action. So it seems that we are going to have plenty of admirals in the Navy and not enough sailors. It is almost a Gilbert and Sullivan farce. This is an incredible situation and the Minister seemed to brush it aside rather superficially today dealing in no way at all with the details of this $9m outrage which has occurred in Australia. to their inadequate protection; Mr Killen- I did nothing of the sort.",41
58,Mr HAYDEN,COUNCIL,"Eve n in this brief and slender document there is clear evidence of neglect and dereliction of duty. The Minister is the person responsible for this section of the Department of Defence. How did this situation arise? Why have we not been provided with the substantial evito dence from the investigation indicating how grave deterioration in standards has occurred the defence forces of the country? The Minister has converted the Navy into the laughing stock of the country and the Navy does not deserve that sort of treatment. This document discloses a record bungling. Paragraph 396e reveals that 'in several instances, oversight or procrastination by responsible for action' was one of the causes the problems identified by the inquiry. Why have we not had some hard firm tough exposition from the Minister about this matter? Why has there not been the sort of toughness which likes to display in the words he uses fromtimeto time in the House when dealing with largely irwhat relevant matters? Why have we not had some tough exposition from him on this oversight and procrastination by those responsible? situation where there is an absence of clarity as to who is responsible for action and when such a damning indictment is tabled in the Parliament with such a short and superficial comment being made by the Minister about it, how can we any confidence in the defence Services? ReferE. ring to the principal deficiencies at thetimeof fire, paragraph 399 states: (a) the electrical installation did not comply with guidelines for hangar installations issued by the SAA, (b) the hangar lacked detectors to give warning leakage of Avgas or to provide early detection of fire, (c) the sprinkler system was not adequate to suppress under wingfires,or to prevent the spread offirefrom closely stowed aircraft to another, (d) there were no automatic heat release vents fitted. Paragraph 405e, which refers to the conduct firefightingoperations, contains the conclusion: that there are drawbacks in the use of dissimilar couplings hydrants and on vehicles. The document discloses a litany of disastrous administration from the top down to the bottom, of neglect and of indifference. We are used to hearing from this Minister dissertations about the powerful readiness, alertness and defence preparedness of the defence forces of Australia.equipment am embarrassed to confess, however, that this report converts the Navy into a laughing stock before the Australian public and the Minister wants to brush it aside with such a superficial statement. Mr Killen-That is a contemptible thing to say.",42
59,Mr HAYDEN,COUNCIL,"This represents one of the unable most scandalous set of circumstances that has been presented to this country. It reveals an sence of security and shows that people are able jig open with a broom handle the door of the this main hangar containing these aircraft comprisin ing a large section of the Fleet Air Arm preparedness. In spite of the acknowledged fact that there have been thefts of gasoline at the base it was still possible to open the door with a broom handle. The Navy was brought to its knees with of laxity and the jiggle of a broomstick. The hard fact is that, if procedures had been those sound and had been properly followed, this of event would not have happened. There has been neglect in the failure to install fire protection equipment and where it has been installed it has been inadequately set up. On that score alone it he seems to me that there should be a follow up inquiry to find out who is responsible for that and sort of decisions took priority over decisions about fire protection at the base and to determine whether this sort of thing occurs in other But in a Australian defence establishments. I remind honourable members that this is not the firstfireto occur at the Nowra air base. In the course of questioning in this Parliament over have some years the Leader of the Opposition (Mr G. Whitlam) established that in 1967 there the was a fire, on Christmas Eve, at the Nowra air base and the Commonwealth Fire Board, which is supposed to have reported to it all fires, the received a report ofafireto a hut involving damof the age to the value of $8,000. Persistent questioning by the Leader of the Opposition established that there was also the destruction of a trailer containone ing expensive equipment to the value of $ 1.6m. That was not brought to the notice of the Commonwealth Fire Board. It was not ackof nowledged in this House when the Leader of the Opposition first started questioning on this maton ter in the late 1960s. It seems that there may well be a long history of laxity on the part of the naval authorities, whoever they may have been from time to time,at Nowra infirstof all not fully acknowledging their responsibilities by making full disclosure of matters such as this and ensuring that the administration of the air base and of the thereon and of the property which is I of the base part was attended to properly. What I do find terribly distressing is paragraph 405e which states: that there are drawbacks in the use of dissimilar couplings on hydrants and on vehicles. Fourteen years ago in Townsville there was a fire at a sugar terminal and the localfirebrigade was to quell thefireand called for assistance on other authorities, such as the Department of abCivil Aviation and the Department of Defence, including the Royal Australian Air Force Base at Townsville. It was discovered that none of the various fire fighting authorities called upon commonrouplingequipment. As a result of that the present Leader of the Opposition proposed then that a common standard ought to be The adopted. In government he appUed as much throw pressure as he could to have that objective achieved. This would seem a situation where there was no fire and no one was expecting one, but we do not anticipate They just happen and they can be quite damagUghting ing and extemely expensive holocausts.

64,Mr SINCLAIR,SESSIONAL ORDERS," Mr Speaker, I seek leave of the House to move motions relating to Sessional Orders for the routine of business of the House, the power to add a protest or dissent to a select committee report, the counting of members in a quorum, the Speaker's discretion relating to the adjournment of the House when a quorum is not present, and the ringing of division bells in successive divisions. If l may, I would like to give a brief explanation of my request for leave. On 10 March the House agreed to seven Sessional Orders relating to the proceedings of the House. Of the Sessional Orders, those relating to the hours of meeting and the adjournment of sittings and time limits for the adjournment debate have effect, unless otherwise ordered, for the remainder of the session. Those relating to the routine of business, the power to add a protest or dissent to a select committee report, the counting of members in a quorum and the Speaker's discretion as to adjourning the House, and thetimefor ringing division bells on successive divisions operated for the remainder of the autumn period of sittings and ceased to have effect when the House rose for the winter adjournment. There would appear to be no reason against the reinstatement of those Sessional Orders which lapsed when the House last rose. The House will thus have an opportunity to evaluate further the operation of those Sessional Orders. I believe that it is preferable to act in this manner than fbr a motion now to be introduced for their adoption in the Standing Orders as there are a number of other matters in abeyance which I trust will be resolved and which similarly may be introduced in the form of Sessional Orders and in that way be tried within the Parliament before they are finally adopted in the Standing Orders themselves. For that reason I seek leave to move a number of related motions.",46
65,Mr SPEAKER,SESSIONAL ORDERS,"Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted. Routine of Business Motion (by Mr Sinclair) proposed: That, unless otherwise ordered, on those alternate sitting Thursdays when Grievance Debate is thefirstOrder of the Day, Government Business, under Standing Order 106 or when General Business has precedence on the Notice Paper under Standing Order 104, so much of Standing Order 101 (routine of business) be suspended as would prevent Grievance Debate or General Business, as the case may be following 5. Ministerial statements, ter of public importance.",47
66,Mr SPEAKER,SESSIONAL ORDERS,I wish to make the comment that I believe that the practice of trying out new procedures by introducing them in the form of Sessional Orders before the Standing Orders are amended is a good practice.,47
67,Mr SCHOLES,SESSIONAL ORDERS,"The Opposition does not object to the motions as circulated. We agreed to the matters contained in them during the previous session. I would point out, however, that I think that there is a limit to how long Sessional Orders can be used as a substitute for Standing Orders. I think that the practice of using this method commenced when Mr Daly was Leader of the House. I see advantages in it but I do not see it as being a substitute for considering the actual Standing Orders and the changes to those Standing Orders which should be made on a permanent basis. Under these circumstances the House can agree to Sessional Orders and they can be subsequently allowed to lapse by a government without any consideration being given to them by the House-merel y by the effluxion of time. Another matter that I wish to raise with the Leader of the House (Mr Sinclair) at this stage is the question of the consideration of the report of the Committee on Committees and the broader recommendations of the Standing Orders Committee, which should be brought before this House during this session at least. Subject to the Parliament still continuing at that time, I hope that prior to the autumn session the Leader of the House will bring forward the necessary amendments to the Standing Orders to bring about the alterations which are acceptable to the House and which should be made. The Opposition does not object to these Sessional Orders being introduced at thistimebut considers that the trial period should not be too protracted. Question resolved in the affirmative.",47
68,Mr SINCLAIR,SESSIONAL ORDERS," Mr Speaker, perhaps I could incorporate the balance of the motions in one motion.",47
69,Mr SPEAKER,SESSIONAL ORDERS,The Leader of the House will have to seek leave to move the remaining four motions in the form of one motion.,47

72,Mr SINCLAIR,SESSIONAL ORDERS,"I move: Select Committee Reports by leave, and preceding 6.

Quorum-Coun t of Members (2) That, unless otherwise ordered, for the purposes of determining a quorum of members, a member who is in any of the lower galleries or officials'seats, behind the bar of the House or in either of the side alcoves at the time when the attention of the Speaker or the Chairman of Committees is called to the lack of a quorum or who remains in any of those areas after attention has been so called, shall not be counted to determine whether a quorum is present. Quorum (3) (1) That, unless otherwise ordered, if it appears that a quorum of members is not present following: (a) the repon by the tellers of a division of the House (Standing Order 44), (b) the counting of the House after a member has drawn attention to the want of a quorum (Standing Order 45), (c) the report by the Chairman of Committees that a quorum is not present in consequence of a report by the tellers of a division of the Committee or the counting of the Committee, and the Speaker orders the counting of the House (Standing Order 46 )the Speaker may, if he is satisfied that there is likely to be a quorum within a reasonable time, announce that he will take the Chair at a statedtime;if at that stated time there be not a quorum present the Speaker shall adjourn the House to the next sitting day. (2) That the provisions of this resolution have effect notwithstanding anything contained in the standing orders. (4) That, unless otherwise ordered, when successive divisions are taken, and there is first division, so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the division bells for the ensuing division being rung for 1 minute only. In response to the remarks of the Manager of Opposition Business in the House I say that I am quite sure that it will not be the sittings of the House that will preclude any debate later in this session on matters that relate to the Standing Orders. There was also in his remarks a comment regarding the report of the Committee on Committees. The principal difficulty has been the consideration of a paper which you have prepared, Mr Speaker, which back benchers severally have prepared and which the Committee on Committees has prepared as to determining the best manner by which legislation might be considered in this House other than that which is now provided for in the Standing Orders. I hope that that will proceed to the point where some trial Sessional Orders will be introduced with the agreement of honourable members and from that position we will then",47
73,Mr SCHOLES,SESSIONAL ORDERS,I hope that your will look at my submission to the Committee too.,48
74,Mr SINCLAIR,SESSIONAL ORDERS,"As I was saying, from members on both sides of the House. I hope that we will then be in the position where we can at one time introduce all the amendments to the Standing Orders. The reason that these proposals are being moved as Sessional Orders at the moment is because it is thought to be preferable that there be only one new printing of the Standing Orders. I hope that the others can be adopted during the course of this session. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA Discussion of Matter of Public Importance",48
75,Mr SPEAKER,BRITISH MIGRANTS,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr of Willis) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for disserious cussion, namely: The atdtude of the Fraser Government as exemplified the statements of the Minister for Primary Industry regarding British migrants. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required ceases, the Standing Orders havingrisenin their places-our",48
76,Mr WILLIS,BRITISH MIGRANTS,"The Opposition has raised this matter for discussion today Division Bells because it believes that this Parliament should consider at the earliest opportunity the appalling display of xenophobia exhibited by a senior Minno intervening debate after the ister over the past week and a half. In a series of speeches, television and radio appearances and newspaper articles the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Sinclair) has vented his prejudice against British migrants who engage in trade union affairs by blaming them for the dire economic straits into which this country is steadily sinking. In making these sinister accusations he has been undeterred by the complete lack of evidence to support his charges and apparently is in no way bothered by the thought tnat he may be fanning the flames of racial discord and intolerance, which could have devastating implications for a multi-racial society such as Australia is today. However, the Minister has not simply identified the problem as he sees it. He has, in his typically constructive and thoughtful way, proposed solutions to it. He strongly implied that Australian citizens of British origin who get themselves mixed up in strikes should be deported. He said: Their interests are not Australian, their origins are not Australian, and one wonders whether action should not be taken against them. The clear implication there is that he thought deportation should be applied. One of his more Neanderthal back benchers has since suggested that such deportations should be to the Soviet Union. On further consideration the Minister has recently proposed another solution, that migrants not be allowed to stand for trade union office until they have lived in this country for a number of years. The Opposition is disgusted and alarmed that a senior Minister should be allowed to parade his fascist fantasies with the apparent approval of the Government he represents. Furthermore, his claim that he has had amazing support from his parliamentary colleagues for what he has been saying elevates this matter beyond the rankings an individual Minister to the collective view of the Government parties. That is an extremely development in this country, but not altogether surprising. Indeed, it can be seen as the logical development of a campaign of by scapegoating that his Government has been pursuing with increasing vigour as the economy collapses around it. As unemployment escalates to increasingly record levels, as innation continues at double figure rates, as economic growth by as farm income declines alarmingly, as international reserves run down and as the value of the dollar is greatly depreciated, Government is becoming increasingly desperate and in its desperation is increasingly anxious pin the blame for its abysmal failures on the trade union movement. Minister after Minister is reported in the Press as blaming the unions for the plight of the nation. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in parunions ticular fulminates periodically about the need more legislation to control them. In conducting this vigorous and energetic campaign of buck passing the Government has been entirely undetotally terred by the fact that the official evidence strike activity was showing, and continues show, a very substantial decline in the level strike action. The first statement by a Governfor ment spokesman in recognition of this fact came from the Minister for Employment and trial Relations (Mr Street) when he was not in Australia but in Japan. In addressing the JapanThe Australia Society in June he was unable to resist the temptation to boast about the extent to which his Government had reduced industrial dispuseen tation in this country. He said that, if the event of the Medibank national stoppage was excluded, thetimelost due to industrial stopsought pages in 1976 was the lowest since 1968 and that in the March quarter of this year the time lost was the lowest in a March quarter for 5 years the number of employees involved lowest in 10 years, all of which, of course, is true. He was also unable to resist assuring the Japanese audience that the amount of time lost in industrial disputes in Australia was generally less than that due to industrial accidents. also was true but had not been said by any ter in Australia up until that time. But it was being said at that time in Japan, not here. As all this seemed to be running rather counter to the Government's developing union bash level. campaign we on this side of the House were interested to see which view would predomifaction nate-woul d the Government ignore these Just figures except when placating foreigners whom wanted to invest here and pursue its union denimigrants gration campaign or would it change course, blaming the unions and emphasise its record reducing industrial disputation? But the Governtor ment has had no trouble in coping with this organisation quandary. It simply incorporated the decline industrial stoppages into its extremely short of achievements but continued full bore with union bashing campaign. Thus the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm has twice in the last 2 weeks managed to accuse the unions of wrecking the chances of economic Party, recovery and in the course of the same this boast about the substantial diminution in the level of industrial disputation. This absolutely to blatant attempt to score both ways on the industrial relations issue vividly exposes the paucity of this Government's response to the abysmal economic mess it has created. Unable to abandon the ideologically appealing approach to blaming the it simply continues that line whilst also for emphasising a totally contrary argument. Admittedly it is only the Prime Minister who has perfected this technique. Other Ministers are either disregarding the decline in industrial of disputation, as is the case with the Minister for to Primary Industry, and bashing unions with of increasing vigour or, in the case of the Minister Employment and Industrial Relations, a heavy emphasis is being placed on the figures to Indusshow what a good job he is doing. spate of attacks on British migrants by the Minister for Primary Industry last week cannot, therefore, be viewed in isolation. They must be as a crass extension of the general union rare bash campaign to a particular section of the trade union movement. But why has the Minister to extend the Government's campaign in this way and to do it with such unbridled vigour? In our view it is not simply a matter of him being andan enthusiastic supporter of the Government's was the anti-union campaign. There is another factor involved, and that is his own gross failure as a Minister in the eyes of the people he supposedly represents-the rural That community. The fact is that the farming comMinis-munity is increasingly impatient with his Government's failure to improve its lot, and well it may be. The Bureau of Agricultural Economics has forecast that in 1977-78 real farm income will decline by 14 per cent from its already low Whole sections of rural industry are being increasingly vocal in regard to their dissatiswith this Government's performance. over a week ago at the time the Minister for it Primary Industry launched his attack on British Mr Barry Cassell, the Federal Director stop of the National Country Party, announced he in was leaving that job to become National Direcof the Cattlemen's Union of Australia, an that has been trenchantly critical of in the Government. The statements Mr Cassell list made on leaving the National Country Party its showed that he was far from satisfied with its performance in government. An article in the Fraser) Melbourne Ageof 8 August 1977 stated: The retiring Federal director of the National Country Mr Barry Cassell, yesterday attacked the party for speech to ' forgetting its basic ideology'. Mr Cassell said the NCP had given too much attention the mining industry at the expense of beef producers. 'Australia's cattlemen have had a gutful', he said. 'The party has forgotten its basic ideology and needs reminded of the plight of the cattle industry'. The fact that the ex-Federal Director of the National Country Party is disenchanted with Government regarding its rural policy and regards it as being too concerned with the mining industry at the expense of its traditional porters gives some idea of the extent of dissatisregard faction that exists in the rural community with the Government and in particular with the Minsimplistic ister who is responsible for policy in that areathe Minister for Primary Industry, the man who has been so vocal lately. It is surely no coincidence that that Minister's sudden insight into the cause of our economic problems and his frenzied attempts to spread the message over the last week or so occurred conparticipation currently with the revelation of major dissatisnot faction with his performance within his own Party. Nor did his rantings about the British ease cut any ice with those who understand problems and are concerned to see policy inpower itiatives undertaken to solve them. I quote from an article which appeared in the Melbourne/ige of 15 August. It stated: The Federal Government should stop bashing the and the British, a leader of the beef industry said yesterday. The Nauonal director of the Cattlemen's Union, CassellThe man who just over a week ago was eral Director of the National Country Party. . . Said the negative approach should be replaced by positive policy initiatives. Mr Cassell resigned as director of the Nauonal week ago to take up the cattlemen's post. His criticism of the Government is a directreferenceto political storm created last week by the National Country Party Deputy Leader, Mr Sinclair. So there we have the ex-Federal Director of the National Country Party just over a week ago publicly saying that this campaign of denigration of the trade union movement and the British should stop. Mr Cassell's comments demonstrate the patheticness of the Minister's campaign against British migrants. His comments were clearly motivated by the desire to be seen to doing something to help the farmers. But, as Cassell said, it is totally negative and totally ing in positive policy measures to assist the rural industries. But it is not just a matter of buck passing negativism. These comments may well have a put decidedly harmful effect on community relations opinion in this country. My colleague the honourable to member for Melbourne (Mr Innes) will elaborate on this point. But I make the point now that we on this side of the House are greatly conto becerned that for narrow political purposes a Minister is prepared to make comments that promote racism in this country. The cheapest political the response to any problem is to blame some section of the community. But when that section is narrowed to a racial group and totally unsubsupstantiated sweeping allegations are made into them, one is playing with fire, particularly in a multi-racial society such as ours. Such notions can be attractive to people who are desperate to find solutions to our problems and eager to believe that those problems are all due to some group. If that becomes a widespread belief then the basis for racialism, discrimination and perhaps worse is established. Furthermore, by calling for deportation or discriminatory treatment for British migrants because of their in trade umon affairs, the Minister only offends the British born but all the non-British migrants who are made to reaUse that disthey are still regarded as different from rural Australian-born citizens by some people in and therefore liable to be denounced or discriminated against. I remind the House that there are three million migrants in Australia and one mUUon chUdren of migrants. That is a large unions section of our community. All of them must have been deeply disturbed by the events oflast week. Mr Barry For some it would have been an uncomfortable reminder of what unscrupulous politicians in the Fed-Europe were saying 40 years ago. The Minister's statement also demonstrates colossal ignorance of industrial relations. He Party a assumes, as do aU his coUeagues judging from their public statements, that strikes occur be the cause evU-minded union officials or shop stewards are trying to disrupt industry simply for political purposes. The Mmister and his colleagues never stop to think-if they do they never acknowledge-that two sides are mvolved in industrial relations and that a high level of strikes indicates bad industrial relations but says nothing about the cause. As we have been talking about the British disease, so described by the Minister for Primary Industry, I refer to an article which be appeared in a German magazine Der Spiegel on Mr 1 August. The article assessed the view of Gerlackman managers of German companies operating in Britain of the situation in England. It states: and German managersrepresentingtheir firms in England have a quite different picture of the 'English Disease'. They major blame on their English manager colleagues. In the of the German managers, if the English worker is correctly approached he is willing to work. I stress those comments. The German managers stressed that in their opinion it is their English manager colleagues who are to blame for the industrial relations problems in that country. article goes on to make the point that the GerJuly man manager in Britain sees poor management, inadequate investment and insensitive industrial relations as the cause of the so-called British ease; not the British workers or their unions. for God's sake let us realise sides to industrial relations. I think the GovernAs ment's campaign of denigrating unions because of strikes totally misses the point. Of course, the dispute Government is not interested in discussing the point that there are two sides and that if one Packers simply union bashes this may have extraordinary negative reactions and adverse effects on the itforseems community. This point has been picked up by tonsPapua Rydge's magazine which recently reported a loaded. It seems study of industrial relations in the by a woman who turned out to be the daughterDeniliquin.

They are minded trade union officials operating there that management was largely the cause. Rydge's meat in my message. Let me state again what the magazine went on in that article to state: Union bashing may be all very well for election purposes but its real danger is that it thoroughly confuses the industrial relations in this country and contributes mony and lost production.",48
77,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BRITISH MIGRANTS, unfortunately Order! The honourable member's time expired.,51
78,Mr SINCLAIR,BRITISH MIGRANTS,"It is unfortunate that the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr identified Willis) in pursuing his epithets and cliches and trying in some way to answer a cause which knows is lost, has really not identified and acunion cepted the consequences and the implications the narrow application of the statement which made in five sentences at page 5 of a fairly plex speech relating to some of the problems primary industry. The speech was made in a pursuing small country town; in a veryrichagricultural region it is true. It was made following the entation of a publication by the Bureau of AgriChile. cultural Economics concerning June trends. that article the Bureau estimated that the real income per farm was expected to fall by as much as 14 per cent during the next 12-month period. From that I went to analyse some of the factors which were contributing to low incomes for farmers. Among those factors-it was not the only one- I identified a spread of industrial disputes. At the conclusion of my remarks I shall table this document which sets out industrial disThe putes as they affected primary mdustry from 1 1976 to 30 June 1977. It is an appalling list of incidents where, not as a result of industrial disputes but, in many instances, peculiarly politidiscally based attacks, there has been a disruption So of income which should be flowing back to prithat there are two mary producers. if that were not enough, only today I have had a report that in thericeindustry there is a between the Federated Storemen and Mill Union and the Federated Millers and Employees Association, as a result of which that 1100 tons of baggedricedestined due New Guinea and a cargo of 20 000 to be loaded at Portland will not be that the bans will cause sigPilbara region nificant unemployment Echuca and rice growers who whom honourpurport to union the but ones who are suffering. That, of course, was I said. There are a number of factors which prejudice the recovery of the Australian economy. As reality of far as the rural sector is concerned, there are a to disharnumber of consequences of industrial disputes, among other factors, which are prejudicing the level of income for those who are at the moment amongst the lowest in expectation has generally in average weekly earnings. It is in those circumstances that nobody wants to deny that there are factors which we need to do something to correct. I have not peculiarly one sector. I shall come back to the Briin tish disease in a moment. What I have done is he say that there are communist Australian trade leaders. I have referred to radical left wing of trade union leaders. Many of them are supported I and fostered by members of the Australian comLabor Party in this House and elsewhere in of Australia. These people are intent not just on industrial action but on pursuing political action which, for example, has led to a compresplete embargo on the shipment of wheat to I am told that today Chile is one of the In principal markets of East Germany. So apparently communists on the other side of the world are able to take advantage of the market but not the Australian wheat growers. The end product is not that Australian labour in any way receives a benefit, but that the individuals who are being led by the nose find that they have fewer job opportunities. That is really the background hind the statement. I made. It also needs to be said that there are a number of factors within the trade union movement don't about which we need to be concerned. Of course it is not peculiar that I have referred to the disease. That is not something original. It has been referred to by many august around Australia and around the world. I point out to those on the other side of the chamber pretend that I am saying something racist and pursuing a vendetta against all British migrants, that that is arrant nonsense. In fact, many British migrants left Britain to come here to escape same shop stewards who they find, to their regret, have followed them here. In fact, most British migrants have contributed the welibeing of this country. They have been the lifeblood of this country. The honourable memI work ber for Gellibrand suggests that I have said 'Deximately port them'. I did not say that. speech. I did not say that. At no stage have I said that they should be deported. What I have said is stillInare that there are a few things that can be done They within the trade union movement.",51
79,Mr YOUNG,BRITISH MIGRANTS,What? Deport them?,52
80,Mr SINCLAIR,BRITISH MIGRANTS,I will be happy to answer that question. I hope that one thing which will happen is that more Australian trade unionists will start participating in trade union affairs. I hope that they will participate not just in registering a vote but in seeking an appointment within the hierarchy of the trade union movement.,52
81,Mr YOUNG,BRITISH MIGRANTS,What about shareholders?,52
82,Mr SINCLAIR,BRITISH MIGRANTS,"Even though the honourable member who is now interjecting does not agree, he realises that the fractionalising of the Australian trade union movement which has taken place as a result of the intervention of British shop stewards, has been rejected by many of those who are significant Australian trade union leaders. Let me quote from The British Disease by Professor G. C. Allen, Emeritus Professor of PoUtical Economy at the University of London. Amongst other things, he stated: Trade unions and management should abandon their present obsolete institutional arrangements and learn countries where industrial relations are harmonious. He was referring to Britain, and he said a deal more; but the problem is not peculiar to tain. I could refer to a good many more authoriworkers ties. It is interesting, for example, to refer to Fred Nicol, the Federal President of the Storemen and Packers Union. In an article in the Sun on 3 September 1976 he blasted some shop stewards: beEngUsh migrant workers as being disruptive and antagonistic towards the union. He said: They have their own peculiar independent attitudes and try to slot in with the rest of the workforce . . . They insist on telling us all about England, how good it is British there and how to run industrial affairs. They have become some of the biggest disrupters we have authorities ever encountered. So, this is not something that has been said who peculiarly by me. Indeed, many British migrants have written to me, communicated with me, and said that they too are concerned. It is true that the British disease does not exist only in the trade the union movement, but it is important that we register its effect in the trade union movement. One letter I received from a gentleman in Vicenormously to toria stated: in an industry, which, in Victoria, employs appro5000 people, and at least 90 per cent of all shop delegates are of British origin. Only a handful are Australian or He read that into a Maltese. our industry 'pommie' shop stewards have been and the biggest thorn in the backside of management. are the most militant, most uncompromising, and most meddlesome pack of people we have ever known. The extent of our problem has been so bad that at one stage we had a complete embargo on the hiring of anyone of British origin. I am endeavouring to point out to the honourable member for GelUbrand that these remarks are not racist in origin; they are not union bashing, much as he likes to use that phrase. Rather, they are intended to identify some of the problems within the Australian community which need to be corrected if we are again to establish Australia as the sort of country it was pre-1972, before he and his friends and colleagues made a mess of it. If the honourable member thinks that the remarks I made are without support, I suggest that he look at a poll that was conducted by Channel 7, Melbourne, last Thursday and Friday, when 26 321 people voted in support of my remarks and 11 305 voted against them. Even witlun the hierarchy of the trade union movement there are people who very strongly support the remarks I made. It is important that we reaUse that the remarks were made in a narrow but very pertinent context. In 'An Overview from of the Problems of Migrants Workers'- a paper deUvered by Dr June M. Hearn in an industrial good relations program at the University of MelBribourne in July 1976-sh e mentioned the Ford strike in Victoria in 1973 as a graphic Mr Ulustration of union leaders being completely out of touch with their rank and file, who were mainly southern European.

She also said: Similarly, in the same industry in South Australia in the early 1970s, migrant (predominantly British) involved in repeated unofficial stoppages and alleged acts industrial sabotage. The 'pommie shop-steward stirrer' stereotypethese are not my words; these are Dr Hearn's earner wordshas been grossly exaggerated but, in some industries, ticularly the metal trades, the incidence of Britishers as delegates is quite marked, especiaUy in regions of heavy grant concentration, for example, the La Trobe Valley Victoria. Many British migrant unionists, unencumbered a language barrier, familiar tions and practices in Britain and often schooled in system that relies heavUy on strong shop-committee ation, have been responsible for a substantial mUitant into the Australian trade union scene. Dr Stephen Haseler, a British Labour member of parliament and the author of the book The Death of British Democracy, in his seventh Sir Robert Menzies Lecture in Perth said: Britain's decline as a nation coincided, maybe not reason, with theriseof the socialist generation. There we have the link with the philosophers the Left, and there are many others. Let  tor of the New Statesman magazine, who visited Australia last year. He said that the main of Britain's current economic ills was the monopoly. He said that unionists were so entrenched in key industries that they could wages to the level where viability threatened and in some cases destroyed. Mr Johnson said the same structures and practices trade unions existed in Australia and there no reason why we should be immune to the individual developments that have afflicted England. Tragically, so manyremarksof this kind haveAustraha been made that it is important for people to alise that these practices are pernicious. Theyindustrial affect industrial harmony and they do affect  New Statesman: The tragic truth is that British socialism has tating case to make out against postwar union leadership. Men ought to be judged by their record, and their record contemptible, smug and self-assured, oblivious of any cism. They have encouraged British industrial workers in habits and attitudes, in rules and procedures, in Ulusions fantasies, which have turned the British working the coolies of the Western world and Britain into a stinking bankrupt industrial slum. I hope, as we all do, that the British economy recover, but those who see the harmful effects some elements of the economy equally need to be listened to. The Chairman of the Fabian movement has said: The direct total social gain from industrial action was not merely negligible, it might well have been negative. Neither in this country nor anywhere elseworkers were he was speaking of Britainof have trade unions been able to increase the share of wages and total national income. The increase in money wages has been frustrated by rising money prices. These rob the wage or his wife of the expected gain. Frustration and anger are the result. The indirect loss due to the resultant worsening of the balance of payments and the enforced slow-down parof expansion was on the contrary immense. The crocodUe job tears shed by some about the fate of the low paid workers, mithe unemployed, the sick and the old is surely disingenuous. in It is trade union action which through wage induced price by movements has created the basic problem. with simUar trade union institua union Tragically, there is a British disease. The British organisdisease does not affect everybody. The British input disease, as I have spoken of it, affects a few. It affects a few employees and a few in management. It is one of those elements which unfortunately have contributed to the rundown of the British economy. I hope that the British economy is on the mend and that the optimistic forecasts of the British High Commission will be realised. without But my concern is not with Britain; it is with Australia. My concern is with the effect that of industrial lawlessness has had on the incomes of me the Australian community, on the maintenance ediof industrial harmony and on re-employment in this country. The former Labor Treasurer, the cause honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr union Crean), shortly after his appointment as Treasurer remarked that one man's pay increase raise can well be another man's job, and how perof industry was tinent that is. of The whole reason for the campaign that I have was been conducting is not to damn any one but to talk about those factors which have prejudiced economic recovery and are delaying re-employment in this country. If is to recover we need to generate new re-employment opportunities. We need to muumise do lawlessness. We need to ensure that both management and trade union members coordinate and co-operate to regenerate this country so that those who are at the end of the had a devasline, such as the farmers Irepresent,are not totally disadvantaged. There is no doubt that the is few words I spoke in five sentences at Tanunda critinearly a fortnight ago have echoed around every and town, village and community in Australia. They class into have won enormous support, and they have won support because they identified a basic problem. It is only the few; but, if we can correct the probwill lems that those few have generated, I believe of that our whole economy will be regenerated in a way which will contribute towards the realisation of what the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) will put forofficial ward in his Budget Speech tonight.",52

84,Mr INNES,BRITISH MIGRANTS," I rise port the matter of public importance raised by the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis). It is obvious that the Minister for Pri- 'desperate mary Industry (Mr Sinclair) is unrepentant force government about the deliberate, outrageous, vile, detestable He attack he made on workers in this country, in reasonable particular migrant workers. claimed that the speech was made to a small group of people in a country town, but copies of the speech were put into the Press in the Press Gallery in Parliament House and therefore it was meant to get the publicity it Further, the Minister quoted a statement Hearn as supporting his stand. In the Melbourne . Sun on 11 August an article appeared under headline 'Sinclair gets a blast. Produce facts-ex pert'. The Minister has not produced any today. His claims have been biased and unsubrelease-i stantiated. Dr Hearn is quoted as saying, amongst other tilings: All Australians would do themselves a lot more credit they examined the causes of conflict rather than tish migrants. She is further quoted as saying: Austraha can ill-afford to fan the flames of racial That is what Dr Hearn thinks about the Ministive ter's remarks. I will have a few words to about all these people the Minister has won to his side in a few moments. This is the acdon of desperate individual whose long history of vicious union bashing is well known. The depths of degradation to which he and his coUeagues wiU sink in order to take the heat offthe ment for its abysmal faUure to add up as a government are hard to imagine. Having weaking ened the economy-deUberatel y wrecked it-an deliberately created record unemployment ever, levels, they are now callously and deliberately imposing the burden of their inadequacies on the backs of workers-in parucular, migrant workers in this country. This phoney attempt to shift the blame from the Government is being exposed day after day by people in the community who are demanding that the Government get on with the job. The outburst by the Deputy Leader of the Nauonal Country Party has brought to the Ught of day the evil and vicious intent underlying the Government's tactics in this matter. He talks in terms of having the support of individuals in country organisations. But my friend, the honourable member for GelUbrand, referred to Mr CasseU who was, until a few days ago, an of the National Country Party. He made certain remarks in the newspaper Stock and Land. I wonder how much support the Government and in particular the Minister is getting from the Catdemen's Union of Australia which to sup Mr Cassell now heads. He said: The union has been militant, favouring direct action. . . . Mr Cassell has said that his union represents men' who regard militancy as the best weapon to action. said: 'If things are not going well and we do not get a response to our pleas, we will be forced to be far The Minister has more aggressive. That could mean withholding stock from the market and in fact other forms of direct acdon*. boxes I wonder what category Mr CasseU would come into? If he happened to be a British migrant, did. would he be sought out for special attenuon? I by Dr wonder whether he would be deported. the - To ensure that Mr CasseU's statement is - regarded as taking the Minister to task about his facts union bashing, let me quote from a Press t is not a comment-signe d by Barry Cassell and dated Sunday, 14 August 1977. He talks about Tuesday night's Budget as an opportunity for the Federal Government to reduce the if burden on countiy Australia. He said that to do blame Brithis, 3 key elements are necessary, including redistribuuon away from country people of some of the unfair costs of controUing innation. The tension. third point he makes is that there should be posipolicy initiatives to replace negative British say and union bashing. What Mr CasseU thinks about the actions and the ravings of the Minister a is well denned in his statement. The Minister's tactics are a desperate attempt to hoodwink the Australian people; to take the minds of people off the further attack that undoubtedly will be Governmade on the Uving standards of Australian workers in the Budget to be delivered this evenby the prince of posers, the Treasurer (Mr d Lynch). The tactics are doomed to faUure, howbecause the people of this country have had enough of this Government's incompetence and dishonesty. Mr Sinclair has not proved his aUegations that the British disease, whatever that is, has been imported into Australia, nor has he said who imported it. On the contrary, the figures show the real position. Let me state the position in respect to the working days lost and show how die position deteriorated in 1977. The number of working days lost in 1976 due to industrial action represented 70 per cent of the total figure. In 1975 it was 45 per cent and in 1974 it was 40 per cent. It is interesting to note that this represents less than 1 hour, 57 minutes and 12 seconds, to be precise, for each member of the work force. More working days are lost in Australia due to the common cold. Mr Sinclair has not proved argument because he cannot prove, any more than the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) any of his Ministers can, that there has been inordinate amount of industrial unrest in Australia. The Prime Minister cannot prove cause the facts tell a different story, as I dicated. But it suited Mr Sinclair to pick out phrases that he found temporarily appealing and to voice it about the countryside. It is an old nique of taking a lie or a half truth and repeating it ad nauseam in the hope that some people might find it convenient to believe it. Mr Sinciair has certainly managed to flush out the fascists our society.",54
85,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BRITISH MIGRANTS," been Order! Is the honourable member quoting from material? If not, he should refer to the able member as the Minister for Primary Industry.",55
86,Mr INNES,BRITISH MIGRANTS,"It is the old technique of taking lie or a half truth and repeating it. This has done by the Deputy Leader of the National Country Party. He thought that the deportation of a few British unionists would solve the probstill lem. But this was not enough for some ofhis folbeen lowers. He gathered around him all these elister ements in the community. One of these followers was interviewed on the television program This Day Tonight last week. She thought that deportmigration ation was not good enough. This wealthy Sydney dowager, Lady Braddon, thought that the penstand alty should be something more final. She did not want to say what she meant by that, but plainly she was implying something along the lines shooting being too good for them. That is the of situation that is created by the irresponsible statements of the Minister. Migrant workers, in particular British migrant workers, are being sought out for special treatment. They will have the threat of deportation hanging over their heads like the sword of Damocles. This is what is happening. It is designed to create tame cat unions so that they are easy prey for the people who support this Government. The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr MACKellar) who will follow me in the debate must dissociate himself from the remarks of the Minister for Primary Industry. On the issue of deportation, he has to guarantee migrants in this country that the threat of deportation will not be used as a weapon against individuals. The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs shakes his head. He has an obligation to do as I suggest. Mr MACKellar-Do not get excited. his Mr INNES-It is not a matter of getting excited. The patronising way in which the Minisor ter answered a question I asked him this afteran noon about citizenship is indicative of his attitude. For instance, I nope that the deportation it besections of the Immigration Act are not have inimplemented in accordance with the wishes of some the Deputy Leader of the National Country Party. I hope that the Minister will not exercise techhis discretion in the way he did when dealing with the representations of an Italian worker, Mr Salemi, who is still under threat of deportation, notwithstanding that three High Court judges inin dicated that there had been a denial of natural justice and that the other three High Court judges were of the opinion that Mr Salemi had treated unfairly and that the concept of natural justice did not apply in the administrahonourtion of the Minister's decision under the Immigration Act. The Minister must stand up and be counted. He has to say that justice will a apply. In the case of Mr Salemi, I wonder been whether the Minister can guarantee a reference under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act which has been passed but which has not been proclaimed? I believe it has not proclaimed because Ministers like the Minfor Immigration and Ethnic Affairs want to write into the legislation sections which would not preclude the operation of section 14, of the section. I also want a guarantee that this will not happen. The Minister must also up and assure migrant workers in this country that this legislation will not be used as a bludgeon to batter them into submission and of make them pawns in the game of chess played by sort the employer organisations represented by honourable members on the government benches.",55
87,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BRITISH MIGRANTS,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,55
88,Mr MACKELLAR,BRITISH MIGRANTS,We have just been treated to a typical performance by the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Innes). Mr Jull-It was not much good.,55
89,Mr MACKELLAR,BRITISH MIGRANTS,"As the honourable member for Bowman says, it was not much good. He characterised his speech by the use of emotional and high-flown phrases. Let me remind the House of a few of them. He claimed there had been an attack on migrant workers-ther e has been no such thing; union bashing-ther e has been no such thing; evil and vicious intent-ther e has been no such thing; and ravings. The only ravings I heard this afternoon came from the position members when they talked about what the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Sinclair) meant by his statement in a speech he made rethis cently in South Australia. I want to deal with one thingrightat Both the speakers for the Opposition have reiterated the untruth that the Minister Industry talked about the deportation of migrants who have taken part in union activities. The Minister clearly refuted that statement, but that did not deter the honourable member for Melbourne one iota. He spent half his speech it talking about the deportation that he claimed the Minister for Primary Industry had talked about. The fact of the matter is that the Minister for mary Industry never talked about deportation. should like to make one thing perfectly clear the Opposition, to listeners to the broadcast these proceedings, to migrants in this country and to the House: The Migration Act 1958 conmagnificent fers power for the deportation of persons who have not become Australian citizens in certain defined circumstances. In summary, those powers can be invoked only when a person granted permanent entry, not having become constituent member of the Australian compolitical munity, has been convicted for crime, or subject to therightof appeal to a commissioner, on grounds of unsatisfactory conduct generally. There is no intention to change that situation. Obviously, all this talk about the deportation people taking part in union activities of the imagination of the Opposition. It is deliberately trying to frighten migrants by this talk of deportation. I have just read out the gration Act 1958 and how it is administered. Mr Innes-It is your responsibility. It is discretion. Do not hide behind the Act. Give your guarantee.",55

95,Mr MACKELLAR,BRITISH MIGRANTS,"I am denying itrightnow. I should like to move to the subject of migration because that is my area of responsibility. I think is appropriate that I should talk about the matter of public importance as it affects migrants, particularly British migrants. It is a simple matter Priof fact that people from the United Kingdom I and Eire have formed the backbone of the to immigration program for many years. More than of one and a naif million British migrants have come to Australia since 1947 and have made a contribution to the development of Australia. That has been acknowledged by this Government and by the Minister for Primary Industry. As with many migrants, British migrants have played a big part in Australia's a postwar progress and in our economic, social, and cultural development. As the largest migrant group, it is not surprising that British migrants have risen in prominence m many areas of Australian activity-in the professions, industry and commerce, politics, the academic world, the of arts, sport, employer organisations, trade unions is a figment and the Public Service. We have a pohcy, which has been pursued by Misuccessive governments, of saying that when people come to make their homes in Australia they should bring to Australia the good things of your then* country of origin and leave behind the us negative aspects. This has been brought up by the Mmister for Primary Industry in a number of over the past few weeks. It must be obvious to everybody that with an influx of over three million people since the end of the Second World War some of the migrants from various countries-no t one particular country-wu l not fit into the Australian scene as well as the majority. The vast majority of migrants from all countries to the distinctive Australian industrial relations and the poltiical and cultural scenes and have helped in their evolution. I should Uke to pay tribute to the migrants from over one hundred different source countries throughout the world for the contribution they have made, are making and will continue to make. Their impact on the work force has been considerable and critical to the success of many The latest detailed occupational figures I come from the 1971 census. At that time the number of persons employed was 5.24 million, of which 541,000, or 10.3 per cent, were born the United Kingdom and Eire. The emphasis on the role of the overseas born in industry tends obscure the fact that the overseas born in general and the United Kingdom born in panicular have enriched our level of skills in all occupations. example, at the dme of the 1971 census per cent of the United Kingdom and Eire born males in the work force were in professional, technical and related occupations, compared the with 8.7 per cent of the Australian born male work force. At that time 2.5 per cent of the United Kingdom and Eire born males were was engaged as skUled metal and electrical tradesin men, compared with 1.7 per cent of Australian It the born males. This trend is evident also in other skiUed areas. At that time 2.4 per cent of United Kingdom and Ireland born males were ment engaged in carpentry and woodwork, compared to Australia. During with 1.7 per cent of Australian born males; 2.1 the lowest number of the per cent of United Kingdom and Ireland born males were engaged as bricklayers, compared with 1.1 per cent of Australian born males; and Yet 1.3 per cent of United Kingdom and Ireland born males were engaged as trademen painters, compared with 0.6 per cent of Australian born males. These statistics overwhelmbrought ingly confirm the significant role that British grants have played in the Australian work force. It is a continuing role which this Government and, I am sure, the people of Australia recognise and appreciate. A more recent survey of the work force which was carried out by the Australian Bureau of Statan istics in November 1974 examined the edunational cational status of the civilian labour force. Of all the United Kingdom and Ireland born males 43.7 per cent had post-school qualifications, is, a degree, diploma, trade certificate, et cetera, compared with 28.8 per cent of aU overseas born, 32.6 per cent of the Australian born males and special 34.4 per cent of the total male work force. It absolutely hypocritical for this Opposition to in this House that it supports migrants. It is a fact on. that under its administration the numbers of British migrants coming to this country whelmingly reduced. One of the first actions took as the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs was to go to the United Kingdom in May last year, which was thefirstvisit by a Minister of the Fraser Government to the United Kingdom, to reassure them that Australia did not- I emphasise these words-hav e an antipathy towards the British migrants but that in fact we welcomed j have them. I repeat that it is hypocritical of the total honourable member for Melbourne, the honourable member for GelUbrand (Mr WUUs) and in members of the Opposition generaUy to claim here, with their hearts on their sleeves, that they to are defending the British migrants. That is absolute nonsense. By their actions they shaU be known. Their actions were significantly against For British migrants coming to Australia during the over 10 time of theu* adrninistration. Obviously an attempt is being made to paint Fraser Government as anti-migrant. It is not anti-migrant; in fact, it is pro-migrant. This can be demonstrated quite easUy and conclusively. It the Labor Government which disbanded the Department of Immigration and incorporated it Department of Labour and Immigration. was the Fraser Liberal-National Country the Party Government which set up the new Departof Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. We have increased the number of migrants coming Labor Adrninistration migrants since 1947 came to Australia. What a record to be proud of that is. here we hear the Opposition pretending to be concerned about migrants. It is anti-migrant; and it has always been anti-migrant. A number of additional measures have been in by this Government. The family mireunion conditions have been broadened. Additional to occupational categories entrepreneurs and smaller entrepreneurs have been brought in. We have had special Indo-Chinese refugees projects, special arrangements for the migration of Lebanese, amnesty for Ulegal migrants, the aboUtion of re-entry visas, the establishment of ethnic affairs branch, the estabUshment of the accreditation authority for interpreters and translators, migrant resource centres, the estabUshment of the Australian Population and that Immigration Council, the Australian Ethnic Affairs Council and the estabUshment of a permanent broadcasting authority which provides a broadcasting service to cater for the rights is of ethnic radio.

Also included in these proposals are changes of an administrative nature following cisions of the Adnunistrative Appeals Tribunal and the High Court of Australia. In view of the numerous reports involved, I do not propose to detaU the contents of each of the proposals.

The excise tariff proposals I have just tabled relate to a proposed alteration to Tariff 1921. These proposals formaUy place before Parliament, as required by law, a tariff change introduced by a Gazette notice on 30 June 1977 and which, with effect from 1 July 1977, increased from 4.3c to 10c per tonne, the excise duty on coal, not being the property of a State or brown coal produced by open cut methods. The excise duty is applied to the Coal Mining Industry Long Service Leave Trust Fund set up under the States Grants (Coal Mining Industry Long Service Leave) Act 1949 administered by my colleague, the Minister for Employthe ment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street).

I have noted in reading, from overseas but sources, related to this matter that there seems be a fairly strong suspicion that the Internauonalpared Fund for Agricultural Development was estabtries. lished as a concession to pressure from developshort ing countries especially for the initiation common fund as part of a new internauonal economic order. It is suggested by leaders of some developing countries, perhaps displaying similar bent of mind and a cynicism which is doubt the product of so many frustrations and disappointed hopes at the hands of promises scarcely fulfilled by developed countries, that concession was originally initiated singer to buy off pressure from the spokesmen for the developing countries. In any event, it does seem that there is a considerable degree of scepin ticism among many of the developing countries over just how helpful the Internauonal Fund for Agricultural Development is to be in terms of massive problems which confront developing countries today. There has been a great deal of disillusionment in the world about aid for developing countries and what is going to be achieved. I must confessfallen to some disenchantment myself. I remember when I came into this Parliament some 16 yearswidening. ago that there was then so much hope as to what could be achieved if only the rich countries increase would make the appropriate sacrifices to allow redistribution of command over resources to benefit the developing countries. All sorts of optiredistributed mistic speculations were put forward about whatwealthiest could be achieved and how the poor countries could be released from their imprisonment within poverty. It was common then to talk about the one per cent decade of development. At the end of that period, one per cent of the gross national product of the developed countries was to be contributed to the developing countries for their needs. Some 16 years later the most we can achieve according to the official statistics on development aid from developed countries is an of 0.36 per cent of one per cent of the national products of those developed counOf course, there is quite a range of contribufrom various countries providing aid but it disappointing to note that two particularly As strong economies, Japan and the United States of America, are contributing respectively 0.24 cent and 0.27 per cent of gross national prodin the form of official development assistance the two fundsto developing countries. Mr Fife-They have now undertaken to do",59

The elusive one per cent connotribution for the development of the underdeveloped countries is as elusive now as it ever was, if not even more elusive. The poorest countries are the staying that way while the wealthiest are getting by Dr Kismuch wealthier. Between 1965 and 1975 the immense disparity per capita income between the poorest nations and the developed nations worsened. The oorest nations, that is countries with less than the 200 per capita have 43 per cent of the world's population. The developed nations have 25 per cent. In 1965 the poorest nations had a per capita income of only 3 per cent of the $4,200 per capita income of the developed nations. By 1975 the per capita income of the poorest nations had to 2.7 per cent of the per capita income of the developed nations of $5,500. The gap is The increase in income for the poorest nations in that period was 15 percent against the for the wealthiest nations of 31 per cent. This is another means of dramatically illustrating the way in which resources in the world are being and allocated to the benefit of the countries. The poorest stay poor while the wealthiest get much wealthier. Projections for 1985 show that the increase in incomes for the poorest countries will be about 20 per cent to approximately $180 per capita. For the wealthiest developed nations the transfer increase will be 47 per cent to $8,100. In other words, by 1985 the poorest countries will have per capita income only 2.2 per cent of the per capita income of the developed countries. can see that it is a losing race for the developing countries. The gulf is widening to their disadIn vantage in terms of the level of resources they able to command from those additional mobilised resources being made available in the world each year. What it means is that at the most the annual increase in the per capita income for the poorest countries will be between $ 1 all sums up to a most depressing picture. There has been much talk, not a litde posturIt ing, a great deal of moralising and, frankly, very little achievement in terms of settling for the goals and solid results which have been set the future and spoken about so much. The poorest countries are still bedevilled with the most depressing social and economic conditions. Compared with the developed countries the infant mortality rate is 8 times higher. The life expectancy rate is one-third less than for the developed countries. The adult literacy rate is per cent less. The nutritional level for one person in two is below the acceptable standards of developed countries. Millions of infants have less protein than is required to allow the optimum development of the brain. It is this sort of aid to poor countries which Premier of Queensland, steeped in ignorance and indelibly dyed in bigotry rails against. does it in the most poorly informed way. He demanding that the sort of aid Australia prodevelopment vides for developing countries should be made available within the country. I am disappointed that the Minister for Foreign Affairs has firmly rebuked him, perhaps with some subtlety, but nonetheless he hasfirmlyrejected the sorts comments he is making which I suspect are ing some public currency at least in Queensland. What the Premier of Queensland has to realise the extent to which aid programs are funded from our overseas reserves. They have no impactredistribute on the domesdc economy. Therefore, it is irrelof evant for him to talk in the terms in which he been talking. We are not denying people within this country resources which would otherwise available. To the extent that aid programs take the form of various goods fabricated in this country, to back on those programs would mean simply that people currendy in employment producing them would become unemployed. If it is the Premier's argument that the moneys should be spent the domestically all it means is that there would of resources from one industry in which people are employed fabricating various goods a for aid programs to another industry. All he is doing is transferring unemployment within the One community. He is making no contribution towards the common welfare of the community. fact, at atimeof slack economic activity Uke are the present a most powerful argument can be in support of the fabrication of more goods in this country as part of an aid program. In that way apart from the humanitarian commitment in this support of aid more opportunity and $2. Itwould be provided domestically. is incontestable that programs Uke those before us are helpful but they are Umited in their help. I have already indicated that for all the for years in which we have been talking about the breakthrough in our determination to lift the poor countries out of poverty, as members of the wealthy club of countries in the world we do not seem to have achieved much. In fact, it would seem on analysis of what has been achieved that what we have been doing has, in effect, been very 60 much like ploughing the sea. As I mentioned, we have achieved a situation in which development assistance aid from the developed countries is still only 0.36 per cent of gross national products. The most advanced countries in the Western part of the world, the United States and Japan, have consistently deplorably poorrecords.One would the have thought that out of enUghtened self-interest they would have much to gain from a more He generous commitment to aid. Those 2 countries is have deplorably poor records of commitment in aid programs. It is clear the more one analyses the available material that the rich countries are determined to stay that way. I happen to think that the countries witlun the of Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries gainwhich were responsible for the substantial increase in the price of oU were responding to a is set of perfecdy understandable circumstances. There was an opportunity for them to seek to in their favour some of the resources the world from the wealthier countries. I know has the argument that the less developed countries have suffered as a result of this action. I shaU be come back to that later. It is not as black and white as the critics of the action of the OPEC countries would Uke to make out. I am sceptical cut about the genuineness of the claims of the people who make this assertion. By and large they do not have a powerfulrecordof assistance to poor non-oU-producing underdeveloped countries in past. It seems more that they are using a conbe avenient symbol to protest theu concern at the treatment which has affected them as rich tries. In any case, the rich countries were some sort of redistribution of resources to the OPEC countries as a result of that action. It clear that the rich countries have taken a numberkeeping of measures which have over a relatively short time effectively reduced the real benefits of redistributional exercise by the OPEC countries. I harbour the strong suspicion that one of the reasons America is prepared to bear with a sub-go stantial balance of payments deficit is some effort to inflate its way out of real cost of oil bill. The problem with the development of the underdeveloped countries as I see it is that prohave viding aid of this sort is merely a litde superficialfor dressing aimed to cover over some deeply seatedtive problems in the world economic order. It meansthe relatively little-the fact that relatively little been achieved by programs so far is evidence that-in terms of the nature problem. I should be much more impressed if I could see determined action by the developed countries to accept more of the manufactured finished products of the developing countries. find something repugnant about the symbiotic relationship that so many of therichcountries like to postulate as the proper relationship tween themselves and poor countries whereby they accept the primary products and raw materials of the poor countries and the poor countries accept theirfinishedproducts. It is clear that the greatest advantages lie those countries which are industrially advanced and continuing to develop, the countries with technological know how and the industrial resources behind them. That is where the greattries. est proportion of value added in the economic order is derived. At the level of primary duction and the production of raw materials the worth of value added in the production system much lower. Until the developed countries are prepared to accept more of the finished manufactured products of developing countries, I am afraid we will continue to hold the poor countries as hostages to poverty. The current problems which this country is facing as a resultern of our trade relationship with the countries of the Association of South East Asian Nations-w e sell twice as much to them as we buy from them-ar for evidence of the sort of prickly political problems that will confront us in the future. In the longer term we could easilyfindthat because of the tough and uncouth attitudes expressed by Auschange trahan Government spokesmen we will become increasingly irrelevant to the needs of those neighbours as they develop more industrially. counThe problem with this Government is that, as to sufferone interprets its behaviour towards ASEAN countries, it is a disciple of the economic prinis ciple of unequal development- a euphemism for all we have and trying to force a few sales on to those who are less well off. It is a thatremarkable principle of economic development for the needy that this country postulates quite firmly and quite inflexibly that aid by trade will from the less developed to the developed-for to make instance, from the ASEAN countries to its Australia. I do not underrate in any way at all the very great political problems in this country at the presenttimein attending to this issue, or the very difficult economic considerations which to be weighed up; but that is no justification the rather crude way in which our representaat the recent ASEAN discussions put down representatives of those countries like an has Australian Bjelke-Petersen with an imported ofnasally Oxford accent. He spoke well even if he and depth of the thinks poorly. I There is not so much a need for a proliferation of gimmickry and new organisations; so I have some reservations about the development of a benew one, the International Fund for Agricultural Development. As I read the Bill, it seems that what is proposed there can be well done by established agencies. In fact, the Fund will be calling on the services of established agencies. In other words, we need more, and more effective, with aid through existing agencies. We need a freeing of the trade barriers which hold down the level theof economic growth and the standard of living which can be provided in the developing counThe wealthy countries collectively should commit themselves to providing grant assistance proand much less assistance by way of loans. We have a good record in that respect at least. The isdeveloped countries should accept a moratorium on the debts of the underdeveloped countries incurred in previous loan commitments. We ought to play as influential role as we can, in the appropriate international agencies, to that end. We have to recognise that the paradigm of Westcapital intensive development is not the best for the poorest countries. I acknowledge in this respect the important influence of the Minister e Foreign Affairs in Papua New Guinea in encouraging the Papuans and New Guineans and the Australian Government, which was the colonial administrator of the then Territory, to the emphasis from an almost exclusive preoccupation with capital intensive developnear ment to one which tended to develop towards equal emphasis for labour intensive activity within the economy aimed at mobilising more traditional forms of economic activity. The evidence from the developing countries, especially of Africa, is clearly that, whilst on paper one country can look extremely impressive in terms of the economic growth rate it is achiev-resources ing and the per capita income that is achieved this way, when an analysis is made, in some rigorous depth, of how that income is distributed the country is found to be quite poorly off. It poorly off in the sense that some elites, some working class and middle class elites, are estabrepeat lished, who are able to earmark for their own benefit the largest proportion of the benefits coming from that development, whilst on the other hand there is a very large dispossessed group of people who are coming from traditionalGovernment village life into the cities and the large urban centres and are unable to obtain employment, and they become alienated and of social problems and stresses for that sort of area. As against that, one can look at another country. I confess freely that I have been enorgo mously impressed with the achievements of Tanfinished zania in this respea. On paper it has not had spectacular economic growth rates and certainly it does not have terribly impressive per capita levels of income, but in terms of mobilising all the people into the work force and providing opportunity for them-providing a place under the sun, as it were, for all the people-it has enormously successful. Perhaps it displays some rather disciplinarian, if not authoritarian, methods which are unacceptable to us, but I remember Mr Nyerere pointing out clearly to this country, at a luncheon in this building, thatsort the principles for social and economic developthere ment in a country that is relatively poorly endowed with economic resources, as Tanzania is, are quite different from those of wealthy coun-this tries such as this one. Australia, for instance, afford the massive blunder of an F111 aircraft the part of a government, involving some countries millions of dollars-in fact, hundreds of millions of dollars-and can absorb that sort of problem without significant economic disruption and location. A poor country cannot afford that exconstrained. pensive margin of error. The wealthy countries have to dedicate themways selves to stable prices for commodities and, again, to a better revenue deal for the developingin countries. The two things do not necessarily together. The common fund is the sort of conceptnational I have in inind, with all the problems it has-an it certainly bristies with problems-in terms of a stable price system for the commondities of the developing countries. I am highly suspicious of the newfound interest of the Americans. I am concerned that perhaps the Americans are considering that there are clear benefits for America in terms of stable prices for some of the mineral that she would wish to import. That is infair enough as long as the commitment does not stop there; as long as it goes further and is a genuinely altruistic commitment for the common is good of mankind and is designed to establish a common fund program for other commodities. I that I acknowledge freely the enormous problems with which this concept bristles, but the fact that a concept or a proposition bristles with problems is not sufficient justification for being caught flat-footed as the Australian was recently in international discussions on this subject, leaving the clear impression that we were not terribly interested in the present all sorts concept at all. I mentioned the need for a better revenue deal for the developing countries. Only 10 per cent of the total value added for their products, as they through the various processes to end up as products in some sort of manufactured or processed form on world markets, goes to the poor countries. That happens because the marketing and the processing of these products is in the hands of the wealthy countries. Again I acanknowledge the problems of overcoming this situation. I am not so much concerned about the conbeenspiracy interpretation of the transnationals, as they now seem to be called, but rather the enormous problems of developing the technology, the marketing skills, the techniques, the outlets and so on which are necessary to overcome the of problem I have identified. The fact that are such problems is not sufficient justification for not trying to do something. The developing countries ought to be encouraged to move in direction through support from established caninternational agencies. The fact that such a small onproportion of total value added goes to the poor means that their opportunity for capital accumulation is extremely Umited, and that in turn means that their opportunity for industrial disdevelopment and economic growth is seriously A further point that we have to consider is in which developing countries can be facihtated to reinvest the profits which are generated their countries. It is a matter of the most nogo torious comment that some large, wealthy interorganisations are responsible for intendsive capital investment in certain development projects in some developing countries that provide limited employment opportunities but quite massive profit returns and that a very large procountries portion of those profits is drained out of the country to the benefit of the parent company the internauonal concern. There has to be a determined bid, as a matter of common sense morality, to allow a substantial proportion of the pronts generated in such countries to vested by those countries in their own economic growth and development. I shall have to condense some final points that I want to make on these matters becausetimeis running out. Why I find a sense of urgency about these things is obvious. I mentioned a few utes ago that, as much as wealthy countries like to vaunt what has been done in terms of aid cent decades, the evidence is that the gap in terms of living standards between the wealthy advanced countries and the poor countries is fact widening. I admit that the income per capita is improving in the poor countries, but it improving most moderately and extremely will unimpressively compared with the rate of mcrease in the living standards of the developed countries. I noted quite recently a United Nations report have that pointed out that the foreign direct investunderwrite ment in 43 developing countries in 1970 was $ 1,610m and that in the same year the outflow of But income as repayment on accumulated past plete investment was $5,340m. Those are the sorts of cepted, disabiUties under which the are staggering. The terms of trade move so often very much, inasthe to punish the developing countries. cording to a report I read recently, developing countries indicated that they could import 6 tractors for the return from 25 exported rubber. In 1965 they could import only 3w tractors for the return from 25 tons of and exported rubber. So the terms of trade do tend move against these countries. There when they move in their favour, but it seems the long term trend certainly is not in their and certainly bears poor contrast with pens to the developing countries. Let us look at the sort of debt burden that crippling them. In 1967 it was $50.7 bUlion for 86 developing countries. In bUUon. The debt servicing in 1975 on that debt burden was $11.5 bUUon. The official ment assistance aid from the developed countries was only $9.4 bUUon. So with an allowance for aU the aid provided for them they were still than $2 bilUon in deficit. That is an example the ever expanding problem offinancingtheir way in their striving to achieve a better standard of Uving, to achieve economic development and at 8 o'clock. to try to close the gap between the developed and themselves. It is a striving that continues to faU and it will continue to faU while the or wealthy countries of the world are so determined not only to hang on to what they have but also to redistribute as much as they can from the increase in the level of resources provided in the be reinworld each year to then: own benefit. I do not believe that our record in recent discussions has left the developing countries of the world with any sense of enthusiasm that they can any longer rely on Australia as a friendly, sympathetic and understanding nation where the asminpirations of the developing countries are concerned. Our attitude to the common fund and the in renew international economic order was one of total unenlightenment. I sincerely trust that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who in so many in other ways displays a quite encouraging Uberal enlightenment in these sorts of things and a great is sense of moral and humanitarian responsibUity, assert himself in relation to this issue and demand that the proper role of Australia is one of sympathetic understanding, of support and of a constructive approach to the problems which I acknowledged several times already are there in trying to develop a common fund and a new international economic order. unless something like that is done and a comrecasting of our approach to development and the needs of developing countries is acI am afraid that we are gomg to continue developing countries to languish situation where what we do is In 1960, acflow with a fork.

109,Mr LYNCH,INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. In doing so, I present the Budget for 1977-78. At the outset tonight I re-affirm the Govern- in jobs. ment's basic objectives. Our first goal is to maintain the underlying trend to lower inflation. Our second goal, which is dependent upon the achievement of the first, is to promote moderate and non-inflationary growth in order to create jobs and reduce unemployment. This Budget will move Australia further towards achieving those goals and, in so doing, it will build on the foundations laid by last year's Budget. Over the next twelve months the depths of Labor's recession, and all of the community hardship that went with it, will be put further hind us. Tbis Budget is designed to give a lead to the community by addressing itself directly and realistically to our remaining problems. One way in which it does so, in a decisive and unprecedented manner, is by lifting the yoke of taxation that has sapped the spirit and initiative of the community over recent years. Unlike our predecessors we believe that taxes have taken too much from the community and that people now want greater charge of their own affairs. The new tax system which I shall announce in this Budget has been made possible because of the efficiency and economy that we have brought to management of Government expenditures. The way is now open to get Australia on the move. This Budget charts a course towards lower taxation, towards conservation of the nation's great energy resources and towards care for those most in need within the community. It maintains the thrust towards economic stability without sacrificing any of the major social reforms of ourfirstBudget such as the family allowance system. Australia's destiny is a shared responsibility, not something that lies in the hands of governments alone. Responsibility also lies with business leaders: it is the private sector that employs most of our Second Reading workers, makes most of the investment decisions and develops the technologies that can underpin (Budget Speech) increasing living standards. Union leadership bears an equal responsibility: it is the trade union leaders who have to consider the unemployment consequences of their demands for higher pay for those presendy All sections of the community must work together to harness our abundant natural and human resources, if we are to restore vigour and purpose to our national development. This Budget sets the nationfirst;it recognises that there must be a fair sharing of the burdens and responsibilities, and a fair sharing of the rewards. NA I turn now to the record of achievement last year. The Government'sfirstBudget was a key elbeement in putting the overall economic strategy in place and, therefore, in the improved economic performance of 1976-77. We budgeted for outlays to grow in 1976-77 at half the rate of 1975-76, and for a Budget deficit nearly one billion dollars lower despite the costs of full personal tax indexation from 1 July 1976 and significant business tax incentives. An increase of 10-12 per cent in the broadly defined volume of money, M3, was then foreseen as appropriate over 1976-77. A year later, the Government takes some satisfaction from the record. Budget oudays, projected toriseby 11.3 per cent, were held to only 10.4 per cent, and for the second successive year outlays were contained within the original Budget estimate. The deficit, originally put at $2,608m, emerged because of some shortfall in receipts as $2,740m, but nevertheless very much in line with the original estimate. M3 increased by 10.6 per cent-wel l within range projected. The anti-inflationary role of external policy was, in the event, less than had been hoped. The burden of Labor's pohcy failures on the export and import-competing sectors made devaluation inevitable. But, because of determined action by the spending, Government, overall policy was not blown off course and the basic strategy was maintained. Naturally, the economy is still adjusting devaluation. Indeed, understanding of that cess is essential to any appraisal of where the economy now is and where it is heading. The wages area also failed to contribute as much to recovery as it should have done. This outcome, beyond the Government's conthe trol, had serious consequences for the recovery and the creation of new jobs. The economy has still not fully attained pre-conditions for sustained growth. Solid progress has been made, but furthering still hinges crucially on the prospects for and income shares. On that, I said last yean 'Provided there is significantly less than flow-on of price increases to wages, an improvement of several percentage price performance, and a possibly somewhat greater deceleration in money wages, can had in 1976-77 as a whole.' Prices, and to some extent incomes, did develop in that way. Excluding health and medical services-price of which have been sharply influenced changes in health insurance arrangements having nothing to do with inflation as such-the Consumer Price Index rose by 10.2 per cent the course of 1976-77 compared with 15.4 per cent in 1975-76. More broadly-based price indicators rose 1976-77 by some 4 to 6 percentage points less than in 1975-76. Productivity increased by 3.6 per cent in problem. 1976-77; the profit share rose to 14.4 per from 13.5 per cent in 1975-76. Company profits increased by 23.5 per cent. Although the pattern within-year was foreseen, activity for the year as a whole was much as foreshadowed. the Real gross non-farm product rose for the year as a whole, with growth concentrated in the private sector. Consumers spent more, and saved less, out of disposable incomes. Business investment, although patchy, strengthened in total; plant and equipment in particular, rose by 6 per cent in real terms. Dwelling investment rose strongly for the year as a whole despite some slackness-no w being to taken up-in the later months. Exports were also significandy higher for the adjustment proyear as a whole. As presently recorded, economic growth was concentrated in thefirsthalf of the financial year. Among the reasons for that pattern, which are fully discussed in Statement No. 2 attached, was effect of devaluation-actua l and anticipated speed of - o n thetimingof expenditures. The key point now is that the factors depressthe ing demand and production early in 1977 were temporary ones. it The forward momentum of private activity is innationnow beginning to re-assert itself. Inflation over the year as a whole fell much as expected a year ago. full Wages costs also grew less fast in 1976-77 than in 1975-76, but the slow-down was less than points in had been hoped. That is closely linked with the major disapbe pointment of 1976-77-the continuation of high unemployment. largely This is a matter of grave concern to the Government. s Unemployment is a human problem-it is not by just a question of statistics. It is precisely because of the social and family overtragedies that go with unemployment that we have pressed, to the fullest extent, for wage and salary restraint in hearings of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. in The grave imbalance between real wages and productivity resulting from the 1974 wage explosion still remains Australia's major economic cent That problem can only be solved by winding down real wages relative to productivity; while it persists, it makes all talk of quickly reducing unnot as employment merely hollow rhetoric. Statement No. 2 presents some material on the extent of this imbalance. In the most recent National Wage Case ing the Commonwealth has presented related evidence. The Commission must be prepared to face, with a greater degree of reality, the employment consequences of its decisions. The basic point is this; if unemployment Australia is to be tackled effectively, wage distortion in our economy will have to corrected. High labour costs have been deterring emappreciable ployers from taking on new workers. All too often, the sums favour the alternaundertaken tives-replacin g men by machines or switching foreign suppliers. Partly for the former reason there was an ap-reductions. preciable lift in measured productivity in 1976-77. A 3.5 per cent increase in product saw only a slight employment increase; and, with labour force, unemployment therefore increased. There can be no doubt that, had the wage determination processes permitted real wages decline in 1976-77, recovery would have been stronger and unemployment less. Instead, so far from having declined, been repeatedly asserted by our political opponents, real wages were actually higher June 1977 than a year earlier. Those fortunate enough still to have jobs their real incomes improved, but at the cost throwing others out of work. Those trade union leaders and others clamourIt ing for 'full indexation' might reflect on that result of their actions. So might our arbitral tribunals. NA STRATEGY FOR 1977-78 This Budget is dominated by two not just frittered away. fundamentals. First, despite the achievements to date, we have some way to go in restoring the preeconomy. conditions for lasting economic growth. 1977-78 must see a further advance. Secondly, our policy strategy established last year and since maintained has been the right one. That strategy must be held in place. Our Budget decisions will give effect to objective, stated last January, of further reducing the deficit. hearThis will permit an expansion in a broadly defined money supply to take place in 1977-78 at a rate a notch or so lower than in the previous year. Our Budget decisions will also give effect to our other budgetary objective stated last in January-to keep Budget oudays in 1977-78 to the real within zero real growth. be We have been mindful, however, of the shortterm dislocations that might have followed any reduction of real outlays at this time. It is a measure of the painstaking preparation this year that we have been able to toshape the Budgetfirmlywithin the parameters of our economic strategy, while accommodating the cost ofboth last year's and this year's major tax Fiscal and monetary policies must be fully supported by the other arms of policy. a growing Wage restraint is crucial. Externally, Australia's now clearly strengthening trade account provides an encouraging basis to for the current role of external policy. There is a mutual dependence between the domestic and external arms of policy which as has should be explicidy noted. In shaping its fiscal and monetary stance for at 1977-78 the Government has had this well in mind. Fiscal and monetary laxness such as the hadbenches opposite have urged upon us would of undermine our internationalcompetitiveness. This Budget rejects that pitfall. will thereby contribute to a more positive outlook for the major development projects now under way and in the offing and their associated investment inflows. In short, it will help to ensure that the favourable effects of last year's devaluation, now increasingly appearing, will be preserved and Against that background let me say something stillabout the role of the private sector in our It is now up to the private sector to respond to the brighter outlook which is in prospect. As we have emphasized, a re-vitalized private sector is essential to increased productivity and morejobs. Governments can only do so much; this the Government has consistemly pursued the course of making way for expansion of the private sector. It is now up to the private sector to play its part in furthering the progress we have made towards establishing, and building upon, the pre1977-78 conditions for economic recovery. I turn now to oudays. In 1977-7S total expenditures are estimated $26,656m, an increase of 10.5 per cent tually the same increase as in 1976-77. I mention some of the larger provisions Budget; details of these and other provisions set out in Statement No. 3 and other accompanyof ing Budget documents and in Ministerial statements. NA Outlays for social security and welfare purposes are estimated to total about $7,250m in 1977-78, an increase of about 13 per cent on year. These outlays now account for 27 cents in every $1 spent from the Budget, or 56 cents in every $ 1 raised in personal income tax. Social service pensions and benefits are adjusted six-monthly in line with the Consumer Prime Index. Accordingly, the standard or single social service pensions and benefits will be increased by $2.20 to $49.30 a week from the first payday in November. The combined married rate will rise by $3.70 to $82.20 per week. There will be a further increase from payday in May 1978 in line with the movement m the Consumer Price Index in the second half 1977. These increases are estimated to 1977-78 and $490m in a full year. Repatriation Benefits Repatriation disability and service pensions also will be increased in November 1977 and May 1978 in line with increases in the Consumer Prime Index. These increases are estimated in 1977-78 and $61.5m in a full year. The Government has decided to the Sustenance Allowance and replace it by a Loss of Earnings Allowance, and to modify existing arrangements concerning pensions related pulmonary tuberculosis. Assistance to Handicapped People Special assistance for handicapped people in is estimated at $93m, an increase of 33 per cent on last year. OUTLAYS This is one of the fastest growing programs in the Budget; it demonstrates that, the need for expenditure restraint notwithstanding, this at Government is concerned to assist the underor virprivileged members of our community. At present an allowance of $15 a week is payin the able for a severely handicapped child. are We are extending eligibility for similar grants up to $15 a week to parents or guardians on low incomes who are experiencing nnanciai hardship in caring for a substantially handicapped child. Aged Persons'Accommodation An amount of $50m is provided for expendilast ture on aged persons' homes and hostels in 1977-78, $7.6m more than last year. Children's Services This year we are providing $73m for children's services, an increase of $6m on last year. Pensions Unemployment Benefits movements in ment and sicknessinclude The estimates $787m for unemploybenefit payments this year. It is the Government's aim to see that these rate of funds go to the genuinely unemployed. It has become evident that the present arrangement of paying two weeks' unemployment benefit in advance is resulting in persons who have secured employment being paid unemployment benefits as well, producing a very substanthe first tial overpayment in aggregate. After considering the recommendations in the of Myers Report, the Government has decided that in future unemployment benefits will be paid cost $ 182m in fortnightly in arrears. Review of Social Security Systems As already announced, an overall review of the operations of the Department of Social Security is being carried out with a view to implementing improvements in the Department's present systems and procedures. The Department's programs now involve to cost $25.3m expenditures of the order of $6 billion annually and significant savings are expected to result discontinue from the review in 1977-78. Assistance to Aboriginals to Although Aboriginals have access to normal Commonwealthfinancedservices and benefits the Government strongly supports special programs of assistance for Aboriginals. In the Budget we are providing $110m for expenditure on non-administrative activities of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. Overall expenditure on programs of direct assistance to Aboriginals in 1977-78 is estimated to be about $176m, compared with $161m in 1976-77. NA The Budget provides for Commonwealth increase expenditure of $2,371m on education in ority 1977-78, $21 lm or 10 per cent more than last year. Late last year substantial general increases were announced in student allowances and benefits; these increases were effective from beginning of 1977. Some living and boarding allowances will be further increased from the begmning of 1978. NA At $2,814m, expenditure on health care in 1977-78 will again pre-empt a large slice of Budget outlays. Payments of Medibank benefits in 1977-78 are estimated at $ 1,494m. The estimate of $942m in payments to the last year. States under the hospital cost-sharing agreements during 1977-78 reflects an expectation of finance firm cost containment in public hospitals. Under the Community Health Program the Commonwealth is providing substantial financial assistance for some 700 community health projects. In 1976-77 $70m was provided under this gram; this year, based on the Commonwealth contributing SO per cent of capital costs and 75 per cent of recurrent costs, expenditure estimated to exceed $79m. The Commonwealth will be suggesting to the States that, witlun this increased allocation, a higher priority be given to the funding of women's refuges. As recently announced, new nursing home arexperiment. rangements will take effect from 1 October. Rates of benefit payable by the Commonexpected wealth and the Hospital Funds will higher rates in each State from that date. The effect will be that the benefits, when combined with the statutory patient contribution, will cover fees payable in respect of 70 per cent of patients in non-government National Health Act nursing homes compared with 30 per cent at present. NA The Government is determined to improve Australia's defence capability. Total outlays for defence activities in 1977-78 are estimated at $2,343m, and imply an increase of about 1 per cent in real terms. In a Budget in which total outlays are estimated to decrease slightly in real terms, this is evidence of the continuing high priwhich this Government attaches to defence. In particular, further progress is to be made towards achieving the important objectives for capital equipment and facilities outlined in the Defence White Paper presented to Parliament the by the Minister for Defence last year. NA Expenditure on Australia's overseas aid programs is estimated to mcrease by 12 per cent, from$380min 1976-77 to $426m in 1977-78. NA NA Welfare Housing In 1977-78 $390m will be made available to the States for welfare housing, $15m more than I shall refer later to the associated question of for private housing. Defence Service Homes Some $22m will be provided for the Defence Service Homes Scheme; repayments of earlier loans and proceeds from property sales are Proestimated at $72.6m, making a total of about $94.6m available for the Scheme in 1977-78. In 1977-78 an application fee of $75 for an iniis tial Defence Service Home loan will be introduced; an application fee of $50 will be charged for an additional loan. Housing Allowance Voucher Experiment Last year, I announced our decision in principle to undertake a housing allowance voucher Field activity to implement the experiment is to get under way at the first sitebe set at Melbourne-lat e in 1977-78. About $ 1 m is provided for this purpose. Growth Centres and Decentralisation The Budget provides $15m for decentralisation purposes, includmg growth centres, in 1977-78, comprising $5m for Albury-Wodonga, $3m for the Bathurst-Orange and Macarthur growth centres, and approximately $6m for a new program of support for general decentraliswide ation initiatives. TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATION the Budget Speech. Postal and Telecommunications Services The Australian Telecommunications Commission's capital program, although larger than in 1976-77, will be funded mainly from the mission's own internal resources and from local borrowings; drawings from the Budget are estimated at $65m in 1977-78 compared with $215m in 1976-77. It is expected that the Commissions will be able to hold basic postage and telephone charges in 1977-78, for the second year running. Nor is the Government proposing, as is sometimes suggested, to re-introduce broadcasting and TV receiver licences. Some more minor licence fees are, however, to be increased: radiocommunications licences will be increased, for some classes of users, from a year to $25 a year, effective from 1 October 1977, and the fees payable by some licensees of commercial radio and television stations are also to be increased. As already announced, $475m will be prowithout vided to the States for road works in 1977-78. Other large expenditures in the transport area include: $55m to meet expected operating losses of the Australian National Railways Commission; a further $33m towards financing the Comin mission's capital program, including conternational tinued construction of the standard gauge railway between Tarcoola and Alice Springs; $5 lm in assistance to the States for urban lic transport projects, including $5m projects-th efirstsince 1974; $8m for land transport planning and research; and $23m for Tasmanian Freight Equalization. Light dues levied on shipping to recover cost of providing coastal navigation aids are to be increased from 35 cents per net registered per quarter to 41 cents from 1 October 1977. The Government has decided not to increase the level of air navigation charges this year. NA In recognition of the depressed outlook for the farm sector the Budget continues to provide for a range of rural industry support activities. Details are set out in Statements attached to Here I mention some of the larger provisions: $53m to facilitate rural industries' adjustment to changing circumstances; Com- $31.4m for wool research and promotion; $ 15.1m for the continuation of the Brucellosis and Tuberculosis Eradication Campaign; $40m for continuation of the superphosphate subsidy; and $I2m for continuation of the nitrogenous fertilizer subsidy at its present level, the proposed review of tnat level from 1 January 1978 being postponed. Rural Bank We have now approved in principle the establishment of a national rural bank, preferably tak$20 ing the form of a refinance institution. We see the new bank complementing existing credit facilities and we intend to hold discussions in the near future with major lending institutions concerning appropriate structural and funding Transport arrangements. We shall press forward with these dicussions delay. NA NA Export Development Grants The Government is concerned to assist all exporters, particularly through further reductions the rate of inflation, thereby improving the inand services.competitiveness of Australian goods As well, direct assistance of $30m-a n increase of $5.9m-is included in the Budget for export pubmarket development grants to encourage firms for new to seek and develop overseas markets. The whole question offinancialincentives to exporters has been referred to the Industries Assistance Commission for examination; meanwhile the Government is not proceeding with the legislation foreshadowed in 1976 to reduce the benefits and payments under the Scheme. ton Industrial Research and Development Grants The Budget provides $14m for payments of industrial research and development grants in 1977-78. Coal Research To finance increased coal research the Government will levy 5 cents a tonne on coal >roduced in Australia in the ! evy will have effect from midnight tonight and is estimated to provide $3.4m this year. NA The Government acknowledges the seriousness of the present unemployment, especially among young people. As well as the personal pressures on those unable to find work, there is also a tragic waste the nation's resources. For these reasons the Government special importance to its labour market training programs. In addition to the general training assistance available the Government is making increased revision this year for programs aimed E ancing employment prospects for young people. These include the recendy introduced ComBudget munity Youth Support Scheme, the Education Program for Unemployed Youth and the Special Youth Employment Training Program, all of Services. which are now proving their worth. The Government is broadening this assistance by extending the Special Youth Employment Training Program to young people under 25 ary restraint,Despite years, to take effect immediately. All told, the Budget provides ployment training programs this year, an increase of 33 per cent over last year. Even that very large increase will be surpassed if it is necessary to do so: we will not allow budgetary situation to inhibit grams or our capacity to offer training to people who meet the necessary labour market criteria. We intend also to approach the States to an early Commonwealth-State conference on the need to upgrade work skills in the community and to consider the adequacy and utilization existing resources for training. NA The Government has decided not to set a specific immigration program for 1977-78 but determine in-take on the basis gible applicants. Assisted passages will be available for some 16 000 people, about the same number 1976-77. NA An amount of $137.3m is to be appropriated for the Australian Broadcasting Commission in next three years; the 1977-78. As already announced, the Government has decided to establish an independent authority to provide ethnic broadcasting services and, at a later date, possibly other specialized services. The proposed appropriation for the provision of the ethnic broadcasting service in 1977-78 is $1.9m. Spending on Australia Council programs is of estimated at $24.4m in 1977-78, an increase of 10 per cent over spending on comparable proattaches grams last year. Following a review of Commonwealth involvement in sport, we are providing $lm in 1977-78 for expenditure on national sports development and assistance; we are also at enestabhshing a Sports Advisory Council. NA An amount of $ 19.6m is included in the to maintain legal aid services in 1977-78 at their present levels; an additional $3.8m is being provided for Aboriginal Legal Aid NA NA the need this year for overall budgetthe Commonwealth has maintained its policy of relative generosity to State $ 102.7m for emand local governments. In line with the offer made by the Prime Minister at the Premiers' Conference in July, provision has been made for the States to receive the $4336.lm under the tax sharing arrangements in our traimng prorespect of 1977-78. I note that this is over $90m more than the estimate of what the States would have been enseek titled to under the tax sharing legislation. The generosity of that increase should certainly enable the State governments to frame of constructive Budgets which avoid putting up their indirect taxes and charges. As part of this offer State tax sharing entitlements in future years are to be determined as a proportion of the preceding year's personal to income tax collections, excluding special surof numbers of elicharges or rebates. The precise percentage to be appUed in later years has still to be settled but with this change as in much firmer estimates of tax sharing entitlements for the year ahead will be known when Commonwealth and States' Budgets are being prepared. The Commonwealth's offer represents a net increase of$621 m, or 16.8 per cent, in States' tax sharing payments in 1977-78. With Loan Council programs and the special grant to Queensland recommended by the Grants Commission, total general purpose payments to the States are estimated to increase by $685. lm, or 14.0 percent, in 1977-78. Local government authorities' share of personal income tax collections will be $165.3m in 1977-78,18.1 per cent more than last year. Total general purpose and specific purpose >ayments by the Commonwealth to States and ! ocal authorities this year will amount to about $10 billion net. NA NA The Commonwealth is continuing to exercise firm restraint in general government expenditures. Staff Ceilings Since 30 June 1975 the number of public serfor personal vants in employment areas covered by staff ceilings has fallen by about 12 500. The staff ceilings now set for 30 June 1978 other energy resources. imply a further reduction of over 3000-o r about 1 percent-during 1977-78. Civil Works A total of $375m is provided in the Budget for expenditure on new and existing civil works projects in 1977-78-leavin g aside Darwin, where the rebuilding program is nearing completion, expenditure is estimated to increase by $ 14m. The Darwin Reconstruction Commission is to be wound up on 31 December and the Departbelief ment of Construction will take over responsiincomes. bility for outstanding works. The National Capital Development Commission will have a cash allocation of about $197m for civil works expenditures in Canberra this year, $6m less than last year. With the move towards self-government in the Northern Territory, a global allocation has been included in the Budget for expenditure on those functions transferred on 1 January 1977income to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. Provision is made in the Budget estimates increased revenue from Northern charges; the details are to be determined in consultation with the incoming Legislative Assembly. Provision is also made in the estimates for increases in rates and charges in the Australian Capital Territory. NA NA In each of the past two years we have succeeded in keeping actual outlays below the original Budget estimates. We aim to repeat that performance again in 1977-78. In so doing we shall again demonstrate that we meant what we said about restoring fiscal responsibility and restraining the previous runaway growth in government spending. NA I come now to receipts. Our revenue measures embody two principal considerations. First, we see an over-riding need to reduce the burden of income tax so as to restore incentive effort. Secondly, we have focused upon the pressing need to conserve and develop our crude oil and Again, as in 1976-77, there are no proposals in this Budget to increase duties on beer, or on spirits, or on cigarettes and tobacco. Personal Income Tax As I said at the outset, this Government is unremitting in its determination to rein back the growth in the public sector for a number of reasons, not the least of which is its fundamental that Australians should be able to determine to a greater extent how they spend thenThe more successful governments are in the exercise of economy in their expenditures, the more scope they have for reducing the burden of taxation on their citizens. Our success since taking office in reducing the Territories rate of growth in expenditure by the Government has made it possible for us to reduce the exof $50m cessive level of personal taxation. Ourfirststep towards reform of the personal tax system was to introduce last year full automatic indexation to prevent effective rates of for personal income tax from increasing purely beTerritory cause of inflation. We thus accomplished, in ourfirstyear of office, a reform that was initially set down for introduction over a three year period. As a result of tax indexation the Government has forgone revenues in 1977-78 of about $965m system. on top of the $990m forgone last year. But the inescapable fact is that, irrespective the positive benefits of tax indexation, present rates of personal income tax are too high. The present tax scale is not is having devastating effects on incentive and the will to work. Given our conviction that decisive measures are required, we now intend to give effect to our own tax philosophy and, once and for all, to repudiate the high tax policies pursued by our political opponents. Accordingly, we are introducing a much improved and simplified tax system that will provide very substantial benefits to taxpayers at income levels. The new measures represent the most revoluI tionary change yet made to Australia's system of income tax. The essence of the new system lies in the establishment of one tax rate as the basic rate of taxation for the vast majority of taxpayers. The essential points of the new tax system are: The so-called 'general concessional rebate'which gave the misleading impression that taxpayers were receiving a benefit which did not in reality exist-wil l have no further relevance in the new system. The tax threshold will be raised to $3,751 (from the rebate equivalent of $3,154) and no individual with an income below that level will pay tax. Dependant rebates are, however, being already retained, so that the effective for a taxpayer with a dependent spouse will be $5,485. A standard flat rate of tax of 32 be established on all taxable incomes over $3,750; this rate becomes the basic tax of the system. A surcharge of 14 per cent will be imposed that part of taxable income between $16,000 and $32,000. A surcharge of 28 per cent will be imposed that part of taxable income above $32,000. Instead of the present seven-step scale this establish a three-step scale incorporating effective marginal rates of 32,46 and 60 per cent. Let me briefly summarise some of the main benefits of this new and vastly simplified tax The most important benefit is that there are of tax reductions at all levels of taxable income. Furthermore, the biggest proportional gainers are those on lower incomes at the bottom of the only inequitable, it tax scale. on In fact, the incomes of about 225 000 taxpayers, including many pensioners with small private incomes, will be made non-taxable. Some 90 per cent of taxpayers will pay tax at no more than the standard marginal rate of 32 percent. As a result, the new system goes a long way to restoring the monetary incentive for individuals all to work and to work harder, to take on added responsibility, to work overtime, and so on. now give some examples of how this system will affect selected income groups: a taxpayer on a taxable income of $4,000 per annum or $77 per week with no dependent spouse will have his tax liability reduced by $2.86 per week, nearly two-thirds of his present tax liability; a taxpayer on $ 10,000 per annum or $ 192 per week, about average earnings, will save $2.83 per week, and his marginal rate of tax will be reduced from 35c to 32c in the dollar; a taxpayer on $ 15,000 per annum or $288 per week will save $ 10.46 per week and his marginal rate will drop sharply from 45c to 32c in the dollar. These reductions will be in addition to those effected from 1 July last through the tax tax threshold indexation mechanism. The new system will apply from 1 February 1978 for both pay-as-you-earn and, notionalfy, per cent will for assessment purposes. rate As from 1 February next, therefore, the total savings in tax from the new scale and the tax indexation mechanism combined will amount, in on the three examples I have just quoted, to $4.46 per week, $5.38 per week and $15.38 per week, respectively. on These examples-whic h could of course be multiplied-indicat e the substantial benefits will flowing to all taxpayers from our program of tax reform and tax reduction to date. I now briefly touch on some further aspects of the new system. The general rebate of $676 previously allowable to all taxpayers regardless of their expenditures on concessional items would have meant in 1977-78, effectively, a rebate of 40 per cent for any such expenditures over $ 1,690. With a 32 per cent standard rate being introduced, it has been decided that eligible expenditure above the ceiling will attract a rebate at that rate; the resultant revenue saving will be applied to reduce the ceiling from $1,690 to $1,590, thus making such rebates available to more taxpayers. Several consequential amendments in respect of such matters as trust income and the threshold of the health insurance levy will be necessary; details are given in Statement No. 4 attached. PAYE deductions from salaries and wages will be reduced as from 1 February 1978, based on the new scale. The rate scale and other features applicable for the final assessment of tax liabilities on 1977-78 incomes will in practice be a composite, equivalent to seven-twelfths of the present system andfive-twelfthsof the new one. Again, details are spelled out in Statement No. 4. As basic provisional tax for 1977-78 is assessed on 1976-77 income, 1976-77 rates of tax will be applied in calculation thereof. The substantial benefits of the new scales will add, from early 1978, to the benefits flowing from the latest round of indexation on 1 July 1977. These new benefits will begin flowing to taxpayers five months before the next indexation adjustment. Full automatic indexation to prevent effective rates of personal income tax from increasing purely because of inflation will be maintained in respect of the new system in future years. However, transitional arrangements will apply with respect to the indexation adjustment due on 1 July 1978. Dependant rebates which will have operated unchanged throughout the year, will be indexed at that time by the full factor given by the annual indexation rules. The new rate scale, which will have been operating only during the second half of the financial year, will be indexed at that time by half the factor given by the annual indexation rules. The cost of the measure on this basis is estimated at $406m in 1977-78 and $973m in 1978-79. Incentives for the Arts Continuing its active support for the arts and as a way of eliciting greater co-operation from the private sector, the Government will liberalise the conditions under which income tax deductions are allowable for gifts of works of art and comparable property to public art galleries, museums and libraries. Details are contained in Statement No. 4. The cost to revenue is estimated to approach $lm in 1977-78 and $2.5m in a full year. Company Tax As I mentioned earlier, there is a clear need this year to finance the essential personal tax reform I have just announced. That has meant, for one thing, the most rigid control of the Commonwealth's own expenditures. Beyond that, however, we have also had to look elsewhere for increased sources of revenue. Since coming to office the Government has eased the burden of tax on business income in several ways, notably by the investment allowance and the trading stock valuation adjustment. These measures will produce a very substantial saving in the tax payable by corporate business in 1977-78, of the order of $600m at current tax rates. As I said early on in my speech tonight there is a need for fair sharing of the burdens. Against the background of the very substantial concessions given to companies last year, and of the recent and prospective increases in corporate profitability, it has been decided to increase the rates of company tax to apply in respect of 197677 income. The increase will be 31*4 per cent bringing the general rate to 46 per cent. The same Vk per cent increase in rate will also apply to 1977-78 income of superannuation funds which do not observe the 30/20 rule, bringing their rate to 46 per cent. This rate increase is estimated to yield $203m in 1977-78 and $224m in a full year. Even so, company tax in total is estimated to increase by only $174m, or 6 per cent, in 197778, compared with $302m, or 12 per cent, in 1976-77. Small Business Taxation The Government attaches particular importance to the fundamental role of small business in our free enterprise system. Because of the benefits this year flowing from last year's alterations to Division 7 tax, introducamounts tion of an investment allowance and a trading stock valuation adjustment, the effective rate of tax for the majority of small firms has been reduced by between 8 and 10 percentage points. This year's changes to personal income tax will be of particular benefit to the owner-operators of small companies and unincorporated enterprises, whose incomes are more subject to fluctuations than those of the majority of taxpayers. There are of course many matters which affect small businesses but which are within the province of State governments-pay-rol l tax, workers' compensation and the like. As I have said, the small business sector will greatly assisted by the Budget-the Commonwealth hopes that State governments will have similar regard to the special needs of this sector. Film Royalties Paid Abroad Most film royalties paid from Australia are at present taxed, on an arbitrary basis, as if the foreign recipient's profit rate were 10 per cent. The Government considers that this produces an unreasonably low effective rate of tax. Accordingly, the rate of tax to apply in respect of film royalties paid out of Australia after tonight will be 10 per cent of the gross royalties, which represents our standard tax treaty rate. Gold-Mining Taxation In April 1977 the Industries Assistance Commission submitted a report on the production of gold. The Government has considered the report but has decided, because of continuing difficulties faced by the industry, to maintain the present basis of taxation and not to ehminate the concessions involved at this time. I pay particular credit to the local member of the area. That, of course, is the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Cotter). Tax Avoidance The Government is well aware of the activities in recent years of tax planners who, increasingly, are promoting tax avoidance schemes and arrangements throughout the business and professional community. We propose to crack down hard on such practices. Many of the arrangements that taxpayers are being induced to enter into are highly artificial and contrived, but they are causing substantial of revenue to be either lost altogether or deferred for considerable periods of time. The Government takes a serious view of these developments and proposes, in these Budget sittings, to bring forward amendments to combat these abuses of the provisions of the taxation laws. Coal Export Duty The Government will make a further reduction this year in the coal export levy. The higher rate of duty will be reduced by $ 1.00 to $3.50 per tonne and the lower rate by 50 cents to $ 1.00 per tonne. Should State governments seek to take advanbe tage of this to increase their own royalties the Government will have to review its position. I re-affirm the Government's intention to remove the remaining duty next year in accordance with its previous undertaking. Mr Innes-You will not be here.",64
110,Mr LYNCH,RECEIPTS,"We have news for you, my friend; I can tell you that. The present reduction, which will apply immediately, will cost an estimated $24m in 1977-78 and $27m in a full year. NA The world price of crude oil has risen dramatically in recent years but only very minor adjustments have been made to the price of crude from Australian wells. Australian crude is now very substantially underpriced. Without significant new discoveries in the next few years, indigenous crude oil would fall from meeting about 70 per cent of total Australian demand to about 30 per cent by 1985. We cannot afford a pricing policy thatfliesin the face of all energy conservation principles by condoning excessive consumption of our scarce presently known supplies of crude. We are moving to produce appropriate energy pricing structure. The National Energy Advisory Committee has the whole question of national energy policy under urgent study and is reporting progressively to the Government on it. We also need a pricing policy that encourages new exploration and ensures full economic recovery of known deposits. In partial recognition of these truths, the previous Government announced, and we nave maintained, a policy applying prices to oil discovered after 14 September But the previous Government did nothing conserve the usage from existing fields, increase the extent of recovery from develop new fields based on discoveries already made. An estimated 400 million barrels of oil could be recovered in Australia at import parity prices densate that would not be recovered at existing prices. yet developed This would add about 20 two years' present requirements, to the reserves which would be economically recoverable at stream present prices. Following a Government reference in May 1976, the Industries Assistance Commission has rently made recommendations directed to an orderly transition towards import parity prices for all barrel. local oil The Government endorses this objective and has adopted an approach based essentially the Commission's recommendations. An annually increasing proportion, or six million barrels per annum, greater, of crude oil from each field or new development withinfieldsdiscovered before 14 September 1975, will be sold at import parity prices, with the remainder sold at the present fixed prices for each field. For thefirstyear, commencing tonight, the proportion of oil perfieldto be sold at import parity prices will be 10 per cent of production. In the three subsequent years, the ing proportions will be 20,35 and 50 per cent. Beyond this, it is the Government's intention to move to full import parity thereafter; accordingly it will, prior to the the period, review the matter. The Government believes that not all the ditional profits resulting from these decisions should remain with the producers, and that community should obtain a return from the exmeans ploitation of these resources which adequately reflects their value. The fact that the recently crude oil stems essentially from action by a cartel of foreign oil producers makes the community interest in that enhanced value all the more obvious. In view of this, the Government has decided to increase the production levy on crude oil from $2 to $3 per barrel. The Government is, meanwhile, examining whether the levy should be replaced by a import parity resources tax. 1975. The levy will not apply to condensate to marketed separately from a crude oil stream; to such condensate may now be sold at commerthem, or to cially negotiated prices. Nor will the levy apply to liquefied petroleum gas fromfieldsnot yet in production. This will assist the marketing of LPG and confromfieldsalready discovered but not in the North West Shelf and the per cent, or about Cooper Basin. Condensate sold comingled in a crude oil will continue to be treated as crude oil for pricing and levy purposes. The levy on liquefied petroleum gas from curproducingfieldswill remain at $2 per Duty on Petroleum Products In association with its review of energy pricing on and conservation policies, the Government has also reviewed the duty on petroleum products and has decided to increase it by one-quarter whichever is the cent per litre. These decisions taken together will result in additional revenues totalling $180m this financial year, and $212m in a full year. The pricing and duty decisions combined are estimated to result in an ultimate increase in retail petrol prices of about Vh cents per litre, or about 11 cents per gallon, in 1977-78; because of the lags involved, thesefinalprice effects are likely to correspondcome through rather gradually. Petrol will remain appreciably cheaper in Australia than in most other comparable as soon as possible countries. end of The Government regrets the need for any action that adds to consumer prices. adHowever, it also realises that the steadily diminishing proportion of our crude oil needs the which will be supplied from domestic wells that increased petrol prices are inevitable in any case; the sooner they are effected, the sooner will excessive use be curtailed, presently increased value of uneconomic for new fieldsbe developed and exploration fields stepped up. A further statement on the new oil pricing and levy arrangements will be made by the Minister for National Resources. NA Total outlays in 1977-78 are estimated to increase by 10.5 per cent to $26,656m. Total receipts are estimated to increase by 14.3 percentto$24,439m. The overall deficit is therefore estimated at $2,217m, a reduction of $523m in 1976-77. After allowance for overseas transactions, the domestic deficit is estimated at $ 1,347m in 1977-78, almost $650m less than in 1976-77. NA The outcome I have just announced is consistent with our fiscal stance since taking office. In 1977-78 fiscal policy will again reinforce the other arms of policy. In particular, the further reduction in the Budget deficit will lighten the burden on monetary policy. We are thus a step closer to our objectives of sustainably lowering interest rates and beginning to ease the restrictions on bank lending during the course of 1977-78. As that can be responsibly achieved, there will be obvious benefits for the economy. I can mention tonight one step in that direction. The Government has been concerned, in reviewing the overall housing scene, to ensure that availability offinanceis not a barrier to steady and sustainable growth in home buildmg activity, including additions and renovations. If borrowers are credit worthy, we would not want them to be denied housingfinancebecause of official restraints. Accordingly, the Government has advised the Reserve Bank that it wants to see banks and other financial institutions encouraged to increase their lending for private home building, particularly in those States and areas where the capacity of the building industry is underutilised. It is of course being left to individual determine their levels of lending, taking into account their particular balance sheet positions and their assessments of the housing situation in their areas of operations. Despite the many hazards in such projections, the present outlook indicates future growth in the broadly defined measure of the volume of money, M3, in the range of 8-10 per cent over the course of 1977-78. That range may change as circumstances unfold. It may also be necessary, as in 1976-77, to adjust policy in response to changing circumstances. With those qualifications, I indicate the Government's present expectation that it will be appropriate for monetary growth in 1977-78 to be somewhat less than in 1976-77. This would maintain the Government's policy of providing adequate funds for sustainable recovery in private sector activity and employment, while continuing to bear down steaddy on inflation and inflationary expectations. The Government believes that these broad monetary expectations will provide the community with a continuing degree of certainty as to the outlook. Overall, thesefiscaland monetary policy settings provide ground for cautious optimism about the unfolding of economic conditions through 1977-78. Again, however, I stress that restoring the Australian economy from its previously shattered state is no simple task. The course of inflation during thefirsthalf of 1977-78 will be influenced by several transitory factors. These will include the continuing lagged effects of last year's devaluation, some' catch-up' effects from the recent prices 'pause' and the direct and indirect effects of the pricing-cum-duty decisions on petroleum products which I have just announced. But, more importantly, the basic thrust of policy is such as to further reduce the underlying rate of inflation. Fundamentally, of course, inflation-and unemployment-in 1977-78 will be heavily influenced by the extent of wage indexation applying. If we assume, for example, that future lenders to National Wage Case decisions embody a broadly similar degree of partial indexation as in 1976-77, by mid-1978 a wide range of price indicators would be registering quarterly rates of increase of the order of 2-2Vi per cent. Unless the degree of wage indexation is reduced, it will mean wage rate increases of around 10 per cent for 1977-78 as a whole. Such an outcome would contribute little to reducing real wage/productivity distortion. If the Commission does make a contribution to this problem by lower awards, the outlook for jobs-and unemployment-wil l be strengthened. We shall, of course, continue to urge the bench to do so-stressin g in that regard the relevance of the tax relief we are providing. As noted earlier, the underlying forward momentum of demand and activity has begun to reassert itselfin recent months. That process will gather pace over the course in 1977-78. Product growth will induce some short-term gains in measured productivity and some further improvement in profitability and profit levels. Growth offinaldomestic demand will again be concentrated in the private sector, with cuts in personal income tax and some further cline in the personal saving ratio underpinning them. moderate growth in consumption while the business fixed investment growth already in train strengthens and broadens. As the trade account continues to switch around, it will contribute significantly to the growth of domestic product over the course of the year. It will also contribute to an improving balance of payments position, although the usual seasonal influences will work in the other direcfrom tion for the next few months. With policy bearing down on inflation and business investment picking up, strengthening private capital inflows and the recently nounced resumption of long-term official borin activity. rowing overseas should reinforce the capital account also as the year progresses. Gross non-farm product should over 4 per cent between the June quarters of 1977 and 1978. This compares with a corresponding increase of 1 per cent between the June quarter 1976 the June quarter 1977. Due to the within-year patterns-particularl y the strong first half and weak second half of 1976-77-growt h of that order in non-farm uct over the course of 1977-78 would growth for 1977-78 as a whole of about 2 per cent. Although seasonal conditions are largely unpredictable, at this stage they support more than a marginal increase in the volume of farm production; if so, real farm incomes would be likely to fall somewhat. Such an overall picture for activity would be consistent with strengthening, though still modest, employment growth during the course of 1977-78. This should broadly take up the growth in the work-force but perhaps not much more than that. Such an outcome would reflect, of course, the continuing serious real wage distortion and the characteristics of the wage determination process. Our policies will continue to erode that distortion and open the way to increased job opportunities and lower unemployment. That desirable outcome would be attainable more quickly were there to be greater moderthe ation on the part of those demanding wage deincreases and on the part of those awarding NA This Budget has been carefully designed. It will be maintaining maximum pressure on inflation in thefirsthalf of thefinancialyear. In the second half of thefinancialyear, as the results of these policies bear their fruits, the Budget will add a stimulus to activity through the large increase in disposable incomes flowing tax reductions associated with changes to the personal income tax system. The Government therefore, looks to a further slowdown in inflation in the second half of an1977-78, accompanied by a continuing pick-up In short, this Budget assures further solid progress towards the Government's economic increase by and social objectives. The new reform of the personal income tax is of particular benefit, both economic and social. and Economically, the Budget builds upon the foundations of the past eighteen months. 1976-77 was not an easy year, and 1977-78-in the very nature of the problems we prodconfront-wil l not see any dramatic breakentail through to rapid economic recovery. But the Budget provides solid grounds for looking to further gains in reducing the underlying rate of inflation and inflationary expectations seem unlikely to in the year ahead. That will, in turn, be reflected in rising levels of activity and growing job opportunities extending through into 1978-79 and beyond. I commend the Budget to honourable members. adjourned.

APPENDIX TO THE BUDGET STATEMENTS-TH E FUNCTIONAL The purpose of the functional classification objectives or purposes. In this way the nature of government activities, on the and to facilitate assessments of the effectiveness Compared with the classification used functional classification has the added conventions. There is thus a consistent classification and the functional classification. confusion which existed in Budget documents different classifications were used-the national accounting classification. The conventions and principles used those set out in the publication A System York 1968. That classification is a widely classification of public expenditure by function. The Australian Bureau of Statistics principles in the documents it publishes functional headings adopted for Budget used by the Statistician in his publications, by the Bureau for Commonwealth Government outlays by Commonwealth Government sector. They therefore differ somewhat the Budget Statements. Information on the the Budget sector is shown in the National Outlays of Commonwealth Government Authorities documents. Two further differences should assistance are shown in the Budget Statements levies and charges; these outlays are shown for the years prior to 1974-75, part of Government departments and instrumentalities classified by the Statistician as foreign shown under the same functional heading Supplementary information on the functional in the Bureau's publication Public The major functional headings are Brief descriptions of the contents of each are intended to convey the scope of the than to be a detailed listing of the contents function is provided in the body of Statement 1967-68 to 1976-77 are given in Statement No. 6. From an examination of the classification it will be evident that the functional classification On the whole it has not been possible, for of departments and to allocate them over functional heading. NA is to bring together outlays with like classification aims to present information on the resources devoted to particular objectives of outlays in meeting objectives. in Budget Statements prior to 1973-74, the advantage of being based on national accounting conceptual basis underlying both the economic This removes a considerable source of prior to 1973-74 when two conceptually so-called 'conventional' classification and the NA in the functional classification are essentially of National Accounts, United Nations, New accepted international standard for the has concurrently adopted these conventions and on public authority finance. While the major purposes are conceptually consistent with those it should be noted that the figures published outlays cover both Budget outlays and authorities which operate outside the Budget from the figures shown for the Budget sector in transactions of authorities operating outside Accounting Estimates of Receipts and which is published with the Budget be noted. First, outlays on primary industry 'net' of the relevant primary industry on a gross basis by the Statistician. Secondly, the expenditure incurred by some Commonwealth operating in Papua New Guinea is aid. In the Budget Statements these outlays are as similar outlays made within Australia. allocation of these outlays is available Authority Finance-Federal Authorities.

Historical data for the period structure set out in the Budget Statements is relatively aggregative in nature. example, to dissect the administrative outlays the particular sub-categories shown under each Outlays under each functional heading together into readily identifiable blocks. represent detailed purpose-oriented sub-functions as recognisable and meaningful groupings analysis. Nevertheless, the main outlay blocks was the case with the categories of expenditure classification used prior to 1973-74. Given the need to produce a continuing outlays and receipts which is consistent Budget Speech and documents, it has been central accounting records. These records which are the legal authority for expenditure The figures presented, therefore, have been priation data, supplemented where necessary substantial appropriation items Functional categories do not necessarily mental structures. Furthermore, some outlay at aggregates.

NA The use of definitions of Budget outlays conventions places Budget data on a basis with national accounting information published and can be related to that information. The principles underlying the national set out in the Appendix to the Supplement National Accounting Estimates of Receipts Authorities, September 1974. Concurrent with cation in 1973-74, some changes were definitions of outlays, receipts and the in the classification have been grouped These blocks do not, as a rule, purport to or programs; rather, they are meant which lend themselves to discussion and are decidedly more purpose-oriented than identified under the conventional and up-to-date record of actual monthly with the overall estimates embodied in the necessary to work largely within existing are built around the Appropriation Acts, rather than detailed costing documents. derived essentially by reclassifying approby a limited amount of sub-costing of which cover several functions. correspond with appropriation or departand receipt figures are netted in arriving heads under the control of a particular under more than one functional heading and appropriation items in the Statements. however, does not alter the structure with the Appropriation Bills, such as and Summary of Estimated Expenditure. classification scheme is to reveal the broad undertaken, it is important to note that unambiguously.

NA Ministerial Statement,264
119,Mr ANTHONY,CRUDE OIL POLICY,"Richmond-Minister for National Resources and Minister for Overseas Trade)-by leave-It was announced in the Budget Speech earlier tonight that the Government is introducing new arrangements for the pricing and taxation of crude oil produced from presently known Australianfields.For several years I have been arguing that energy in Australia is unrealistically pneed. The pnce of petrol here is less than half the price in countries like Japan, France and Italy. While consumers would welcome the continuation of this situation, Second Reading the fact is that it cannot continue. The quadof international oil prices in 1973-74 ushered in a new and disturbing realisation of the essential role oil plays in the standard of living the world either enjoys or aspires to. Events since then have reinforced that realisation. Oil plays a key role in the transport on which the modern world depends. It is also the energy for which we face the most critical shorttoages. President Carter's energy statement contained the estimate that on current trends, demand would overhaul supply some time around the mid 1980s. Nobody seriously questions this If this situation is permitted to occur, the market price for oil will be anyone's guess. Governments the world over must make every attempt to forestall such a demand-supply squeeze. They must take active steps to mitigate of dearer oil- a certainty whether or not world demand outpaces availability. Oil supplies 45 per cent of the world's energy needs and 47 per cent of Australia's. It will remain for decades the most important energy source. It is at Second Reading the heart of any country's energy policy. I am currently preparing a statement which will deal comprehensively with all forms of energy. That statement will be presented to the House as soon as practicable. The matters disis cussed in this present statement form an integral part of that forthcoming statement of energy polused icy. For Australia, our central energy policy objectives must be threefold. Firsdy, we must encourage oil exploration and development. Secmy ondly, we must encourage greater economies of energy usage and encourage people to use other fuels in preference to oil. Thirdly, we must foster a more intensive search for alternatives to oil. is Each of these objectives requires the price to be 17 increased. That is why I have constantly argued that we should move gradually and predictably towards higher oil prices. This approach allows us to avoid the large, abrupt, destabilising increases which would otherwise occur. Price is not the only instrument available to promote our policy. Clearly the Government can and will exhort consumers to reduce their usage of oil products in the nauonal interest. But realistic pricing remains critical to the success of a policy. Energy saving measures like, for example, insulation of houses, need to become recognised money-saving propositions. Higher priced oil will also assist in bringing about the economic introduction of alternative energy technologies such as coal conversion and solar power. A higher price will raise the return on successful exploration. An improved return on investment provides a strengthened encouragement for exploration; moreover, we would expect that higher earnings by existing producers will be ploughed back into further exploration here in Australia. The Treasurer (Mr Lynch) has given a general outline of the new arrangements. I will now describe in some additional detail the pricing, location, and levy arrangements, and deal briefly with the question of their likely impact. As already announced, the Government cided to implement a scheme which will take the price of indigenous crude oil from presently known fields in the direction of import parity. This will be achieved through a uniform method of price determination. The new scheme will apply to each presently known field in Australia and will apply from midnight tonight. Producers will receive the import parity price, determined by the Government every six months, for a specified part of their production. Import parity will be received for either the first six million rels of oil produced from each field per annumNational called the 'basic allowance'-or a proportion of production per annum, rising overtimeaccordmine ing to a specified schedule, whichever is the greater in any particular case. The schedule is per cent from tomorrow until the end of the presentfinancialyear, rising to 20 per cent thefinancialyear 1978-79, 35 per cent for finanremove cial year 1979-80 and 50 per cent for financial year 1980-81. For all additional production from each field or new development, the producers will receive the price which was current up to the time of introduction of the new arrangements. That $2.33 per barrel in the case of the Bass Strait fields and $2.88 per barrel in the case of the row Islandfield.All production from the Moonie and Alton fields and other smallfieldswill, in practice, receive import parity prices, as the output from those fields will be well below six million barrels per annum. The Government will review the position before June 1981 to decide the rate at which the further progression to full import parity for presently known fields should take place. Oil from fields discovered after 14 September 1975 will continue to receive full import parity. The present crude oil absorption policy, whereby all crude oil produced in Australia is required to be processed in Australian refineries, will be continued. Indigenous crude oil, with its high yield of light fractions, is ideally suited to the local market demand. The export of the indigenous crude oil would therefore simply mean the exchange of our own oil for another, probably less suitable, imported oil. The existing embargo on exports of crude oil will therefore remain in force. The Government is, in any case, under an obligation to continue the present crude oil absorption policy and associated allocation arrangements until at least 1980. This is because most refineries have undertaken considerable alplant investment on the basis of that policy and to prematurely abandon it or phase it out would arbitrarily disadvantage a substantial section of has dethe oil refining industry. The import parity price will be set every six months by the Commonwealth Government. It will be calculated on the basis of the price of Arabian light oil at the nearest refinery port, adjusted to allow for an appropriate quality differential. This differential will take account of the suitability of indigenous crude oil for the local market. For the period until 31 December 1977, the import parity price will be set at $13 barper barrel. Officers of the Department of Resources will be having discussions with the oil industry in the near future to deterthe precise basis on which the impon parity price should be calculated in future periods. The 10 new pricing arrangements give a consistent set of ground rules applicable to all present and future for developments in existing fields. They will any apparent arbitrariness inherent in the previous method of price determination. The basic allowance will apply to the combined existing developments in each presently known field and to each substantial new development in such fields. Thefigureof six million barrels per annum the has been selected to ensure that new developis ments will immediately receive impon parity prices for all or most of their production. It will Barensurefirstlythat different producers are treated equitably and, secondly, that adequate recognition is given to the fact that oil from the smaller fields is typically more cosdy to produce than from the larger fields. As already announced, the crude oil levy be increased by $ 1 per barrel to $3 per barrel. The levy will be deducted from the price for ergy import-parity oil, and added to below-import-parity oil. In effect, therefore, ducers will pay the levy on import-parity oil, consumers will pay the levy on below-importcrude parity production. The likely effects on prices, company profits, and Government revenues of the new arrangements were mentioned in the Budget Speech. The new arrangements will fields increase the prices received by existing producers approximately as follows: For the remainder of 1977, the average price for all Bass Strait fieldsfor already in production, net of the crude oil levy, will be about $3.20 per barrel. For Barrow Island, the average price received will be about $6.60, and for Moonie the price received will $10 per barrel. If world pricesriseat 6 per cent per annum and no further changes are made in the levy arrangements, corresponding net prices by 1979-80 could be of the order of $6.20, $7.30 and $11.60 for Bass Strait, Barrow Island and Moonie respectively. The net prices in the early period would be somewhat lower than the prices which would per have resulted from acceptance of the precise Industries Assistance Commission recommendathese tions. The new arrangements will immediately increase the average price into Australian refineries of all oil including imports by an estimated 25 per cent. While the actual extent any petroleum product price increase will be matter for the Prices Justification Tribunal, resultant increase will probably be of the order of 2Vic per litre on the price of regular motor spirit. On this basis, the recommended price regular motor spirit in Sydney would rise to approximately 19c per litre. The Government is, of course, most reluctant to increase the price of petroleum products Australian consumers. But the option of mainstantial taining indefinitely a low price for the bulk Australian refinery feedstocks is simply no longer available to us. It needs to be recognised that Australian consumer has been paying less than the real value of the petroleum he uses. Furtherrelevant more, over the phasing-in period he will continue to pay less than in most overseas countries. Comlevy pared to the new likely price Sydney, the French motorist pays 39c, the Japanese motorist pays 38c, and the German, Swedish and British motorists all pay over 30c. Petrol prices in Australia remain considerably below the 25c per litre in New Zealand and are oil now at roughly the same level as Canadian prices. Only the United States among major will Western countries has cheaper petrol than Australia and the thrust of President Carter's enpolicy is to increase the price of oil products the price for to American consumers. proIt must be recognised that our decision to and move towards impon parity pricing for known oil merely hastens the inevitable. In the next few years, production from the Bass Strait fields will begin to decline as thosefieldsapproach the end of their economic life. These comprise 90 per cent of present day Australian production. Hence oil produced overseas, imponed at prevailing world prices, will account an increasing proportion of the input to Australian refineries. Furthermore, should more oil be discovered in Australia, it is already established Government policy that that oil will be be priced at full import parity. The new arrangements will effectively increase the amount of oil available from presently knownfields.There are over 400 million barrels of oil, or two years worth of consumption, locked up infieldsand not economically extractable at current prices. Australia cannot afford to leave this oil in the ground. The basic allowance of 6 million barrels annum of oil at import parity prices for each new development will provide an assurance that reserves can be extracted. There are several considerations other than basic energy policy considerations which the of Government has necessarily had to take into a account when formulating its new policy. One is the the Government's overriding aim of lowering the rate of inflation and raising the level of activity in the economy generally. There is a need of also to avoid the significant dislocation which could be expected to follow as particular industries suffered large cost increases. It is for these reasons that the Government has decided to increase prices gradually rather than all at once. to The new arrangements will result in very subincreases in the profits of each of the curof rent producers. For this reason the Government is considering the application of a resources tax the to these profits. Accordingly the Government will be seeking early discussions with the oil producing companies on these matters. Any decision on the future of the crude oil will be taken in the light of decisions on the of 19c per litre in resource tax. The Government considers that the new pricing arrangements represent the most appropriate way of bringing Australian oil prices to world levels. The new taxation arrangements will aim to achieve an appropriate division between producers in the form of net returns, and the Government-and hence the taxpayer-in the form of taxation revenue. Over the transitional period, the Australian consumer of petroleum products will, for some years, be able to pay prices based on crude oil prices below the price of imported crude. Many other countries in a less fortunate position than Australia have had to adjust to the hard reality of high oil prices very rapidly. Our own oil reserves will allow us to adjust gradually, and consequently at less cost in terms of disruption. But we must take advantage of the dme these reserves have allowed us to adjust our oil consumpuon habits and to prepare substitutes for imported oil. I present the following paper: Crude Oil Policy-Ministerial Statement, 16 August Motion (by Mr Sinclair) proposed: That the House take note of the paper.",264
120,Mr KEATING,CRUDE OIL POLICY,"In reply to the statement made by the Minister for Nauonal Resources (Mr Anthony), I want to say briefly that what we have heard in the last few minutes was virtually a home town decision by the Government in support of its corporate friends when it has had a year to consider the report of the Industries Assistance Commission, which was presented in September last year. The Opposidon has announced on other occasions that it is sympathetic to the general thrust of the IAC report where increases in the price of crude are accompanied by the presence of a secondary taxing structure. But what we have heard tonight represents an increase of 1 lc a gallon in the pnce of fuel to the Australian consumer, to the motorist in the city and to the farmer, and a massive increase in profitability for the main producers of oil in Australia, the Esso-BHP consortium in Bass Strait. The Minister said in his speech that the Government is considering the applicadon of a resources tax on these profits and that, accordingly, the Government will be seeking early discussions with the relevant oil producing companies on the matter. That is not good enough. The Government was presented with the IAC repon 12 months ago and that repon canvassed a secondary taxing or royalties system. The Treasury should have been instructed to present the Government fonhwith with a number of taxing scenarios which the Government could have considered for simultaneous introduction with these proposals. Not only do we find that that is not the case, but also that the real story is hidden. There is no express mention in the Minister's statement of the kind of profitability which will flow to the companies by virtue of these decisions. On my quick estimate, from BHP and Esso, the Bass Strait producers, which have three fields which qualify under the 6 million barrels a year provision, there will be approximately 13 million barrels in respect of which the Government is offering import parity of $13. Taking into 1977. account the present price of $2.30, as well as the $3 a barrel, the benefit will be about $7.70 a barrel over 13 million barrels. That means that the Government has put $ 100m in excess profits into the hands of Esso and BHP without any express commitment to spend that money on new exploration. The Minister said that he hopes there will be new exploration. He should have insisted. There should have been an express provision that the money given to the companies would be spent in that way. As well, massive additional revenue will flow to the Government from these arrangements. That additional revenue should have been spent on alternative energy technology and research into alternative energy resources, but that was not mentioned in the statement. I believe that it is a very inadequate statement. It is a home town decision for Esso-BHP and the other oil producers. The Government ought to be ashamed. It has had 12 months to introduce a taxing system and it has failed to measure up to the challenge. I seek leave to continue my remarks at a later stage. Leave granted; debate adjourned. House adjourned at 9.54 p.m. The following answers to questions Medical Claims Paid by Commonwealth (Supplementary information to that published in Hansard 3 December 1976.)

123,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relauons, upon nouce, on 9 March 1977: Does he have any statistics to indicate which countries have a higher percentage of married women among its employed persons in the workforce than is the case in Australia; if so, what are the countries. Mr Street-The answer to the honourable member's quesuon is as follows: Information on the percentage of married women among employed persons in the workforce is available, in respect of 10 of the 24 OECD countries (including Australia), from the OECD publication Labour Force Statistics, 1963-1974 (Paris, 1976), and is presented below. It can be seen that most of the countries for which information is available have a higher proportion of married women among their employed workforce than does Australia. Country Denmark Sweden (a) Norway (a) Japan (a) Austria (a) United States Federal Republicof Germany (1973) Australia Canada Italy Average Award Rate-Adul t Males (a) Tool-maker (b)(c) Level 6 Commonwealth Public Service (c) (a) February 1977 (b) Victoria elsewhere, Metal Industry Award (c) Including November 1976 National Wage Increase (d) Increase rounded to nearest 10 cents The honourable member will be aware that the Conciliation and Arbitrauon Commission on 31 March 1977 awarded an across the board increase of $5.70 per week in respect of the movement in the Consumer Price Index for the December quarter 1976. This amount included ment of $2.90 per week to all award rates on account of the movement in the Consumer Price Index resulting from in revised Health Insurance arrangements. (a) Statistics of employed civilians include the armed (Question No. 93) forces. It should be noted that because of differences between these OECD countries in the matter of general concepts, classifications, and the methods used to obtain labour force statistics and employment data, the comparisons presented here should be treated with caution and should be regarded as merely approximate. Details of these differences can be obtained from the OECD publication referred to above. Indexation of Medibank Contribution: Effect on Wage Rates (Question No. 96)",273

(2) If so, which Government department would have the responsibility for such a program. (3) Will he ask the responsible Minister to initiate an education campaign aimed at public acceptance of the need for motor spirit conservation. (4) As policies aimed at conserving petrol are likely to prove unpopular, will he give an assurance that his Government will act in the long-term national interest rather than take shon-term opportunist decisions.",273
125,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) and (3) The Fourth Report of the Royal Commission on Petroleum has been considered by the Government. The Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs made a statement on 31 May concerning the Government's intentions with regard to the Royal Commission's recommendations. Responsibility for co-ordinating the Commonwealth's interest in energy matters rests with the Minister for National Resources and his Department, with a supportive role on conservation aspects from the Department of Environment, Housing and Community Development. The Minister for National Resources has advised me that at thefirstmeeting of the Australian Minerals and Energy Council on 4 March 1977, the Commonwealth and State Ministers agreed that there was a need for the Commonwealth and the states to consult on a wide range of energy Minister Rt Hon. Ian Sinclair RtHon. Ian Sinclair Rt Hon. Ian Sinclair Hon. Jim Cairns Hon. Rex Patterson Hon. Frank Crean Senator the Hon. Don Willesee RtHon. J.D. Anthony matters including matters relating to energy conservation. To facilitate these consultations, the Council agreed that its Advisory Committee of officials should set up small Task Groups to investigate and report to Council on agreed subjects. As a number of matters under the control of the States have a very important bearing on the effectiveness of any energy conservation program, the Commonwealth will be seeking the establishment of a Task Group to consider what steps would be desirable and feasible in this area. The recently established National Energy Advisory Committee will also have an important role to play both in advising on what is technically feasible in regard to energy conservation, and in stimulating public awareness of the need for energy conservation. (4) The Government will certainly act in the long term national interest in this matter. Ministerial Visits to the Republic of Korea (Question No. 196) Mr E. G. Whitlam asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 9 March 1977: What were the date, duration and purpose of each visit to the Republic ofKorea by any ofhis present Ministers in the last 12 years.",274
126,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: An examination of records shows that the following Ministerial visits to the Republic ofKorea have taken place in the last 12 years: Date Purpose 9-13 December 1968 To attend Annual Ministerial Trade Talks 29 November- To attend Annual 3 December 1970 Ministerial Trade Talks 13-17 June 1972 To attend Seventh Ministerial Meeting of NA 15-18 September 1973 To take pan in trade discussions 1-2 September 1974 To discuss a sugar agreement between the two Governments 15-20 June 1975 To attend Annual Ministerial Trade Talks 19-22 June 1975 To strengthen relations with the ROK-pa n of general visit to the region 1-6 July 1977 To attend Annual Ministerial Trade Talks Unemployment Registrations: Western Sydney Mr E. G. Whitlam asked the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relauons, upon nodce, on 9 March 1977: (1) How many persons were registered as unemployed at the end of January 1976 and at the end of January 1977 in the Electoral Divisions of (a) Chifley, (b) Macarthur, (c) Macquarie, (d) Mitchell, (e) Parramatta, (f) Prospect and (g) Werriwa. (2) What percentage of the persons was (a) males and (b) females (i) under 21 years of age and (ii) 21 years of age and over. (3) What were the principal work categories of the persons registered as unemployed. Mr Street-The answer to the honourable member's quesuon is as follows: Statistics of unemployed persons registered with the Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) are normally compiled according to individual Employment Office areas. It is not usual for the boundaries of these to coincide with the boundaries of parliamentary electorates and in the majority of cases parts of several Employment Office areas would be contained in any one electorate. Conversely, however, some Employment Offices either contain a single electorate or parts of more than one electorate within their boundaries. It is possible to state roughly the proportion of each CES Oflice area contained in a particular electorate and to provide statistics relating to the tered as unemployed in each of those Offices. Any attempt to apply the relative proportions to these total figures, however, in an effort to obtain an estimate of the number of characteristics of the unemployed registrants in that electorate, would be misleading as the distribution of population and unemployment within each CES Office area is unlikely to be uniform. With this caveat in mind, as stated in my answer to the honourable member's question No. 219 of 9 March, 1977,I am prepared to provide statistics of persons registered as unemployed in Offices of the CES contained in the respective electorates as requested by the honourable member but, as statistics of occupauonal categories for which unemployed persons are registered are not normally published by CES Office areas, I do not consider that the considerable clerical effort involved in their extraction would be justified for part (3) of the honourable member's question. The following are the answers, in terms of CES Office areas, to pans (1) and (2) of the honourable member's question: (1) (a) Pans of three Employment Office areas fall within the boundaries of the Federal Electoral Division of Chifley as presently constituted, viz: Mt Druitt, Blacktown and Penrith.

(2) If so, what steps has he taken to check on the accuracy of this statement",288
130,Mr HUNT,ASPAC,"The answer to the honourable in any member's quesdon is as follows: (1) and (2) I am not aware of any properly conducted research study which can support such a claim. The honourIt able member will be aware that claims of this sort have been made in various parts of the world on the basis of the review of clinical records by clinicians and researchers properly quaUfied in the analysis of clinical data. The Division of Surgery has been conducting a survey on the utilisation of the surgical facUities in conjunction with the hospital adrninistration as a step towards the more efficient Decision utilisation of surgical facUities and the organisation of peer review. That is the appropriate body to review surgical rates generally and I can assure the honourable member that any reliable information on over utilisation would be referred to the Division for analysis. Contract to Inter-city Security (Question No. 474) Mr Armitage asked the Minister representing the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 23 March 1977: (1) Was a contract let to Inter-city Security in respect of the New South Wales Repository of the Australian Archives at VUlawood instead of arranging for Commonwealth PoUce to guard the Repository; if so, why.

(2) How many persons were registered for employment in the Division in (a) January and (b) February 1977. (Question No. 447) (3) Of those referred to in parts (1) and (2), how many were (a) single and (b) married women. Mr Street-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Statistics of unemployed persons registered with the Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) are normally compUed according to individual Employment Office areas. It is not usual for the boundaries of these to coincide with the boundaries of parUamentary electorates and in the majority of cases parts of several CES Office areas would be contained one electorate. Conversely, however, some Employment Offices either contain a single electorate or parts of more than one electorate within their boundaries. is possible to state roughly the proportion of each CES Office area contained in a panicular electorate and to provide statistics relating to the total number of persons registered as unemployed in each one of those Offices. Any attempt to apply the relative proportions to these total figures, however, in an effort to obtain an estimate of number and characteristics of the unemployed that electorate, would be misleading populadon and unemployment within each CES Office is unlikely to be uniform. (I) and (3) Bearing in mind the above also be noted that, as the highest number of persons registered as unemployed will not necessarily month for each of the CES Offices included in a parliamentary electorate, it is not always feasible to deduce uie particuFunds lar end-month reporting date when unemployment would have been highest in the electorate in any given year. Parts of three Employment Office areas boundaries of the Federal Electoral Division of Capricornia as presendy constituted, viz. Rockhampton, Gladstone and number Bundaberg. The respective proportions of the three Employment Office areas involved are 10 per cent of Rockhampton, 60 per cent of Gladstone and 20 per cent of Bundaberg.

(5) What was the cost to Medibank and Private Health in thefinancingof abortions in 1976.",290
131,Mr HUNT,ASPAC,"The answer to the honourable fall within the member's question is as follows: (1), (2) and (5) There are no reliable statistics of the of abortions carried out in Australia. Information is available for medical services for which medical benefits have been paid under various individual items in the Medical Benefits Schedule. The information relates only to services performed by medical practitioners on a fee-for-service basis, and which were the subject of for medical benefits. For instance the information of would not include any of the large numbers of medical services provided by recognised hospitals to 'hospital patients' in standard wards (i.e. the former 'public ward patients'). Under the Commonwealth/State Hospital Agreements, Single Married Total these medical services are provided to these patients by the women persons recognised hospitals. Medical benefits are not payable in respect of such services, and the cost of their provision forms Gladstone pan of the costs shared under the Hospital Agreements. 23 812 23 525 The Medical Benefits Schedule includes medical services 53 1022 in the nature of gynaecological procedures which may result 51 932 in the termination of pregnancy.

Information 41 799 is not available on the number of such cases in which a preg38 1 386 nancy was terminated as the items cover a number of gynae31 1 923 cological procedures apan from termination of a pregnancy. 37 2 159 On the basis of information available it is estimated that the the number of services for which medical benefits were paid the by Medibank and the private health funds in 1976 under 6469 was 39,400 and the medical benefits paid and (d) end-February amounted to $2.5m. (3) and (4) A doctor providing any medical procedure should have regard to the laws of the State or Territory in Single Married Total which he practises, professional ethics and the patient's women persons interest and welfare. The information available does not distinguish which of the services mentioned above (i.e. 39,400) Gladstone were performed for medical reasons, or other reasons.

Mr Street-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) At end-April 1977 the unemployed with the Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) in New South Wales, including the Australian Capital Territory, was 139,911 or 6.1 per cent of the estimated labour force. This compared with rates of 4.3 per cent in Victoria, 5.7 per cent in Queensland, 4.4 per cent in South Australia, 4.3 per cent in Western Tasmania and 8.8 per cent in the Northern Territory.

(3) What were the principal work categories of the persons registered as unemployed. drawn to the paper delivered by Mr Street-The answer to the honourable Symposium member's question is as follows: Statistics of unemployed persons registered with the Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) are normally comand piled according to individual Employment Office areas. It is not usual for the boundaries of these to coincide with the boundaries of Parliamentary electorates and in the majority in cases parts of several Employment Office areas would be thecontained in any one electorate. Conversely, however, some Employment Offices either contain a single electorate or been parts of more than one electorate within their boundaries. It is possible to state roughly the proportion of each CES area contained in a particular electorate and to prostatistics relating to the total number of persons registered as unemployed in each of those Offices. Any attempt to on apply the relative proportions to these total figures, however, an effort to obtain an estimate of the number and characteristics of the unemployed registrants in that electorate, would be misleading as the distribution of population and unemployment within each CES Office area is unlikely to be the recommendations in that uniform. With this caveat in mind, as stated in my answer to the honourable member's question No. 219 of 9 March 1977,1 to provide statistics of the numbers, age and sex of persons registered as unemployed in Offices of the CES in the respective electorates as requested by the member but, as statistics of occupational for which unemployed persons are registered are not normally published by CES Office areas I do not consider the considerable clerical effort involved in their extraction, would be j ustified for part (3) of the honourable memCommonwealth Police ber's question.

(2) Did he state on 21 October 1976 (Hansard, page 2173) that the Commonwealth's intention was that funds be available for continuation of the 19 previously approved women's refuges throughout 1976-77. (3) When did he become aware that the Queensland P overnment had decided in July 1976 not to pass on any ederal Funds for the two women's refuges which had been approved in Queensland, namely in Brisbane and Townsville.

The excess usage is assessed and billed as a supplement to the basic charge. There are only slight clerical and billing costs which relate directly to the recovery of excess water rates but these are not extractable or measurable. The total costs relating to water meters and meter readings including billing, collecting, accounting, repairs and maintenance, capital amortisation charges, etc, were estimated at $456,000 during 1976. The total collection in respect of the water supply account was about $3.8m for 1976. This explanation excludes the cost of operation, maintenance and amortisation of the total storage and distribution system. Medical Benefits Payments for Termination of Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 20 April 1977: (1) What sum has been paid to medical practitioners from the medical beneiits schedule for the termination of pregnancy in each of the last three years. (2) What are the various benefit payments for termination and associated services.",298
136,Mr HUNT,OCCUPATIONAL CATEGORY FOR,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) While the exact information requested is not available, I have supplied below what relevant information is available. Information is available for medical services for which medical benefits have been paid under various individual items in the Medical Benefits Schedule. The information relates only to services performed on a fee-for-service basis, and which were the subject of claims for medical benefits. For instance the information would not include any of the large numbers of medical services provided by recognised hospitals to 'hospital patients' in standard wards (i.e. the former 'public ward patients'). Under the Commonwealth/State Hospital Agreements, these medical services are provided to these patients by the recognised hospitals. Medical benefits are not payable in respect of such services, and the cost of their provision forms part of the costs shared under the Hospital Agreements. The Medical Benefits Schedule includes medical services in the nature of gynaecological procedures which may result Specialist Fee Benefit The associated anaesthetic fee and benefit for each of these would beGeneral Practitioner Fee Benefit Specialist Anaesthetist Fee Benefit In addition to these services there generally would be a general as well as a pre-operative examination by the anaesthetist.

Another gynaecological procedure which may result in the termination of a pregnancy is covered by Schedule items 6460/6464-'Uterus , curettage of, with or without dilation, including curettage for incomplete miscarriage'. Information is not available on the number of such cases in which a pregnancy was terminated as the items cover a number of gynaecological procedures apart from termination of a pregnancy. On the basis of information available for item 6469'Evacuation of the contents of the gravid uterus by curettage or suction curettage . . .'-it is estimated that the amount paid as medical benefits in 1974-75 was $0.9m, and in 1975-76, $2.4m. This procedure was not introduced into the Medical Benefits Schedule until 24 April 1974 and so information on this procedure prior to 1974-75 is not available.

(2) The health program grants were introduced with effect from 1 July 1975 as part of the Medibank arrangements. Their main purpose was to provide a source of financing, in lieu of the payment of medical benefits, for services provided by medical practitioners employed on a salaried or sessional basis by approved organisations. Health program grants were paid on the basis of reimbursing approved organisations for the cost of providing approved medical cunical services free of charge. With the introduction of the modified Medibank arrangements on 1 October 1976 significant changes were made in the method of financing medical services, with private medical benefits funds and employers assuming a much greater role. As from that date Commonwealth medical benefits have not been payable in respect of services rendered to privately insured persons or for medical expenses incurred by employers. As a result of the above changes the health program grants have not been payable since 1 October 1976 in respect of those organisations shown as having the grant terminated on 30 September 1976. The changed health program grants arrangements adopted from I October 1976 take into account the basic principle that charges should be raised for scheduled medical services provided to people who are insured for both medical and hospital benefits with registered health benefits organisations. Exceptions to the application of this principle are permitted in special circumstances, e.g. where privacy considerations are paramount. Consequently the levels of the health program grams to approved organisations are now generally determined so that grants meet the cost of medical clinical services provided to persons covered by Standard Medibank. I would remind the honourable member that I recently announced the expansion of the scope of existing Health Program Grant arrangements to provide funds for projects which have potential for demonstrating increased effectiveness, or efficiency of health services, whilst at the same time containing costs. Active encouragement has been given to the development of project proposals pending necessary amendments to the Health Insurance Act 1973.

(2) What percentage of the persons was (a) males and (b) females (i) under 21 years of age and (ii) 21 years of age over. Mr Street-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Statistics of unemployed monwealth Employment Service (CES) are normally compiled according to individual Employment Office areas. It is not usual for the boundaries of these to coincide with the boundaries of parliamentary electorates.

147,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,OCCUPATIONAL CATEGORY FOR,"The answer to the its honourable member's question is as follows: No such direction has been given. In relation to Government departments and authorities staffed under the PubUc Act, the engagement of consultants or other contractors for service is still subject to strict control and requires the prior approval of the Public Service Board. Earlier this year, departments were advised that the Government had reaffirmed the need to Umit the use of consultants to those whose employment is strictly essential to efficient and economical operations. Ministers had earlier been asked to apply this same test to (Question No. 759) all statutory authorities within their Ministry which are financed wholly or partly from the Budget. Telecommunications Commission and Postal Commission: Use of Private Contractors (Question No. 774) Mr Scholes asked the Minister for Post and Telecommunications, upon notice, on 28 April 1977: (1) Is the Telecommunications Commission or the Postal Commission letting out to private contractors, typing, computer programming and other work normally undertaken by the staff of the Commissions. of the present members; if not, (2) If so, is this action made necessary by lack of staff in clerical areas. (3) What is the cost of using private contractors. so,Were thefirmsused for this work determined by tenwho was the lowest tenderer. it (5 ) If tenders were not let, what method was used in determining where the excess work would be placed. (6) What additional staff would be required to allow the of Commissions to perform internally the work now subject to private contract. Mr Eric Robinson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Telecommunications Commission has placed orders with private contractors for typing and computer programming services. The Postal Commission has used private to the Board contractors for typing services. (2) No. Intermittent work loadings and recruitment be adequately difficulties are the main factors. (3) Costs from 1 July 1976 to date Telecommunications Commission: Typing: $3433 Computer Programming: $ 122,639 Postal Commission: Typing: $1,431. (4) Yes, in relauon to the Telecommunications Commission. Different firms are used and the lowest tenderer suitable for the particular type of work involved is selected. There was one exception where typing at a cost of $108 was placed with a previously used agency to save time and administrative costs. The Postal Commission uses competitive quotations where the value of the projected work exceeds $100. The only instance of this occurred in Tasmania where the lowest and selected quotation was C. M. Staff Centre, Launceston. (5) The Postal Commission uses the standard quotation procedure. (6) As the typing workload is of an irregular nature in both Commissions, no additional typing stan is warranted. Telecom Australia advises that S additional computer programming staff would be required for the particular projects. Programming staff are in short supply however, and it is extremely difficult for the Commission to recruit, at the present time, staff with the necessary qualifications and abilities.

149,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,OCCUPATIONAL CATEGORY FOR,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Statement No. 4 attached to the 1976-77 Budget Speech contained a note indicating that the investment allowance announced on 20 May 1976 was estimated to cost $200m in 1976-77 and $600m in a full year. (2) Yes. The estimates are based on forecasts of the level of investment, but the cost to revenue lags investment by one year as tax is payable by businesses generally in the year following the year of income. The cost to revenue of investment allowance in 1976-77 and 1977-78 therefore depends on the level of investment in 1975-76 and 1976-77 respectively. (3) The 1976-77 estimate has since been reduced to SlOOm and the 1977-78 estimate, previously $550m, was put at $450m in the light of the results of a survey which suggested that the lead time (i.e. the period between the ordering of the plant-after 31 December 1975-and its installation) was greater than had been expected. Furthermore, although, onreview,the level of private investment in plant adopted for the purpose of the estimate was higher than that previously adopted, the surveyresultsindicated that the range of equipment not covered by the new allowance was greater than had been anticipated. (4) No; see answer to (3) above. (5) A revival in investment forms only pan of the Government's strategy for economic recovery. The Government's aim ever since it took office has been to achieve a balanced, sustained expansion in economic activity. The severe slump in non-dwelung investment during the first half of the 1970s has impaired the provocative capacity of the economy. Recovery is thus more than usually subject to the danger of quickly meeting supply constraints which could rekindle inflation and abort the recovery. Against that background the Government has chosen a strategy which rests at least partly on the proposition that private investment expenditure should play a conspicuous role relatively early in the course of the recovery. There is a normal tendency in the recovery process for non-dwelling investment to lag behind the recovery in other areas. The investment allowance is designed to shorten that lag by encouraging businessmen to bring forward new investment. In this way, capacity will expand as activity expands, instead of waiting until bottlenecks are encountered, by then of course it is too late. Indications are that investment in plant and equipment has, in fact, been moving in step with the overall recovery. In (Question No. 785) 1976, private gross fixed capital expenditure on plant and equipment, in constant prices, was 6.4 per cent higher than in 1975. Expenditure in the second half of 1976 was 7.6 per cent higher than in the second half of 1975. Rear Admiral B. J. Castles, CBE. (Question No. 790)",309

(4) Can he also say whether Mr Castle is now with Director Techniques des Constructions Navale of France. (5) Has this organisationrecentlybeen awarded a contract for project definition of the underway replenishment ship. Mr Killen-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Rear Admiral B. J. Castles, CBE was the Chief of Naval Technical Services during the period 15 March 1969 to 21 July 1972 and would have had responsibility for the DDL team without being a member ofit. (2) After extensive study by an Interdepanmental Committee of several systems available, a Rolls Royce propulsion system was recommended for the DDL as the most appropriate. (3) B. J. Castles and Associates, Consulting Engineers, were appointed as consultants for marine engineering matters to Rolls Royce from 25 August 1972 to 31 December 1976. (4) B. J. Castles is the Australian representative of SOFREXAN a French agency involved in the overseas marketing of Naval Matenel, including ships, built by the French Government owned shipbuilder, Direction Techniques des Constructions Navale (DTCN). (5) On 4 February 1977, Direction Techniques des Constructions Navale was awarded a contract for a Project Definiuon Study for the supply of an Underway Replenishment Ship to the Royal Australian Navy. Contractual arrangements for this Study were negotiated directly between the Australian Government and DTCN.

(Question No. 791) While the Australian Film Commission Act 1975 contains a provision (Section 12) for the Commission to keep itself on all aspects of making, promoting, distributing exhibiting films in Australia, it is not obliged to publish any of this information. Details of earnings on individualfilmsby the various sectors of the film industry are of critical commercial importo those private companies in relation to their competitors. For this reason it would seem to be preferable to keep such details confidential. However, I shall be in touch with the honourable member to see to what extent information required by him is available.

154,Mr VINER,OCCUPATIONAL CATEGORY FOR,"The Minister for Education has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) to (5) I am advised that the research project in question is the solar-ammonia project which is being conducted within the Depanment of Engineering Physics, Research School of Physical Sciences at the Australian Nauonal University. The project has been concerned with studying processes for the mass utilisation of ammonia as a means of chemical storage, with a view to developing a 10 megawatt power generation station. A power stauon of this size could supply enough electricity serve a town of 10 000 people. The solar-ammonia project has been funded from the beFirst inning of 1974 to the present time from the resources of the f Research School of Physical Sciences but the reached a stage where the level of funding required exceeds the nnanciai capabilities of the School. the research group, in their submission of May 1976 to the Senate Standing Committee on National funher development of the project to the point where a significant pilot plant could be constructed would require about $2.0m over a period of S years. On the assumption that Uniretired versity funding could continue at the current level, an additional amount of about $1.4m would be needed to reach the required level of funding.

It was cided that the School should continue to suppon the project to the end of 1977. The expectation is that the technological and economic viability of the process will then have been examined to determine the feasibility of proceeding to the first production stage of a 10 MW electrical generating stauon.

Financial constraints are such that work of an applied nature can be supported only during an initial exploratory phase, on the understanding that funding from sources outside the University must be obtained before any extension to the often much more costly development phase can proceed.

During the most recent sixmonths period for whichfiguresare available, viz., November 1976 to April 1977, these medical practitioners provided 10 007 patient consultations. (4) No. The current arrangements are that the Department of Health Services, Tasmania, proposes to impose charges equivalent to medical benefits payable in respect of professional services rendered by salaried medical practitioners at the Centre to privately insured persons. Medical benefits organisations are required to pay fund benefits in accordance with the basic medical benefits table to contributors who are charged for professional services received at the Centre. Accounts will be issued for such services by and in the name of the Department of Health Services, Tasmania, and will show the name of the medical practitioner who renders the service.

(6) Can he say whether any lar specialist referral form.",314
156,Mr HUNT,OCCUPATIONAL CATEGORY FOR,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The present referral system, which was introduced on 1 November 1970, was direcdy based on the recommendadons of a special working party which included senior representauves of the medical profession. A formal system was considered necessary because of the introduction at that time of higher benefits for rendered by specialists and consultant physicians to referred patients. The system is a formalisation of procedures which previously existed within the medical profession, and provides written evidence that a referral has taken place. The referral requirements relate solely to the payment of medical benefits. The system recognises the fundamental right of a patient to seek referral to a specialist or consultant physician, and that, when referral is requested, medical benefits are payable at the appropriate higher rate. The system also acknowledges that, as a general rule, an initial consultation by a general practitioner is in (2) The only statistical information available relates to the number of services for which specialist rate. Referral certificates may be valid for periods up to three months or twelve months and there is no way of knowing how many specialist services may be performed during these periods in respect of any referral certificate. Moreover, in the case of surgical operations, for example, a referral certificate may cover procedures performed by as many as three specialists-the surgeon, the assistant surgeon and the anaesthetist. No special staff are employed to process referral certificates. Checks to ensure that referral certificates are provided where necessary to enable benefits to be paid at the higher specialist rate are carried out as a normal assessing procedure. Notices of referral are processed by Medibank and private medical benefits funds in assessing benefits, not by the Depanment. Printing of notices of referral pads is arranged by the Department; however the current annual printing requirements are approximately 100,000 pads comprising SO notices to a pad. (3) See (2) above. (4) Information regarding 'please explain' queries is not available. There have been no prosecutions relating to referral forms. (5) Unless a referral system is used, specialists could be overwhelmed by patients, many of whom may require only G.P. treatment. The referral system is afilterfor the protection of patients, general practitioners and specialists. The current referral system is considered to be the most satisfactory method of achieving the desired result, providing a relatively easy and economical procedure which has been suc(Question No. 852) cessful in meeting the majority of cases involving the need for specialist treatment.

The referral may be to a private or salaried specialist attached to a hospital or polyclinic, or to a private practising specialist.

166,Mr LES JOHNSON,MANAGED BY COMMONWEALTH,"the Minister for Post and Telecommunications, upon nodce, on 27 May 1977: Was the omission, during the Australian Broadcasting Commission broadcast of the ANZAC Day parade in Sydney on 25 April 1977, to name clearly the group of men and women representing Australian soldiers, who were isolated and cared for by Timorese citizens in World War II an accidental omission or a result of a direction to comply with the present Government's decision to ignore the Timorese. Mr Eric Robinson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The ABC found no mention of the group in its research, conducted in collaboration with the organisers, prior to the ANZAC Day Parade, nor was such a group officially identified in the Parade itself.

There have been no increases in Australian postal rates since 1 September 1975.

Government Australian naval personnel on duty in the UK. are allowed concessional rates of postage on mail. Saturday Postal Services Mr Neil asked the Minister for Post and Telecommunications, upon notice, on 30 May 1977: (1) What is the reason for Saturday mornings. (2) What action is the Government taking to restore Saturday morning services. (3) Which post offices or sub-post offices in the Electoral Division of St George are open on Saturdays and during which hours. Mr Eric Robinson-The answer to the honourable member's quesdon is as follows: (1) Prior to 1974 a significant number of official offices had been closed on Saturdays and the Saturday trading hours of others had been reduced in accordance with a lower level of customer demand. Closure of all official post offices on Saturdays resulted from direct action in 1974 by certain staff organisations which instructed their members (including counter staff) not to attend for ovenime duty on Saturdays. Until that time, counter staff completed their weekly hours over the five days, Monday to Friday, and were rostered on overtime in order to provide counter services on Saturdays. (Question No. 954) Negotiations with staff organisations to re-open some official post offices on Saturday mornings were not successful. Studies showed that it was not practicable to provide counter services on Saturdays under any acceptable rostering arrangement whereby the Saturday duty could be regarded as normal duty withtimeoff in lieu during the week. Additionally, cost benefit analyses have been made on the re-opening on Saturday mornings of those official post offices which, prior to 1974, did provide a Saturday service. On the basis of providing a counter service only, costs (at current prices) would be to the order of $4.8 milhon a year. At many of the offices, the costs involved would not be justified by the service demand, and overall, it is most unlikely that any significant additional revenue would be earned. (2) Recent surveys have indicated low demand for Saturday counter services at many non-official post offices that do provide services on Saturdays. Based on these surveys and for the economic reasons given in (1), the reintroduction of services at official post offices on Saturdays is unlikely. Postal services continue to be provided at those non-official post offices where there is a reasonably high demand for counter services on Saturdays. (Question No. 959) (3) The following non-official post offices in the St George Electorate are open on Saturdays and provide a counter service from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m.: Banksia; Bardwell Park; Bexley North; Bexley South; Carlton; Clemton Park; Earlwood West; Kingsway West. to 45c; if so, what is the reason. Suitability and Performance of Commonwealth Vehicles (Question No. 977) travelling overseas are subject to Mr Scholes asked the Minister representing the Minister for Administradve Services, upon notice, on 30 May 1977: (1) Are Commonwealth employees who regularly drive cars, buses or other vehicles, consulted regularly in relation to the suitability and performance of vehicles purchased by the Commonwealth which they drive or operate. (2) If not, will the Minister examine the possibility of requesting drivers to supply a statement of suitability and performance at regular intervals. (Question Na 969) (3) Will the Minister consult with his Department, unions, vehicle manufacturers and automobile organisations to establish what information could be useful as a result of these surveys of drivers. post offices remaining closed on Mr Street-The Minister for Administradve Services has provided the following answer to the honourable member's quesuon. (1) Yes. Discussions are held on an informal basis with individual drivers or formally with union representatives. (2) See answer to (1) above. (3) My Department consults with unions and vehicle manufacturers and attimeswith automobile organisations regarding suitablity and performance of vehicles, including drivers' views on these matters. Inclusions in New Zealand-Australia Free Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Overseas Trade, upon notice, on 30 May 1977: (1) What procedures are adopted by his Department to determine whether or not an industry will be affected by the inclusion of a commodity in Schedule A of NAFTA. (2) Is the industry organisation always contacted; if not, why not. (3) If so, was the Australian Mushroom Growers' Association contacted prior to New Zealand being notified that there were no Australian objections to fresh mushrooms being included in Schedule A; if not, why not.",324
167,Mr ANTHONY,MANAGED BY COMMONWEALTH,"The answer to the honourable member's quesdon is as follows: (1) Nominations for the addition of goods to Schedule A of NAFTA are received and exchanged by both Governments on a regular basis. In Australia the Department of Overseas Trade is primarily responsible for the preliminary examination of such nominations, in close consultation with the Department of Industry and Commerce and Primary Industry depending on the nature of the goods under consideration. Acting on the advice of the relevant Department that, on a prima facie basis, inclusion of the goods in Schedule A would not be detrimental to the particular local industry, and provided the nomination is acceptable to the New Zealand Government, the proposal is widely advertised in both countries. In Australia an advertisement giving notice of nominations under consideration is placed in all the major daily newspapers and a considerable number of industry associations, lobby groups and interested individuals receive a circularised notification of the proposals. Interested parties have a period of 60 days within which they may comment either in support of or in the event that objections to particular nominations are substantiated, by reference to the Industries Assistance Commission, if necessary, the goods are not added to the Schedule. (2) As outlined above considerable efforts are made by several Government Depanments to acquaint interested panies with proposals for the addition of goods to Schedule A of NAFTA. The procedures currently followed have been in operation since the Free Trade Agreement came into effect in 1966 and the method of notification of proposals is consistent with that normally adopted in similar circumstances by other Government Depanments and agencies. While the Depanments concerned endeavour to directly contact known industry organisations, ible to ensure that every interested pany is consulted in this way. However, all nominations are subject to public scrutiny for two months and it is considered portunity for comment. (3) In view of the fact that mushrooms are already traded duty free between Australia and New Zealand, it was not expected that inclusion of the goods in Schedule A would be detrimental to the local industry. The proposal to include fresh mushrooms in Schedule A of NAFTA was publicly notified on 17 March 1977. Subsequently, the Secretary of the Australian Mushroom Growers' Association has had frequent contact with officers of the Depanment of Overseas Trade and, as a result of these discussions, the inclusion of fresh mushrooms in Schedule A has been deferred. In accordance with normal procedure it is proposed that a reference will be made to the Industries Assistance Commission for enquiry and repon as to whether the inclusion in Schedule A of these goods would be detrimental to the Australian industry. Trade Agreement Petrol Consumption of Motor Vehicles (Question No. 982) (Question No. 987) Mr Jacobi asked the Minister for National Resources, upon notice, on 31 May 1977: (1) Has he studied the United States legislation which sets standards for the petrol consumption of motor vehicles. (2) Has this matter and other recent US. initiatives been considered by the interdepanmental committee which is studying the repons of the Royal Commission on Petroleum. (3) If so, has the Australian motor vehicle industry been consulted about any technical and economic problems which might arise from possible petrol conservation measures.",325
168,Mr ANTHONY,MANAGED BY COMMONWEALTH,"The following is the answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Departmental officers have examined the United States legislation. (2) The Royal Commission on Petroleum did not specifically give attention to the American legislation and this matter was therefore not covered by the relevant interdepanmental committee. (3) Energy conservation measures are being actively examined by the National Energy Advisory Committee. Approaches have been made to the Australian motor vehicle industry and funher consultations are scheduled to take place in the near future. Employment of School Leavers (Question No. 998) Mr Charles Jones asked the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, upon notice, on 31 May 1977: opposition to the nominations.

175,Mr STALEY,MANAGED BY COMMONWEALTH,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) to (6) I refer the honourable member to the Prime Minister's reply to Quesuon on Notice No. 1003. Frequency Warrants Mr Jull asked the Minister for Post and Telecommunications, upon nodce, on 1 June 1977: (1) Does he intend to issue frequency warrants to operators of television and radio stations in Australia; if so, for what purpose. (2) Does he intend to follow the course outlined in the Green Report at pages A130 to A132 in this regard; if not, what procedures will be adopted. (3) Will frequency warrants automatically be granted to every holder of a broadcasting ing of a licence by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. (4) Will the same conditions (5) Will the Australian Broadcasting Commission stations also be granted a frequency warrant; if not, why not. (6) Under what circumstances would a warrant be withdrawn from an operator. (7) Would frequency drift be considered just grounds to revoke a warrant; if so, would the ABC also be subjected to this provision; if not, why not. (8) What action would be taken prior to his final decision to revoke a frequency warrant. (9) After 30 years of broadcasting in Australia, why, in 1977, does he consider it necessary to institute such a system. (10) Under the system of frequency warrants, will a broadcasting licence holder be unable to operate a radio or television stauon should his warrant be withdrawn; if so, will it be primarily the listening or viewing public who will suffer from the blackout of a radio or television station. (11) Can he say whether in the United States of America the Federal Communications Commission imposes fines on operators who breach broadcasting regulations. (12) If so, has this system not, why not. (13) Would this system be more advantageous for the Australian listener or viewer, rather than a complete withdrawal of a licence. (14) Is he prepared to reconsider the whole matter of frequency warrants in the interest of the radio listeners and television viewers of Australia. Mr Eric Robinson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. Frequency warrants will be issued as part of the process of allocating frequencies for broadcasting services. (2) Yes. (3) Yes. (4) Yes. (5) Yes. (6) In cases of gross and/or repeated instances of technical malpractice-particularl y matters affecting other services such as the use of an incorrect operating frequency, excessive spurious radiations, excessive power and so on. (7) Yes. If the drift was so excessive as to cause harmful interference to another service, and if reasonable steps had not been taken to correct the drift. These provisions would apply to all users. (8) A suitable warning would be given to remedy the technical problem concerned. This warning would also give notice of intention to withdraw the frequency warrant if no corrective action was taken within a reasonable time period as specified. (Question No. 1031) (9) Under the revised broadcasting system a number of powers previously held by the Minister and the former Australian Broadcasting Control Board become the responsibility of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. However, the management of the radio frequency spectrum with its international obligations must remain a Government responsibility, and will now be separately discharged through the issue of frequency warrants. (10) Yes. However since a frequency warrant would only be withdrawn in cases of gross technical malpractice, any action taken in this regard would be very much in the public interest. licence, following the grant(11) No detailed study has been made of this matter see (12). apply for renewal of licences. (12) A system of fines has not been considered for Australia as such a system is felt to be totally inappropriate as a means of rectifying major breaches of technical standards which are causing substantial interference. Breaches of this nature require correction, rather than a penalty by way of a fine. (13) See(l2). (14) As one of the basic aims of the frequency warrant system is to protect the interests of radio listeners and television viewers in Australia, there would appear to be no necessity to review the system at this stage. Establishment of Broadcasting Council (Question No. 1032) Mr Jull asked the Minister for Post and Telecommunications, upon notice, on 1 June 1977: (1) Is it still the intention of the Government to establish a Broadcasting Council; if so, when. (2) What will be the composition of the Council and its functions when it is established. been considered for Australia; if (3) To what degree will the Council be involved in the future planning of the broadcasting industry in Australia. Mr Eric Robinson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) It has now been decided to defer the establishment of a Broadcasting Council until the Government has had the opportunity to consider the report and recommendations of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal following completion of its inquiry into broadcasting standards and the concept of self-regulation. As the proposals included in the Green Report for the formation of a Broadcasting Council envisaged a significant role for such a Council into matters of programming and advertising standards, as well as broadcasting planning, it has been considered desirable that there should be a clearer understanding of the manner in which matters of regulation within the industry is likely to be administered in the future before a Council of this nature is finally established. (2) The composition of the Council, and its functions, will be reviewed in association with the points raised in (1). (3) See(2).

These potatoes are imponed only for processing under quarantine supervision, and must be free packed in clean containers. There is no quarantine restriction on the impon of frozen or processed potatoes non-viable and do not present a quarantine risk. (b) Avocados may only be imported from areas free of the disease sunblotch, or from groves which have been certified free of the disease by an acceptable authority.

(2) What other freight subsidies are paid in respect of stock or goods entering or leaving the Northern Territory, and what has been the cost of these subsidies in the same period. (3) What amount has been paid on subsidising freight of cattle within the Northern Territory in the same 6 months.

Airport Ratings (Question No. 1065) Mr Morris asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 2 June 1977: (1) Has he received the repon of the study into the 3 airports given 'black star' ratings by the International Federation of Airline Pilots in April 1977. (2) If so, when will he table the repon in the Parliament. samples of new varieties may are sub Mr Nixon-The answer to the honourable for two years. member's question is as follows: in Australia, potatoes may (1) 1I have received a report from my Department regarding the 'black star' ratings given to Kalgoorlie, Meekatharra of soil and and Learmonth aerodromes by IFALP A.

(b) it is recognised that this standard is met at all international airports in Australia, but not at some internauonal alternate airports. (c) it is clearly uneconomic to provide RFF services at all international alternate airports in Australia, considering the very few international aircraft diversions that some are required to accommodate e.g. during 1976, Freight Subsidies only seven international aircraft had cause to divert from Perth Airport to a suitable international alter(Question No. 1051) nate airpon. - 4 Boeing 707's diverted to Meekatharra - 2 Boeing 747's and I DC-8 diverted to Learmonth - Kalgoorli e is no longer used as an alternate for international aircraft. (d) it is not possible to equip all airports in Australia with a full range of aviation facilities and it is imponant to so locate facilities as to ensure that they give the best possible service to the aviation industry as a whole. (e) Australia is ranked amongst those countries enjoying the best safety records in the world, largely because of the very high safety standards set by the Depanment ofTranspon.",330
