I am delighted that the member for Rankin, legislation, apart from his tirade on the industrial opposition are taking a second guess to have I think, 2008, or at some later date, when most for Corio will no doubt make allegations that has said on a number of occasions. That is not tariffs have a downward trend, and this legislation I place on the public record the good work Corio worked.

The ACIS Bill 2003, as it is known, is part policies and it implements the post-2005 government tariff reform. So it is on the downward trend; five per cent with the provision of ACIS in helping is an extension of ACIS until 2015 and, if money allocated to the car industry in research changes. It will assist the imported motor tariff will be reduced from 10 per cent to five The government has picked that up but in part has picked it up through the identification of $150 of ACIS of that pool for the car makers. about the reductions in tariffs that seem this government: go for the main game.

It is easy to understand how other sectors can be undermined by recklessly large tartariff regimes can be counterproductive in not supported innovation, have not supported improved quality. The important thing down while the industry tools up. That is exactly in 1995 we had a tariff of 27.5 per cent and our vehicles and exported 23,940 of them.
