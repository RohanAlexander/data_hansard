1,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"Las t night, when the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Marr) was addressing himself to the Supply motion, and. speaking of proposing to reduce-the vote iby £1, to direct attention to the lack of provision for works at Canberra, I made an interjection, and the incident is reported in this morning's Age as follows:When Mr Marr repeated his threat, the Treasurer waved an admonitory finger at him, and said, playfully, "" Now, now, no threats,"" and added that he would hand over £1 straight away if necessary. "" No,"" retorted Mr Marr, "" 1 want my pound offlesh.""Then Mr Jowett came to light. "" There,"" he said, "" the Shylock of Australia."" Mr Marr sat down amid laughter. I had not the remotest intention of referring to my honourable, most amiable, and generous friend, the honourable member for Parkes, as "" the Shylock of Australia""; what.I intended to convey by the interjection was that, on present indications, Canberra is the Shylock oT Australia. . Mr EiucY - I submit that the concluding - sentence of the honourable member went beyond the matter of a personal explanation, and was a reflection upon the House.",19
2,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,I did ; not - understand the honourable member to reflect on any - honourable member of the House.,20
3,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"Certainl y not. I regret that such an impression should 'have been oonveyed bymy remark, and I apologize for it. FATHER JERGER. NA",20
4,Mr RY AN,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"the Attorney General, v,pon notice I. Is it a fact that the Government are guaranteeing the costs and undertaking the defence of Sir Granville Eyrie in an action for defamation now pending against him in the Supreme Court of Victoria at the suit of The Reverend .Charles Jerger ? 2. If so, will he set out the exact reasons for so doing?",20
5,Mr HUGHES,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. Yes. 2. Because the speech in question was made by Sir Granville Ryrie in his capacity as Assistant Minister for Defence. PEACE WITH AUSTRIA.,20
6,Mr RY AN,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"the Prime Minister, upon notice I. Will he ascertain and cause to be laid on the table of the Bouse the exact terms of the Imperial Order in Council declaring peace with Austria ? 2. From what date was the declaration of peace to operate, as set out in the said Order m Council? 3. What is the exact description of the parties as referred to in the said Order in Council?",20
7,Mr HUGHES,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,Ful l information will be furnished as soon as possible. WAR BONDS. PROBATE DUTIES.,20
8,Mr LAZZARIN I,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"the Treasurer, upon notice I. Whether it is a fact that the Government allow war bonds to be accepted in payment of probate duties? 2. Is it a fact that wealthy people buy these bonds at £01 or £92 on the Stock Exchange, and tender them to the Government in payment of probate duties at par value, £100? 3 - Will he take steps to stop this great leakage of Commonwealth revenue, especially now, when the Government are in such urgent need of funds? Sir JOSEPH ;GOOK-The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. Yes. 2. Bonds purchased on the market may. be tendered in payment of probate duties. The Government is not aware at what prices .bonds have been purchased for this purpose. 3. There is no leakage of revenue, because ' for every £100 paid by the surrender of bonds, the Commonwealth's indebtedness under the war loans, for a similar amount, is cancelled. Whoever may lose in these transactions, the Government do not. SECOND PEACE LOAN. SECKETABY, VICTOBIAN NATIONAL FEDEBATION.  asked the Treasurer, upon notice I. Whether it is true that the secretary of the Victorian National Federation has been appointed to the Publicity Committee of the Second Peace Loan? 2. If so, in what capacity? 3. If so, what is the amount - of salary, if any, that he is to be paid? 4. If so, whether such appointment of a prominent political party organizer is wise, in view of the non-party nature of the appeal?",20
9,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. Yes. 2. In - a private capacity, as an honorary member. 3. .No salary or other remuneration is paid. 4. The gentleman concerned was not appointed as a representative of, or because of his association with, a political party, but solely because his special experience in war loan organization and publicity work would benefit the loan campaign. The Government seeks the aid of all classes, without regard to their political associations. DEFENCE EMPLOYEES.",20

12,Mr TUDOR,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"for Dr MALONET) asked the Minister for Trade and Customs, upon noticeIn view of the fact that the managing director of Robert Harper and Company, giving evidence before the Fair Profits Commission, as reported in yesterday's papers, states that it takes 120 bushels of oats to produce a ton of oatmeal, and as this varies from other sworn evidence given before the same Commission, will the Minister kindly inform the House(a) the average weight of oats to produce a ton of oatmeal to make a short ton of 2,000 lbs. weight; (6) the amount of oats to produce a long ton of 2,240 lbs.; (c) what is a fair price for gristing a short ton of oatmeal; (d) what is a fair price for gristing a long ton of oatmeal?",21
13,Mr MASSYGREENE,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,The information is being obtained. ORDER OF BUSINESS.,21
14,Mr HUGHES,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"Bendigo-Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [11.11] - I move That on each sitting day, unless otherwise ordered, Government business shall take precedence of general business. In submitting the motion, I remind honourable members of the state of the business-paper and the position of the House. Many measures of great importance await consideration, and, although Parliament has been in session for some five months, little business has been done. I shall not animadvert upon the causes of this state of affairs, but as it is the duty of the Government to see that the business of the country is proceeded with expeditiously, I would remind the House of some of the measures that have to be dealt with. ' First of all, there is the Tariff. Some honourable members have not sat through a Tariff debate, but I am one of those who have done so. If I remember aright, the first Tariff occupied the attention of Parliament for about twelve months.",21
15,Mr TUDOR,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,For sixteen months.,21
16,Mr HUGHES,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"At that time my position in regard to the Tariff was different from what it is now, and that may make some little difference in the length of the debates, but a man would be an intolerable optimist who could imagine that the Tariff could be disposed of in a short time. During a Tariff discussion the ordinary party lines are not drawn, and when I had the honour of association with my friends opposite during the last Tariff discussion, it was a common thing, for us to the hopelessly divided on various items. The circumstances in which I now find myself will prevent me from shaking a free leg, so to speak, when the present Tariff is discussed, but every honourable member who is not a Minister will be free of party ties regarding it. Then there is finance. That is, to say the least of it, a matter that requires consideration by this Parliament. Our position is serious enough, and we should not be doing our duty to the country unless we gave to financial problems that consideration which is due. Then there is the question of the Estimates. An early opportunity to discuss them has been askedi for, and a promise has been given that they shall be discussed. That promise will be fulfilled. But clearly one of the conditions precedent to the fulfilment of that or any promise is that opportunity shall be given for the despatch of public business. There is also the problem of defence. Nobody has said anything about that so far. But it is clearly one of those questions that must be faced. There is room for difference of opinion as to the scope of our defence policy, and the amount which should be expended upon it, but I think no one will deny that some policy is necessary. We shall require time to consider that matter. There is the question of the civil administration of the Pacific Islands, and the giving of effect to the mandates. In addition, there is the group of three Bills relating to industrial mattei'3. One is already before the House, and it is to be followed by the Public Service Bill and the Bill for the amendment of the Arbitration Act. Other Bills of great importance must be brought before Parliament. The honourable member for Dalley (Mr Mahony) has brought under my notice a matter which, owing to the unearthly hour at which this Chamber persists in meeting on Friday, had escaped my notice, l i e reminds me that the business of the House cannot be effectively carried on until the seat of this Parliament is removed to Canberra. The honourable member for Yarra (Mr Tudor) can argue that matter with the honourable member for Dalley ad lib. We have .wasted a great deal of time. We must now make up for our lost opporfoinities, and whilst I should be the last to say that the discussions which take place on private members' day are not interesting - the y are full of interest, and yesterday was a most enjoyable day-ye t they do not advance the business of the House. Therefore, I am asking honourable members to allow Government business to take precedence of private members' business. I am perfectly prepared to pledge myself and the Government to allow a week to private members' business at the close of the session. Honourable members laugh; I suppose that the contemplation of a whole week is a little too much for them. But I do say, not necessarily for publication, but as evidence of ray bona fides, that I promise honourable members an opportunity before the close of the session to deal with those private motions which now appear upon the notice-paper. Therefore, since the opportunities of honourable members to deal with such business will not be denied, but merely delayed, I ask them to agree to this motion without much discussion. assure them that there are many measures which they and I alike agree are necessary to be dealt with. The Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) reminds me that next Thursday is '^Grievance Day."" That is an additional reason why honourable members should vote for the motion. I shall not argue the question further. Honourable members understand the position, and I promise those who have notices of motion upon the business-paper that they shall have a week for their consideration at the end of the session.",21
17,Mr MAHONY,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,Dalley) [11.22] - I am surprised that the Prime Minister should have moved' this motion when most important motions have been placed on the notice-paper by private members. The first item for next Thursday is an urgent motion in the name of the honourable member for Nepean (Mr Bowden) in relation to the Federal Capital.,22
18,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,Honourable members were discussing that matter on the Supply Bill last night.,22
19,Mr HUGHES,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,And it can be discussed under cover of grievances.,22
20,Mr MAHONY,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"The matter was being discussed last night for a few moments, but we desire a serious discusable sion upon it, and an opportunity for House to say to the Government that the Bill? construction of the Capital at Canberra shall be proceeded with. Honourable members who represent Victorian constituencies may laugh, but they must remember that New South Wales, which provides three-fourths of the revenue of the Commonwealth, will demand that this contract shall be carried out. The notice of motion in the name of the honourable member for Nepean (Mr Bowden) reads(1) That pursuant to the resolution passed by this House on 27th May, 1915, and in view of the importance of having the Commonwealth Parliament removed at the earliest opportunity from influences inseparable from its location in any of the existing State capitals, in the opinion of this House the building of the Parliament Houses and Administrative Offices and other necessary works should be proceeded with at the earliest possible opportunity. (2) That the carrying of this resolution be an instruction to the Government to take all necessary steps to expedite the construction of the necessary accommodation. The discussion of that motion will provide an opportunity to honourable memI bers to decide by their votes whether the compact entered into by the various States with New South Wales shall be honoured. That compact was made, and it is of no use",22
21,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE," The honourable member may state reasons why the motion in relation to the Federal Capital should be discussed, but he will not be in order in discussing the question in detail now.",22
22,Mr MAHONY,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"I . desire only to show the effect of depriving private members of their right to bring before the House most important matters. We desire an opportunity to show reasons why the work at Canberra should be proceeded with immediately, and to inform the House of the action which New South Wales will take if it is to be fooled any longer in regard to this question.",22
23,Mr MCWILLIAMS,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,The question can . be tested just as well on a motion to reduce Supply by £1.,22
24,Mr MAHONY,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,We should have an opportunity for a full and free discussion on a definite motion. In connection with a Supply Bill there are many important matters which require consideration,22
25,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,Why is the honormember now blocking the considerathe tion of Canberra by delaying the Supply,22
26,Mr MAHONY,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"The effect of the motion proposed by the Prime Minister is to block discussion on the motion standing on the notice-paper in the name of the honourable member for Nepean. The Prime Minister's proposal is brought forward for no other purpose. Cabinet on looking through the business-paper has discovered that the first item of business for next private members' day is a motion relating to the Federal Capital, and Ministers have decided that the House must not be allowed an opportunity of voting upon the question, because they know that the majority of honourable members are in favour pf the contract with New South ""Wales being carried out.",23
27,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"The honourable member is absolutely blocking the op-, portunity which is here now. Mr MAHONY;-The . Treasurer knows that that is not so. Another important motion, in the name of the honourable member for Angas (Mr Gabb), relates to internment camps. There are many other motions upon the notice-paper which the House should have an opportunity to consider. The statement of - the Treasurer that any of these matters can be - discussed upon the Supply Bill is so much hot air, because he knows that the Government are determined to get the Bill through this House today, and they will take all sorts of care that we are not given an opportunity of discussing these important questions upon the Bill. The proposal to prevent honourable members bringing before the House, upon private members' day, matters affecting their constituencies, and the welfare of Australia generally, is an infringement of our rights, and the Government should be told clearly that we demand an opportunity to deal with these questions.",23
28,Mr BAMFORD,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,The Prime Minister has promised honourable members a week at the end of the session.,23
29,Mr MAHONY,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"The Prime Minister, in his usual light and airy manner, dangled before honourable members the promise of a week at the end of the session for the discussion of private members' business. There will probably be a sixmonths' recess at the end of the session, and this will give us plenty of time to afterwards ? stay at home and meditate on our foolishness if we allow this motion to pass. It that to the judgment of the House. will be useless for honourable members i complain later on that they have had noopportunity to discuss important questions. Every honourable member has his responsibilities just as much as have the Government, and we, therefore, have every right to discuss private business.",23
30,Mr MCWILLIAMS,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"Franklin) [11.31]. - The time has arrived when we ought to seriously consider our position. The measures we have to deal with this session are, perhaps, the most important that have come before the House since I have had the honour of a seat here. A Bill was introduced last night, and if the desire is to murder it in its cradle, the most effective way is to rush it through without its being thoroughly considered by those interested. Then there is the question of finance, which demands our closest attention. I have always been one to stand for the rights of this Chamber, but the. time has come when we ought to put our "" neck to the collar,"" and proceed with the business of the country. I shall support the motion on the distinct understanding that those honourable members who have not the opportunity now to discuss proposals which they desire to bring before the House shall be given an opportunity later on. I am quite certain that the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Mahony), after the briefest reflection, will see that a much more effective way of dealing with the question - of the Capital is that suggested by the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Marr). Knowing what is going on outside, and realizing the feeling on all sides of the House regarding the Federal Capital, I say deliberately that it is time that question was settled one way or the other. Personally, I am opposed to the proposal to remove to Canberra, and would favour the Seat of Government being in Sydney for the next ten years. At present we are spending money in the Federal area in a wasteful manner with no good results. What is the attitude of Parliament in regard to the establishment of the Capital in the immediate future? As I say, I favour the Federal Parliament sitting in Sydney for the next ten years.",23
31,Mr WATKINS,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,Where would it go,23
32,Mr MCWILLIAMS,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"I would leave I to have always advocated Parliament sitting four days in the week. It is not fair to honourable members who come from Queensland, Western Australia, and Tasmania that we shou d meet here on only three days, because they practically have to live in Melbourne from the day Parliament opens until it is prorogued. When .the House rises at 4.30 on Friday the honourable members to whom I refer have to remain in Melbourne until 3 o'clock on Wednesday; and, now that Parliament, in its wisdom, has increased the salaries of honourable members, it is only fair that we should put in one more day's work. At the present time there are practically only two days a week for Governmentbusiness, and I am therefore prepared to give up private members' day, but I do urge that we should meet on Tuesdav, the result of which would be to give us as many actual Government days in the week as we now get in a fortnight. The Prime Minister has certainly not over-estimated the important work that awaits us; and it is high time we proceeded with the measures that must be discussed before Parliament rises. I ask the Government to consider very seriously the suggestion to sit four days a week, though not next week, seeing that honourable members must have made their arrangements.",23
33,Mr MAHONY,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,Is that a threat to the Government ?,24
34,Mr MCWILLIAMS,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"I never threaten the Government, but. I ask them, in view of the great, importance of the measures to come before us, to call Parliament together on an extra day. This would give ample time for measures to be discussed as they ought to be discussed, instead of, as in the past, leaving many to the end of the session only to be rushed through one after the other, thus necessitating amending legislation when Parliament meets again. Let us give the Government the extra day in the week, and hold them fully and completely responsible for both the matter of the business and the manner in which it is conducted.  in ful l sympathy with giving the Government and Parl ament ample opportunity : to deal with measures of such paramount importance as those which are to come before us; but I do not think that the proposal of the Prime Minister is the proper one. I quite agree with the honourable member for Franklin (Mr MCWilliams) that this House should sit for more days in the week. The present arl rangement may be all very well for some honourable members, but it means stringing the session out over the whole year. There are other honourable members who have no opportunity to visit their constituencies or tlieir homes at the week-end; whereas if we sat five days a week instead of two and a half, we might get through our work in much shorter time; and, further, private members' business would not be put in the quarantine-box. I am not too sure that a week at the fag end of a session would afford any reasonable opportunity for the discussion of private members' business. For instance, there is the measure which I propose to ask permission to introduce, and which, if accepted, might result in saving sufficient money to pay the first instalment of the cost of the Eederal Capital, and that important measure must be delayed by the Prime Minister's proposal. However, I strongly support the idea that we should sit at least one more day in. the week until we have concluded the work of the country; then, if. honourable members were so inclined, we might revert to the present laissez faire system.",24
35,Mr GABB,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"Angas) [11.40] - I move That all the words after ""That"" be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" this House meet on Tuesday, Wednesday,- Thursday, and. Friday of each, week."" This amendment may not be popular with all lionorable members, but that fact does not deter me from moving it. We are sent here to do the business of the country, and as we are well paid, it is our duty to come here and do it. A second reason I have for submitting the amendment is that I have, a motion on the business paper for next week dealing with the question of the internment camps. The last time that motion was before tihe House, the representatives of. the Governr ment took care not to say one word, but; as it were, hid themselves; and honourable members on the Government side, generally, did not seem inclined to deal with the question. It is remarkable that just when the turn for that motion should have arrived-and it is an important motion to those concerned-w e have a proment posal this morning to shelve it for rest of the session.",24
36,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"The honourable usual ? member knows that next Thursday is "" Grievance Day.""",25
37,Mr GABB,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,Quite so; but that would not prevent my motion coming on.,25
38,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"""Grievanc e Day "" will give the honourable member an opporness tunity to bring the matter forward.",25
39,Mr GABB,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"I do not think so. Seeing that my motion is on the business-paper, at any rate I shall not be able to take day. the question to a vote, as I should under ordinary circumstances. Probably the Government would talk the motion out; if so, that would be exactly what is needed to show them in their true colours. I notice that the honourable member for. Wakefield (Mr Richard Foster) is getting a little excited; but I should like his constituents to know where he stands this question; and there are other honourable members who, by interjections which do not get into Hansard, have tried to "" rub it into "" me. Another important motion on the paper is that by the honfor orable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr. Austin Chapman) for the calling together of a Convention to deal with an amendproposal ment of the Constitution. What chance will there be, if the motion before carried, of that proposal being considered The Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) told us that the Convention matter was to be brought up at the Premiers' Conference; but was anything done? If the Governonly ment vote against my amendment, the public will know which members are trybut ing to do the work for which they are paid, and which members are not.",25
40,Mr ROBERT COOK,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,Indi) [11.45] I rise to second an amendment which has for its object the providing of day for work.,25
41,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE," The amendment is not in order. The motion is that Government business shall take precedence of private members' business on each sitting day. The amendment deals with an entirely different matter, that is to say, an extra sitting day, and, therefore, does not apat the week-end. pear to me to be applicable or relevant to the motion. It is a matter that should be the subject of a separate motion.",25
42,Mr GABB,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"Could I submit an amend that Government business shall take the precedence on three days a week, while private members' business is taken as",25
43,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"No ; that would be a direct negative. The motion specifies no particular days of meeting, but states that Government business shall take precedence of private members' busion each sitting day. , The sitting days may be three, four, or five a week.",25
44,Mr JOWETT,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,It is clear that honourable members cannot amend the motion for the purpose of providing an extra sitting,25
45,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,I have already intimated' that the proper procedure to secure an extra day of sitting is to bring forward a separate motion. No amendment to provide for an extra sitting day is relevant to a motion which states that Government business shall take preon cedence on each sitting day.,25
46,Mr JOWETT,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"Grampians) [11.49] Apparently honourable members who desire that the House should sit on an extra day in each week have no choice but to vote or against the motion. There is a considerable body of opinion in the House in favour of making the Prime Minister's more effective for the carrying on of business by sitting an extra day, and us is I would ask the Minister (Sir Joseph ? Cook), who is, for the time beiug, in charge of the House, if he is prepared to withdraw the motion at the present stage, and move on a subsequent occasion, not that Government business shall take precedence of private members' business, also that the House shall sit on Tuesdays for the remainder of the session. Otherwise many honourable members who desire to increase the means of getting on with business may feel compelled to vote against a motion which they consider is an extra not sufficiently effective.",25
47,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"Parramatta[11.51] - The present sitting days were fixed in 1913, when I was Prime Minister. Previously the House met four days in each week, but it was a very inconvenient arrangement. It was impossible for honourable members living in other States to attend to their businesses  those who are compelled to live in Melbourne the whole year round?",25
48,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"Then they can-' not have any businesses in their States to which they can personally attend. Honourable ' members whose homes are in other States found it very inconvenient to have to leave for Melbourne every Monday, in order to attend a sitting of the House oh Tuesday. Those were the circumstances in which the change was made from four sitting days to three sitting days in each week. The question of an extra sitting day is not connected with the other matter of permitting Government business to take precedence over private members' business. Even when we were sitting four days a week, it was the rule, when the session had been going for a while, and when the notice-paper began to become congested with important business, to wi|pe out vate members' day.  is the excuse for the motion, would not be met by sitting an extra day in each week?",26
49,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"That is a matter which should be raised as an entirely separate question. If honourable members are anxious to sit on Tuesdays, theGo- do so. vernment must try to accommodate itself to that condition of affairs.",26
50,Mr CONSEDINE,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,Yes ; bow your neck to the storm.,26
51,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"I would regard it.as acting in a democratic way. But the honourable member does not believe in Democracy. He believes in the big stick, and in Lenin's "" dictation of the proletariat."" Long ago he left all his democratic opinions behind him,- and, therefore, cannot understand me when I suggest that the Government should pay some regard to the opinion of a democratic assembly. I suggest that honourable members should accept the motion today, as nothing important will happen, even is agreed to. Private members' business is not of first-rate importance. At any rate, it is not .so important as Government business is. The question of sitting on an extra day may very well be considered, and, in the face of a congested business-papeT, I think the Government will soon be compelled to ask members to sit on an extra day per week, as well as give the additional time for which we are now asking. [130]",26
52,Mr CHARLTON,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"Hunter) [11.55LI am entirely in accord with the motion. I £iave had considerable experience in a State Legislature, and in the Commonwealth Parliament, but so far I have not discovered that there is any utility in placing private members' motions on the notice-paper. I have never placed one on the business-sheet, either in the State House, or in the Commonwealth Parliament, because I realized the futility of doing so. The adoption of a motion submitted by a private member leads nowhere. I have never heard of any good being done by it.",26
53,Mr BEENNAN,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,Did not the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney) succeed in carrying a motion in favour pri- of the initiative and referendum?,26
54,Mr CHARLTON,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"Yes ; but what good has come of it? ""What becomes of it any motion carried on private members' day? It is a waste of time for the House to deal with private members' business when there is no means of giving effect to any resolution adopted unless the Government, who alone can take action to give the necessary effect to it, see fit to",26
55,Mr MAHONY,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,Honourable members can force the Government to take the necessary action.,26
56,Mr CHARLTON,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,I have never seen it done.  an extra day?,26
57,Mr CHARLTON,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"Apparentl y the honourable member, who is so anxious to get on with the business of the country, wants the extra sitting day for the discussion of private members' business, the futility of which I have just been endeavouring to point out. Has anything been achieved by the Thursday sittings, at which private members' business is dis^ if it cussed? The answer is "" No . """,26
58,Mr GABB,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,Because the Government always talk out private members' busiDGSS.,26
59,Mr CHARLTON,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"If the honourable member were on the Government bench he would do the same thing. The Go* vernment are placed in power by a majority, and will give effect to anything, which meets with their approval. I remember the occasion when honourable. members' made representations to the Government, led by the right honourable gentleman (Sir Joseph Cook), pointing out how very inconvenient it was for honourable' members who visited their electorates at the week-end to be obliged to return to Melbourne to attend sittings on - Tuesdays. We left it to the Government - to increase the sitting days, if a't any time during the course of the session they found it necessary to do so on account of the congestion of business. The same practice should apply today. If it is found that we cannot get through all our business before Christmas, the Government, .1 presume, will ask us to sit on an extra day. My experience is that very - little is done in Parliament the first couple of months session. Members do not get down properly to work until towards the end of the session. As' I regard private members' day as a waste of time, I support the proposal to wipe it out. The further question of the extra sitting day can be left to the Government for future decision. , Mr RICHARD FOSTER (Wakefield) [11.59] - I am entirely in accord with what the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton) has said regarding private members' day, but, while I support the motion, I would ask the Government to give earnest consideration to the question of meeting on an extra day. On top of a lot of business of the greatest importance, and the utmost urgency, we have yet to deal with the Tariff. The people want to know what the Tariff will be. We ought not to consider our own interests at a time like this, but should consider the interests of the people of the country, and settle the Tariff as speedily as possible. I hope, that the Government will make up their minds, at all events, the' week after next, to ask the House to meet on an extra day.",26
60,Mr CONSIDINE,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"Barrier) [12.0]. - I oppose the motion. The honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton) that in his opinion private members' business was of no use, and that the time devoted to it was practically wasted. That may be true; but, on the other hand, the conduct of business by the vernment is such that honourable members have ho opportunity to discuss measures as they should be discussed in an assembly representative of the people. We have recently had illustrations of the petulance of Ministers. The latest occasion was that on which the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook), as soon as he had had his say, promptly moved the ""gag."" 'lionorable members have bad experience of the Government intimating without warning that a measure is to be regarded as being of urgent importance^ and that it must be rushed through within a specific time. Quite a number of measures, before this Chamber and foreshadowed, are of considerable importance to the people; whether they are so recognised by some honourable members is during another matter. There are Bills, for of a example, having to do with immigration, and with passports; and there are several others beside, of which the Government have given notice, which will arouse quite a deal of discussion. It is the duty of those who claim to have the interests of the people at heart to very critically examine all these measures, but that cannot ; %\ be done in the limited time devoted to the affairs of Parliament at present, I shall certainly oppose any proposition to give precedence to Government business, so long as no provision is made for honourable members to adequately discuss matters put before them. Only the other day the Prime Minister (Mr Huclies), speaking in Bendigo, announced his intention to push through a certain measure without reference to the opinions of honourable members at all. No matter what might be the views of the Opposition, or of critics in-any part of the House, the Prime Minister was going to have that Bill through by today. So long as that spirit actuates the Government it will not receive my support in the passing of any of its legislation. At various times Bills have been brought down, and even honourable members sitting behind the Government have notknown what the measures contained until they were tabled. That kind of thing makes a farce of the so-called representasaid tive institutions of the country.",27
61,Mr ROBERT COOK,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"Indi) ri2.4] - . Any procedure which will afford this House extended opportunities for giving Goattention to Government business shall have my support. In my briefexpert-ence here I have noted that the closure,' whenever it has been applied, has been perfectly justified; and similar methods will receive my support on all like occasions. The matters to which the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) has drawn attention are of such importance that they become the responsibilities not merely of One side of 'the House, but of all honourable members. The Prime Minister referred to the three grave subjects of finance, defence, and the Tariff. During the past four weeks or more, what work has the House done ? What legislation has it passed? If honourable members can only get to the problems ahead of them the interests of the country will be served. Honourable members have made considerable reference to the Federal Capital. Just now we are asking the people to subscribe to the second peace loan, and the Government are offering a rate of interest which will penalize hundreds of small men who desire to secure private loans, because the rates of interest will correspondingly increase. Then, we are faced at this period with an unprecedentedly heavy financial strain. In view of these facts, I ask the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook), and honourable members generally, if there is any wisdom in expending money upon a temporary Capital. Mr KrxBY - On a point of order, I submit that the honourable member is not dealing with the question before the Chair, but is entering upon a financial discussion. *",27
62,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE," I have permitted honourable members to allude to various items of business. I have asked, at the same time, that they will not discuss the merits or demerits of any particular measure or phase of legislation, but will advance their reasons why this motion should or should not be. agreed to.",28
63,Mr BOBERT COOK,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,I quite understand the objection to the honourable member for South Sydney (Mr Riley) to my touching upon Canberra.,28
64,Mr EILEY,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,All I am interested in is that if you do so' I shall be permitted to do the same.,28
65,Mr ROBERT COOK,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"I feel that I - am quite justified in referring to this matter, in consequence of the extremely difficult financial position in which this coun[130]- 2 try finds itself today. We are committed in respect of many millions of money, and it is for the Federal Parliament to concentrate its forces with a view to bringing about the utmost efficiency and economy. A ll endeavours having those objects in view shall receive my consistent support. Regarding expenditure on defence, there are certain matters which are bound to be taken in hand. The Prime Minister has stated that Australia must have some settled policy. When we study the cost of the war, and look upon our position in the world generally, we are bound to ask whether it shall be taken for granted that Australia is to remain under the sole protection of the Mother Land for ever. ITo; we must foot the bill. We must take care of ourselves; and it will cost millions. We must find the money to provide adequate defence, or run the risk of handing our land and our people over to those whom the honourable member for Barrier (Mr Considine) would like to see in control. I agree with the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton) that, no matter what Government is in power, it should have support for such a proposition as that now before the Chair. I would stand by a Labour Administration in such a proposal just as readily as I propose to do in the case of the present Government, or as I would do if a Government selected from the Country party were in power-as it will be later on. I shall assist the Government in pushing on with its business in preference to that of private members. We have witnessed wrangling day after day, with no business done. As for the suggestion that this House should sit an extra day a week, and regarding the criticism that the business claims of honourable members in the distant States should be considered, I would remind the House that salaries were recently increased in order to offset that precise difficulty. We now, more than ever, owe the whole of our services to the country; and, no matter what may be the nature or urgency of our outside affairs, the public duty of honourable members should be regarded as paramount. W© cannot do our duty honestly if we are prepared to give only half of our time and the fag-end of our brains to the business of the country. Seeing that there is such an enormous volume of business ahead,. I trust that honourable members, without exception, will assist the Governmy ment to the full extent of their abilities. your ruling. 1 hope there will be no blocking of the important business of the Government which has in it no taint of party polities.",28

72,Mr EILEY,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"South Sydney) [12.31]. - The loan of £25,000,000 which the Government are placing on the market will, I believe, be a success so far as the raising of the money is concerned, but I contend that the Government are borrowing on wrong principles. The Treasurer informed us that the bulk of this money is required for soldiers' homes and for the land settlement of soldiers, and bonds for an amount of £25,000,000 are being issued. Every penny of that amount must be taken from industry, in which it might be employed on reproductive work and in increasing business. Therefore the Government .are proposing to remove from the avenues of industry and labour an enormous amount of capital. The Government are offering 6 per oent. interest for this money, and they have arranged that-any person who-takes up bonds to an amount equivalent to his present holding of old stock may convert the old stock, and receive 6 per cent, on it also. Thus a man who invests another £1,000 will, if he holds £1,000 worth of old 4$ per cent, stock, be able to draw 6 per cent, on'£2,000. It is possible that the-Government will be called upon' in ""that way to pay 6 per cent, on, not only £25,000,000, but on £50,000,000. Sir JOSEPH 'COOK - That might 'be so if all the holders of old stock convert their stock as'the honourable member suggests, but it will not pay thenrto do'that.",30
73,Mr EILEY,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"If I hold £1,000 worth of 4-J per cent, stock and take up another £1,000 worth of new stock, I shall be receiving 6 per cent on £2,000. *.\ ,tf\ Sir JOSEPH COOK - But the big holders will not get that. SERVICE Mr EILEY - There is no difference between the issuing of bonds and the issuing of Commonwealth notes for the purpose of raising money. At present the market is overstocked with Commonwealth bonds, and the stock is selling under par.",30
74,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,Do not forget that a great deal of this money will be lent again to the States.,30
75,Mr EILEY,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"My suggestion is thai the Government should issue £25,000,000 worth of war service notes. In the ordinary course a soldier's cottage can be built in three months. At the end of that time the soldier occupies the house and commences the payment of interest and principal. If , for the purpose of this repatriation work, the Government issued a special war service note, as the payments came in from the soldiers the loan would be automatically redeeming itself. In this way money would be saved to both the soldier and to the Treasury, The war has exploded the .gold reserve theory. "" Sir JOSEPH COOK - My word, it has not.",30
76,Mr EILEY,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"Great Britain and Prance had very small gold reserves in proportion to their note issues. Let us issue special .notes :for waT service homes as they are required, and, as the homes are completed, and the repayments from the soldiers commence, the notes will gradually be taken out of circulation. Thereby we shall not only save the soldier from the payment of heavy interest, but .we shall .avoid taking an immense amount of capital ""from the ordinary channels of commerce. i Sir JOSEPH COOK - This is a .proposal to .build homes for nothing.",30
77,Mr EILEY,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"It will amount to that in time, because the Government will have the security behind the issue. The Commonwealth Bank-the finest institution of its kind in Australia-wa s established without any capital other than the credit of the Commonwealth. To-day there is about £55,000,000 worth of notes in circulation.",30
78,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"The amount is only about £22,000,000. MT . RILEY - If the amount is so small, that is another argument in favour of the issue of special war service notes.",31
79,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"If we issued £50,000,000 worth of new notes, they would not remain in circulation. Mr - RILEY - No , but they would serve the Government's purpose. If the Government follow the old system of borrowing money at interest, thus taking capital from the avenues of industry and employment, they will not help the country, and the new bonds will merely help to depreciate the older stock. Under the system I suggest, so many thousand pounds' worth of notes would be withdrawn automatically every few months. That system has been followed elsewhere, and it could be adopted with advantage by the Commonwealth.",31
80,Mr JOWETT,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,What provision does the honourable member propose to make for withdrawing the notes?,31
81,Mr RILEY,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"A house is built for £600 or £1,000. As soon as the soldier occupies it he commences to pay to the Treasury rent and principal. At the end of six months he has paid in, say, £20 Or £30. Thousands of other men have done the same, and the Government then withdraw from circulation war service notes to the amount of the aggregate. _",31
82,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"In .the meantime where are the notes, and who has them?",31
83,Mr JOWETT,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"They are in .circulation; there is no difficulty about that. \ Mr Riley - The suggestion is worthy of the serious consideration of the Government. These specially ear-marked ""notes could be redeemed each year to the ""amount of the rent and principal that has been repaid. ' Sir JOSEPH COOK*-Where shall we find a lot of contractors who will accept these notes? ' Mr Riley - They will be legal tender. War service notes will be no different from ordinary notes, but they will have their own identity, so that they can be gradually withdrawn. By this scheme J;he Government would make money, and I am sure that if the Labour party had an opportunity they would give it a trial. I move That the sum be reduced iby £1. I do this with the concurrence of the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Marr), who forecast such an amendment. At the last general election the Government announced as part of their policy the honouring of the constitutional contract made with New .South Wales to establish the Federal Capital at Canberra.. The Prime Minister has since. assured deputations that he is prepared to keep that pledge. Now is the best time of the year for building operations; if we wait until the Budget is brought forward, and the Estimates are approved, we shall have lost six months of the best portion of the year for building. The majority of honourable members are anxious that a sum of money shall be made available at once for commencing the erection of buildings and other works at the Federal Capital. I believe the Government are sincere in regard to this matter. The Prime Minister has given his promise, and I believe that he will fulfil it. My only fear is that the commencement of operations will be unduly delayed. At Canberra there are 1,000,000 bricks ready to be laid; there is £20,000 worth of timber lying idle, and there are complete water supplies and power and lighting services. When so much expenditure has been already incurred there, we are not justified in staying our hands any longer. The people of New South Wales have been long-suffering, seeing that the time specified was ten years, and that it is now twenty years since the Constitution came into operation. , There is no doubt that the political life of this country is influenced by the city where the Seat of Government now is.",31
84,Mr JACKSON,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,It will be influenced just as much at Canberra-if ever we get there!,31
85,Mr RILEY,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"That is not so, and I trust that members who believe in carrying out the compact will vote for the motion aa an intimation that we wish to know what the intentions of the Government are. I voted for the construction of the transcontinental railway, and also for the payment of a lump sum to Tasmania, because I regarded these as part of the Federal agreement.",31

87,Mr EILEY,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"A previous representaought tive of Bass made a great fuss about payment to Tasmania; and, in any case, New South Wales is entitled to have the Capital within its borders.",32
88,Mr JOWETT,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,You want the Capital Sydney.,32
89,Mr EILEY,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"No ; our only desire is to carry out the Federal compact. I the Federal Territory there are 900 1,000 square miles of beautiful country, which, as soon as the Seat of Governtive .ment is removed, will return a encountered revenue. The whole influence of Melmunication bourne and of certain members of this Parliament is bent on preventing the move to Canberra. I have here a report of indicated. the Public Works Committee on the proposed construction of a notes printing railway already ? office, and the desirability or otherwise of placing that office at the Federal Capital; and it only shows the spirit of those members who signed the documeut. It is pointed out that tliere are 211 employees in the printing office, and the report says that for their it would be necessary to erect 100 houses and two hotels; further, that for seventy single women, 100 cottages would be quired.

97,Mr LAZZARINI,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"Werriwa) [12.52]. - Many arguments can be advanced why on the work of removing the Capital should Gobe proceeded with at once; but I shall only attempt to advance one or two. We often told that this or that cannot be under the Constitution, which must be strictly regarded. But, in the present instance, it is proposed to depart from a (Mr solemn compact embodied in the Constitution itself-a . compact any departure .from which,means.a violation of that Constitution'., ', I . dp not j think that New - South. Wales has been treated at all fairly in this connection. It is time that a Commonwealth of this importance had its Federal Capital and its Parliament properly housed. As to the work being unproductive, I submit that it would prove reproductive from the very first. The whole of .the land there belongs to the Commonwealth, and the leasing of it for building and other purposes would return more than the interest on the money invested. The building of the Capital would also tend to solve the serious problem of unemployment, if the Government would only boldly tackle the job. There would not be much trouble in getting the initial capital, even if we resorted to the old system of borrowing, because I believe that New South Wales itself - would contribute sufficient. Although I see nothing in the Estimates to provide for works at Canberra, I notice a very large amount is provided for the unproductive purposes of defence and the military establishment. It seems to me inconsistent to raise the cry of ""No money,"" when evidently we can raise any amount for the Defence Department. protest against this enormous expenditure because I believe a system is being organized that will eventually Prussianize Australia. Not long ago, I saw a cartoon by an eminent English artist, depicting, in the other world, the shades of a German soldier and a British soldier The German soldier is saying to the 'Englishman, "" They told me I died to 'Prussianize Britain""; and the British soldier is saying to the German soldier, ""I died to liberate Germany,"" and then they both say, ""Let us congratulate ourselves on our success."" We have been victorious in the war which was to crush militarism and end wars, but it seems to me that it is the other nations which are going to get the freedom from militarism. This military system, and the piling up of huge expenditure every year, will prove too great a burden for a small population of 5,000,000; and for that reason I think it will be well to effect some reasonable reduction. Of course, a certain expenditure is necessary, but, in my opinion, we are spending too much in building up huge defences which are unnecessary, seeing that today there are practically no enemies who could attack us. Amongst the countries of the world, Mr Lazzarini. Japan is the only one which may be regarded as a military power; as to the other countries, I believe that the social and political organization which will grow up will prevent militarism getting any hold there in the future. Really, the only"" nations which are piling up defence expenditure are the Allied nations.",32
98,Unknown,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.15 p.m.,33
99,Mr MAHONY,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"Dalley) [2.15] - I wish to direct the attention of the Treasurer to a very unfair provision in the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act, whereby applicants for the invalid pension are refused on the ground that the total income for the family averages £1 per head per week, an amount which, as we all know, is not nearly sufficient in the present high cost of living for the maintenance of any person. Many such cases have come under my notice, but I have in mind one in particular, that of a young lady who has been invalided practically from birth. Medical men certify that she is incapable of doing any work, and her parents are obliged to provide expensive medicines and I treatment for her. The father is a boilermaker, whose earnings happen to be more than an average of £1 per head per week for the family. If the parents refused to keep the girl in the home, and threw her out on the street, the Commissioner for Old-age Pensions would be obliged to - grant her a - pension, but those who are humane enough, and have sufficient love for their offspring to maintain their in .valid children in the family circle, are .'heavily penalized - Such a glaring anomaly ought toibe rectified at once, and - I hope that the Treasurer will see - his way clear to bring down an amending Bill to do eo. We ""have no greater unfortunates in the land than those who . are permanently invalided and unable to follow any occupation. The moment one touches upon the question of carrying out the solemn compact entered into with New South Wales, that the Federal Capital should be built in that - State, there is a :howl of - derision from honourable members representing Victorian constituencies, and, in some cases, Tasmanian divisions. This morning we had the remarkable spectacle of the honourable member for Bass (Mr Jackson) condemning the proposal to carry out this compact because, as he said, it was wrong; yet, in the next breath, he was advocating that the contract with South Australia to build the north-south railway should be honoured. 'The honourable member approves of the action of this Parliament in coming to the financial aid of Tasmania, making it possible for the State to exist in a solvent condition, and he would build the north-south railway in order to carry out a contract entered into with South Australia, yet we find him opposing any proposal to carry out a compact entered into with New South ""Wales.",33

I stand to the principle that the Commonwealth should observe any compact it enters into with a State, and J would not oppose a work being carried out in South Australia merely because I am a representative of a New South Wales constituency. The people of New South Wales would not have entered into the Federation if they had understood that representatives of Tasmania and Victoria were prepared to go back on the compact entered into to build the Federal Capital in New South Wales.",34

We shall never have a national spirit in Australia until the Federal Parliament is established in its own capital at Canberra, away from State influences. It is undeniable that a Parliament, sitting in any State capital, is consciously or unconsciously uuder the influence of ideas prevalent for - the time being in that particular State. For the future welfare of Australia, it is necessary that we should .get into our-own Capital as soon as possible. : I ask honourable members to hesitate very seriously before they attempt to tear up the solemn treaty made with New South Wales. Mr .BELL (Darwin) [2.28] - In spite of what has been said by the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Mahony) and . others, and in spite of the assertion that - representatives of Tasmania are desirous of tearing up a certain compact, and .unwilling to give to the State of New South Wales what is due to her, I must oppose the proposal to spend such an enormous - amount of money .as .will be involved in .building the Federal Capital at the present juncture. I take second place to no honourable member in advocating expenditure that will be for the benefit of Australia as .a whole, irrespective of State boundaries; but it is obvious that, at the present time, we cannot afford to spend money in the direction contemplated by the amendment. When first I .went to school, I 'learned that ""he is idle - who might be ..betteremployed'."" iWe can amend that aphorism, and say that money is idle when it might he better employed. If we were to find money to carry on the building of the Federal Capital, it might become necessary to withhold urgent expenditure in other directions. It has not been proved that if this Parliament were removed into the desert Capital, Australia would benefit. It is mainly upon the question of finance that I lodge my protest, and I intend to continue to strongly protest against any and every effort to authorize further expenditure on the Federal Capital. It 'has been argued that Australia has already laid out £1,000,000 at Canberra, and that it is lying idle so long as nothing further is done. There is another aphorism to the effect that it is bad policy to send good money after bad. It would be improper to spend another £2,000,000 or £3,000,000 simply because £1,000,000 is lying idle in the Federal - Capital. Honourable members who employ the argument that the Federal Parliament should be removed from the influence of Australia's large cities are merely condemning themselves. Surely honourable members come here with some other point of view than that of representing merely parochial interests. Surely they have some thought for the welfare of Australia as a whole. Is it inevitable that honourable members who travel to Melbourne to carry out their legislative duties should be influenced by their immediate surroundings?",34
109,Mr RYAN,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,The honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) wants to send us to West Sydney.,35
110,Mr BELL,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"I protest . against the statements of certain honourable members who have alleged that Tasmania has received her share of the benefits arising from the expenditure of Federal money; they are under a misapprehension. It has been pointed out that Tasmania has been receiving £90,000 per annum. Honourable members know the circumstances in which it was agreed to pay that sum, and they know that there was no question of bargaining or of that amount being regarded as Tasmania's dole. Public money was paid to that State following upon careful inquiries. It was rightly held that Tasmania, owing to the leakage of Customs revenue due to so much of .her goods having come into the mainland first, was entitled to. an amount estimated to balance the annual leakage. When the island State entered the .Federation she made no bargain. It has been submitted by certain honourable members, however, that a compact was made in the case of New South Wales. And, by'way of emphasizing that point, it has been stated that had it been realized that, twenty years later, New South Wales' bargain would be repudiated, that State would not have come into the Federation. I have always taken the view that the Federal Capital compact came about largely because of the childish jealousy existing between the two leading cities of Australia. To-day, however, we are twenty years older. Melbourne and Sydney have grown; the people of Australia have developed, and should have grown in wisdom. After another twenty years our jealousies should have altogether disappeared, and our outlook should have become truly Australian.",35
111,Mr MAHONY,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"Where is Tasmania, anyhow ?  been torpedoed?",35
112,Mr BELL,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"It is a striking commentary upon my own statements that, after twenty years of Federation, there should be members of the Commonwealth Parliament who find it. necessary to ask ""Where is Tasmania?"" I take it that they do not know. They must possess very little interest in Australia as a whole, even though they may claim to represent .national, interests in this Chamber. The honourable member for. Bass (Mr Jackson) has stated that if Tasmania had known as much twenty years ago as she .does now, she probably would not have entered, the Federation. I do not say that; but, perhaps, if Tasmanians had been as keen as the representatives of some of the larger States, she might have driven some hard bargains.",35
113,Mr TUDOR,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,I do not think the other States would have agreed to Tasmania securing any hard bargains.,35
114,Mr BELL,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"Probably not, for the reason that they are more powerful. The threat that New South Wales might draw 1 .out of Federation if the Capital is not speedily built at Canberra is, of course, - a joke. Despite the gibes so frequently heard concerning Tasmania, I am pleased that I represent a small State in the Federation. It is always the big fellow who has plenty of friends. The little fellow generally has to look to himself. I prefer the honour of fighting for the little fellow; and, although I may not be successful, 1 can at least do my best; and my best at this stage is to enter an emphatic protest against expenditure of money on the Federal Capital in the near future. Honourable members will be pleased, no doubt, with the assurance of the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) that the Budget is to be brought down, before the end of August. They will be still more pleased to learn, when the Budget is under review, that the Government have proposed various means for bringing about economy. I desire to refer particularly to the matter of 'the High Commissioner'sOffice. During my election campaign I announced that I stood for economy in all matters. It is hard for a private member to be able to place his finger on any specific item, and to say that expenditure can there be cut down. Here, however, is an item upon which economy can be effected without reduction of efficiency. Last week the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) presented some information concerning the cost of the High Commissioner's Office. The figures were rather startling. They would not have been so unpleasantly surprising had honourable members been satisfied that Australia was securing a beueficial return from the representation of the Commonwealth in Great Britain. When the Prime Minister made his statement a few weeks ago regarding the resignation of the ex-Treasurer (Mr Watt) he remarked that the result of Mr Watt's resignation was that Australia would be left absolutely without representation at certain highly important Conferences. If Australia has been left without representation the High Commissioner should now be on his way back to Australia, and a successor should be outward bound. I understand that there is at present a gentleman in England who is going into the matter' of the reconstruction of Australia House. Upon what lines his investigations are being conducted I do not know. But, when it can be said that Australia has been left without representation, although we have a High Commissioner in London, the Government should apply the lesson which it has learned; it should appoint a young' and vigorous man to take up the Commissioner's duties in London, and remodel the High Commissioner's Office along the lines of highest efficiency. I trust that, when the Budget is presented, it will be shown that there has been a great reduction in the cost of it, for I am of opinion that that would not retard the efficiency of our representation in the Old Country. Indeed, the expenditure could be very well cut down by half, without the High Commissioner-whoeve r he may be in the future-havin g any qualms concerning the' maintenance of the dignity of his position.",35
115,Mr TUDOR,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"Yarra) [2.45] - It is not a new thing to hear in this Parliament complaints made against the Federation by the representatives of a particular State. New South Wales is now complaining that she has not received fair treatment, but the same complaint has come from Tasmania; from Western Australia, where not so long ago there was a secession movement; and from Queensland-whe n our white labour legislation' was enforced; from South Australia; and from Victoria. That every State has in turn complained is, to my mind, proof that the Federation has dealt fairly with all of. them. I have risen to Tefer to a matter which is of importance to all honourable .members, the judgment of Mr Justice Isaacs . in the recent Ballarat election case. Let me read a portion of the Argus report of the case, which appeared on the 3rd JuneMr Justice Isaacs scathingly criticised some of the official methods in the conduct of the election, which took place on December 13, 1919 Mr Justice Isaacs, in the course of his judgment, said that the case raised several extremely important points of electoral law, and revealed a great number of official errors, causing disfranchisement of electors. In some cases these errors were due to almost incredible carelessness on the part of local presiding officers. He agreed that two of the votes had been properly allowed, and went on to refer to a number of cases in which, the petitioner alleged, persons had been wrongly ""refused a vote. Petitioner claimed that these and other votes refused vitiated the election. Speaking of a Mrs.. Franklin, Mr Justice Isaacs said Clearly she was deprived of her vote by official error. Alfred Reason, enrolled for Ballarat East, and Alfred Crowther, enrolled for Buninyong, went to Duverney polling booth outside the electorate to vote as absentees. They were told that no blank absentee ballot-papers were left. The presiding officer was asked to alter some ballot-papers he had, but the suggestion was not acceded to, and the men, after waiting a considerable time, left without voting. Seven persons, duly qualified to vote, were, by official error, prevented from voting. . . . . There could not be any doubt that, but for that official error in omitting the surname of MCGRATH, that vote would have made the numbers equal. In such case the D.R.O. would have been called on to decide by his casting vote. The official errors appearing in the Ballarat section of the case placed the matter beyond question. It was clearly proved that they affected the result, and it was the duty of the Court, in compliance with the. Act, to declare that Edwin Thomas John Kerby was not duly elected for Ballarat, and that the election was absolutely void. No costs were allowed. After the 1903 election, two petitions were lodged-Dr Maloney"" petitioning against the return of i Sir Malcolm MCEacharn for Melbourne, and Mr Chanter against the return of Mr Blackwood for .Riverina. Subsequently, in an Appropriation Act No. 21 of 1905-Parliament voted £100 each to all four gentlemen as an allowance towards their expenses, and in 1913 .a grant of £250 was made to Mr Chanter. In regard to neither of those elections did the presiding Judge make such a pronouncement against the electoral officials as was made the other day by . Mr Justice Isaacs in regard to the conduct of 'the Ballarat election. probability official errors have been made in connection with the return of practically every member of the House, but the voting is not generally so close.as it was in the Ballarat division. were the difference between the candidates only five votes, almost any election - could be upset on that score. But when an election is upset through no fault of :the candidates, ^they should not be.penalized. I understand that an application - has been made on behalf of Mr. 'Kerby that, as the . election was declared to be invalid because of the mistakes .made by . officials, he should not 'be required to pay the expenses incurred in - contesting it. I have also seen the Min* ister 'for 'Home and Territories '(Mr Mr Tudor. Poynton) on the subject, and on the 1st of June wrote this letter to himMelbourne, 12th June, 1920. DEAK .SIB, With reference to my interview with you on the 5th instant, regarding the petition for the Ballarat seat, I have to request that the question of the Electoral Office paying the costs of this suit on both sides be favourably considered. lAs you know, many difficult points in connection with electoral law have now been settled. According to the judgment of Judge Isaacs, the voiding of the election was due to mistakes made by electoral officers, and not to either party or candidate. The Judge ordered, that a shorthand writer be appointed to take notes of the evidence. This cost each side £60. In my opinion, the Department should pay for this. Section 197 of the Electoral Act provides that no counsel or solicitor sliould appear unless the parties consent, or the Judge orders this to be done. Mr J. Kean, who appeared for Mr MoGrath, would not consent to this. The other side applied to the Court, and MT. Justice Starke ordered that the parties be represented by solicitor and counsel. I shall .be glad if you will favourably consider this matter. ,",36

'We are entirely in sympathy with the application. Mr TUDOR,-Furthermore , I under and Mr Chanter, who succeeded in unseating, by their petitions, the gentlemen first declared elected, the parliamentary allowance was paid as from the date of Jn all the original election. I do not say that the gentleman who was in December last returned for Ballarat, and sat here for some time, should be asked to refund What was paid to him by way of parliaProbably, mentary allowance; but Mr MCGRATH, who unseated him, and was kept out - of the seat for a time by the 'fault of the : officials, - should be paid the allowance from the 13th December-the date of the original election. "" I trust that the Government will give favourable consideration to this matter, so that justice - may be done to all parties concerned. ' Sir ROBERT-BEST (Kooyong) [2.55]. - There is much to be said for the contention-of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor).

They know well that they are not influenced in that way, either directly or indirectly.",38

119,Sir ROBERT BEST,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"Quite the connext trary. Some of my honourable friends hardly know when they are well off. The people of Victoria have no feeling on thisquestion; and, in my opinion, the people of New South ""Wales do not care a snap of the fingers about it. I cannot find out who it is that wants this Federal Capital.",38
120,Mr HILL,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,It is the representatives New South Wales.,38
121,Sir ROBERT BEST,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"I admit that a few of the representatives of that State wish us to move to the Federal Capital; but the people of New South Wales have not demanded the move, and to them the Federal matter is of no moment.",38
122,Mr MAHONY,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,-Tak e a broad view.,38
123,Sir ROBERT BEST,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"That is what I am doing, ancl what my honourable friend is incapable of doing. The people of New South Wales realise that they are heavily burdened with taxation, and their chief concern is to berelieved of the cess. They have to contribute to the exI pense of government as much as, and - perhaps more than, any other part Australia. When we again reach normal - conditions so far as taxation is concerned, my honourable friends will have a right ask that the building of the Federal Capital be proceeded with. But, to prate about economy, and at the same time to Waste money deliberately on a bush Capital, is the height of hypocrisy.",38
124,Mr MARR,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,That is what they said here before the war.,38
125,Sir ROBERT BEST,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"I urge my honourable friends, who profess an anxiety for economy, to look at this matter sanely.",38
126,Mr WATKINS,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,We would like to make you travel a bit.,38
127,Sir ROBERT BEST,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"The matter does not concern me personally. But my electors are anxious that they shall be released from excessive taxation, and not that they shall be further burdened. That is the question that is involved at the present time. When we are in such desperate financial straits, to deliberately set to work to waste money in the way suggested would be little short of madness and criminal folly. If honourable members believe that there is any feeling in any of the States, even in New South Wales, in favour of this Federal Capital project, I suggest that, at the election a referendum be taken as to whether the Capital shall be proceeded with immediately or deferred until taxation has been reduced to normal dimensions. Everybody is ready .to assist in the establishment of the Federal Capital when we can afford to do so, but there, is no urgency about the project. Parliament dare not overlook the ultimate finanof cial liability; we must consider, not merely the erection of buildings at Canberra at the present time, but also the construction of a railway from Jervis Bay to Canberra. It was realized from the very beginning that there must be a port at Jervis Bay. I quite endorse that view. Without a Federal port and a railway connecting with Canberra we should travel to the Capital merely by the grace of New South Wales, and' on railways belonging to that State. Therefore, we must realise that, in voting for the construction of the Federal Capital, we are committing ourselves also to exexpenditure on a railway from Jervis Bay. do not delude myself with the hope that I shall make any impression upon the of members who represent New South Wales, but I say that, if they were really earnest in their desire to represent the to wishes of the people, they would take a referendum upon this question. The desire of my electors to be relieved of taxation to the greatest extent possible is common to the people of all States. As soon as our financial position enables us to deal tution, is concerned. with this matter we shall have a right to take it into consideration. But today, when our finances are in the direst condition, and when the people have demanded that Parliament shall take every opportunity of exercising economy in every direction, we have no right to contemplate expenditure such as is proposed. It must be remembered that if money is wasted at Canberra other works more useful, and more necessary, must be neglected, and important matters which demand consideration will be sacrificed.",38
128,Mr WATKINS,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,I have not heard the - honourable member raise his voice once against all the expenditure that is taking place in Melbourne at the present time.,39
129,Sir ROBERT BEST,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"Melbourn e is not securing any greater expenditure than it is entitled to. But if the honourable member can prove that any unreasonable or unfair expenditure has been incurred in Victoria, I shall join with him in condemning it. It has been established that the creation of even a temporary capital would involve the expenditure of millions of pounds, which the community ought not to be called upon to pay at the present time. I challenge any honourable member to refer to any Federal expenditure unfairly incurred in Victoria. Inquiry will establish the fact that, as a rule, all expenditure of the kind has been incurred on the recommendation or order of a Minister from another State. regard to the report recently furnished to the House by the Public Works Committee, only two members' of that body are Victorian representatives, whilst three are from Western Australia. The Committee endeavoured to frame an impartial report, and their recommendation should be received in good faith. I join with other honourable members in protesting against the wasteful and flagrant expenditure at Canberra which is suggested by the supporters of the amendment.",39
130,Mr BOWDEN,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"Nepean) [3.8] -^There are two ways of avoiding the payment of debts, and we have had illustrations of both this afternoon. The honourable member for Bass (Mr Jackson) told us quite frankly that he advocates a policy of repudiation, so far as the debt to New South Wales, as specified in the ConstiThe honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) gave an indication of the other way of avoiding payment, namely, the constant postponement without a distinct repudiation of the debt, the suggestion that it is inconvenient to pay at the present time, but if the bill is renewed for another three months the debtor may be in a better position to meet his obligation. I honestly and sincerely believe that it will be better in the interests of the Commonwealth and of Federal legislation that this Parliament should not meet in any of the great centres of population. We hear slighting remarks about people being influenced by associations. But there is, and always must be, a very great indirect influence through the associations of people in big centres. That influence is felt in this House, consciously or unconsciously.",39
131,Mr JOWETT,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,Would not the same objection apply to small centres?,39
132,Mr BOWDEN,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"No . In a big centre we have no chance of creating a Federal atmosphere in place of the State atmosphere which preponderates in a big State capital. The honourable member for Kooyong. said that he did not know what influence was behind the agitation for the removal of this Parliament to Canberra. But he told us over and over again that his electors do not desire that this expenditure shall be incurred, and thereIn fore he is opposed to it. The best answer to the honourable member's argument is the feeling reflected by the representatives of New South Wales. As a general rule, honourable members do not support projects which are not favoured by their constituents. We would not be in this House if we were out of harmony with the views' of the majority of our constituents. The honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) said that, so far as he knows, the Federal Capital is not regarded as an important question in any part of New South Wales. The fact is that every candidate in New South Wales had to face on the public, platform the agitation for the removal of the Federal Parliament to Canberra.",39
133,Mr JOWETT,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,That is because there is a Federal Capital League in New South Wales.,39
134,Mr BOWDEN,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"Not necessarily. I do not think I addressed one meeting at Supply Bill T30 JULY, 1920.] which I was not questioned regarding my attitude towards the Federal Capital.",39
135,Mr JOWETT,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"Because the League instigated-the electors to ask the question. Mr BOWDEN"" - If Victorian members have no better argument than insipuations of that character, they have a very weak case. No talking can evade the fact that a contract to establish the Federal Capital in New South Wales was deliberately inserted in the Constitution. I do not care whether or not people call it a bad bargain, or whether they say that New South Wales acted unfederally in insisting upon that condition; but the fact remains that a definite compact was made. The original enabling Bill was not carried in New South Wales by the requisite majority, and the section in regard to the Federal Capital was inserted as an inducement to New South Wales to join in the Federation. If New South Wales had stood out, Queensland would not have joined, and there would have been no Federation. It is certain that the required majority in favour of the enabling Bill would not have been obtained in New South Wales if the Federal Capital compact had not been inserted in the Constitution. I fought to secure the adoption of the original enabling Bill, and I know the opposition that we had to meet. When the ' second enabling Bill was placed before the people, I was one of those who went before the electors and said, "" Y o u have now obtained from the other States what you asked for; give us your support.""",40

137,Mr BOWDEN,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"I played no confidence trick on the electors, although the very people to whom I put that argument now say that they have been misled, and that Victoria never meant that Commonwealth. the agreement should be carried out.",40

The argument that wo have no money has been used over and over again; but so far as members from Victoria are concerned there never has been a time when there was any money to spend on the Federal Capital.,40
142,Mr RILEY,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,We can raise the money hi New South Wales to build the Capital.,40
143,Mr BOWDEN,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"That is an argument that I have not used, but New South Wales will find the money. It is not a great amount that is required, though - honourable members have talked about millions and millions, and it will be a gradual expenditure. If this Parliament would do the sane aud proper thingj and sell the freehold of the land in the Federal Territory, we would obtain all the money we require. The difficulty arises simply because Parliament in its wisdom decided that there should be only leaseholds; and at the present time no man can take up a leasehold for building, because there are no regulations. There are men in Sydney who would undertake to build an accommodation house at Canberra if they could get the land, but they can get land neither on a ninety-nine-year lease nor on freehold. A great deal has been made of the ""burden of taxation,"" and it has been said that this taxation the people of New South Wales do not desire. I remind' honourable members that, of any expenditure on the Capital, New South Wales will bear one-half, as it bears one-half of all other expenditure.",40

As one who was sent here to represent the interests of working men and women, I fail to see how all this agitation for a specific site for the'Seat of Government vitally affects the interests of the people as a whole. For all practical purposes, the Capital might as well be in Rabaul as in Canberra. What effect can the ""situation of the Capital have on wages or the general conditions of the working men and women of the country? If any influence of that kind could be shown, there might be something in the argument for a change in the Seat of Government. The only argument I have heard in favour of any action is the influence of the Victorian press.",41

156,Mr CONSIDINE,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"That influence, in , my opinion, is a very negligible quantity.' - The men and womenof Australia are beginning to think for themselves, and have more sense than to take any notice of either the Victorian or the New South Wales daily press; at any rate, to the extent they may have done hitherto."" The only other argument worthconsideration is that the removal of the Capital to New South Wales was arranged when Federation was established, and that that arrangement was made part and parcel of the Constitution: I am surprised that honourable members, who are-such blatant sup-5 porters of constitutionalism and strong advocates of adhering to written promises and honourable understandings, should advocate any departurefrom the Federal compact. We were told that a reason for 1 the world's catastrophe was the repudiation of certaindocuments or guarantees-that the-world was engulfed because of the tearing up of a "" scrap of paper."" We are now told by the same people that the understanding between one State and a number of others when Federation was inaugurated does not matterthat though New South Wales may have been promised the Capital, the promise does not matter, and we are very comfortable in Melbourne. The only reason I can see for supporting the removal of the Capital is that it forms part and parcel of the Federal Constitution. The people of New South Wales, through their repreCapisentatives at the time, agreed with the other States that the Capital should' be within the borders of New South Wales, and Parliament subsequently decided that it should be at Canberra.

162,Mr MAXWELL,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"Fawkner) [ 3 . 3 1 ] - Since T last had the pleasure of addressing honourable members, I have had the privilege of travelling a littl e in Northern Queensland. I also saw something of New South Wales and lower Queensland, and wherever I was I took the opportunity of entering into conversation with all sorts and conditions of men and women, with a view to seeing how far Federal matters interest the citizens of the Commonwealth, especially in regard to the question of the removal of the Seat of Government to Canberra. The impression left on my mind was that there is not the slightest interest taken in this matter, outside a narrow circle of interested people. Were I convinced that it is the wish of the citizens of Australia, who will be called upon to pay the piper, that the Seat of Government should be transferred to Canberra I would undoubtedly vote for it , but I am satisfied that the people of Australia, staggering under a tremendous debt, are not desirous of adding to that financial obligation and are perfectly content to wait for the transference of the Capital u n t i l some more favourable season. Generally speaking, I believe that the way in which we comport ourselves in this House, and the time we waste over trivialities, as we 1I have been doing today, are to a large extent responsible for the lack of interest shown in Federal matters. The boat in which I was travelling was delayed at Townsville for an hour or two, and I had the opportunity of walking about the town. As I was anxious to gain some in^formation about some of the trees I - spoke to an intelligent-looking middle-aged man who was passing, and put some questions to him. Afterwards I got into conversation with 'him about Federal matters, and said, "" By the way, who is the Federal member for Townsville?"" He said, "" I think he is a man named Dooley."" I said, "" - I am perfectly certain it is not Mr Dooley, because there is [131] no Mr 'Dooley in the Federal House."" Then he thought for a littl e while, and said, "" If dt is not Dooley I believe it is Ryan."" I replied, "" It is not Ryan. There is only one Ryan, and he is the member for West Sydney."" The man It scratched his head, and then said, "" If it is not Dooley, and-is not Ryan, I do not know who our member is."" That is about the extent of the interest taken in Federal matters by the people in those remote districts. There is a feeling among them that ithe Federal Parliament neglects their interests. It would not matter to them where the Federal Capital was situated so long as they got decent legislation.",42
163,Mr TUDOR,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"Does the honourable member think that the fact that they do not know their representative's name amounts to much? Does he believe that 2 per cent, of the people in Victoria know who represent them in the Legislative Council?",42
164,Mr MAXWELL,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"In answer to my friend, I am sorry to say that I believe it is only too true that very little interest is taken in Federal matters outside certain circles. And this House is very largely responsible for that lack of in terest. People, generally, are becoming so absolutely sick of the way in which it deals with business matters that they do not care practically who are elected to represent them or where their representatives sit.",42
165,Mr WATKINS,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,The honourable member ought to be the last man in the House to make that statement.,42
166,Mr MAXWELL,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"I am saying what I believe. When we, as business men, act and deal in a common-sense and business like way with the matters that come before us the people will begin to take an interest in what we do. So long as we f r it t e r away our the> and waste it upon trivialities, they will not care a snap of the fingers'what happens.",42
167,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"ParramattaTreasurer) [3.38] - After this controversial debate, I hope that we shall get the Supply Bill through. My concern is to get the money with which to pay the Federal public servants, and, incidentally, ourselves. It is about time we came to a decision on the matter of the transference of the Seat of Government to Canberra. Of course, there is absolutely no feeling about it , nobody cares very much about it : but somehow or other, accidentally, and incidentally, I suppose, we have this spectacle: Nearly all the representatives of New South Wales are in favour of the Federal Capital being begun immediately, while nearly all the representatives of Victoria are against it , and, of course, honourable members representing both States look at the question from a national point of view. However, that is how the matter statnds today, and how it has stood for twenty years past, and I am afraid that is how it will continue to stand.",42
168,Mr FLEMING,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,What we object to is that it has remained too long in that'position.,43
169,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"The point I merits wish to make is that it is not quite fair enter into a highly controversial question of this kind when a Supply Bill is before the Committee, the very essence of which is that it should not contain any controlet versial subjects. Everything has excluded from this Bill that could lead party feeling or controversy of this kind. Of course, it goes without saying that there should be ventilation of grievances before grainting Supply; but may I sugmonth gest that the present is not an appropriate time for testing this matter by a vote of honourable members. Other occasions will be available when such a step may taken. For instance, next Thursday is Grievance Day.",43
170,Mr RILEY,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"That will be of no advanof tage to us because the matter could be "" talked o u t . """,43

173,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"The matter could not be ' ' talked o u t ' ' unless House permitted it . That, I suggest, would be the proper way in which to submit the question to the arbitrament of the House. However, the Government, through the mouth of their Prime Minster (Mr . Hughes) made certain pledges on this subject at the recent election, and those pledges they will endeavour to carry out. When the 'Budget is presented I hope will contain an earnest of the Governcarry ment's intention in regard to Canberra; but I remind honourable members that the House is the tribunal which must ulti- .my amendment. mately decide the matter. Much as some members of the Government may feel with regard to the question, it is one which is not to be decided absolutely by Ministers without reference to the House.",43
174,Mr RILEY,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,What is the Government's policy in this regard?,43
175,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"The Government policy is to proceed with the development of the Federal Capital im the terms of the constitutional agreement entered into twenty years ago. In pursuance of that agreement, and m consequence of the votes and deliberations of this House, large sums of moiney have already been spent at Canberra.

181,Mr MCWILLIA MS,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"F r a n k l in) [3.45]. - I think the time has come when there should be a thorough overhaul of the position in connection with the office of High Commissioner. Matters are unsatisfactory today, not only to the gentleman holding that office, but to the Government and to the people of Australia. We are getting virtually no return for the money laid out. There are continual complaints in Australia that the High Commissioner is doing practically nothing. I understand that Mr Fisher's view is that, whenever there is anything important to be done, a Commonwealth Minister is sent to London to do it . I do not wish to utter a threat, but merely to intimate to the Government that, unless a complete statement is made before or on the introduction of the Budget, I will test the feeling of the House upon the question whether or not the High Commissionership is to be retained as at present. Australia is certainly getting no commensurate return for the money expended in London, and it can scarcely be a matter of the men who have been appointed to the High Commissionership, for both Sir  leaders of Australian public opinion, and have occupied with honour the highest office in the Commonwealth, namely, that of Prime Minister. If Mr Hughes had gone Home as High Commissioner, and Mr Fisher had remained here as Prime Minister, the latter, no doubt, would have journeyed to London to transact Australia's business, and Mr Hughes would have been permitted to do nothing.",44
182,Mr WATKINS,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,That is very unfair to ,44
183,Mr MCWILLIAMS,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"It is, and I want it clearly understood that I am not raising the matter in any personal sense. If Mr Fisher is not competent to carry out the duties of his office the fact should have been made known long ago, and a successor appointed. At any rate, the time is rotten ripe for a change.",44
184,Mr FENTON,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,It is about time we had one Australian representative in London instead of a High Commissioner and six Agents-General.,44
185,Mr MCWILLIAMS,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,It is.,44
186,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,The only answer necessary at the moment is that Australia sends very many less representatives to London than almost any other Dominion.,44
187,Mr MCWILLIAMS,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"Then , all I can say is that the various Dominions must despatch a power of men to London.",44

191,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,Certainly !,44
192,Mr MCWILLIAMS,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"I am utterly dissatisfied with the manner in which the High Commissioner's office is conducted, and I emphasize that I am not making this .a personal matter, for when Mr Fisher was in this Parliament I differed with him politically, but always respected him as a man. It is now for honourable members to say whether the High Commissionership shall be continued as at present or not. If the High Commissioner is to be retained in London, let him do the work for which he is highly paid, and let us put an end to this perambulation of Ministers back and forth between Melbourne and London.",44
193,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"I believe that Tasmania has sent as many Ministers to England as the Federation; and more, in fact.",44

195,Mr MCGRATH,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"Ballarat) [3.50] The attitude of the honourable member for Franklin (Mr MCWilliams), I take it , is that the High Commissionership should be retained, but that the gentleman holding that office should be a Minister of the Crown. That is precisely the view which I propounded when I returned to. Australia. I found, in London, that Mr . Fisher had no powers whatever, and that every littl e question as it cropped up had to be referred to Australia so that he might secure advice and instruction. I saw for myself the necessity for a High Commissioner in London, and for the establishment of Australia House.",44
196,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"In normal times there are always 3,000 or 4,000 Australians in London.",44
197,Mr MCGRATH,ACTION AGAINST SIK GRANVILLE RYEIE,"I quite believe that. No one who has paid a visit to Australia House, particularly if he were there during the war years, can question the necessity for the representation of Australia in the capital Empire; but it is unnecessary to incur the expense of having Commonwealth Ministers continually travelling from Great Britain. If a were appointed to the High sionership, with power to .act in all circumstances, considerable trouble and expense would be saved the Commonwealth. I trust that the Government will favourably consider that point. If a Minister is sent to London, he will be representative of the Government of the day, which reflects the opinions of the majority of the people of Australia. An amount of work was done in House throughout the war. People who remained in the Commonwealth scarcely credit, and can hardly be expected to appreciate the facts. branch alone, namely, the Branch, there was tremendous It may be news to some honourable members that, of our first and second Australian Imperial Force Divisions, 30 per cent, of its personnel had their next-of-kin in Great Britain. was that a vast amount of pension work had to be conducted in Australia The building of . that structure was a very fine business deal - Upon the establishment of a branch of the Commonwealth Bank in London during the war, no suitable premises were available except a portion of Australia House. nearly one-half of that building is occupied by the Commonwealth during the war years its activities conducted mainly to suit the convenience of our soldiers abroad. Any one who spent some time in London, and witnessed the operations of the. Commonwealth Bank in Australia House, must been gratified to know that Australia had reared such a fine structure in London, and that it was housing our own Commonwealth banking institution. there is a good deal of waste in Australia House. There is a considerable of frill, which ought to be cut out. There are many officials housed in various corners of that building who seem to be making a pretty good living out of Australia, but who are entirely out of touch with Commonwealth conditions. . In the office of the Victorian Agent-General there is not a single individual, the Agent-General himself, I believe, who has ever been in Australia; and there are many other persons 'employed tralia House who have no Mr MoQrath. of the whatever of Australian life, and who are not competent to speak of the'Commonwealth, or, for example, to answer questo and tions of those who may be thinking of Minister emigrating. Now that a fresh appointCommis- ment is about to be made, I ask the Government to considerthe question whether it is wise to .simply appoint an agent who has no power whatever. I understand that Mr Eisher still has to ask for instructions upon any and every matter that crops up. If, however, a Minister were appointed, enormous he could deal without delay with such Australia important matters as negotiations in connection with war loans, and he could will represent Australia at International Conferences. It would then be no longer In one necessary to send any one else overseas. Pensions I wish to refer, also, to the distribuactivity. tion of ANZAC tweed. In a reply which the Assistant Minister for Defence (Sir Granville Ryrie) gave to an honourable fully member, it was stated that the tweed manufactured at our Commonwealth The result Mills was being sold to the public at 15s. a yard. I regretted to hear that stateHouse. ment. If any one should set an example against profiteering, it should be the Government of the day. As a member of the Returned Sailors' and Soldiers' I m perial League, I was able to purchase the To-day cloth for the suit which I am now wearing for £ 1 9s. 9d. I obtained it through Bank, and the'League. It is splendid material, and were I ask the Government not to seek to make a profit from the operation of the Commonwealth Mill s so long as they pay expenses. The people should be permitted to enjoy some of the benefits arising have from this public activity, and should be able to secure this excellent cheap tweed which the Commonwealth Mills are turning out. Its distribution should not be Still, confined to returned soldiers alone. Surely the widows and children of fallen - men amount should be entitled to some of the material at cost price. I know that the Returned Soldiers' League is not supplying ANZAC tweed to others than members of t the - League. It was understood that this cloth was to be available to all soldiers for their services abroad, irrespective of whether or not they belonged to the Reexcept turned Sailors' and Soldiers' Imperial League. However, T can quite understand the position of the League. In in Aus- conducting its distribution, it has to incur knowledge expenses of salaries and rent, and it is not fair to ask that body to distribute the cloth to non-mem bora. Tho tweed should be distributed through the Kepatriation, or some other such Department; and it should be made available to all returned soldiers, to all returned nurses, and to all widows and children of deceased soldiers.",44
