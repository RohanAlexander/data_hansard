However, because the reality is that, in spite of the minister's billion cut per year for road and raid funding which is set to commence on 1 July 2014. own figures become a $24 billion program. overblown. The minister makes big announcements Metro link project. He talked again just now not say is that there is only $75 million He was boasting about WestConnex being the Prime Minister has put conditions on that it to ever proceed-but there is only $400 billion-it is only $400 million. And, since the there is about a 75 per cent gap in The reality is that there will only be network across the country in the first year of Labor's approach in other areas, where funded-like the NDIS, like Gonski. They announce but the money is not provided. When you look significant gaps in what is actually going alarming is that the government seems to be look as big as it is. For instance, the department confirmed in of untied local road grants for local government Building 2. I ask the minister, is that $4 billion the past, that money has been dealt with in that this $4 billion funding, the traditional now part of their nation-building strategy. When billion of that $24 billion is coming out of the previous Howard government-and when transferred out of the mining tax, the real five-year program is not $24 billion; it is about that we have had in this nation The minister again talked about their have actually had candidates out there notice is in the chamber-yet the funding announcement.

We have been this is the budget where it all comes unstuck, claims, this budget actually predicts a $1.2 under their so-called nation building 2 program, A $36 billion program has on the government's Once more, even that figure is probably about things such as the Melbourne about it being a $3 billion project. What he did in the next four years to actually fund it. a $1.8 billion project-although we all know project which make it absolutely impossible for million actually provided. There is not $1.8 government is insisting that there be no tolls, the funding for a project of that nature. $2 billion spent on the entire national highway of nation building 2 program. This is just typical they announce big programs but they are not what sound like big amounts of money, at these kinds of investments, we are left with to be able to be achieved. What is even more manipulating the figures to make the $24 billion Senate estimates last week that almost $4 billion is included now as a subprogram in Nation included in his $24 billion announcement? In other ways. But this time the department has said funding that goes to local government for roads, is you look at the program and realise that $1.5 the Building Australia Fund-created entirely by you realise that there is $2 billion being amount allocated for road funding over the next $17 billion.

Once upon a well-when we talked about privacy it used to in Australia involving privacy had to do with to recognise today, in the digital age, that it is virtually an untenable concept with how far sharing and the ability of individuals and organisations personal information.

This bill at its heart attempts to undo callous attack on single parents and their parents.

To recap, in those were at that stage on Parenting Payment were time when their youngest child turned eight For people who had not had a child at that the changes were made that prospectively when would move from the Parenting Payment to Newstart. existing stock of people and effectively say to you're on Newstart'-instead of on the contribution to their household budgets and indeed funding. No wonder there was an outcry from were affected by the change. The approach budgets to create uncertainty and to try to return funding and without any funds available to those So this bill is a response to the outcry that decision that was taken, basically, because finances. This bill includes three measures. The first that applies to recipients of Newstart allowance, parenting payment partnered and sickness allowance. ordinary income that an income support recipient of payment of their various allowances is affected. will increase from $62 to $100 per fortnight. additional income before their payment rate will take effect from 20 March 2014.

The third measure would provide a 12-week concession card to single parents who no longer to speak on the Social Security Amendment 2013. This bill seeks to amend the Social to provide additional support to single parents other related activities. The amendments also to earn more before their income support some of the damage which Labor has done in their attack on the household budgets of many single undertook welfare reform, we acknowledged In fact, we spent several billions of dollars 2004-05, including funds to assist those changes the Parenting Payment recipients who left in the system on the understanding that over they would effectively wash out of the system. stage but who were coming into the system then their youngest child turned eight then they What has happened here is to take that them, 'Now, all of a sudden, from a certain date Parenting Payment without any corresponding with a reduction in the funds available for the community, particularly from those who was to drive a wrecking ball through household people to the workforce without any training people to boost their skills or qualifications. occurred over that decision by the government-a of the parlous state of the Commonwealth measure would increase the income-free area widow allowance, partner allowance, The income-free area is the amount of is able to earn in a fortnight before the rate The income-free area for these payments This will allow recipients to earn some is affected.

This measure This bill is typical of a chaotic and dysfunctional decision which is a direct hit on single parents; outraged by this proposition, they rush to try this bill-but of course they cannot. The reality the solution is to effectively allow people minimum wage on top of the hours they can me repeat that: what this bill does is allow the minimum wage on top of the hours they presently the hit, which is the reduction in the amount payment compared to what they receive under Newstart.

Yes, this is but the damage would not have been done if on single parents.

So saying that it is all Labor's fault. I have no time made; the legislation only got through this There are hundreds of thousands of people under enormous pressure, particularly financial electorate where we have more people in public country. Many of those people, as well as themselves living below the poverty line When you have, in round figures, $250 a week live in somewhere like inner-city Melbourne public housing waiting list in Victoria is over place somewhere else you may not find anything unemployed, cheaper than about $180 a week themselves homeless.

Up until a very short while ago, Labor financial year than they have so far raised you do not have the courage to stand up to the fair share,' and when, instead, you turn your parents tend not to have a spare $26 million the big miners do. So they are seen as a softer target. What is the effect of pushing single parents week. When you are a single parent and you find a job-plus looking after your kids, there money budget or your time budget. What we and why we urged this parliament not to vote for ones who were hardest hit were the ones who you look at the analysis, single parents were highest number of people in work, because that to stay in connection with the workforce and improve their kids. This gave the lie to the rationale from Labor back into the workforce, because when you more hours and keep more of your money but cannot keep as much. The ones who were the in this country who are doing it tough. They are pressure, and nowhere more so than in my housing than in any other electorate in the many others, who are out looking for a job find on the incredibly low rate that is Newstart. to spend, if you are trying to find a place to in my electorate, it can be very tough.

A single room in a rooming house cost house and you are sharing a kitchen with feed yourself. You are forced to go out and buy But $180 out of $246 leaves you with $60-odd, all your other costs. You cannot do it. It is urging this government to have the courage to at minimum, a $50 boost to their Newstart. We government go the other way.
