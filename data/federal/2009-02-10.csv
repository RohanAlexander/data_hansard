2,Mr ALBANESE,BUSINESS,"by leave-I move: That so much of the standing ders be suspended as would prevent government business orders of the day being called on immediately. Question agreed to. NA Victorian Bushfire Victims Debate resumed from 9 February, on motion by Ms Gillard: That the House: (1) extends its deepest sympathies to families and loved ones of those Australians killed the weekend's tragic bushfires in Victoria; (2) records its deep regret at the human injury, the loss of property and the destruction of communities caused by the weekend's fires; (3) praises the work of emergency services, volunteers and community members in assisting friends and neighbours in this time of need; and (4) acknowledges the profound impact on those communities affected and the role of governments and the Australian community in assisting their recovery and rebuilding.",15
3,Mr RUDD,CONDOLENCES,"7 February will become etched in our national memory as a day of disaster, of death and of mourning. This nation has been scarred by natural disasters, disasters that remind us of our tenuous hold on this vast and forbidding land: ‘Her beauty and her terror', as our nation's poem reminds us, of this ‘wide brown land'. Except that the land is now black, the earth scorched and the people in mourning. Fire holds a great terror for us all. Its power, its speed, its roar, its relentless destruction, its capricious shifts in course, its want of mercy-all personal stories I have heard from its survivors in recent days. And the numbers just mount and mount: so far 173 deaths, more than 500 injured, nearly 1,000 homes destroyed, thousands now homeless, 365,000 hectares burnt, 25 local government authorities affected and and sessional or- entire towns gone. Our first response as Australians must be, as it has been, to extend the open hand of friendship, empathy and giving. The people of Victoria are not alone in this disaster because the entire nation is with them, and not just the nation but good people across the world-an expression of our common humanity. In the last day or so I have received calls from President Obama, Prime Minister Brown, President Barroso of the European Union, the Secretary-General of the United in Nations, the prime ministers of New Zealand and Turkey-our ANZAC brothers. President Obama said that we in Australia should know that the prayers of he, his wife, Michelle, their family, and the American people are with the people of Victoria and the people of Australia today. We have also received messages from others around the world: Andorra, Brazil, China, Cuba, East Timor, France, Indonesia, Ireland, Japan, Mexico, Nauru, Peru, Pakistan, Samoa, Singapore, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Sweden, the Solomons, Thailand and others. Expressions of sympathy have also been accompanied by offers of practical help. France and Japan have made urgent inquiries as to what assistance they might offer. Thailand is proposing a financial donation to the bushfire victims. Indonesia has offered assistance with disaster victim identification. New Zealand has offered a hundred firefighters. Singapore has offered to deploy Super Puma helicopters. The United States Department of the Interior is in discussions with the government of Victoria on the provision of personnel and assistance. We welcome each of these offers of support and these expressions of sympathy from around the world. It is good that they have Victorians and all Australians should know that in this darkest hour they are not alone. Since Saturday night the Australian government has been working closely with the Victorian government in response to this disaster. The Commonwealth disaster plan has been activated. The Australian Defence Force has established a Victorian based joint task force of more than 450 personnel, under the command of Brigadier Michael Arnold, commander of 4 Brigade. The joint task force, which includes full-time and reserve defence members from Navy, Army and Air Force, has provided tents, stretchers and sleeping bags to accommodate 120 people at the Yea recreation reserve. One hundred and forty soldiers from Puckapunyal are assisting with this task. One hundred and sixty reserve soldiers have been deployed to assist police with search and recovery. The joint task force has also provided 150 portable beds or mattresses to relief centres in the Baw Baw Shire. This is to enable emergency workers with facilities so that they can get enough rest to continue their tireless work. The task force also includes heavy plant, chainsaw sections and logistics support, which have been assigned to the clean-up task. Graders, bulldozers, front-end loaders and their operators have been asked to assist with fire containment measures, reopening of roads and firefighting measures around Yea and elsewhere. Defence Force personnel will help build containment lines around Yea, which is still being seriously threatened with fire. Four communications-dedicated armoured personnel carriers have been sent to the town to assist Defence Force engineers and to provide an emergency medical capability if required. The ADF has also been asked to provide aerial imaging of affected areas. This will enable the identification of all resicome. All dences affected by fire. Ninety personnel from the Australian Federal Police have also been deployed to help Victoria Police with the investigation and response to the fires, crisis centre operations and general responsibilities. The AFP team comprises some 16 disaster victim identification specialists, 14 members from the AFP Melbourne office to assist with the National Registration and Inquiry System, and 60 from the International Deployment Group's Operational Response Group. Minister Macklin and I have both conveyed to the Victoria Police that, if any further ADF personnel or AFP personnel are required, they will of course be made immediately available. That will include any assistance required in the investigation into the causes of these fires. Emergency Management Australia is also providing critical support in coordinating our response across the government and in liaising with the Victorian government agencies. Tony Pearce, Director-General of Emergency Management Australia, has been providing me and my office with written and verbal briefings about the fire situation throughout each day. The House will be aware that we have made available the Australian government disaster relief payment. This payment is $1,000 per adult and $400 per child for those affected by fires, in order to provide immediate cash help. As honourable members will be aware, people escaping from fires have often arrived simply with the shirts on their backs, if that, and therefore the provision of immediate cash to help get the necessities to get through the next day has been of vital importance. Payments started flowing on Monday. I am advised that, at close of business on 9 February, we had received 2,027 claims, with 427 paid and 1,600 pending. Cash payments were made at Yea, Warragul and Alexandra yesterday. Other relief and recovery that did not have access to banks will have cash available from today. Indeed, a number of banks have agreed to establish facilities at local centres to make cash payments there and then. Five hundred and ninety-three adults and children have been provided with assistance worth $493,400, and authorities are working to provide further assistance as quickly as is humanly possible. The government's National Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements currently apply in 25 local government areas: Alpine, Baw Baw, Cardinia, Corangamite, Greater Bendigo, Hepburn, Horsham, Indigo, Latrobe, Macedon Ranges, Mitchell, Mount Alexander, Murrindindi, Nillumbik, Southern Grampians, Wangaratta, Wellington, West Wimmera, Whittlesea, Yarra Ranges and Lake Mountain Alpine Resort. Today South Gippsland, Greater Dandenong, Casey and Knox were added to the list, and the list continues to grow. NDRRA assistance involves measures to help with those suffering personal hardship and distress assistance: emergency personal hardship grants of $427 per adult, $213 per child and up to a maximum of $1,067 per household, and temporary living and re-establishment grants of up to $8,650. On Sunday the Commonwealth announced a $10 million contribution to an immediate Community Recovery Fund to assist local communities, small businesses and primary producers. We are currently working with the Victorian government on the specific details for the operation of this fund. The Commonwealth has also made a $2 million contribution to the Victorian Bushfire Appeal Fund. I understand it currently has received donations of more than $15 million. I urge all Australians to make a contribution to this appeal, and I thank from the bottom of my heart all of those Australians who have dug deep. It is a great testament to what Ausrecovery tralians do at times like this. I announce to the House today that the Victorian government, in partnership with the Commonwealth government, will establish the Victorian Bushfire Reconstruction and Recovery Authority to coordinate bushfire recovery activity across Victoria. The authority will be responsible for coordinating the effort of all local, state and Commonwealth government agencies and the many community organisations involved, aimed at helping communities to recover and to rebuild. The authority will be established under existing state government legislation. The head of the authority will be the outgoing Chief Commissioner of Victoria Police, Christine Nixon, who will be responsible to the Premier. A CEO will be appointed. The Premier will be assisted by a ministerial advisory group. The group will include the Commonwealth's coordinating minister, Minister Macklin. The head of the authority will chair an interagency task force comprising all relevant state and Commonwealth government agencies and local government representatives. The authority will be supported by a dedicated project team with the specialist skills needed for the reconstruction and recovery task. Community input and consultation will be directed through a community reference group. The Australian government can also announce today further steps to assist the natural disaster affected areas of Victoria and Queensland. The government will provide an additional $5 million for emergency relief for our most recent natural disasters in Victoria and Queensland. This will be provided immediately to church and other nongovernment organisations working in the field-organisations such as Anglicare, the Salvation Army, St Vincent de Paul, UnitingCare and others-to help them provide food and other essential supplies to those affected. For councils in the natural disaster affected areas, the Australian government will allow them the opportunity to reprioritise their projects under the government's $250 million Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program to better meet their needs. These councils will be notified of this change in program today. In order to assist fire affected Victorian local governments and flood affected Queensland local governments, I have asked that the payments for the local government financial assistance grants also be accelerated. As a result, the final payment for the 2008-09 financial year, which is due on 15 May 2009, will be brought forward to 23 February 2009. All Victorian and Queensland councils, including those affected by the current emergency, will receive these advance payments. This will provide fire affected councils with an immediate injection of funds to ensure that recovery can commence immediately. These funds are untied and can be spent on local priorities determined by individual councils. These priorities will vary from council to council depending on the individual circumstances of the council and the impacts of this terrible disaster. For example, Murrindindi Shire Council has lost about one quarter of its houses. This has affected its rates base and consequently its ongoing cash flow. In addition, the Commonwealth Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government will consult with all affected councils and communities in Victoria and Queensland to determine the immediate and long-term needs of their communities. The government today will also put in place an income support recovery assistance program for individuals who have lost their primary source of income, including small businesses and farmers, as a direct result of the Victorian fires and the floods in Queensland. This assistance will be in the form of an ex-gratia Newstart-like payment up to the maximum amount of Newstart for a period of 13 weeks, to be extended if necessary. The Australian government through Medicare and Centrelink will also work with the Victorian government to assist individuals to re-establish their identity for those who have lost licences and other proof of identity. When you meet personally the victims of this extraordinary disaster, the desperation is compounded for those who have lost every form of establishing who they are. It is something which, unless you have experienced it, is beyond imagining. It is not just the loss of memories and photos and entire family histories; it is the loss of the certification of who you are and your legal personality. So we will provide the resources necessary through Centrelink and other agencies to assist in the immediate provision of necessary means of identification for people to begin the difficult and long task of establishing anything approaching a normal life. Job seekers in the affected areas of Victoria and Queensland who volunteer to help with the clean-up and recovery efforts or who live in locations where job opportunities have effectively been destroyed will not be asked to look for work for a period. Job seekers who have been personally impacted by the tragedy will also be subject to a waiver of compliance obligation for a period of time. The Australian government will also enter into negotiations with the Victorian and Queensland governments to establish a farming and small business assistance fund. Businesses in affected regions will be able to ply for capital grants to purchase or replace premises, machinery or other capital needs. The Australian government's $6.4 billion social housing fund, announced as part of the nation building plan recently, will be available to state governments responding to social housing needs in disaster affected areas. The government of Victoria will be able to draw on its estimated $1.5 billion share of the social housing fund to assist families in need as a result of the Victorian bushfires. The government of Queensland will similarly be able to draw on its estimated $1.3 billion share of this fund to meet the needs those affected by flooding in North Queensland. In dealing with the reconstruction and repair of schools in disaster affected areas, Australian government will make funds available from the $14.7 billion Building the Education Revolution program. The Victorian government will be able to give priority to construction of school infrastructure in communities affected by bushfires. The Queensland government will also be able to give priority to repairs and upgrades of those schools that have been damaged by flooding in North Queensland. This is the start of dealing with the tragedy that has unfolded in both of the states. The Australian government stands ready to assist, in any other possible way, our fellow Australians in rebuilding their lives. Given the magnitude of this tragedy, we have deliberately made the decision to place no cap on the Commonwealth's contribution to the recovery and reconstruction effort. This government will be a partner for the long term in the rebuilding of each of the communities. As members of the House will be aware, it is important that all facts concerning this extraordinary natural disaster are made known. The government will provide all asap- sistance we can to the royal commission that has been announced by the Victorian Premier. As the House will be aware, the royal commission will be examining all aspects of the Victorian government's bushfire strategy and, as the Premier has said, everything will be on the table. We must do all that is possible through this commission so that we properly prepare for the future. We await the deliberations of that commission and its subsequent findings. While the Victorian firestorm has been unleashed on the good people of so many communities in that state, floods have been of ravaging towns in the north of our country. As was announced yesterday, the Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy, Dr Emerson, has the gone to North Queensland to ensure that funds flow quickly to flood victims and to coordinate the Commonwealth's contribution to the relief effort there. Dr Emerson will be giving all possible support to local staff, who are doing a highly professional job, and ensuring that any necessary decisions can be made quickly. Yesterday the minister met with Centrelink and the Queensland Department of Communities in Townsville. He was advised that Centrelink payments of $1,000 per eligible adult and $400 per child are flowing to victims. The payments are for people who have been seriously injured or whose home has been destroyed, significantly damaged or inaccessible for more than 48 hours. So far, 600 claims have been received. This morning the minister was briefed by the Director-General of the Department of Emergency Services, Queensland, and today the minister is meeting with Commonwealth and state officers, relief staff and local residents in Ingham, where the road is now open to four-wheel drive vehicles for the first time in a week. Today 20 Centrelink staff have travelled to Ingham to join those already on the ground. In Ingham, 3,000 homes have been affected, with 90 per cent of businesses still closed. The town of Halifax is still isolated and supplies are getting in by helicopter. The government also continues to closely monitor the unfolding events in North Queensland. In recent days the nation has observed a legion of heroes at work. The work of our emergency services workers; the CFA, the Country Fire Authority, of Victoria; and all those country fire authorities which have come from across the country to support their brothers and sisters in arms in dealing with their common enemy is testament to the enormous spirit of country fire authorities across Australia. Their courage has been remarked upon in recent days and, having heard some of the stories first hand, theirs will again be the stuff of legend. Workers with the CFA, the police, the SES, ambulance, those working in hospitals and those with the extraordinary and delicate task of working in the burns units of hospitals all deserve our utmost respect and commendation from this, the parliament of the nation, and so they receive it. In each of the centres also there is the army of volunteers: the Red Cross, the Salvation Army and others who materialise in a way best known only to God at times like this, helped, I am sure, by extraordinary feats of organisation and by those good ladiesinvariably good ladies but not always-and some men as well who are there in an instant to make it work. It is a rolling miracle Australian volunteer community and the church and charitable sector that this great army of people immediately comes and is there, without complaint, without request for anything in particular, prepared, sleeves rolled up, quietly, effectively, assiduously doing their job. In each centre I visited yesterday and the day before, in Yea, Whittlesea and Alexandra and also other centres, this army of volunteers was working quietly and effectively. In one centre I visited I saw literally acres of bedding, provided by local shops and local families, ready to be made available to those who now have nothing. Entire gymnasiums full of clothing, including kids' clothing, toys, bedding, and anything else that you might need to start up a household, all materialised within a day or two of the ask going out. That is an extraordinary testament to those communities, an extraordinary testament to the church, charitable and community organisations which have made the physical organisation of it possible. We are left speechless at the thought and the possibility that some of these fires may have been deliberately lit. Every member of this House cannot comprehend how anyone could ever do that. Something which the nation must now attend to, as a matter of grave urgency, is the problem of arson: where it happens, why it happens and what more can be done about it. There is no excuse for this-none at all. This, as I said yesterday, is simply murder on a grand scale. Let us attend to this unfinished business of the nation and come to grips with this evil thing. The fires continue and, as we assemble here in the nation's parliament today to reflect on what has happened in days past and on the acts of heroism and the experience of tragedy, let each one of us remember that they are all still in the field today in so many different parts of Australia-in Victoria, in of the New South Wales and elsewhere-fighting the great elements of nature which bear down on communities. We salute each one of them. We also, as we gather here today, reflect on the lives and families which are now permanently shattered. This is an unspeakable horror for those families. The ability to recover from events of such extraordinary trauma will be sorely tested in the days, weeks and years ahead. One of the things that Jenny Macklin, the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, has been determined to do is to ensure that we have a sufficient availability of counsellors in the field nowcounsellors for the families who are now bereaved, counsellors for those whose friends and neighbours have perished or have seen their friends and neighbours perish. The trauma of scarred and blackened vehicles along the road to Marysville, which I saw yesterday, the trauma also of Country Fire Authority personnel who have confronted this first hand and the police and emergency services personnel dealing with the aftermath: the physicality and the emotional scar of trauma reaches deep into people. This is a much-needed and necessary area of work to be done, and done as well as possible, in the days ahead. We do not know what lies ahead. What I have outlined to the House today is our response to date. Let us all work with governments at all levels and with all communities and community organisations of goodwill to deal with each challenge as it presents itself. I say to the country at large that, whatever community you are from, if it has been rendered to ashes, if it has been destroyed, together we will rebuild each of these communities-hear this from the government and the parliament of the nation. This will take time. It will take effort. Yesterday I sat in the community hall at Alexandra and spoke with a lady of a certain age who was the town's local historian-the town in question being Marysville. She asked this question of me: ‘What is it to be the town historian of a town that is no more?' She said that this year the town was about to celebrate the 40th anniversary of its historical society-would there be a 50th? I told her on behalf of the government and, I believe, the parliament that there would be that this town and others like it would be rebuilt, brick by brick, school by school, community hall by community hall. That must underpin our long-term resolve as a government, as a parliament and as a nation-to be there with these communities not just in the trying and difficult days and weeks which lie ahead but in the arduous task of the months and years that lie ahead until, one day, we can look back before too much time has gone and say, ‘These towns, these communities, have been reborn.' I have read the contributions to this debate yesterday from many members on both sides of the House. I thank them for those contributions. I acknowledge the contribution of individual members of parliament, some of whom-understandably-are still not with us today but are attending to their local communities. I sought to speak to a number of those members during the course of yesterday. We have a large task ahead of us and it will be uneven in the recovery-that is the nature of things. But let us resolve clearly, in full witness of the nation at large, that this will be our common resolve: to rebuild each of these communities so that these communities can live again. Honourable members-Hear, hear!",15
4,Mr TURNBULL,CONDOLENCES,"On indulgence, Mr Speaker: on behalf of the opposition, I thank the Prime Minister for his remarks and commend both the Australian and Victorian governments on their immediate response. We welcome the establishment of the royal commission and the new federal-state reconstruction authority. We restate our commitment to do whatever it takes to put these communities back on their feet and we encourage the government to address the relief of these communities in specific legislation separate from other measures.",21
5,Mr BROADBENT,CONDOLENCES,"On indulgence, Mr Speaker.",22
6,The SPEAKER,CONDOLENCES,The member has every right to speak to this motion. The member for MCMillan has our support.,22
7,Mr BROADBENT,CONDOLENCES,"I want to identify, of course, with the remarks of the Prime Minister and thank him for his call of concern to my electorate, through me; it was passed on to my electorate. Prime Minister, I believe you were where you should have been these last two days-you were at the front in Victoria with the Premier and with Ted Baillieu, doing what we would have expected of you, and I thank you for that. When Ivan Smith's face came on my television on Saturday afternoon-he was my district group officer during the Ash Wednesday bushfire-I knew we were in trouble. He is a very experienced incident controller. I knew that the fire was out of Bunyip Ridge state forests and on the move. I was immediately drawn back to that day at Beaconsfield when my team was pulled from the fire 15 minutes before the crews that went in before us died. I was immediately reminded of the next day, heading with my crew and my truck up to Upper Pakenham. I had the best driver I knew in the town, Greg Atkins, a great team and a good truck, but I was wondering one thing: will I bring these people home? I know that goes through the minds of the Ivan Smiths and the Peter Schmidts-Peter Schmidt gave us a briefing yesterday-and the Brian Petries. They are all over this great southland, these people. Their names you do not know-they are just men and women who do their jobs extremely well. It was hard coming in here yesterday, when the call came out from Churchill in Darren Chester's electorate. We had fires last week near there and we had fires coming through there last night. The word was that it was too late to leave. The fear rips you when you know that one of the communities in your electorate-it was in my electorate; it is now in Darren's electorate-has a fire fronting the homes. These are urban country areas where a fire is drifting through and then coming on at a rate about which the CFA is saying that it is too late to leave. When I was at Warragul on Sunday at the refuge centre, my friend Gary Blackwood, the member for Narracan, said, ‘I have just spoken to my mate. They stayed to defend the house. They expected the ember attack and then the fire front to go through. But instead of that, two lines of flame came at them, straight out of the scrub. They hit the shed wall and went straight up the shed wall, across the shed roof, down to the floor, across the ground and into the house, and the house blew up.' This was in a matter of seconds. They were ready for everything, and they were mentally the prepared too. The awesome fury of the fire coming out of the Bunyip state forest just before it broke into open ground ripped out a 200-foot mountain ash, threw it into the air and dropped it on the ground as if it were a twig. The awesome fury of this fire cannot be comprehended by the thinking of any reasonable person. I say to the Deputy Prime Minister: thank you for your address yesterday. It may be looked back on as one of the most important addresses you have ever made to this House. To the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition: you identified with the broken-hearted, with the wounded spirits, with the loss, the grieving and the terrible unprecedented trauma that is being experienced right now. I know there are people who will wake every morning believing that it was all a dream; that it did not happen. And then they will realise it was not a dream and they will cry and they will cry again. Deputy Prime Minister, you identified with every man and woman right across Australia. More importantly, as I stood in my kitchen listening while you stood together as one in this House on behalf of all of those people, that was a proud moment for me because you all identified with what the others had just said. The people of Australia knew that each one of you stood as one with them. It is not just about David Hawker, John Forrest, Sophie Mirabella, Tony Smith, Jason Wood, Darren Cheeseman, Steve Gibbons-and Fran Bailey: I do not know how that woman is standing on her feet. I have known her since 1984 and she is tough as guts, and I know she is out there now doing what she can in her area, which has been so badly affected. Not just those I mentioned but all of you-many from New South Wales-have people who will be investing in the work that will need to be done over time. The six degrees of separation is a lot closer in Australia. I also do not want to leave out mentioning the Treasurer and his remarks yesterday in regard to these fires. The Bunyip Ridge fire was an incendiary device sitting for four days waiting for the north wind. To give a bit of an outline for those who do not know where MCMillan is, we are in Gippsland. If you imagine Melbourne and East Gippsland, it is around the centre, near the Great Dividing Range, Mount Baw Baw-that area. Bunyip Ridge is closer to Melbourne, sitting not say how the fire started, but four fires went up at the one time on the one road way back in the forest. That fire sat there against as much effort as the DSE could put into it for that time, and we knew about it and we had a plan for it. We have fought many fires in that area. It was going to come out of the forest and it was going to come out on Saturday. We knew about what time it was going to come out, we knew where it was going to go and we knew what the worse case scenario was. I paint that picture for you of where Bunyip is. Just to the east of that, you then have Noojee and Walhalla, where there are five fires burning. Way to the east, we have the Dargo fire. Behind us, we have the Churchill fire, which is just coming up again through increased wind right across Victoria. I paint that picture because there is also the Healesville fire closer to the north of Melbourne. What we are looking at is a fire that we are in and managing today, and each one of us in this room who has identified with the Australian community are all in this fire in Victoria today. And the worse case scenario is that if we do not have rain, those fires will join together. The Bunyip Ridge fire has a 21kilometre front at the moment. That is going north by one kilometre. In the worse case, the Healesville fire will join the Bunyip Ridge fire and the Noojee fires. I dare say, Prime Minister, that you have had the same briefing that I have. Therefore, if a northerly wind changes, we are then threatened all the way to the south from that fire. Those of you who have experienced the weather patterns that have been going on in Victoria recently will know that there have been hot days and then cool changes which hit hard and will go for an hour. That is how the great damage of Ash Wednesday and the incredible damage of yesterday was done. That is the situation we up there. I will face today. There are things we can do, but I want to pay tribute to the ABC: to Gerard Callinan and his team at the ABC at Gippsland. For those of you who were listening to channel 774 and getting all the information that you needed, how important are they to us and how important are they to every individual? I heard one man say how important it was: ‘Just to hear a voice in my house. I have nothing else. I am staying here to protect.' I know how people felt on Saturday afternoon. I changed into my boots, my woollen socks, my cotton jeans and my pure cotton top, and I got my overalls ready and went outside and picked up the hose that was going to protect us. I turned it on and it blew straight back over my head and I knew then that what I was facing was nothing that we could normally do something about in our household. So I put it down and went back inside and said to Bronwyn, ‘Get the dog, get the bucket, put it in the car. The moment we see anything go up to our north, we move.' There are many working in our community today who are still traumatised by what happened on Ash Wednesday. We are going to need every resource that this government and this parliament together can muster to respond to what has happened, what is happening and what is ahead of us. I know that you will do that as one. Our firemen have been terrific and they are tired, but there are those who work in the back room. If you are a person anywhere in Australia who has experience in logistics, resource management or fire planning and you have not come forward yet, please come forward. And if you are someone who in the future might like to be trained in that area, these are the men and the women who have been working behind the scenes: in administration, catering-normal things that are not on the front page of the paper. But they are equally important as those who are on the fire front. To those who pray, I say: pray now; do not leave it until next Sunday. To those who fight, I say: all strength to your arm; stay safe. To those who serve, I say: we in this parliament stand with you as one. There was a note from somebody else today that I read in all the information that comes through, but I added to it. In times such as these of unprecedented trauma when faced with an inescapable disaster from a near indestructible force, all we can rely on is each other. Sadly, as the Prime Minister has described today, there are so many who cannot even do that.",22
8,Mr ANTHONY SMITH,CONDOLENCES,"As a Victorian member of this House who represents that part of outer eastern Melbourne and the Yarra Valley that adjoins the MCEwen electorate of Fran Bailey, I want to associate myself with all of the speakers on the motion moved by the Deputy Prime Minister yesterday, with the words of the Prime Minister, with all those who spoke yesterday and with the moving words we have just heard from the member for MCMillan. We are united in our sorrow for the families who are grieving. We are shocked at the scale of the tragedy. We are, as previous speakers have said, in total awe of the volunteers and the emergency service workers. We are proud of the community spirit that we are seeing and that we have seen in tragedies in the past. As the Prime Minister indicated and the member for MCMillan reiterated, we are still coming to terms with a horror that is growing and a nightmare that is not over. I thank all of the CFAs from across Casey and MCEwen. As you can imagine, they work very closely together and, as we speak and meet here in this House, they are fighting the fires in and around Yarra Glen and Healesville. I thank all of the CFAs from across Victoria and the volunteer firefighters from right around Australia. Together with the police and emergency services, as the Prime Minister indicated, even the most hardened and experienced of police and emergency service workers are seeing things they have never seen in their careers. I thank the staff of the Shire of Yarra Ranges, led by the mayor, Len Cox, and the chief executive officer, Glenn Patterson, who are working around the clock. I spoke to Fran Bailey earlier. She asked me, in speaking today, to pass on her thanks to all of you who have left messages for her. She has passed the messages on to her constituents on behalf of all 150 of us here in this House, who represent each corner of Australia. As you know, Fran's office and her home are in Healesville, which today has fire close by on the doorstep, and so that she can keep working she has moved herself and her office down to my office, a little further down on the Maroondah Highway in Chirnside Park. The Leader of the Opposition spoke yesterday of the accounts he had heard on the ground about the sheer speed and ferocity of the fire. My wife and I and our young sons live right on the gateway to the Yarra Valley, up on a hill on the edge of Chirnside Park and Lilydale. For so many Melburnians, when we saw the mushroom cloud of black and grey erupting over Kinglake on Saturday afternoon, then the wind change and gale force winds, followed by a deadly symphony of fires starting off along the Melba Highway at Dixons Creek and Steels Creek and into Yarra Glen, followed by spot fires and fires started by lightning, the sheer scale of it beyond comprehension. As a Victorian member I know-and other Victorian members would agree-that most Melburnians can see the Yarra Valley mountains and the Dandenong Ranges from where they work and live, and when smoke rose from the Yarra Valley late on Saturday afternoon most feared what it might mean. Most instinctively thought of Ash Wednesdayour worse reference point. That we have awoken to and, as we need to keep reminding ourselves, are still in the midst of thing more horrific naturally strains our human capacity to comprehend. Many Victorian members know well the country towns we have been reading and talking about-towns like Marysville, Kinglake and Flowerdale-because we have been to them on school camps or day trips. We have driven along the roads that became death traps. We have played footy or cricket there. All of us in this House and all Australians know these towns and these people, because the community spirit which built them, which has sustained them and which will rebuild them is alive in every Australian in every town.",24
9,Mr FORREST,CONDOLENCES,"In speaking in support of this motion, I am very, very saddened in lots of ways but I am heartened by the deep sense of subduedness amongst the 150 of us here. I say to each and every one of you: we must use the energy that has been generated amongst us these last two days to finally do something constructive about preventing disasters like the one which confronts Victoria. Although with nowhere near the same death toll, this has happened before. The electorate of Mallee is not unfamiliar with bushfire. The two distinct regions of the electorate are the north, which is the regional area of Mallee itself, and the south, which is was the Wimmera. Much of the electorate is bush and national park. Bushfire watch starts usually around late October, mid-November in those national parks, with fire spotters in the air. Fires are started mostly by lightning but occasionally by arson. In the Wimmera are the Little Desert and Big Desert regions, which are often threatened, but never before have we had the threat in the suburbs. There was a fire in Horsham but my electorate has not had the fatalities that my colleagues have had and spoken of right across some- Victoria-although one member of the public was badly burned while attempting to help his neighbour release stock locked into a paddock-so in a way we can say we have been spared. But eight families have lost their dwellings, a commercial trucking company has lost its entire industrial buildingalthough thankfully it managed to save its fleet of trucks-and the prestigious Horsham Golf Club is in ruins. Horsham Golf Club involved massive investment and was mostly community funded. It was a building that the community was proud of and that hosted international events, but it now looks like an atomic blast has gone through it. Other members have spoken about the terror that people have endured across Victoria. I was impressed with the explanation of the member for Bendigo yesterday, relayed in terms of what his constituents have been reporting to him as the sheer terror of the Australian bushfire. There is a part of this debate that is bothterm, ering me, being trained as an engineer. I remember from engineering school at university that there is no engineering solution to confronting a eucalyptus-fuelled Australian bushfire. Seemingly nature has created this wonderful environment, which other members have spoken of, that is designed to burn occasionally. It is an enigma, isn't it? Eucalyptus oil is a volatile oil. It does not just start to burn when the intensity of the fire reaches 600 degrees but rather ignites and explodes like a bomb. People who have had the frightening experience of being near an Australian bushfire explain that it comes like a speeding train. It comes at temperatures that are unbearable to the human body. The body of the fire itself can reach temperatures in excess of 900 to 1,000 degreestemperatures that melt the aluminium alloys in the gearboxes of motor cars. Others have said there must be an engineering solution to building buildings that can withstand such a terror but, other than a concrete nuclear ker, there is not. As tough as it is for the families in my constituency who have lost their homes, they are ringing my office wanting to help somewhere else in Victoria, which is a credit to their incredible Australianness. Receiving calls like that makes us feel good about being Aussies, with that wonderful spirit of common humanity. The Prime Minister rang me on Sunday morning, and I really valued that call and made the Mayor of the Horsham Rural City Council, Councillor Bernard Gross, aware of it. It provided a great deal of reassurance and, through the Speaker, I thank you, Prime Minister, for it. When people have called me they have asked for suggestions about what could be done to assist. I think I was still in some level of shock when responding, but I said that there is the immediate term and then there is the long-term reconstruction and that, in the immediate we need to get social support in there as quickly as we can. Another thing that I said was that we must find a way to express our appreciation to the Australian volunteers who put their own lives at risk and stick their necks out for their fellow Australians. My own baby brother has just joined a Sunraysia CFA task force. They were in Kinglake last night and over the next few days may well front the maelstrom that the member for MCMillan described to us. Another thing that this crisis has made me realise is how small a community we are as Australians. There might be only 20-odd million of us, but everybody knows somebody affected by what has happened in the last three or four days-a friend of a friend, a relative-and people have tried to support those who still do not know where their loved ones are, and there is a long list of those people. Getting back to the engineering, I need to correct the record in regard to the Horsham bun- fire. The member for Wannon generously embraced my constituents in his remarks yesterday. Both he and I had been advised that the Horsham fire was a result of arson. The fire forensics have subsequently identified that, while that was suspected, that was not the case. The Horsham fire commenced at a faulty power pole. For decades this has been an issue. I can remember that as a young child there were helicopters that flew over power lines and that occasionally would spray the dust off an insulator before moving on to the next pole as they conducted inspections. There are things that stick in your mind and stay with you forever. My late father had an Irish friend who said, ‘What a terrible waste of good alcohol.' He made that assumption because alcohol is used to defrost insulators in alpine areas. But it is a silicon solution that is used to dedust transmission lines in dusty regions. In a faulty insulator an arc can form and, when it has a wooden cross arm, it feeds a fire. The sparks fall to the ground. Time and time again this has been identified as a source of these terrible fires. Colleagues and friends, we must find a way to energise ourselves and use the strong sense of humanity that we have been feeling in this place in the last two days to do something about it. We have to provide assistance to power authorities to replace those timber cross arms with steel. It is a readily available engineering solution. Sure, there is a cost involved, but we need to find the resources to achieve that. My other anxiety is about what those families who have survived must be going through, especially those who still have not been able to locate loved ones. What must they be going through? Many members have stood and offered their prayers and thoughts. We do this as human beings; we offer our prayerful support. For some of us, that thought and sentiment comes out of our common humanity. Sometimes it comes out of a strong position of faith. My prayer since Saturday has been that somehow those persons concerned can find the strength to address the deep cavity that they feel in their hearts having lost a precious loved one and their property. My prayer is that somehow they will find the courage to build again. My other prayer is that they will be inspired to do that by the overwhelming support that is coming from their Australian friends right across the nation. I was pleased, Prime Minister, that you have announced some level of coordination of the voluntary aid effort. My office has now moved on to receiving calls from people who want to offer a truck to cart some blankets down. All they are asking is for perhaps the fuel to be picked up. Others are offering hay. I am not really sure what the demand is for stock and fodder in the east of Victoria, but I would like an opportunity to be able to direct those people to a central point. I ask you to take that on board. I will just finished by reinforcing the remarks made yesterday and today, especially for those who do not know where their loved ones have ended up. The brutal reality is that, with the temperature of these fires, they may never know.",25

14,Mr ZAPPIA,FEDERAL COURT OF AUSTRALIA,"It is very difficult to take one's mind off the events in Victoria after listening to the ous speakers, but I accept that the business of this House must go on. I rise to speak in support of the Federal Court of Australia Amendment (Criminal Jurisdiction) Bill 2008. I welcome the introduction of this bill, which I am sure will also be welcomed by most Australians. This bill is related to the Trade Practices Amendment (Cartel Conduct and Other Measures) Bill 2008, which amends the Trade Practices Act 1974 and which introduces new offences for serious cartel conduct. These amendments in turn give the Federal Court jurisdiction to deal with those new offences and set up the necessary framework. Equally welcome is that, for the first time, serious cartel conduct will be criminalised and there will be uniform procedures across Australia, including a trial by jury. Serious breaches would carry a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment and a $220,000 fine. This is consistent with international penalties. Other provisions in bill relate to the procedures of the court, which are matters that I will leave to my colleagues with legal expertise to pass comment on. The bill is long overdue. It is long overdue Reference that serious cartel conduct should be criminalised, and the Trade Practices Act amendment bill will do exactly that. However if the amendment is to be effective then the laws and processes relating to such prosecutions must also be in place. That is what this bill does. For years the difficulty of successfully prosecuting serious cartel conduct has been a cause of frustration for both the government and the wider community. Furthermore, the penalties relating to such conduct have been inadequate to act as a deterrent. Criminal cartel conduct is a matter which crosses state and national jurisdictions and is therefore quite rightly a matter over which the Federal Court should have jurisdiction. Furthermore, the ACCC, which has been empowered to previconduct the necessary investigations and launch prosecutions, is also a national body. The Federal Court of Australia, which began exercising its jurisdiction in 1977, already deals with a number of corporate matters, including the Australian Competition Tribunal. I note that the draft legislation has been the subject of widespread public consultation and that a number of submissions have been made, particularly by the legal fraternity. Given that any prosecutions under the legislation will undoubtedly be costly, drawn-out cases, every attempt should be made to close possible loopholes and minimise any ambiguity within the legislation. I note from the submission from the International Bar Association, a group which represents some 30,000 individual lawyers from across the world, that 15 jurisdictions worldwide already have criminal sanctions for cartel conduct. Of those, 11 jurisdictions may impose a term of imprisonment for cartel conduct, with the terms ranging from one to 10 years. Under the legislation, if the Federal Court and a state or territory supreme court both have jurisdiction to hear a trial on indictment and a magistrate makes a committal order then the magistrate will have to determine which court should be named in the order. The magistrate will, however, be required to consult with the Director of Public Prosecutions and ultimately the Director of Public Prosecutions will make the final decision on which court an indictment should be filed in. The legislation creates criminal offences for making or giving effect to a contract, arrangement or understanding that contains a cartel provision with the intention of dishonestly obtaining a benefit. Consistent with international best practice, the definition of a cartel provision applicable to both the criminal and civil regimes will reflect the OECD's definition of hardcore cartel conduct. The OECD recommendation defines hardcore cartel conduct as an anticompetitive agreement, anticompetitive concerted practice or anticompetitive arrangement by competitors to fix prices, make rigged bids-which is otherwise known as collusive tenders-establish output restrictions or quotas, or share or divide markets by allocating customers, suppliers, territories or lines of commerce. This is a very broad range of activities that are generally very difficult to prove. In that respect I welcome the provisions in the related bill relating to the protection of witnesses and to telephone interception. I note that this bill has been referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for inquiry and report by 20 February 2009. I expect that the Senate committee will want to have a close look at the six submissions that were received as part of their inquiry, all of which came from the legal profession. Within those submissions, several matters were raised, including whether the Federal Court is the most appropriate jurisdiction to hear cartel conduct cases; whether the Federal Court is properly resourced to handle the workload; and matters relating to the presumption of bail, defence disclosure and jury selection. These are matters which I expect the minister is aware of and which the minister will respond to if specific recommendations arise from the Senate committee report. I note that the bill has the support of opposition members and I commend the bill to the House.",28
15,Mr OAKESHOTT,FEDERAL COURT OF AUSTRALIA,"Lyne) (3.44 pm)Before I begin speaking on the Federal Court of Australia Amendment (Criminal Jurisdiction) Bill 2008 I would like to put on record very briefly the views of the mid-North Coast of New South Wales, following the very generous and passionate comments from others in relation to both the Victorian bushfires and the Queensland floods. I represent an area which is geographically between the two natural disasters that are currently going on. Whilst the mid-North Coast is not physically affected, many in the region are very touched emotionally and their thoughts are with family, friends and communities affected. The communities of the mid-North Coast are also helping through offering financial assistance, donating blood and contacting family and friends. We also have one of the major Centrelink call centres, which is dealing with many calls in relation to both natural disasters. At a local level our thoughts are also with those taking those calls. All support locally will be in place. I turn to the bill before the House. After four months in this chamber, having seen $70 billion spent by government in relation to many financial affairs, I consider this to of equal significance in finally dealing with the issue of cartels within Australia and their impacts on local communities throughout Australia. When I first spoke in this chamber three to four months ago, I said that I would advocate as much as possible not only on behalf of the 90,000 residents of the midNorth Coast of New South Wales-and in this particular legislation you can change the word ‘residents' to ‘consumers'-but also on behalf of the business community of the midNorth Coast of New South Wales, which is one that is 95 per cent dominated by organisations of five employees or fewer. The two groups that are going to feel the full impacts of cartel behaviour are those in the micro small businesses in local communities and regions such as mine and consumers who are paying too much for the end product. We are finally seeing legislation that is dealing with cartel behaviour and treating it as what it is, which is essentially theft, fraud and criminal behaviour. That is certainly long overdue and it is welcomed. I thank the government for bringing it in and for making it fit into the federal jurisdiction. For some reason, and it has always confused me, Australia seems to lag with regard to cartel behaviour. Whether it is because the concept is probably not cracking through to the common psyche as much as it could, whether it is because of our penal background, whether it is because of our larrikin nature in trying to beat the tax manwhatever the reason is-I would hope that there is an educational element in this legislation that is going to make very clear to the common man and woman on the street that cartel behaviour is probably the most significant offence in a market economy with regard to impacts on the consumer and the small business on the street in regional areas such as mine. I support this legislation as it upholds a be couple of fundamental principles of justice under the rule of law, one being consistency. It is crazy that we could have eight different players involved in the one cartel that may be based in eight different states and that they would be treated differently by eight different jurisdictions, with eight different outcomes. There would be a fundamental inconsistency in the way the message of the consequences of cartel behaviour would be sent to communities. There would be an inconsistency in the fundamental principles of the rule of law. This would lead to fundamentally inconsistent outcomes in dealing with cartel practice. So consistency is a critical and important aspect of these changes, which I certainly welcome. I know these issues have been highlighted by others far more eminent than me, such as Justice Weinberg and others, in promoting the argument that there is a problem that needs to be addressed to achieve greater consistency in dealing with cartel behaviour. Fundamentally, there is the issue of relevance. All of us, if we are being good local members, respond to frustrated letters about price fixing in all its forms, whether at the petrol bowser or in the shopping centre. If this legislation can start to up the ante in putting pressure on those involved in illegal activity and in developing more transparent practices at the top end of the market economy of Australia then I think it will make some substantial changes that will be recognised in local communities such as mine and I am sure in the other 149 electorates throughout Australia. The laws in respect of cartel practices need to be relevant. Consumers have been complaining about many issues that they feel aggrieved about. We can start to shoot some of them home with regard to cartel behaviour. There is the high profile example of last year in which small business operators in their many forms around Australia who were involved in the lower levels of the chain of that particular product were left out of pocket. Where is the deterrence for that future behaviour unless there is legislation such as this? This is an important reflection of those frustrations at a community level and, hopefully, it will achieve some good outcomes on behalf of small business and consumers, particularly, from my point of view, in regional areas. The constitutional issues that are contained in this legislation are also fascinating, with the Federal Court sticking its nose into indictable offences for the first time. I wish the court luck. I hope that this is the start an expanded role of the Federal Court and I wish it success in this particular field. I am one who shakes their head that it is 2009 and we are still having these jurisdictional issues. I certainly hope that this is a success and that the laws can be expanded into other areas with regard to criminal practices, again, based on the two previous points I raised on relevancy in local communities and on consistency in the delivery of law. I note the comments and concerns raised by the Law Council of Australia, the coalition and others on issues of the accused's right to silence and bail. I also note that we can argue about that in this chamber until we are blue in the face until we have some test cases that start to define some of the terms in question. The government could try and be as prescriptive as possible on some of the definitions in question but let us have a look at the notes, practices and definitions that come from the court. I hope the Attorney General has a watching brief so that, if it does not go in the direction that I hope we all want it to go, we can see further legislation or regulations come through this chamber. Finally, whilst the Attorney-General is here, there are some issues relating to cartel practice that I would like to raise. This is an opportunity for cartel practices to take a greater role and significance in law enforcement, competition law and trade practices law in Australia. I would be very interested to hear responses from the Attorney-General with regard to the consideration of specialisation and, potentially, a cartel branch within law enforcement operations. It would marry up nicely with this legislation, and the Trade Practices Amendment that is coming up soon, to see greater resourcing for the specialisation of law enforcement and the fingering of cartel practices at the highest level. In addition, with regard to criminal jurisdicof tion and cartel practices, it is noted from various international jurisdictions that reached this point earlier than us that there are still some question marks about the use of those laws. It is one thing to have these laws but it is another thing to use them. From the various surveys that have gone on in the various jurisdictions, the actual use of the laws is still relatively low. Imprisonments from the sanctions that are being proposed today are relatively low. If we are going to take this step and put this legislation in place, I hope that what comes with that is the upping of the ante in respect of the concept of cartel practices throughout Australia, and with that comes the clear message to directors, shareholders and anyone involved that this is a no-go zone; it is something that is the complete antithesis of everything about a market economy that is operating in the people's interests. We are in the people's chamber. I hope that vested interest can be put to one side by all the various players in this chamber and that we are advocates and lobbyists for people. If we are, we would then place great significance on this legislation today. I hope that it is used, used well and that we can have the market economy that we all want to see operate in the people's best interests in Australia today.",29
16,Mr MCCLELLAND,FEDERAL COURT OF AUSTRALIA,"in reply-I thank all members for their contribution to the debate on the Federal Court of Australia Amendment (Criminal Jurisdiction) Bill 2008, with the member for Lyne just concluding. This bill is the product of extensive consultation with key stakeholders around Australia. The procedural provisions are based on the best features of existing state and territory law and will allow the Federal Court to apply consistent criminal trial procedures regardless of where the trial is held. With that in mind, I would like to respond to some of the matters raised in today's debate. In particular, I would like to address a number of concerns raised by the opposition through, in particular, the member for Farrer-very sincerely raised, I acknowledge. The member for Farrer has suggested that the pretrial closure provisions abrogate the ancient right of silence of a defendant in our criminal system. These measures, contained in the current bill, are not unprecedented. The provision in question-proposed section 23CFclosely follows the Victorian provisions. Those provisions include the requirement that, if the accused takes issue with the prosecution's case, the accused must state the basis for taking issue. The aim is to ensure that an accused person provides a meaningful response to the outline of the prosecution case. The clause will not require them to disclose their defence. The Law Council of Australia has noted that the courts and the practitioners in Victoria have found ways of operating under the Victorian provisions which do not require the accused to disclose their defence, and that is what we are aiming at in this current legislation. We are aiming, with these provisions, to achieve those arrangements, and to formalise those arrangements, at the Commonwealth level. One person who is eminently qualified to comment on this legislation is Justice Mark Weinberg. Justice Weinberg is currently a judge of the Victorian Court of Appeal. He was formerly a judge of the Federal Court of Australia and, prior to that, he practised in criminal law, civil law and administrative law at the bar as well as serving for a period of time as the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions. In addition, from the academic side of analysing the law, he was the Dean of the Faculty of Law at the University of Melbourne. As a result, we believe he is eminently qualified to comment on the development of the criminal law and in particular the Federal Court's role in that development. In evidence to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs last week he indicated his support for the legislation and he rejected any notion that the dispretrial disclosure regime was in any way unfair to the accused. His Honour said: I have no difficulty with the proposition that the defence, in a case of this kind, should be expected to indicate in broad termsand I underline that the areas that are not in dispute and the areas that are in dispute, and, if they are in dispute, the general basis of why that is so. I do not regard that, in this day and age, as being in any way antithetical to the conduct of a fair trial or in violation of any notion of the right to silence or any of the more traditional reasons why it is thought that the cused should simply be entitled to put the Crown to its proof. His Honour's reference to ‘this day and age' refers to the incredible complexity of running criminal cases involving corporations and the demand on the public purse and court's time if frivolous, vexatious or unreasonable points are taken by a litigant in any proceedings and I think, with respect to His Honour, that that is what he was having regard to in commenting about the contemporary context of proceeding in a case such as this. And again, as His Honour indicated in his submission, the Crown will, under these provisions, still bear the onus of proving its case against an accused. In relation to the comments of the member for Farrer about the absence of a presumption for bail, I note the bail provisions of the bill will apply only to the serious cartel offences heard in the Federal Court. It should be left to the Federal Court to balance competing factors and to make a decision that takes into account all the circumstances of the case when considering a bail application. Having made these points, and in fairness to the argument of the member for Farrer, I note that both these matters are currently being considered by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, which is reviewing the bill; I will certainly carefully consider the committee's recommendations in terms of any final amendments that may be considered. The bill sets up the procedural framework to ensure that the Federal Court can exercise its new criminal cartel jurisdiction to be given under the Trade Practices Amendment (Cartel Conduct and Other Measures) Bill 2008-the bill that actually establishes the criminal offence. This will be the first time that the Federal Court of Australia will have jurisdiction in respect to indictable Commonwealth offences. It is the government's acbelief that these matters are too serious to be left to a summary jurisdiction and certainly too serious to be left to a regime that applies only a civil penalty, and that is why we are establishing this indictable criminal jurisdiction to deal with what we believe are very serious offences. The jurisdiction in the Federal Court will be concurrent with the state and territory Supreme Courts. This will ensure a high degree of flexibility to ensure that cartel cases can be prosecuted in the most appropriate court, but it will ensure a central role for the Federal Court in developing a nationally consistent set of principles in these areas-a matter mentioned by the member for Lyne, who mentioned the risk of developing eight different outcomes around this central cartel offences law. The Federal Court has developed extensive experience with respect to cartel conduct in the civil jurisdiction as a result of dealing with cartel cases. It makes sense for the Federal Court to be able to apply its existing expertise in that area to criminal cartel conduct as well. The Federal Court has extensive experience in dealing with complicated economic concepts in the field of competition law, and the Federal Court has been responsible for developing jurisprudence in the field-and it has been a jurisprudence that has developed a real specialty both from the point of view of practitioners and from the point of view of the court. State Supreme Courts, we believe, simply do not have that same level of experience. I note a recent media report which raised questions about why this jurisdiction is not being given exclusively to state and territory courts, which have traditionally dealt with criminal matters, including, it must be acknowledged, federal criminal matters. In response, I would say that it should be pointed out that a number of the judges of the Federal Court presided over many criminal trials and criminal appeals when they were judges of the state Supreme Courts, and other federal judges routinely preside over criminal cases in their capacities as additional judges of Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. The court itself has experience in dealing with state territory corrective service organisations and agencies as a result of conducting its general jurisdiction. In summary, this bill will give the court the full range of powers needed to run a criminal trial, from pretrial proceedings through to bail, empanelling juries, conducting trials and hearing appeals. The government is equally determined to be tough on crime, whether that crime occurs on the streets of our suburbs or in the boardrooms of our corporations. I note the member for Lyne described this cartel conduct as amounting to theft, fraud and criminal behaviour. He is absolutely right, and these two bills are intended to deal with those measures. We believe this is a major initiative in law enforcement against corporate crime and I commend this bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time.

18,Mr BALDWIN,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"I rise today to speak on the Defence Legislathe tion (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 2008. The stated purpose of this bill is threefold: firstly, to amend the Geneva Conventions and Act 1957 and the Criminal Code Act 1995 to incorporate a third universal emblem, the red crystal, along with the existing emblems of the red cross and red crescent; secondly, to amend the Defence Act 1903 to explicitly allow the making of regulations for the provision of medical and dental treatment to a member of the Australian Defence Force, to a member of the family of an Australian Defence Force member and to cadets; and, thirdly, to amend the Defence (Special Undertakings) Act 1952 to provide that the Joint Defence Facility at Pine Gap is a prohibited area. Given their disparate nature, I will speak to these three issues individually. Schedule 1 of the Defence Legislation (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 2008 incorporates the third additional protocol to the Geneva conventions, which establishes a third universal and distinctive emblem, called the red crystal, for the Red Cross-Red Crescent movement. Schedule 1 also proposes amending the Criminal Code Act 1995 to ensure that the new Geneva emblem is covered by the existing offences related to the improper use of the emblems of the Geneva conventions. As most of us are aware, the emblems of the red cross and red crescent have for many years been seen as symbols of protection against the violence and brutality of warfare and the promise of aid in times of disaster and distress. Anyone who has seen the Red Cross-Red Crescent organisation in action knows the good work that they do, and the Australian Red Cross of course is no exception. Whether it be helping out in times of disaster or championing the causes of human rights in our region, the work of the Red Cross is invaluable. It is also worth mentioning that this work is yet more remarkable when you consider that much of it is carried out by volunteers-ordinary Australians making extraordinary contributions to their community, to their country and to the world in which they live. We have seen this contribution first hand this week as the Red Cross continues to help thousands of people devastated by the bushfires that have raged across large parts of Victoria. Red Cross staff and volunteers are working at 20 relief centres to support people affected by the fires, including at Whittlesea, north of Melbourne, where many people from the devastated township of Kinglake are currently taking shelter. They are providing meals for firefighters, police and people in the relief centres. First aid volunteers assisting emergency services personnel and other affected people by treating mainly fire related injuries like minor burns and smoke inhalation. Red Cross personal support volunteers are providing practical assistance to evacuees as well as emotional support, information and referrals to recovery services. Red Cross staff and volunteers are also manning donation and blood bank facilities around the country. I urge all Australians to give in any way they can. Now, as always, the red cross emblem stands out clearly as a symbol of help in hard times. The symbols of the red cross and red crescent have both served as protective emblems for military and civilian medical services in wartime, and as distinctive signs for national Red Cross and Red Crescent societies around the world. Yet since their adoption these now universally known symbols have also been a source of recurrent controversy and the subject of much debate-debate which has at times hampered their effectiveness as symbols of neutrality. A recent submission to members of this parliament by the Australian Red Cross Chief Executive Officer, Robert Tickner, goes some way to explain these issues of difficulty and to articulate the need for and value of the third additional protocol to the Geneva conventions, which establishes the new red crystal emblem alongside the red cross and red crescent. The red cross and red crescent emblems are legally recognised under international law-most notably the 1949 Geneva conventions and their additional protocols of 1977-and are used around the world to protect medical personnel, equipment and buildings during periods of armed conflict, as well as to identify national Red Cross and Red Crescent societies, the International Committee of the Red Cross and the International Federation of Red Cross and are Red Crescent Societies. However, the red cross and red crescent emblems have in some circumstances been wrongly perceived as having particular political, cultural or religious connotations. This has affected the perceived integrity of the emblems and has therefore on occasions lessened the protections the emblems offer to victims and to humanitarian and medical personnel. The debate which has led to the adoption of the additional protocol III arose out of the need to operate in circumstances or in locations where neither the red cross nor the red crescent emblem is perceived and thus respected as neutral. There have also been a number of countries, such as Israel, which, as a result of not using the red cross or red crescent symbols, have been unable until recently to be admitted as formal members of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. To address this problem, an international diplomatic conference adopted the additional protocol III to the Geneva conventions in late 2005, and the third emblem, the red crystal, allowed the movement in mid-2006 to formally recognise and admit the Palestine Red Crescent Society and Magen David Adom, the Israel society, as full members. Working with the Australian Red Cross, the coalition government, under the Howard administration, played a significant role at the international negotiations to develop the protocol, and on 8 March 2006 Australia signed the protocol additional to the Geneva conventions of 12 August 1949 relating to the adoption of an additional distinctive emblem for the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, protocol III. Protocol III entered into force internationally on 14 January 2007. On 9 May 2007, protocol III was tabled in parliament with a proposal that Australia take binding treaty action to ratify the protocol. The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties reviewed the protocol and conducted hearings on 18 June 2007. The committee tabled its report to this parliament on 16 August 2007 and recommended that binding treaty action be taken. The bill incorporates the red crystal emblem along with the existing emblems, the red cross and the red crescent, into Australian statute and will conclude a process fully ported and facilitated by the coalition both government and in opposition. The incorporation of additional protocol III to the Geneva conventions has demonstrated that the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement continues to stand as a neutral and independent organisation capable of putting aside political and religious tensions in its commitment to humanitarian need. As stated previously by the Minister for Defence, schedule 2 of the Defence Legislation (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 2008 amends section 124 of the Defence Act 1903 to enable the making of regulations to cover the provisions of medical and dental treatment including pharmaceuticals to an ADF member or cadet or a member of the family of an ADF member. Currently, the Defence Force regulations contain a provision that recognise the provision of medical and dental treatment to members of the ADF in order that they are healthy for the purpose of discharging their duties, as well as cost recovery in specified circumstances. The amendments to section 124 will enable a more comprehensive regime in the Defence Force regulations, including broadening the regulations to enable the making of regulations to cover the provisions of medical and dental treatment, including pharmaceuticals, to an ADF member or a cadet remember or a member of the family of an ADF member. This is not necessarily contentious and the coalition certainly supports the government in addressing any shortfalls in the regulations relating to the provisions of medical treatment to members of the ADF. In briefings on this matter, the minister's office has specifically mentioned the treatment of cadets and the treatment of ADF members by civilian contractors as at least two possible shortfalls. However, it must be pointed out that the government have not sup- mentioned in the bill, in the explanatory in memorandum, in the minister's second reading speech or in any brief that he or his staff have provided to either my office or the office of the shadow minister for Defence their very bold election promise to extend the free health coverage provided to ADF members to the families of ADF member's. A plan has now been reformed and rebadged as the ADF family medical and dental trial. This is, we assume, because they do not wish to draw attention to the fact that they have in every way failed to deliver on this promise. It must be pointed out that such an entitlement, even if provided as only a limited trial to a select few, will indeed require the making of regulations to cover the provision of medical and dental treatment, including pharmaceuticals, to a member of the family of an ADF member. Some explanation of this promise is necessary, given the amendments proposed in schedule 2, as it would seem any planned regulations are likely to be directly related to this provision. In the lead-up to the election, the Labor Party promised free medical and dental care for ADF families, stating in Labor's Plan for Defence that: ADF families can face significant difficulties obtaining access to general medical and dental care for dependants, especially in regional and remote localities. Posting to a remote location can mean that ADF families struggle to access the sort of health care that Australians enjoy. A Rudd Labor Government will progressively extend free health care currently provided to ADF personnel to ADF dependent spouses and children. Labor will begin this with a $33.1 million vestment starting at 12 Defence Family Health Care Clinics, with a focus on remote bases locations and major regional centres. However, come budget time the government funded the promised entitlements only as a trial, clearly failing to deliver on this extraordinary pre-election commitment. May I remind the House that that elaborate election commitment included the promise of dedicated Defence family healthcare clinics which would be open five days a week and include a doctor, nurse, dentist and dental nurse. The election policy promised that Defence family healthcare clinics would be located at Lavarack Barracks, Townsville, for around 4,000 dependent spouses and children and at all Defence facilities in and around Townsville, and at Robertson Barracks in Darwin for around 3650 dependent spouses and children at all seven Defence facilities in and around Darwin. The remaining 10 were to be located in Cairns in the electorate of Leichhardt, RAAF Edinburgh in the electorate of Wakefield, Elizabeth North in the electorate of Wakefield, RAAF Amberley in the electorate of Blair, Jerrabomberra in the electorate of Eden Monaro, Williamtown in the electorate of Newcastle, Shoalhaven in the electorate of Gilmore, Singleton in the electorate of Hunter, East Sale in the electorate of Gippsland and Karratha-Pilbara in the electorate of Kalgoorlie. Instead of the $33.1 million that they promised, they have allocated only $12.2 million over four years to trial the provisions of basic GP services and limited dental care to families of ADF members in the selected locations of Singleton, Katherine, East Sale, Cairns and Karratha-Pilbara. The budget allocation of $12.2 million over four years falls some $20.9 million short of the election promise, while the amount allocated for 2008-09 is only $2.4 million, with dental in- care limited to $300 per dependant per annum. Having pledged that initial $33.1 million investment to start these 12 Defence family healthcare clinics with a focus on remote base locations and major regional centres, only five of the rural and remote Defence locations were mentioned, excluding, amongst others, Townsville and Darwin where the commitment to provide clinics was replaced by a plan in which families would have to access the health department's GP Superclinics in Darwin and Townsville. Similarly, instead of providing the promised Defence healthcare clinics, Defence families in other limited locations are now to source their own doctor and dentist. This can be very hard on a family every time that they are posted to a new base. Given that the regulations likely to be made and/or changed following the amendment of schedule 2 of this bill are those that will allow for the provision of medical and dental health care by the ADF to civilian family of ADF members, there are a number of areas of concern to the coalition regarding this proposed entitlement. As stated, the bill provides for the making of regulations about medical and dental treatment for a ‘member,' ‘cadet' or a ‘member of the family' of an ADF member. These terms are defined in section 58A of the Defence Act as follows: ‘member' includes a person who has ceased to be a member, whether by reason of death or otherwise. ‘cadet' means an officer, instructor or cadet Australian Army Cadets, the Australian Navy Cadets or the Australian Air Force Cadets, and includes a person who has ceased to be such an officer, instructor or cadet, whether by reason of death or otherwise. ‘member of the family' includes: (a) in relation to a member-a member of the household of the member and a dependant of the member; or (b) in relation to a cadet-a member of the household of the cadet and a dependant of the cadet. It is important to note that, under the act, the term ‘member of the family' includes but is not limited to a member of the household and a dependant of the ADF member or cadet. There are some concerns here as to what model will be used to determine the meaning of the terms ‘household' and ‘dependant' in the provision of such an entitlement. Thus the extent of medical and dental treatment, if any, available to persons other than members of the ADF and their families is not clear. The terms ‘member of the household of the member' and ‘a dependant of the member' are not defined in either the Defence Act or the bill. It is therefore not clear whether the proposed medical and dental treatment could, for instance, be extended to people other than spouses and dependent children who are members of the household of the member. It would seem to hang on the extent of their dependency, and it is not clear whether the member of the household of the ADF member must be totally dependent or whether they need be only partially dependent on the member in order to receive the proposed medical and dental care. Given that the government is still apparently promising to extend free health coverage to all ADF family members, the financial ramifications of such definitions could be considerable. Another area of concern is the provision of such an entitlement to reservists. Section 4 in the of the Defence Act 1903 defines a ‘member' as including any officer, sailor, soldier and airman. It is not clear whether the government, through this bill, intends that reserves and their families are to be included in the class of persons who will have access to the proposed medical and dental treatment. This would, perhaps, seem unlikely, given that in section 4 and elsewhere in the Defence Act-for example, section 58B-a distinction is drawn between the terms ‘member' and ‘member of the reserves'. Does this mean that reservists and their families will not be covered for medical and dental treatment? And, if they are not to be included, why do families of ADF members get preferential treatment over reserves? Why is free health care offered to non-ADF persons before reservists, many of whom are currently serving their country overseas and have recently been counted amongst those who have made the ultimate sacrifice in giving their life in service to their country? We remember, sadly, the recent death of Private Gregory Sher. There are also concerns about whether the relevant medical and dental care entitlements are to be contained in planned regulations. The details of the treatment available to ADF members are contained in Defence Instruction (General), issued under the authority of the Secretary of the Department of Defence and the Chief of the Defence Force. In particular, Defence Instruction (General) PERS 16-1 emphasises that health care for ADF members is based on operational readiness, as well as equity with Medicare, stating: The Australian Defence Force … requires the medical and dental fitness of its personnel in der that they are able to undertake operational duties. As such, the provision of health care by the Defence Health Service … to members of the ADF is a requirement of service. It goes on to state, in paragraph 5: Equity with Medicare under the provisions of the Health Insurance Act 1973 underpins the basic entitlement to the range of medical services provided to members of the Permanent Forces. Usually the range of, and ease of access to, health care provided to such members will exceed that available through the public health care system because of the requirement to meet and maintain operational readiness. However … the Director General of the Defence Health Service … will, from time to time, issue policy which may exclude or limit the provision of certain medical dental treatment on the grounds that such treatment is contra-indicated or unnecessary for operacircumstances tional readiness. It is not clear whether the nature and extent of the medical and dental treatment provided to family members will be detailed in the proposed regulations or whether it will be left to the discretion of the Secretary of the Department of Defence, the Chief of the Defence Force or to the individual service chiefs, as is the case currently with the relevant Defence Instruction. It would seem preferable, in the interests of transparency and accountability, that the medical and dental care entitlements are contained in regulations which would be subject to disallowance under the Legislative Instruments Act 2003, rather than in internal Defence documents such as Defence Instruction. Yet, as I said, there has been no explanation about such detail. The coalition is not alone in its concerns. Even the Defence Force Welfare Association have expressed serious reservations about the government's plan. I quote from a recent statement entitled ‘ADF healthcare trial: the hidden tax slug!' which states: The medical component of the trial is based on a orpayment being made to general practitioners who participate in a program to bulk bill eligible dependants for eligible services. Basic dental services, capped at $300 per dependant per year, may be accessed by eligible dependants at any dental practice in Australia. However as with many ADF ‘benefits' there is a sting in the tail that Government conveniently neglects to mention: in this case, the benefits associated with the trial will be considered a fringe benefit under the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986. Consequently, the benefits will be subject to FBT and the FBT will be paid by Defence. However depending on individual circumstances the ‘grossed-up' value of the benefits provided during the FBT year may be recorded on a member's annual payment summary. or We therefore recommend participating members seek financial advice relevant to their individual before registering for the trial.. Participation in the trial is voluntary and members may elect to participate only in the medical or the dental, or both, and may decide to only register certain members of their family. Participants may also opt out of the trial at any stage, or change registration as required. For example, a child with a Health Card may only require the Dental component of the trial, with the remaining dependants requiring both Medical or Dental. It is also worth mentioning here that Labor's election promise specifically acknowledged that ADF families can face significant difficulties obtaining access to general medical and dental care for dependants, especially in regional and remote localities. Now that the plan to provide ADF health clinics in these locations has been dumped, how will this trial plan, where people must source their own GP and dentist, help these families? It is my opinion that the Labor Party has dishonoured the defence community by breaking its promise to provide free medical and dental care and to do so through the creation of dedicated defence health care clinics. Given the little, or no, explanation articulation from them of the details and parameters of either their initial or current plan to provide free health care to ADF families, they appear to have made this promise either without any comprehension of what it would take to implement it or with no intention to actually deliver on it. If this is the case, is there any worse betrayal? The Prime Minister and the Minister for Defence looked our service men and women in the eye and made them a promise they had no intention of delivering upon, and it would seem they did so only for political gain. As I have said, the coalition has no reservation in supporting any measure which more efficiently allows for the provision of health care to members of the Australian Defence Force. However, we would be much more comfortable in supporting these particular amendments if the government would provide at least some detail of the proposed regulations relating to the provision of free health care to ADF families. The issue now is, given the Rudd Labor government is simply handing out cash reimbursements or vouchers for GP and dental visits, why this is limited to a couple of select bases as a trial. It should be spread across the whole of the Defence Force. In fact, today I call on the minister to expand this ‘trial' to every serving defence family and to stop discriminating. Now that the government is not providing clinics it can be equally hard to get access to a GP or a dentist no matter where you are posted. Schedules 3 and 4 of the Defence Legislation (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 2008 amend the Defence (Special Undertakings) Act 1952 to provide that the Joint Defence Facility at Pine Gap is a prohibited area. These amendments were designed to overcome certain shortfalls in the drafting of the act which were brought to light by both the or Northern Territory Criminal Court and the Northern Territory Criminal Court of Appeal in the prosecution of four protesters charged under the act with breaking into the Pine Gap facility after cutting through wire fences in 2005 to gain entry. The Joint Defence Facility Pine Gap contributes directly to the national security of both Australia and the United States by verifying arms control and disarmament agreements and by the monitoring of military developments. Australia also supports the United States in its ballistic missile early warning program through the relay ground station at Pine Gap. This program makes a significant contribution to global security. The coalition supports these amendments and is well aware of the circumstances which highlighted their need. Section 8 of the Defence (Special Undertakings) Act 1952 provides that the Minister for Defence may, by notice published in the Gazette, declare an area of land or water to be a prohibited area if it is necessary to do so for the purposes of defence during protests, many of which have been anti-nuclear or anti-USA in nature. In December 2005 four protestors cut through wire outer fences to access the facility and were subsequently charged with indictable offences under the Defence (Special Undertakings) Act 1952-charges carrying a possible custodial sentence of up to seven years. Serious issues and concerns arose during the prosecution of the four protestors when it was contested whether the area on which each of the defendants allegedly committed the offences was in fact a prohibited area. The Crown case argued that there was a valid declaration that the Joint Defence Facility Pine Gap was a prohibited area and that the activities of the four defendants in that prohibited area were therefore subject to criminal penalties. In their defence, the four protesters sought to challenge the Crown case based on the interpretation of section 8 of the Defence (Special Undertakings) Act 1952. They argued that the minister's declaration in 1967 was invalid. Particularly, they sought to establish that in 1967 the Pine Gap facility was not being used for defence purposes. In addition, the defendants also sought to advance a case that the Pine Gap facility was not a prohibited area in 2005 on the basis that in 2005 the Pine Gap facility was primarily used for the purposes of aggression rather than defence and therefore the continuation of the declaration was not necessary for defence purposes. The trial judge ruled that evidence about these matters was inadmissible and in June 2007 the four were convicted and fined over $3,000 but not given custodial sentences. The trial judge also ruled that the precondition to the exercise of the power to declare an area a prohibited area under section 8 was satisfaction by the minister that the declaration was necessary, rather than the objective fact that the declaration was necessary for defence purposes. In February 2008 the convictions were overturned on appeal to the Northern Territory Criminal Court of Appeal. In making his decision, Chief Justice Brian Martin stated: It is appropriate to note that following the ruling by the trial Judge, in the conduct of the trial it appears to have been overlooked that in challenging the validity of the declaration, the defendants were entitled to attack the basis upon which the Minister in 1967 reached his state of satisfaction that the declaration was necessary for defence purposes. If, as an objective fact, the declaration was not necessary for defence purposes, that fact could be used by the defendants to mount an argument that in the absence of a factual basis for the declaration the Minister could not reasonably have been satisfied that the declaration was necessary for defence purposes. This was a way in which the defendants could seek to attack the validity of the declaration under the terms of her Honour's ruling. However … this basis of relevance appears to have been overlooked. The Joint Defence Facility Pine Gap makes critical, vital contributions to the security interests of both Australia and the United States of America and is an outstanding example of the level of cooperation that has been achieved in Australia's closest defence relationship. The Defence (Special Undertakings) Act makes it an offence to enter, without government approval, a place used for a special defence undertaking. Such an undertaking is defined as one for the defence of Australia or ‘some other country associated with Australia in resisting or preparing to resist international aggression'. These amendments to the Defence (Special Undertakings) Act 1952, contained in schedules 3 and 4 of this bill, are intended to overcome the inadequacies in the drafting of the Defence (Special Undertakings) Act 1952, which were highlighted by both the Northern Territory Criminal Court and the Northern Territory Criminal Court of Appeal in this matter. The coalition supports these measures unreservedly, However, I wonder if the Labor Party can say the same. Over the years the honourable Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts, Peter Garrett, has voiced his opposition to the facility in both song and speech, campaigning vehemently for its closure. It would be interesting to know his thoughts on these amendments, which will, in effect, make it easier to prosecute his fellow protestors. I commend this bill to the House.",34
19,Mr BUTLER,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"As the shadow minister for defence science just indicated, the Defence Legislation (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 2008 deals with three very distinct elements. Really, the only commonality between the three elements to this bill is that they reflect an ongoing commitment by this government to make whatever legislative change is necessary from time to time to give our defence forces all of the support that they need to do their job. In no particular of order of priority or importance, the first element of the bill, as the shadow minister indicated, seeks to give effect to protocol III, the third additional tocol to the Geneva conventions. That protocol modifies the Geneva conventions to add a third distinctive emblem for the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which previously was called the Red Cross Movement. As the shadow minister has outlined, and as I am sure is well known to all members of this House, the red cross and the red crescent have been the two symbols for that movement since about 1929. Protocol III, the third additional protocol, adds a third symbol, namely, the red crystal. The red cross was adopted almost 150 years ago as a symbol intended to protect those who were providing aid, comfort and medical assistance to people injured or at risk of injury in war, whether an internal war or an international war. The Red Cross was established under that symbol at the Geneva convention of 1864 and now some 185 Red Cross or Red Crescent societies operate around the world including, as the shadow minister indicated and as has been said so many times in the condolence motions this week, the Australian Red Cross, which has been performing extraordinary work in the Victorian bushfires. All of those Red Cross and Red Crescent societies are coordinated by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, which is also located in Geneva. The purpose of the symbols, the distinctive emblems, is largely twofold. Most importantly, it is to serve as a protective symbol in times of armed conflict to provide a protection recognised by armed forces and hopefully militias around the world so that they do not attack or endanger people, buildings, vehicles and any other equipment being used to provide succour, comfort or assistance to people injured or at risk of injury in that conflict. Also, the emblems have an organisational purpose, which is to provide an pro- indication of the belonging by an organisation to the international movement. Usually in that case the emblem is accompanied by a title such as, in our case, the Australian Red Cross. The two symbols, the red cross and the red crescent, are now used in about 190 countries. As the shadow minister indicated, historically the red cross in particular has caused some problems and some sensitivities because of apparent or perceived Christian connotations. It is absolutely clear that the red cross, when adopted in the 1860s, was adopted with no religious affiliation, but it has been recognised around the world over the decades that there is some scope for connotation, even if there was no affiliation. It is well known that the red cross is a reversal of the Swiss flag, or the Swiss Cross. The Swiss Cross, or the Swiss flag, certainly does have religious or Christian origins. The Swiss Cross was adapted as the national flag in Switzerland in 1840 but, before that, for some 600 or so years, it was the flag of the Schwyz canton, one of the original three cantons that created the Old Swiss Confederacy in 1291. The Swiss Cross, or that flag, was granted to the canton in about 1230 by Emperor Friedrich II, who was one of the successor emperors to Charlemagne in the Holy Roman Empire. It is quite clear that the cross that was added to what was simply a red flag of that canton was a symbol provided by the emperors of the Holy Roman Empire to indicate leadership over the Christian continent of Europe. So there is, in the government's view, some reason for the connotations that have been ascribed to the red cross over the 150 or so years since its adoption and some reason for the sensitivities that have arisen since then. After its adoption the red cross very quickly gained wide recognition in times of war, even back then, but only a decade or so later, during the Russian-Turkish war of the 1870s, it became clear that the red cross was going to be an insufficient or inadequate symbol for universal application. The Ottoman Empire, in that war between Russia and the Ottoman Empire in the 1870s, decided therefore to use the red crescent, taking the view that its soldiers, being Muslim, would not feel comfortable with the red cross. After the intervention of the Red Cross Society, the international Red Cross movement back then, the Russian army agreed to recognise the red crescent as having the same effect for protection purposes as the red cross. That de facto equality between the two symbols continued until it was formally, in a de jure way, enshrined in an amended Geneva convention in 1929. So too in 1929, the Geneva conventions recognised the red line with sun symbol which was used by Iran from that time in the same way until the revolution in 1980, when the new republic of Iran adopted the red crescent in its place. This has been a problem for a couple of societies, most notably Israel, whose equivalent of the Australian Red Cross, the MDA, has since the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948 used the red star of David or the red shield of David. As a result, Israel has not been a member of the international movement and, strictly speaking, has not been entitled to the protection of the conventions because that symbol is not enshrined in the convention. It is a position that from any reasonable person's perspective is obviously untenable and one that has given rise to discussion, as the shadow minister indicated, over many years with a view to trying to adopt a symbol for societies that do not feel comfortable with the red cross or the red crescent. As the shadow minister indicated, in December 2005 the Swiss government convened a conference of all 192 signatories to the Geneva convention, including our own government, the former coalition government. After a couple of days that conference not unanimously but overwhelmingly decided upon the red crystal, which is now known as the third protocol emblem. There has been lots of support since, including, importantly, the ratification by the state of Israel and a range of other countries. Australia signed the new protocol in 2006, and the number of countries required to sign the protocol ticked over in January 2007 with the result that the protocol entered into force at that time. Our ratification requires a couple of things. It requires the amendment by this parliament of different pieces of legislation protecting the status of the Red Cross emblems-the red cross, the red crescent and now the red crystal-which is the purpose of the debate tonight. Importantly, it also requires the Australian government to disseminate the protocol, most particularly through military training so that our defence forces serving overseas will recognise the importance of the third emblem in the same way as the ADF has always recognised the importance of the red cross and the red crescent and also to disseminate it in civilian education so that our school students come to recognise that the red crystal has the same effect as the red cross and red crescent around the world. It is recognised-and was in the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties debatesthat the red crystal is unlikely to be used in or by Australia. We have a long and proud history of adopting the first of the emblems, the red cross, but it is important that the red crystal be adopted by all Australians, whether serving in the ADF or otherwise, when overseas. This is an important development which brings some greater unity to the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and deserves the parliament's support, and I note the enthusiastic support of the opposition, particularly given that a lot of these developments occurred while the Howard government was still in power. The second element to this bill took a great deal of the shadow minister's attention-namely, the addition of regulationmaking powers to extend protections to personnel providing defence related medical care. As the shadow minister indicated and is well known by members of this House, the ADF is obliged by the Defence Act to provide medical care to ADF personnel to ensure that those personnel are healthy to discharge their duties as uniformed personnel. But we also know that much of that care is provided by nurses and medics. The Defence Act provides for exemptions from different pieces of state and territory legislation relating to the supply and the prescription of medication, recognising that medical care in a defence context is quite different to the civilian medical care at which the state and territory legislation in question is directed. This is particularly important so far as it concerns obligations imposed by the legislation on doctors supervising nurses and medics. The exemption in the Defence Act currently only applies to uniformed medical personnel and, as I have learned as I have gone around the different bases in Australia in my capacity as chair of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, uniformed medical personnel are particularly difficult to obtain and retain in the defence forces. It has been my experience that medical care at many bases in Australia is provided to ADF personnel by contractor medical staff or in some cases APS staff, neither of which categories are covered by the Defence Act exemptions. The legal advice provided to the government by the different legal agencies of government indicates that it is unclear whether those exemptions apply to those personnel. It is clearly in the interests of a properly functioning ADF that those exemptions be extended, and that is in a nutshell the regulation-making power that is provided by this legislation. The shadow minister spent some time discussing the rollout so far of the groundbreaking election policy commitment made by the Labor Party before the 2007 election to extend free medical care not only to ADF personnel, as currently is the case, but also to their dependants and spouses. This was an extraordinarily popular and well-received election policy and it is very easy to understand why the shadow minister and others on the opposition benches are so sensitive about it-as they did not think of it for the 11½ years during which they occupied the government benches. The shadow minister appears to have taken the view that after that period of neglect the new government would be able to implement this policy in a matter of days and the fact that we are rolling out trials in a progressive way is not a proper approach to public policy making and service delivery. On this side of the House we disagree with that assessment. Labor made a commitment to progressively extend basic medical and dental care to spouses and children of ADF personnel, and we are well underway in delivering on that commitment. Over the course of the development of ways in which to do that, the government came to the view that there was a better model than the original proposal of building family health clinics for a couple of reasons. Firstly, as I indicated, it is particularly ficult in regional areas to obtain the sort of medical and dental personnel who are contemplated by that policy. But we also took the view that the trials that are in place using a card system to directly pay GPs an agreed amount when the trial participants see the GP provide those defence families with a much greater sense of choice over the doctor or the dentist that they can go and see. The first stage deals with a range of remote bases, which is where this service is most needed. The second stage deals with three other significant regional bases in Townsville, Darwin and Puckapunyal, and in total those two trials will see the delivery of this free dental and medical care to some 16,000 spouses and children. This is a policy that we continue to be very proud of and intend to continue to roll out in a progressive but sure way. The third element of the bill deals with the legal status of the joint facility at Pine Gap, near Alice Springs. As the shadow minister indicated, Pine Gap was set up in the late 1960s as part of a suite of joint facilities that until 1999 included Nurrungar, near Woomera in South Australia, and the North West Cape in Western Australia. Pine Gap remains, and together these facilities were, of a very high strategic value in terms of the Western alliance's capacity to communicate and gather intelligence around the world, particularly concerning the early detection of ballistic missile launches, especially nuclear ballistic missile launches. As the shadow minister indicated, this was not a policy without controversy. Firstly, the view was taken by many that the placement of these joint facilities on Australian soil made Australia a nuclear target, particularly a first-strike target. However, were an all-out nuclear war to have broken out during the Cold War it is very clear that Australia would have been a nuclear target with or without difthe joint facilities in place. The second concern raised by opponents of the joint facilities being on Australian soil was essentially to do with sovereignty issues. The debate raged for many, many years about the degree to which these were joint facilities run jointly by Australian and American forces or whether they were simply US bases on Australian soil. It was an endless debate which really does not require continuation in the context of the debate on this bill. Suffice it to say for the purposes of this bill that very regular protests took place, particularly at Pine Gap but also at Nurrungar before its closure in 1999. The now member for Fadden took part in those protests as a very youthful and perhaps radical individual. I am sure he will expand upon that in his contribution after I am finished. I suspect friends of many members of parliament and perhaps members of parliament themselves took part in those protests. It is very important to make clear that this bill is not about infringing on the right to protest about Pine Gap or any other aspect of government defence security policy-or any other policy, for that matter. We are not about curtailing that right. What we are about doing is amending the Defence (Special Undertakings) Act, the D(SU) Act, to clarify the security of that joint facility to protect it from unauthorised entry, which is an entirely different proposition to protest. As the shadow minister indicated, this arises from a well-known case where four protesters cut through the wire surrounding the joint facility at Pine Gap and were subsequently charged, with a hearing taking place in 2007. There is no question, factually, that this entry was unauthorised. There is no question that it went beyond protest at the point of unauthorised entry. The point that gives rise to this legislation is that the defendants in that case made the argument before the court that the base was not a prohibited area and was not undertaking defence work. In a belt-andbraces way, the purpose of this bill is to make very clear, from the Australian government's perspective and from the Australian parliament's perspective, that the whole of the facility is a prohibited area for the purposes of the D(SU) Act and that the work in the facility is a defence undertaking and defence work. For that reason I commend that part of the bill to the House. The government is committed to making sure that the defence forces are given all necessary legislative, executive, capital works and other support to do their incredibly important work. This bill in its three difthat ferent aspects continues that job and I commend it to the House.",41
20,Mr ROBERT,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"I rise to speak on the Defence Legislation (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 2008. In doing so, I recognise the members of the defence establishment who are here today, including Michael Simon, who have come to witness the debate. I wish to speak on the duplicity of the government in schedule 2 of the bill, although it would be remiss of me not to remind the member for Port Adelaide that in 1993 I was at the Nurrungar protests as a young lieutenant with the 3rd Battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment. The Prime Minister at the time, Prime Minister Keating, sent in a company group plus 170 troops to guard the Nurrungar facility against 4,000 demonstrators, including union members. As a union member, member for Port Adelaide, you should be very thankful the unions did not get past the police barricade and come in contact with the members of the 3rd Battalion, because we would have been less than merciful. It is also interesting that you complain about the coalition under Howard not introducing the measures in schedule 2 with respect to providing medical treatment to defence members. Need I remind you that we had to pay off $96 billion of Labor debt, including $30-plus billion of interest payments from 1996 through to the early 2000s? We put aside $65 billion in the Future Fund to take care of public service liabilities that you neglected. Furthermore, we set aside $20 is billion in funds for future infrastructure expenditure and left $18 billion in the 2007-08 budget surplus. We left you $240 billion, a quarter of a trillion dollars, so do not come in here and lecture about what the coalition may or may not have done in various areas of the economy. If we did not have to spend quarter of a trillion dollars on the liabilities you left behind, I daresay there would be a range of things we could have done.",46
21,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"Order! Member for Fadden, please remember you are speaking through the chair. The use of the word ‘you' implies that I have done all these things.",46
22,Mr ROBERT,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"That would be dreadful, Madam Deputy Speaker.",46
23,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"It would be atrocious. I remind the House that the use of the word ‘you' is actually not permitted. If you could rephrase future references in your speech, it would be most appreciated.",46
24,Mr ROBERT,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. Through the chair, the former coalition government could have spent that quarter of a trillion dollars on infrastructure and a range of things if the hole left by the previous Labor administration had not been not there. Moving on to schedule 2 of the legislation and focusing on the duplicity of the Labor government, schedule 2 will amend section 124 of the Defence Act 1903 to explicitly enable the making of regulations to cover the provision of medical and dental treatment, including pharmaceuticals to an ADF member or cadet or a member of the family of an ADF member. As stated the bill provides for the making of regulations about medical and dental treatment for an ADF member, cadet or a member of the family of an ADF member. These terms are defined in section 58A of the Defence Act. Yet the Labor government's 2007 federal election policy on defence promised something very different to what schedule 2 is indeed delivering. It promised free medical and dental care for ADF families. It went on to say ADF families face significant difficulties obtaining access to general medical and dental care for dependants, especially in regional and remote localities. Speaking as a former military officer, who spent 12 months living on Thursday Island working with the 51st Battalion of the Far North Queensland Regiment, it is difficult to get good medical treatment when you are in the middle of the Torres Strait. Labor policy went on to say that posting to a remote location could mean that ADF families struggle to access the sort of health care that most Australians enjoy. No-one can argue with those two statements. The policy platform then went on to say that a Rudd Labor government would progressively extend free health care currently provided to ADF personnel to ADF dependent spouses and children-notable, noteworthy and indeed supportable. The fourth point was that Labor would begin this with a $33.1 million investment starting at 12 defence family healthcare clinics with a focus on remote base locations and major regional centres. It is here where the duplicity starts. here where the election promise does not even come close to being honoured. It is here where Defence families, where fighting men and women, have been sold short. It is important not to look at what is said with respect to election promises but to look at what is budgeted in budgets brought down and subsequently what is delivered. The Rudd government's 2008-09 budget funded the promised entitlements only as a trial, clearly failing to deliver on an election commitment, a commitment to progressively extend free health care. It was not a commitment to try it and see how it goes but to progressively extend it. Instead of the $33.1 million promised there was only $12.2 million over four years-4½ million dollars or four million and a bit dollars per year-to trial the provision of free basic GP services and limited dental care to families of ADF members, initially in the rural and remote communities of Singleton, Katherine, East Sale, Cairns and Karratha/Pilbara. Five sites and $12.2 million are far from $33.1 million and 12 defence establishments. The amount allocated for 2008-09, the current financial year, is only $2.4 million with dental care limited to only $300 per dependant per annum. Only five of the 10 rural and remote defence locations were mentioned initially, excluding Townsville and Darwin. I am sure the member for Eden Monaro, the Parliamentary Secretary for Defence Support, must be appalled to see defence establishments and defence servicemen so poorly sold out. Rather than defence families attending defence family healthcare clinics, which was the policy commitment of the Rudd government prior to the election, families are to source their own doctor and dentist. This is a little difficult sometimes when you are in the middle of nowhere. On 17 October last year, the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel announced, to his credit, It is that the trial would be extended to include Townsville, Darwin and Puckapunyal, although I suggest only after a significant backlash from the defence community, but to his credit nonetheless. ADF families do not currently have access to any form of free health cover as opposed to the militaries of other countries, of which the United States is a good example. Free health care-which includes physio, dental, general practice, other allied health professionals, cosmetic and indeed psychological services-is currently provided as needed or as requested to all full-time ADF personnel only. Apart from the provision of emergency health treatment to civilians and health care provided to an ADF member's dependants accompanying the member if they are travelling overseas, defence's health care is aimed at the operational readiness of ADF members. It is important that their health care dental care be in top-rate condition before we send them to battle. The relevant regulations allow for the provision of medical and dental treatment to members of the ADF on these grounds. Most of the services are provided in-house. Albury/Wodonga and Puckapunyal have these services provided by a civilian contractor. The value of the contract for Albury/Wodonga is approximately $27 million over four years, servicing perhaps something like 900 people-a cost of $7,500 per person including the provision of GP, physio, dental, specialists et cetera. This is a far cry from what Labor is presenting at a cap of $300 per dental consultation in total. There is no question and the facts bear witness today that the Labor government have broken a key promise to our defence personnel. It is a key compact with those who do our war fighting on our behalf. They promised to spend $33.1 million over four years on 12 defence family healthcare clinics. They said they would to service men and women, many thousands who were fighting on the frontline overseas, thousands of kilometres away from loved ones, from family, from friends, from home and from all that they knew. They said to those people overseas, ‘We will provide free health care for your families in these 12 locations.' Now these same people find out that this compact has been broken. The budget delivered a $12.2 million trial in only five locations, albeit three more have been added. This is $20.9 million short of an election promise. I say to the government, I could understand it if we had left you in an almost quarter of a trillion dollar hole, which in the scheme of things is what the next coalition government will be left with. I could understand it if there were a $96 billion debt, if interest payments were $30 billion or $40 billion by the time it was paid off or if superand annuation entitlements of $60 billion had not been catered for-I could probably understand it if you were facing that. But indeed the Labor government came into office with an economy in first-rate condition, the envy of the world, with banking stability-where only 16 banks have AA rating of which four are our big four banks-in which there is no net Commonwealth debt; in which future superannuation liabilities have been catered for in the Future Fund; in which a surplus of $18 billion was left them in the 2007-08 budget and $20 billion in other infrastructure accounts. In conditions like that, in a budget position the envy of the world, the Labor government cut $20.9 million from the health care of the mums and dads, the boys and the girls and the babies of our fighting men and women. It is unbelievable. Of all the places to make a budget cut in such an impressive fiscal position the Labor government was left by the Howard government, of all the places to make a budget cut, taking $20.9 million from the health care of the most vulnerable, the families of serving men and women in remote localities that do not enjoy the same comforts that we do in the more urban areas, is almost reprehensible. Instead of extending the free health care to ADF personnel, only a trial has been committed to, for basic GP services and limited dental care in eight locations. RAAF Edinburgh, Elizabeth North, RAAF Amberley and RAAF Williamtown all miss out, as do other establishments. Instead of free health care, the trial will provide only $300 for tal care per dependant. Given the current cost of dental care, this amount simply does not add up. Two hundred and three million dollars per year is spent on defence healthabout $4,300 per soldier, sailor or airman. Labor's plan does not even come close to what we currently spend on our fighting men and women. This is a dishonouring of the defence community; breaking promises to the community is always dishonouring that community. They have made a promise either without comprehending what it would take to implement or-and I cannot believe this would be the case-with no intention of actually delivering. The Prime Minister and Minister for Defence looked our service men and women in the eye and made them a promise they had no intention of delivering on. I refuse to accept that is the case, looking across the chamber at the member for Eden Monaro. I have faith that he will ensure that the right thing is done by our defence men and women. Having pledged an initial $33.l million investment to start 12 defence family healthcare clinics, with a focus on remote bases and locations, this promise must be fulfilled. In section 4 of the Defence Act 1903, it defines a ‘member' as including ‘any officer, sailor, soldier and airman'. It is not clear whether the bill intends that reservists and their families are to be included in the class of people who will have access to the proposed medical and dental treatment. It is perhaps unlikely given that in section 4 and elsewhere in the Defence Act a distinction is drawn between the terms ‘member' and ‘member of the Reserve'. Again I would see it as unlikely that Labor would exclude our reservists, considering that our deployment to the Solomons is staffed entirely by reserve personnel. Again looking at the member for Eden-Monaro, a member of the government in the Defence portfolio, I can only hope he den- will ensure that our reservists are not excluded. The legislation amendments deal with the provision of health care to cadets. However, the extent of health benefits available to cadets has not been made clear by the government. I can only assume that further regulations will provide clarity on the issue of cadets. The ADF is still experiencing recruitment challenges. Although a range of initiatives has been put in place by the Rudd and indeed the Howard government that has alleviated many areas of this, it is still a problem. It would be disappointing if a roll-back in the Rudd Labor government's commitment to defence families was allowed to impact defence recruitment. There is a need for a degree of bipartisanship, when it comes to defence and our national security, across both sides of the chamber. There are only two members of the House who wear operational service medals from service in the military. It behoves us to ensure that our Defence Force is ably supplied, well managed and well equipped, that promises are not broken, that our defence men and women and their families are well taken care of. At this stage that responsibility falls on the shoulders of the member for Eden-Monaro, a distinguished officer, a combat veteran who wears the Active Service Medal, a man of great respect. I look to him to ensure that our men and women are taken care of.",46
25,Dr KELLY,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"Eden-Monaro-Parliamentary Secretary for Defence Support) (5.12 pm)-The provisions of this bill, the Defence Legislation (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 2008, operate in relation to three issues, as we have heard. Two of these issues could be described as housekeeping measures that clean up a discrepancy arising from our federal system and also cure a technical deficiency relating to the security of the Pine Gap facility. The third issue is of greater nificance. It reflects the resolution of a standing point of contention in the law of armed conflict relating to protective emblems. On the medical provisions, I have heard the statements by the member for Fadden and the member for Paterson. I accept the genuine concern of the member for Fadden for the men and women of our ADF and their welfare. I certainly do not hold him responsible for the actions or inactions of the previvariations ous government as he was also a member of the class of 2007. However, it is the height of hypocrisy for any member of the previous government to complain about action on delivering better health outcomes for defence families as they had 11½ years of opportunity to do something about that and did not. We are acting on that issue. In opposition it is of course difficult to formulate policy without the advice of departments. We are now working through the best solution to that problem through conducting trials, and certainly help is on the way for our ADF families. The service of the men and women of the ADF is unique in so many ways-one of them is the fact that they are required to be somewhat nomadic. We require our personnel to regularly relocate from one part of this country to another and overseas, having to continually adapt to varying jurisdictions. This creates a tedious round of adjusting many basic administrative aspects of daily life such as drivers licences and car registration but also with respect to fundamental family issues of education and health. This is something that the Rudd Labor government are fully conscious of, and we are working to smooth out some of these rough edges created by our federal structure. In particular, we are currently working on the national curricula project, which will be siggreatly appreciated by defence families. One longof the measures contained in the bill before the House will cure another of those anomalies in relation to the medical service provided to our personnel within Australia and when overseas. The bill will do this by explicitly enabling the making of regulations to ensure that the medical and dental treatment, including administering pharmaceuticals, provided to an ADF member or member of their family and to cadets is not impeded by in state and territory laws. This follows advice from the Australian Government Solicitor that in some jurisdictions ADF, APS and contracted civilian health professionals could run foul of the professional standards in the state or territory in which they are registered, arising from supervising the medical treatment provided by ADF medics. The amendment also enables the provision of health support to ADF members and dependants in certain overseas countries where the range of pharmaceuticals may not be of the standard available in Australia. The second administrative issue the bill addresses is the provisions dealing with the Joint Defence Facility Pine Gap under the Defence (Special Undertakings) Act 1952. In a case in June 2007, the act was used for the first time to convict four persons who had broken into the Pine Gap area. Some technical deficiencies were revealed in relation to the validity of declarations relating to the facility, so these amendments will strengthen the Commonwealth's legal position in dealing with offenders against the act. In particular, the addition of the new section 2A, defining the purposes of the act, will make it clear that the Commonwealth's power in relation to the facility and its security is based not on the defence power alone but on other elements such as Australia's obligations with respect to treaties, conventions and international agreements to which it is a party. In these fraught times it is not just misguided demonstrators that we need to secure this and other key facilities against but, of course, the more deadly threat of terrorists, as recent trials have illustrated. In relation the demonstrators, though, let me say that, while I fully recognise the right of citizens to demonstrate against the Pine Gap facility, it has long been a puzzle to me why they believe the world would be better off without it. Without doubt, the Pine Gap facility is one of the most positive contributions to peace and security in the world today. I note that it was sometimes said that the facility made Australia a nuclear target. The truth is that this facility makes nuclear war less likely. It provides a key piece of the puzzle in verification concerning nuclear arms and testing treaties and the security of friends and allies around the world through its ballistic missile early-warning information. Without its technical intelligence service, it would be like losing an eye in a world where we need all our senses operating at full capacity all the time. I suggest demonstrators could make a far greater contribution by focusing on the situation in Zimbabwe or Sudan or the brutal, extreme Islamist movements Hamas, Hezbollah and the Taliban. Turning to the emblem issue, the other provisions of the bill which deal with the introduction of a new protective emblem in relation to the law of armed conflict deal with, in technical terms, amendments to our Geneva Conventions Act 1957, which made effective in Australian law the four Geneva conventions of 1949 and subsequently the two additional protocols to those conventions introduced in 1977. Following the entry into operation of the Criminal Code Act 1995, which made further adjustments to the Australian regime of the law of armed conflict, principally through changes made necessary by measures associated with the creation of the International Criminal Court, it will also be necessary to amend the Dictionary of the Criminal Code. The amendment to the Geneva Conventions Act 1957 brings into force a new protocol III of 2005 to the Geneva to conventions of 1949. The purpose of the protocol is to add a new emblem to the protective red cross and red crescent, in the form of a so-called red crystal. This is, in effect, a hollow red square turned on one point on a white background. The story of how this protocol came to be and of the need for a third emblem is a long and convoluted one and is intimately entwined with the history of the International Committee of the Red Cross, or ICRC, and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. It began, as with the history of the ICRC itself, with the experience of Henri Dunant, the Swiss businessman who observed the appalling suffering and deprivations of the wounded on the battlefield at Solferino in Italy in 1859. Largely through Dunant's efforts, the first Geneva convention was created in 1864 for the amelioration of the wounded on the battlefield. In this convention the red cross was established as the sole emblem designated to identify the medical services of armed forces and voluntary relief societies. This was intended to substitute for the various flags and distinctive signs that were in use at the time. The idea was to have something universally understood and recognisable from a distance. It is unknown why the red cross was selected but it appears that it was probably a tribute to Henri Dunant and the tradition of neutrality established over several centuries by Switzerland through reversal of the Swiss national flag. While it was not intended to have religious significance there is no doubt that the emblem bore a close resemblance to the flags and devices used by the medieval crusaders and therefore it was rejected by the Muslim world and, in particular, by the Ottoman Empire of the day. This was understandable, and I have no doubt that consciously or unconsciously the founders of the movement were influenced by their Christian background in selecting the emblem. If it was a reversal of the Swiss flag then there is no doubt that the use of the cross on the Swiss flag is a religious reference. Had a clearly non-religious emblem been selected at this point, the debate and angst of the last 130 years could have been avoided. In 1876, during the Russo-Turkish War, the Sublime Porte declared its intention to adopt the red crescent on a white background to distinguish their military medical services. In 1906, at the conference to review the 1864 convention, there was an attempt to obtain recognition of the red crescent, and the tion was further complicated by the efforts of Persia to have the red lion and sun, and Siam the red flame, recognised. The conference rejected these efforts but authorised states formulate reservations to the provisions on the emblem. The Ottomans and Persia took advantage of this, while Siam elected to adopt the red cross. Finally, in the updated and revised convention of 1929, the red crescent and red lion and sun were formally recognised, with the proviso that only emblems already in use at the time, and no new emblems, would be recognised. This situation was later confirmed in the first Geneva convention of 1949, which is the convention for the amelioration of the wounded on the battlefield in force today. The negotiations on this issue for the 1949 convention were not straightforwardsurprisingly! Proposals were put forward at the time for replacing the emblem with a new universal emblem-this originated from the Netherlands-reverting to the sole use of the red cross or admitting the red shield of David for the newly created state of Israel. Unfortunately, the idea of a new emblem was rejected by the Western states in the name of tradition and by certain Muslim states for religious reasons. It was, as a consequence, the last issue of the Israeli proposal which has proven so controversial over the years from 1949 to 2005 and has been at the heart of getting to the solution we now have with respect to the red crystal. The red star of David, or Magen David Adom, had been in use by Jewish relief societies in Israel/Palestine for nearly 20 years prior to 1949, including by Israeli armed forces during the fighting against invading armies from neighbouring states in 1948. For the Jewish community of Israel, there was the concern shared with the Muslim world over the mutual experience of the crusaders, which was not a good one. There was also situathe very recent and bitter memory of the failure of the ICRC with respect to the Holocaust, a failure well documented in books such as The Yellow Star and the Red Cross to by Marc-Andre Chargueraud and freely acknowledged and regretted by the ICRC. Clearly, also, the acceptance of the red crescent had established a precedent for the acknowledgement of cultural and religious concerns over the emblem. There was heated debate on this in 1949, with the proposal being defeated by only one vote, and Israel was to try again to have the red star of David recognised during the diplomatic conference of 1974-77, which produced the two additional protocols to the four Geneva conventions of 1949. Once again, however, they were unsuccessful. Since 1949, Israel has therefore relied on its reservation to the 1949 conventions on the emblem, which has only been rejected by two of the parties. The practical effect of the inability to produce a mechanism accommodating the red star of David was that a number of national voluntary relief societies were not able to be admitted to the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, as a condition for the recognition of a national society was use of the red cross or red crescent. The societies which were not able to do this included not only the Israeli Magen David Adom but also the Eritrean and Kazakh societies, which wanted to use a double emblem of the red cross and the red crescent, and at one point Zimbabwe and India, which wanted to use a red star and a red swastika respectively. Understandably that might have caused problems. Further complicating matters was the emergence of the Palestinian Authority and its red crescent society, which could not be admitted to the movement without resolving matters with Israel. Beginning in 1993, the ICRC began a serious effort to find a solution. Over the years between 1993 and 2005 there have been many conferences, some of which I participated in, diplomatic negotiations and impediments which have arisen periodically associated with conflicts in the Middle East. Another phenomenon that gave added impetus to the search for a new emblem was also emerging. In the years from 1993 onwards, we have seen the rise of brutal interstate and ethnic conflict involving a proliferation of non-state actors. We have also seen the rise of Islamic extremists who have eschewed all the accepted boundaries of armed conflict, civil society and the principles underpinning the work of voluntary relief societies. In an unprecedented fashion, the ICRC has endured attacks on its personnel and facilities over these years in places such as Somalia, Chechnya, Iraq and Afghanistan. I personally watched the struggles of the organisation in Somalia and Iraq and was privileged to serve on secondment from the Army to the ICRC in Bosnia and Croatia in 1996 as part of the Sarajevo delegation. It was fast becoming clear that the Red Cross was entering a situation where not only was it not affording protection but it was in fact becoming a target in some situations because of the emblem itself. The ICRC and the UN were facing a similar situation of needing to have some flexibility in the manner in which they operated. In the course of attempting to find an answer to this dilemma the issue of moving to one universal emblem was again canvassed but this could not be achieved. The solution was therefore to adopt the third emblem, which became the vehicle for facilitating additional flexibility within itself. This was the outcome of the diplomatic conference in Switzerland in 2005. The result is that the red crystal can be used on an equal footing with the red cross and red crescent by all military medical personnel and by voluntary relief societies who wish to be part of the movement. It is also open for national societies to incorporate within the red crystal an emblem that is in effective use by a high contracting party and which has been communicated to the other high contracting parties and the ICRC. It is therefore possible for the red star of David and the dual red cross and red crescent to be used in this way, at last enabling the Magen David Adom, Eritrean, Kazakh, and Palestinian Red Crescent Societies to join the movement. Additionally, it is possible for the military medical personnel of high contracting parties, the UN and the ICRC to use any of the three distinctive emblems where it is believed this may enhance protection. As a heartening symbol of the success achieved during the process leading up to the adoption of protocol III, on 28 November 2005 Dr Noam Yifrach, Chairman of the executive committee of the Magen David Adom, and Mr Younis al-Khatib, President of the Palestine Red Crescent Society, signed in Geneva an agreement on operational arrangements between the societies. Finally, in a powerful and emotional moment at the conclusion of the 29th international conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent, the ICRC announced the recognition of the two societies, and they were subsequently admitted to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies by acclamation. There is no doubt that the movement has been strengthened by the resolution of this issue and the wounds of the last several decades of debate can now begin to heal. It is incumbent on the ADF now to put in place a sound familiarisation process to ensure an understanding of the meaning of this reform and that our personnel instinctively recognise the new symbol. The community in general also needs to understand the significance of the symbol, as the red cross has often been misused. We must ensure that the red crystal is not similarly the subject of misuse. In many ways it is regrettable that the ternational community was not able to settle on a universal symbol. Over the last two decades, the issue of protective emblems has become more complicated by a proliferation of non-government organisations, NGOs, operating in the field with an absolute rainbow of emblems and logos. There is no doubt that this has complicated the situation for the ICRC. Not all NGOs operate on sound principles, and some have blatantly crossed the line in being fronts for belligerhistory ence and terrorist organisations. In conflict zones and countries with low educational levels, many simply do not understand the difference between all the emblems and logos they see around them from time to time. We must therefore work all the harder to promote knowledge of and respect for these three essential protective emblems. I stated that I was proud to serve on ondment with the ICRC. The organisation performs essential relief work in countless conflict zones and disaster areas around the world, which has only too clearly been made evident again in these last few days. As a member of the ADF, the role I prized above all is that which seeks to track and monitor the whereabouts and well-being of prisoners of war and detainees. With this in mind, I call on Hamas to immediately provide access to the ICRC to Gilad Shalit, a soldier of the Israeli defence force, as he continues to endure nearly three years of captivity somewhere in the Gaza Strip. I worked with all the ability I could muster to facilitate the work of the ICRC in Somalia, Bosnia, Croatia, Timor Leste and Iraq. I count as the lowest point of my field experience the failures of the coalition forces to do better with respect to the handling of detainees in Iraq and the Abu Ghraib saga. That experience was a lesson that we must always be on our guard to maintain our standards. It inis important for us to work with the ICRC and maintain a regular dialogue. It is not a perfect organisation and has made mistakes along the way, but there is no doubt that if it did not exist we would have to invent it. I commend the bill to the House.",49
26,Mr IAN MACFARLANE,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"As we have just heard, the Defence Legislation (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 2008 is in three parts. I thank the member for Eden-Monaro for a very enlightening lesson on both the red cross and red crescent and the reason that today, as part of this bill, we are amending the Geneva Conventions Act 1957 and the Criminal Code Act 1995 to incorporate the third additional protocol to the Geneva convention to establish the universally distinctive emblem of the red crystal. It is very appropriate at this time that our sec- minds are drawn to the history of the Red Cross. As we have seen in the enormous tragedy that has unfolded in Victoria and, to a lesser extent, the devastation in North Queensland, the Red Cross is always to the fore. However, in a world of great diversity and many different cultures, it is singularly important that we have a symbol that will not be wrongly perceived as having a particular religious, cultural or political affiliation and that will guarantee, as much as ever can be guaranteed in the field of battle, the safety of those people who work under it. The emblem will only be used with the consent of the Minister for Defence. It is an emblem which will universally signify people who are coming to the aid of the injured, whether it is in a military conflict, as a result of terrorism ormore commonly these days, it seems-as a result of natural disaster. The second component of this bill will amend the Defence Act 1903 to explicitly enable the making of regulations to cover the provision of medical and dental treatment, including pharmaceuticals, to ADF members or cadets or a member of an ADF member's family. This was an election commitment. We hear at great length from those who sit opposite, even when they sit on this side, the promises that they lay out about what they will do when they gain the Treasury benches: how they will never cut back on defence spending and how they will preserve the rebuilding of the defence forces which the coalition did under the Howard government. Yet again we see with this part of the bill a reneging on an election commitment. The coalition supports the government in this provision to provide extra support to defence personnel. However, the opposition is concerned that Labor has broken a key election promise to our defence personnel. It promised to spend $33.1 million over four years on 12 defence family healthcare clinics. And yet, as we saw in the budget, all the budget delivered was an amount almost a third of that, some $12.2 million, for a trial, with care provided in only five locations. So early in its term of government, this government has broken an election promise with a $21 million shortfall from its election promise. Five months after the fact, the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel-that is, the member for Eden-Monaro, who has just spoken-belatedly included three more locations, adding Townsville, Darwin and Puckapunyal to the trial, such must have been his embarrassment, as an ex active soldier and someone who I am sure holds deep pride in the ADF, at the reneging of the government in a key area of election policy. I am sure his embarrassment would have been accentuated by the fact that, at this time, in a world that we now find so challenging, when given an opportunity to show their commitment to the ADF, the Labor Party failed. They failed as they have in the past and as they no doubt will in the future. The message that sends to the ADF personnel who are affected by this cut is that the Labor Party not only do not keep their promises but do not fully, 100 per cent, support the proper provisioning of the members of the ADF and their families. On that point, it has an effect on the morale of the ADF and an effect on the recruitment ability of the ADF, and the government should be held in condemnation for both of those points. We hear too often from people standing at the dispatch box on that side under this government of their commitment to the ADF and what they will do and how important the personnel in the ADF are. But, given the opportunity, they cannot even keep the most basic of election promises. We are not talking about $21 billion; we are talking about a sum of money that was promised to the personnel in the ADF, a sum of money which could easily have been allocated as it was promised, a sum of money just under $21 million, and yet they are unable to keep that election promise. The failure to fully deliver this promise means that defence personnel in the RAAF in Edinburgh and Elizabeth North, and at RAAF Base Amberley and RAAF Base Williamtown are to miss out on this service altogether. Instead of extending the free health care currently provided to ADF personnel and their dependent spouses and children, Labor has committed only to a trial of the free provision of basic GP services and limited dental care to the families of the ADF, and only at limited locations. This is a disgrace. But it underlines a lack of commitment by the Labor Party to the ADF. I can be as sure as I stand here that that lack of commitment is being felt in my electorate at the two Defence Force bases there-the one at Oakey and the other at Cabarlah. Already, as I move around my electorate I am asked-in fact, almost immediately after the election I was askedwhether or not this government would maintain their commitment to fund the ADF in total, and I have to be honest and say that, on the basis of their past experience, I said I would be watching them closely. I did not condemn them straight up-although I should have; my instinct was right-I gave them the benefit of the doubt. That benefit of the doubt has been betrayed. Not only have they failed to deliver on this election promise item but also we now see that the federal government was planning to cut $1 billion from the ADF. Madam Deputy Speaker Bird, I ask you if those in government fully understand the message that that sends to those men and women who, in some cases, make the ultimate sacrifice in the service of this country. wonder if the government understand the message that that sends to those people. It sends a message that demoralises them. It sends a message that these brave men and women will again have to wait for a coalition government to rebuild the defence forces to the level this nation requires. In my electorate, as I have mentioned, I have two defence installations. The first is at Oakey, which is a premier helicopter training base, which trains men and women to fly helicopters in all sorts of scenarios and situations. I have flown with the ADF in Timor and admired the skill that those men and women displayed in handling these wonderful pieces of equipment. I will watch them as they now embark on the training with the new Tigers, and I look forward to seeing the MRH90s grace the skies around Oakey. But it is important, as we go forward with the defence budget, that those sorts of training facilities are not threatened. Of greater concern to me, though, is the installation at Cabarlah, known as the signals base-though I am sure they do much more than signalling. That base plays an extraordinarily important role in virtually every peacekeeping operation and theatre of war that Australia is involved in. It also plays a very important role, though, in the economic and community makeup of my electorate. The people who come to that base are highly skilled men and women. They are men and women who come there to take their careers on, to learn extra skills-and also to perform certain tasks that we do not speak of in public. Those tasks are done to fundamentally underwrite the personal security of each and every Australian. Yet this base is under threat from this government and its budget costcutting. This base now sits there with an axe over it, with those in it wondering whether or I not it will remain intact after the defence white paper. I took certain action when I was a member of the Howard cabinet to ensure that the base was not considered for closure and, on the change of government, I spoke personally and wrote to the defence minister, asking him to recognise the significance of the Cabarlah barracks, and to secure its future. I have to say that it concerns me greatly that, to date, I have only received a non-committal response and a referral to the process of the white paper. That process is now becoming way overdue. It is a process which does not give any comfort or security to the men and women of the Cabarlah base, nor give any comfort or security to the community that surrounds it. As I said, the defence personnel, both in the electorate of Groom and nationally, require a government that is prepared to stick to its commitments in relation to its election promises and to the ADF. Mr Craig Thomson-Was it a core promise or a non-core promise?",54
27,Mr IAN MACFARLANE,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"The member opposite should answer that question, and I am happy if he wants to do so, because I understood from the Prime Minister that all his election promises would be carried out, and on that basis I suggest that it is a core promrecognise ise and on that same basis I suggest that he has broken it. I think that the government need to seriously consider exactly what message they want to send to the Australian defence forces, to those who are serving overseas, to those young people who are considering service in the ADF, and whether or not they are going to, as a government, provide the level of funding that they need. They should immediately reverse this decision, or enhance this decision, and take it back to the $33 lion over four years for the 12 defence family healthcare clinics they promised. There is a third component to this bill, on which I will only speak briefly. Again I find myself, twice in one speech, acknowledging the comments of the member for Eden Monaro. It is in relation to the amendments of the Defence (Special Undertakings) Act of 1952, to provide that the Joint Defence ity Pine Gap is a special defence undertaking and a prohibited area. I, like the previous speaker, certainly agree that people have the right to demonstrate, but this is an important establishment in the defence of Australia and our allies and, whilst demonstrations should take place, they should not take place in a way which interferes with its operation. This is a bill in three parts, each of which is quite different. In speaking on this bill today I also take the opportunity to wish those in the ADF every success and every safety in their endeavours and again extend the gratitude of my electorate for their efforts. I commend the bill to the House.",57
28,Mr DREYFUS,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"I rise to speak today on the Defence Legislation (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 2008. As the House has heard from other speakers, this bill does a number of things which include amending the Geneva Conventions Act 1957 and the Criminal Code Act 1995 to the red crystal as the third emblem of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and also providing that the joint facility at Pine Gap is a prohibited area. It is impossible to speak about the Red Cross Movement without reiterating the comments that have been made in the last two days by many others in this House about the work of Red Cross volunteers and, indeed, other volunteer movements. The Red Cross, alongside the Country Fire Authority miland other volunteer organisations, are working in the bush as we speak here. More than ever, we thank them for their work. In this crucible, in which our resolve is cast, we find our cohesion as a nation and resilience as a people. These particular amendments incorporate the red crystal into Australia's statute books as the third emblem of the International Red Facil- Cross and Red Crescent Movement. The crystal will give to groups and societies that have difficulty identifying with the two previously recognised symbols, the red cross and the red crescent, a neutral protective marking to clearly distinguish them from combatants in war zones. It will identify all those operating under it in these ways: it will identify them as working within the Geneva conventions; it will identify them as a group providing relief and care in times of crisis for the most vulnerable; and it will identify them as a group or society blind to race, religion or politics. One such society is, of course, Magen David Adom-Israel's national disaster, ambulance and blood bank service. Until 2006, Magen David Adom had been prevented from becoming a member of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement because it used what would be known in this country as the red star of David as its emblem. I do not want to revisit the long controversy over the admission of Magen David Adom to the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and some of the other disputes in recent years because, in 2006, Magen David Adom was admitted as a member of the international movement. But it is the case that the introduction of the addilance tional neutral protection symbol has been under discussion for a number of yearsindeed, for far too long. In the very protracted discussion, the red crystal, the emblem that has now been adopted, emerged as the most popular proposal. It is formally referred to as the ‘third protocol emblem' in additional protocol III, there being a series of protocols to the Geneva conventions under which the use of these emblems is mandated. It is the happy event that in 2006 Magen David Adom-which is Israel's national disaster, ambulance and blood bank service, as I mentioned-joined over 100 million volunteers in 186 national societies, all of which are committed to: providing protection and assistance to victims of conflict, visiting detainees, providing medical care to the sick and wounded, and reuniting separated families. The third symbol has none of the religious connotations surrounding the cross or the crescent. Of course, the red cross is not itself a religious symbol. It is simply an inversion of the Swiss flag and it was intended when introduced and adopted to symbolise the traditional neutrality of that country, that being an appropriate stance for this kind of organisation. It is also the case, however, when gaining the acceptance of sometimes traumatised and poverty stricken people, some of whom have deep suspicions arising out of protracted religious conflict, that there should be no room for misunderstanding. For that reason, Magen David Adom, when operating outside Israel, will use the new symbol, the red crystal, that is being endorsed here as part of Australian law. As a member of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, Magen David Adom will continue to operate blood banks. It will continue to operate the first aid stations that have been built and maintained all over Israel and the ambuservices that are provided to all critical border kibbutzim. During the most recent conflict, MDA mobilised over 400 ambulances, extended the hours of over 12,000 volunteers and transported injured civilians, both Palestinian and Israeli, to hospitals throughout Israel. This year alone Magen David Adom's 700 fully-manned life-saving vehicles attended 1,180 sites hit by missiles within the western Negev, protecting human life regardless of political or religious affiliation. Increasingly, Magen David Adom has been extending its outreach to first-aid programs among the Arab-Israeli population. Its aim is to address the disproportionate number of drownings, electrocutions and serious burns among Israelis of Arab descent. The Victorian division of Magen David Adom has also been doing its bit for many causes. In Melbourne 700 people attended the function at the Esplanade Hotel on AFL grand final night last year, raising $10,000 for Magen David Adom's vital work. Similarly, the Caulfield Hebrew Congregation welcomed three of Israel's finest paramedics to Melbourne at a function at Sukiert Hall. Alon Basker, Ilya Levi and Tom Pasler attended an event co-hosted by the Australasian Jewish Medical Association. The Victorian branch of Magen David Adom has also launched an appeal for those affected by the Victorian bushfires. Co-president of the Victorian division of Magen David Adom Glynis Lipson, who is in the gallery today, said that the response has been so overwhelming that organisers could not get into their driveways or front doors for all the donations. I would like to thank Magen David Adom for their work both in this country and elsewhere in the world-work which is vital, which emphasises our common humanity and which ameliorates human suffering. The other matter that I would like to mention is the part of the bill which clarifies the definition of a defence undertaking in the context of the joint defence facility at Pine Gap. Under the amendments it will be an offence to enter a facility that is ‘resisting preparing to resist international aggression'. Proposed subsection 8A as set out in the bill provides that the whole area in the geographic location of the Pine Gap facility is a prohibited area. It also provides that the work conducted at Pine Gap is a special defence undertaking. These amendments respond to the defences raised by a number of activists who broke into the Pine Gap facility in 2005. The activists sought to rely on a defence that asserted that Pine Gap was not a prohibited area because it was not then being currently used for the defence of the Commonwealth. The assertion was then and would be now an absurd assertion because Pine Gap is an essential piece in our intelligence and counterterrorism network. It makes an important contribution to our alliance with the United States as well as to the deterrence and avoidance of conflict. It is a central part of ANZUS and UKUSA and plays a vital role in the forward defence of Australia. Similarly absurd is the allegation that was raised by those activists and has been raised since that Australia does not know what is done at Pine Gap. Much is sometimes made of what is in fact a misquotation of Sir John Gorton, former Prime Minister, to the effect that, and this is the way it is usually misquoted: ‘I don't know what happens at Pine Gap and I don't care.' It might be asked, who knows what the Liberal Party were doing in the 1960s? Today an important underlying principle of the Pine Gap facility is ‘full knowledge and concurrence'-that is, Australia must have full knowledge of and agree to all activities conducted on its soil. The activists concerned who raised this mistaken defence in 2005 were supposedly pacifists. They broke into the facility as a statement of their own political convictions. I would say to members of the House that there was both or conceit and naivety in their actions. It is supremely arrogant to think that, entitled to express your politics as you might be, you can in effect recklessly undermine the security of the Australian people by breaking into a defence facility; and it is naive to think that, committed to peace as all of us are, Australia should not pursue interoperability with the United States, as our closest ally. Pine Gap has always captured the imagination of the Australian people. On 26 January 1967 the daily newspaper of Alice Springs, the Centralian Advocate, ran the front-page headline, ‘Space base may attract flying saucers'. Perhaps, as a peaceful nation with friendly neighbours, we are unused to the kind of military installations that dot countryside of our allies in Europe and the United States. For some reason or other this facility has always excited not only UFO believers but also conspiracy theorists. It might be that what has sometimes been said to be the quintessentially Australian fiance of authority has led to the problem of break-ins at Pine Gap. As early as 1967 the daily log kept by the supervisor for the construction of Pine Gap records that he had to lock the cover to the facility's water tank to prevent what was described as ‘illegal swimming'. One way or another it does need to be made absolutely clear that the facility at Pine Gap is essential to a multilateral approach to global security cooperation. It is vital for intelligence collection and our missile early-warning systems. It allows the Australian government to ensure that arms control and disarmament agreements are being honoured throughout the world and it also allows the Australian government to monitor military developments in areas of the world where our troops may be operating. We do need to shake off the tendency to regard a ‘prohibited area' as a challenge and instead let our military do their work. If any Australian citizens have a political problem with a facility such as Pine Gap then it is a problem that ought to be expressed by those citizens peacefully and legally. It might be that those who have a problem with the Pine Gap facility even write to me as a member of the Australian parliament to express their views about it. What does need to be made clear is that it is not a legitimate means of protest to break into this or any other military facility and it is appropriate that the amendments that are here put forward in this bill be adopted by the House. I commend the bill to the House.",57
29,Dr JENSEN,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"Tangney) (5.59 pm)Before addressing the bill at hand, allow me the to express my deepest respect for the men and women of the defence forces of Australia, who are the pride of our nation and the envy of so many others. Their professionalism, their courage and their humility are constants. Regardless of political, economic and de- social change, our armed services stoically continue their work, risking all so that the rest of us can enjoy peace. I trust that the profligate spenders opposite, whose idea of victory appears to be setting record debt levels, will not get so carried away trying to buy favour with the public through their unstimulating stimulus packages that the larder is left bare for our Defence Force. The first item in the Defence Legislation (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 2008, the formal recognition of the red crystal symbol, in addition to the red cross and the red crescent, would appear long overdue. Given the religious connotations of the existing two symbols, it was inevitable that not all communities would be comfortable with embracing them. Many societies, Australia among them, have populations and consequently armed forces which are extremely diverse in cultural and ethnic terms. Although more than half the world's people reportedly follow Christian or Islamic faiths, represented respectively by the symbols of the cross and the crescent, billions more do not, many of them tragically in regions currently suffering conflict. Perhaps the red crystal will one day become the dominant symbol for protection of people and property such as hospitals and vehicles, working in accordance with the Geneva conventions which set down rules governing the conduct of war. Regardless, the adoption of the red crystal in addition to the red cross and the red crescent is a positive move and one which would meet no opposition from any reasonable party. Sadly, the same cannot be said for the second item in this bill, relating to the provision of health care to families of Defence Force personnel. I have already indicated the great esteem in which I hold our service men and women, and I suspect the vast majority of Australians share my sentiment. However, we also feel enormous gratitude to the families of these personnel-families who make enormous sacrifices in supporting their military members in the execution of their duties. The life of a military family can be exceedingly challenging. Stability is one of the first casualties, with frequent relocations as service personnel take up new postings, often in relatively remote and occasionally very unpleasant settings. Then there is the stress of separation when defence personnel are deployed overseas or even within Australia but away from their families for long periods of time. No-one should have any delusions about the purpose of our military or the risks inherent in any military career. But we must all recognise the impact on families who stay behind as personnel are sent into battle, as they have been and continue to be for the first time in such numbers in a generation. Such are the realities of military life. But spare a thought for those families and the stomach-churning anguish they experience as a father, a mother, a brother, a sister, a son dren. or a daughter stands against Australia's enemies in distant lands and information on their whereabouts and welfare grows scarce. Every ring of the phone and every knock at the door must cause a chill in these homes as family members wonder if this is bad news from the front. Imagine their stress. For the excellence of their skills and the way in which they exercise them-for that alone-military personnel deserve to know that their families are being taken care of by the nation they so faithfully serve. But when you consider the additional costs to the families themselves, then surely our debt and gratitude grows manyfold. I thought the government also understood this. But it seems that they were merely paying lip-service to the principles involved when they made an election promise to meet the medical and dental needs of our Australian Defence Force personnel's families. I say ‘paying lipservice' because, of course, on winning government, the members opposite failed to keep their promise, just as they have failed to keep so many others. You have lied, and lied to the Australian public on this, and your credibility is shot. Here I will quote from Labor's plan for defence, your election policy document, as it has been cited in reports. This is signed off on by the now Prime Minister and the now defence minister and the now veterans' affairs minister. Under the title, ‘Free medical and dental care for ADF families', you said: ADF families can face significant difficulties obtaining access to general medical and dental care for dependants, especially in regional and remote localities. Posting to a remote location can mean that ADF families struggle to access the sort of health care that Australians enjoy. A Rudd Labor Government will progressively extend free health care currently provided to ADF personnel to ADF dependent spouses and chilLabor will begin this with a $33.1 million investment starting at 12 Defence Family Health Care Clinics, with a focus on remote bases locations and major regional centres. What a fantastic promise-brilliant! Families of those who lay their lives on the line for the sake of national security will be allowed to access the same healthcare services as the rest of us. If I did not know you were full of such empty promises, I might have been hoodwinked into voting for you myself.",60
30,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"While I appreciate the passion in the member's comments, he needs to direct his comments through the chair.",61
31,Dr JENSEN,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"Not surprisingly, the problem with this promise was that those opposite would not keep it. A cynic might suggest that they never had any intention of keeping it. By the way, where are all those laptops for the schools? Never mind, we will be here all day and all night if we query every one of the broken promises. Anyway, back to ADF families and that particular broken promise. As the members opposite are no doubt aware, they did not begin this with a $33.1 million investment, and the government did not start with 12 defence family healthcare clinics. In the current budget the government allocated $12.2 million over four years for this project. Even worse, they set aside $2.4 million for the current financial year. If they could not find the funds to keep their words last year, how are they going to manage to keep it now? Is this why the government wants carte blanche to borrow up to $200 billion? These are questions which require answers from the government, especially following reports which say that they now plan to cut defence spending by up to a billion a year, including the loss or relocation hundreds of jobs. And news of these cuts came just a few days after the Australian Strategic Policy Institute warned against further reductions in defence spending. ‘In the event of a recession, it would make little sense to withdraw the stimulus of defence spending,' the think tank said, adding that most defence expenditure remained within Australia. Obviously the government does not care about this. The government would rather make cuts to defence to support their wild one-off payment schemes. They would rather remove a known stimulus to the economy in favour of an unproven measure. And far from the great promise of the sort of health care that Australians can enjoy for ADF families and 12 clinics, according to reports at the time you put a cap of $300 on dental care-no pun intended there-and told the families to find their own doctors and dentists. The Minister for Defence Science and Personnel pitched in that this dramatically scaled-back program would be limited to just five locations. This was just a trial period, the government said. And last October the same minister said that this ‘trial' would be extended to include Townsville, Darwin and Puckapunyal, but he also revealed that the government had still not made a start on implementing the program about which they had made such grand promises almost a year earlier when they made lavish, unrealistic commitments in order to get over the line in the election. Last October, adding yet another restriction to the program, the minister said, ‘The initial phase of the trial is set to commence in early 2009 for 2,700 ADF dependants.' Well it is now early 2009, so where are the lucky 2,700 dependants who are enjoying such largesse? There are 53,000 active service personnel in the ADF, yet only 2,700 are supposedly getting help in the first stages of this project, and we do not even of know if that help has yet commenced. Worse still, the minister added, ‘When the trial is expanded in late 2009, it will provide for a total of approximately 16,000 ADF dependants.' Certainly there are a lot of young, single people in the military, but 53,000 personnel do not have only 16,000 dependants. Perhaps this reflects the same poor mathematics skills in the government that we have seen in their response to the financial crisis. There appear to be significant holes in this aspect of the bill before us, not least that it fails to specify that the dependants will get free consultations and up to $300 per annum in basic dental care, as promised by the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel. Instead, it makes provisions for regulations to be made to the ADF for medical and dental care of a member, a cadet or a member of the family of an ADF member. In the absence of such detail in the bill, presumably we are being asked to pass legislation which then will be subject to interpretation and implementation by the ADF. Why are we getting no details here? Section 58A of the Defence Act defines a ‘member' as including someone who has actually ceased being an active service member and even includes them if they are no longer an active service member because they are dead. Likewise, a ‘cadet' includes officers, instructors and cadets in the Australian Army Cadets, again, even if they are no longer active because they have died or for any other reason. The act says that a ‘member of the family' includes but is not limited to people who are a member of the same household and a dependant of ADF personnel. This applies to both ‘members' and ‘cadets'. The key phrase here is ‘included but not limited to'. In the absence of detail in the bill, this could open the door to all sorts of possible claims for health care under the program. Furthermore, section 4 of the Defence Act defines a ‘member' as including ‘any officer, sailor, soldier and airman', so it is not clear in this bill whether reservists are also to be included in the provision of health care to dependants. The reservists themselves are already entitled to ADF health care because it is an operational requirement that they be maintained in fitness so they are always ready for duty. So here we have an element of the bill which not only shows up the government for failing to meet a key election promise to tens of thousands of families but also is so full of holes that, if it were a school assignment, it would surely be returned to the student with an instruction to do it again. The men and women of the ADF and their families deserve better than such shoddy conduct from the political leaders who ultimately control their lives. You ought to be ashamed. If this is indicative of the levels of skill and intelligence on the benches opposite, it is a wonder they could find their own way to their own seats, or perhaps it is simply that they do not care. Maybe that is why they are pressing ahead with defence acquisitions which not only increase the risk to the lives of front-line personnel but jeopardise the nation's very sovereignty. Let us take the purchase of Joint Strike Fighters-a multibillion dollar plan which would become Australia's biggest single military order ever. Air combat experts around the world have raised grave concerns about the capability of this aircraft in general and many have reservations specifically about its capacity to meet Australia's unique needs. Nevertheless, the top bureaucrats at Defence have been dazzled by the showmanship of JSF manufacturer Lockheed Martin's sales team and appear to have convinced the government it is the right choice for Australia. This is despite the US openly admitting that foreign powers such as Australia will only get a second-rate version of the JSF, with Washington demanding only America get the best model. The problem is in the insular offices of this city where sales hype seems to have become indistinguishable from reality, and where the talk is of ‘magical' powers in the JSF-and I am serious, they really do use the word ‘magic'-rather than talk about the practical and very real considerations of defending Australia and Australia's interests. This ‘magic' was related by Tom Burbage, Executive Vice President of Lockheed Martin Aeronautics, in Avionics magazine. When asked what was ‘magic' about the JSF, he responded, ‘There is a lot of magic.' Asked why Australia is not purchasing a better plane-and who would not want the best when it comes to defending our nationsupporters of the JSF will come back with two excuses. First, they will say that the F22-in this case-is too expensive. Well, the difference in price between the JSF and the F22 appears to be narrowing by the day, largely because of skyrocketing estimates of the JSF's price tag. If the government would stop panicking and throwing money at every movement in the economy, this margin could easily be covered, especially when you consider the next fighter jet acquisition will be expected to see us through to the middle of this century. Secondly, the claim is that the US has banned sales of the F22. That is not quite right. Congress did order that no funds be spent on marketing that aircraft-the so called Obey amendment. So the ban is technically on trying to sell it, not on the sales transactions themselves. In addition, given our extremely close defence relationship with the US-and that relationship can only be expected to become closer in the futurewe should expect the government to make strenuous representations to our key ally that we be given access to the best of military hardware. Why buy mutton when you can buy lamb? This brings me to the third and final element of the bill before us, which is intended to further safeguard the security of the Joint Defence Facility at Pine Gap. Leftist blowhards-who no doubt vote for members opposite, apparently in the knowledge that they share the same disregard for national security-have long been critical of Pine Gap, without even knowing exactly what work is done there. Few do know, and that is as it should be. Successive governments on both sides have been satisfied that it is worthwhile, and that it is necessary to maintain tight security. We must accept those assurances. What we do know is that it is a key element in our defence relationship with the US, providing valuable intelligence to both parties, and that both enjoy a strategic advanthe tage through its continued operation. Under the Howard government in 2007, the then defence minister, Brendan Nelson, eloquently explained the reasons for maintaining the Pine Gap joint defence arrangement. He stressed the value of the project to our national security and that Australian personnel had full knowledge of all activities at the facility. He said: The intelligence collected at Pine Gap meets critical requirements of both our nations, providing us with information on priority intelligence targets such as terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and military and weapons developments. As such, Pine Gap must certainly remain a secure facility, including against protestors, who, while free to express their opposition, must also be subject to laws protecting national security installations, whether those installations are joint facilities or solely ADF projects. This is beyond dispute. It is just a shame that the government appears to have so little interest-or is it even an active disinterest?-in defence matters. National security should be a priority-in fact it must be the foremost priority-for any government. Without national security, all the flawed healthcare programs, all the missing laptops for schools and all the pork-barrelling, oneoff payments will amount to nought. The members opposite should reflect on this as they continue to talk down markets and plunge Australia deeper into ever-morepointless debt.",62
32,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,I would take this opportunity to remind members to avoid the use of ‘you' in their speeches as it is a reflection on the chair.,64
33,Mr NEUMANN,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"I speak in support of the Defence Legislation (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 2008. As a number of speakers have mentioned during debate, the bill has three purposes, the first being changes to the symbolism that we accept and which is internationally recognised-and this relates to the Geneva Conventions Act 1957 and the Criminal Code Act 1995-to include the third protocol to the Geneva conventions, which formally recognised the red crystal as a tripartite emblem of the international Red Cross. The red crystal is a very distinctive symbol. It looks more like a diamond to me, but it is called a crystal, and it has been recognised alongside the red cross and the red crescent. On 8 March 2006 Australia signed the third protocol, which came into force on 14 January 2007. The second aspect of the bill relates to changes to the Defence Act 1903 in relation to dealing with pharmaceuticals by Australian Defence Force medical staff. The third deals with changes in relation to the Defence (Special Undertakings) Act 1952 to make certain that the Pine Gap facility is properly protected against unauthorised access-and that relates to a decision made by the Northern Territory Court of Criminal Appeal in the case of The Queen v Law and others in 2008. There are deficiencies. We can look at the legislation, and it was a very clever argument put by the QC representing the defendants in that case in relation to a very technical aspect of the law. There are legislative deficiencies which were shown up in that case against the four Christian pacifists arising from their actions in 2005. The first aspect of the bill relates to the red crystal. I think just about any adult in Australia, and even children, would recognise the red cross emblem, and even the red crescent emblem, which is so recognised across the Muslim world. They are universally recognised and can be found in humanitarian and medical crises, in places of war and conflict-on buildings, on unarmed personnel vehicles, on the sleeves of medical staff and in all kinds of places. There is universal agreement that people using these emblems are to be protected because-as so many people have said today-they express our common humanity and care for the sick, the frail, the aged and those who are in need. The red cross emblem dates back to 1863 internationally. It was recognised following warfare in Italy in 1859. In Australia it dates back to World War I and the first days after the declaration of war. There is some conjecture about what the red cross actually means. It is usually accepted that it is the inverse of the Swiss flag. But it is a recognised symbol and people jealously guard it, as an almost religious icon. That is the problem, because the red cross, for those of the Christian faith, has a connotation. The cross is worn by Christians throughout the world, around their necks, and the cross is held dear in the Christian faith. It has that religious connotation. It is the same with the red crescent in the Muslim world. The red crescent was first recognised during military conflict between Russia and Turkey in the 1870s, but it was officially recognised in 1929 and adopted by Islamic nations worldwide. The red crystal is really the compromise. Ian Piper of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement has said, regarding the red crystal: ‘It was not an easy birth.' That is right. Achieving consensus was a very difficult process-long and laborious. Finally the third protocol was achieved, but only by a majority, on 8 December 2005. The decision to add the red crescent in 1929 did not prove to be the final chapter. As Ian Piper said, it did not prove to be definitive. Using the symbol of the Islamic world, the crescent, and the symbol of the Christian world, the cross, did have connotations, particularly in places where animism or Judaism were prevalent. We recognise that there is a dominant religious belief in our country, as there is in many Middle Eastern countries. Even though we are a multicultural and pluralistic society, there is a recognition throughout our country of our Christian heritage. It is reflected in great work that the churches do. As the Prime Minister eloquently put it today, we see at this particular moment the great work that the churches do in times of crisis and difficulty. We are seeing it in Victoria and in Queensland-along with the work of the Red Cross, of course. Coming up with a symbol which is different was very important. Israel's own relief society, Magen David Adom, is a really wonderful organisation, which serves the same purpose as the Red Cross in Australia, but the red star of David has some really significant connotations for those in the Muslim world. Even though the red star was adopted in the 1930s, before the birth of the state of Israel, it is almost understandable that the Islamic world would have some problems with it. So the red crystal is a compromise achieved after decades of controversy. Even after the Palestinian red crescent and the Israeli red star of David were recognised internationally in 2006, that really was not the end of it, and a neutral symbol was important to achieve. As I said, only two-thirds of the 192 signatories to the Geneva conventions supported the red crystal in December 2005. It is possible now for countries in conflicts in Africa where Christianity and Islam are not prevalent to use that symbol as well. I think there will be a universal recognition of the red crystal not only across Africa but also in countries elsewhere. I want to take this time to applaud the Red Cross for their wonderful work. When I was a boy living in Ipswich, my parents' house was eight foot underneath the water in 1974. We lost almost everything. The Army were terrific in those days in Ipswich. South-East Queensland was devastated by Cyclone Wanda. As it came in from the north, a lot of Brisbane and Ipswich were under flood. the Those who lived through that time will remember with a great deal of appreciation not just the work of the Army-who saved what little remained of my parents' furniture-but also the work done by the Red Cross, who came round with such tremendous compassion to care for the people in my area. I will always be thankful personally to the Red Cross for what they did. I want to pay tribute to what the Red Cross are doing at the moment, particularly in Victoria. According to the website, as at 3 pm on 10 February, they had raised, in the Victorian bushfire appeal, $25.7 million from over 139,000 website and phone donations, with the federal and state governments additionally pledging sums of money. And the donations keep pouring in as the Australian people open their hearts. The Red Cross, which is the subject of this bill, along with the red crystal, has done tremendous work in this country. I urge all Australians, particularly in my electorate of Blair, to donate to the Victorian bushfire appeal as well as to the work done by the Red Cross in North Queensland. I come from South-East Queensland, but we feel it, because Queenslanders across our state are prone to experiencing floods. So the work done by the Red Cross is highly valued, as is the work done by the Salvos, Anglicare and a whole host of other community organisations which show great humanitarian spirit. We thank them for the wonderful work that they do in our community. It is not the time to make highly political speeches. I feel inclined to do so in responding to what the member for Tangney had to say, but I will let it pass through to the keeper, as they say in cricket, and deal with the second aspect of the bill. The member for Tangney made some quite amazing statements in relation to the second aspect of the bill. In the provision of medical and dental care for defence families, the Rudd government has not only done what it announced in the budget but also gone beyond that in terms of the pilot programs for the health and welfare of defence families. That is more than was done by the coalition during their nearly 12 years in office. The second aspect of this bill will amend section 124 of the fence Act 1903, ensuring regulations can be made to cover the provision of medical and dental treatment, including pharmaceuticals, to an Australian Defence Force member or cadet or a member of the family of an ADF member. Currently the regulations relate only to members of the ADF to ensure their health for the purpose of discharging their military duties and relating to cost recovery. I want to praise the military personnel of Blair in Queensland. We have the biggest military base in the country at RAAF Amberley. I was privileged last year to serve in ADF parliamentary program and to experience first hand the wonderful competency, effectiveness and commitment of the people of the ADF, particularly at the RAAF base at Amberley. This government is pouring $1.1 billion into the expansion of that base, and there will be a greater need to provide medical treatment not just for the Defence personnel serving there but also for their families. About 80,000 people cross state borders each year to live in other areas, and getting access to GPs and dentists is a very difficult process. I have talked to many defence personnel in my area and this is an ongoing problem. We have a shortage of doctors in my area. We have one GP for 1,609 people across the Ipswich and West Moreton area. The Rudd Labor government is making a big effort to increase the number of GP training places and is making great strides to ensure that we have more allied health professionals and nursing staff in my area. I applaud the commitment to a GP Superclinic in my area, which the Minister for Health and Ageing made when she was the shadow minister. I know that a number of stakeholders are interested and I know that a number of military personnel and their families will avail themselves of those services in my area. The third aspect of this bill relates to the De- Defence (Special Undertakings) Act 1952 to include specific provisions for the joint facility at Pine Gap. In the 1960s Pine Gap, which is located about 20 kilometres from Alice Springs, was established. It plays an important role in the security of our nation and of our allies. Part of the Labor Party's platform is its commitment to Pine Gap. We say in chapter 14 of our national platform-a platform that I have voted for on a number of occasions as a national conference delegate-that we believe the Pine Gap joint facility makes an important contribution to our the alliance with our most important ally, the United States of America. We require that this facility continue to be managed and operated on a joint basis, as it is, and only with the Australian government's full knowledge of and concurrence with the facility's activities. We have said that we will ensure the operations of the joint facility are consistent with our national security, disarmament and non-proliferation objectives. It is our constitutional requirement that the Australian government provide not just for the welfare of our people but for their security, and that we are doing. Our national platform says that Labor requires the facility at Pine Gap to continue to be managed and operated as a joint Australian-US facility within the full knowledge and concurrence arrangements to ensure the protection of Australian sovereignty. There are three aspects to our national security that we hold dear in the Labor Party and in the Rudd Labor government. They are, firstly, our alliance with the United States of America, which the Curtin Labor government turned to in the darkest days of World War II, a full 10 years before the ANZUS treaty was signed by the conservative government subsequent to the Chifley Labor government. The second aspect is our constructive engagement with Asia, and we have been taking great strides to improve our relationship there. The Rudd Labor government has a good relationship with many Asian countries-historically, Labor governments have. The third aspect of our national security is our membership of the United Nations. We strongly believe that the United Nations plays a vital role in our national security. We are a middle power and we must play our part in relieving poverty and helping other countries in our region in a quasi good Samaritan way. But we must also play a constructive role in terms of national and international security. This particular legislative amendment arises out of a particular criminal case concerning a number of self-styled Christian pacifists who sought to advance the proposition that the Pine Gap facility was not a prohibited area on the basis that it was primarily used for the purposes of aggression rather than defence. Therefore, the continuation of the ministerial declaration was not necessary for defence purposes. I really cannot understand how they can argue that. The judge, at first instance, ruled the evidence concerning that was inadmissible. But, on appeal, their very clever counsel managed to convince the Northern Territory Court of Criminal Appeal that they were deprived of a possible defence in the circumstances and Law and others had their convictions overturned in February 2008. We believe that, in our kind of democracy, it is appropriate for people to protest. They are entitled to turn out on election day and overturn governments-replace them. We believe that they are entitled to write to the editor, that they are entitled to protest on the streets lawfully and to engage in all manner of civil disobedience, if I can put it like that. But to threaten the security of this country, to engage in illegal protests, simply on the basis that they are anti the United States, anti nuclear or have green, left-style credentials and want to protest like that is simply unacceptable to the average Australian. It is certainly unacceptable to my electors and unacceptable to the Rudd Labor government. We need to protect Pine Gap. As the Minister for Defence said in his second reading speech, ‘Pine Gap has the function of collecting intelligence which is sensitive.' In relation to what goes on at Pine Gap, he said that it: … could threaten their effectiveness and thereby diminish their contribution to national security. It is therefore important that the Joint Defence Facility Pine Gap is protected with effective legislation to deter unauthorised access to the facility. The amendments in this particular bill will ensure that Pine Gap is a special defence undertaking and prohibited area for the purposes of the act. So the very clever argument put by counsel for the defendants in the Queen v Law & Ors would be unsuccessful. This bill serves a very good purpose for the protection and security of our country. It is a great initiative of the Rudd Labor government in terms of the security of our country, and I commend the bill to the House.",64
34,Mr SIMPKINS,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"As a former member of the Australian Regular Army and a serviceman for 15 years, I appreciate the opportunity to speak on the detail of the Defence Legislation (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 2008. Most of my comments will be on the schedule 2 provisions. I speak in support of the view that the government's election commitment, as embodied within this bill, to provide free medical and dental care to ADF families should letters be examined in detail by a committee. This bill will have the effect of amending section 124 of the Defence Act 1903, allowing regulations that will allow for the provision of medical, dental and pharmaceutical support to family members of an ADF member. That sounds fine, and I am sure it sounded great to those RAAF families at Tindal, those Navy families at Cerberus and maybe even those Army families out in Oakey and Palmerston, near Darwin. Having never been posted to any of those locations, I would not be sure of the number of GPs which families can access, but it is easy to accept that seeing a doctor or a dentist in those locations is far more challenging than it is in our capital cities or, for that matter, the remote centres within this country. The commitment made by Labor is clearly stated in its election policy, and I quote: A Rudd Labor Government will progressively extend free health care currently provided to ADF personnel to ADF dependent spouses and children. That seems clear enough. Over a period of time, every dependent spouse and child will get free health care-and I emphasise ‘every one of them' will get free health care. I will move on to the next sentence of that policy: Labor will begin this with a $33.1 million investment starting at 12 Defence Family Health Care Clinics, with a focus on remote bases locations and major regional centres. Again, that is very clear. The first clinics be established, using $33.1 million, and will be across remote bases and even into major regional centres. Do you know what I, as a former Army officer, liked about this policy? The announced policy would lighten the financial burden on defence families in these non-capital city postings. You have to remember that it is far easier for a spouse to find employment in Brisbane than in Oakey, in Darwin rather than in Katherine, and in Sydney rather than Singleton. Paying for medical and dental treatment with just one income means a higher burden, and that is directly resulting from one's service to this country. Local, non-defence people in these remote bases, locations and even regional centres would also benefit from a reduced level of competition for the available GP appointments. To my way of thinking, this would be good for both defence families and non-defence families in these sorts of areas. In fact, my friends who still serve in uniform would benefit and, at the start of 2008, I looked forward to the allocation of $33.1 million to establish these 12 defence family healthcare clinics. I wanted to see that money and I wanted to know which bases and places would be supported under this 12clinic plan. I also hoped to see further plans of when my friends in capital cities would begin to benefit from the promise of ‘progressively extended' free health care. This bill, like so very many before it, is another example of where a policy promised and possibly voted for does not measure up with the detail in the bill placed before this House. I do not know what the reason is behind this significant shortfall. Is it too expensive for the government to do exactly as it said it would or is it just about show and image? Is it too hard for the government to achieve what it said it would? Has the Department of Defence maybe said that it was a bad idea or that it could not be done? I do not will know. It probably does not even matter, but what matters is getting a promised policy implemented: $33.1 million to roll out 12 clinics. To me, that sounds like a black-andwhite commitment. It is the minimum requirement, but I will take this opportunity to remind the government what defence families heard when it said ‘free health care'. There may be a lot of hiding by this Rudd government behind fine-print statements, such as $300-worth of treatment but, when you say ‘free health care' to a defence family, they immediately think of the same level of health care that their ADF member gets. So is the government ready for flu shots and the full range of inoculations for every member of the family? And what about when Warrant Officer Smith's son needs physio after a football injury at Lavarack Barracks? What about dental care such as braces or fillings? What about all of those things? Free health care in the ADF is a very comprehensive concept and defence families are not ignorant or stupid people. I wonder whether the government has finally realised that what looked good in a media release and clearly received no scrutiny from an adoring media fan club may be unravelling just a little. I will come back to three colossal disconnects: what was said, what was heard and what will be delivered. To emphasise the scale of the shortfall, I refer to the Albury Wodonga contract for health care to serving ADF members. It is my understanding that the contract is worth $27 million over four years, averaging out for the 900 personnel to around $7,500 each over that time. It would seem that even if $33.1 million were provided for free health care that amount would not even look after the families of ADF members of the defence facilities around Albury and Wodonga. I would invite government members to do as we have done on this side: think of that defence base in or near your electorate, think about the married quarters and the private rentals leased by ADF families, think about the partner and the two or three children that are so common in ADF families and then multiply that number by $7,500 over four years, and you start to see the figures that will provide a meaningful amount for what defence families expect from this policy. In looking into this bill, I would also like to raise the circumstances of reserve soldiers. Within Perth we have most elements of the headquarters and units of the 13th Brigade. Not far from the electorate of Cowan-in Joondalup, in the electorate of Moore-is D Company of the 16th Battalion, Royal Western Australian Regiment. I know that 16th Battalion has deployed soldiers to the Solomon Islands as part of the company group. For six months they are serving as full-time servicemen. With regard to this bill, it would appear that the families of reservists will not be able to access this health care, but it should be clarified that those who serve on full-time service should have their families looked after. I raise that matter on behalf of the soldiers posted to the 13th Brigade. I also take this opportunity to make mention of the regard that I have-and, we hope, that all members of this place have-for the reservists within the three services. In Perth, the 13th Brigade consists of the brigade headquarters, the 16th, the 11th/28th Battalions of Light Infantry, the 13th Combat Services Support Battalion, the famous A Squadron of the 10th Light Horse Regiment, the 7th Field Battery of Artillery, the 13th Field Squadron of Engineers and 109 Signals Squadron. Within the formation, and particularly in its units, are reservists, many of whom have served over many years, giving up their holidays and weekends to fulfil their passion-a passion for service of this country in uniform. It is hard to believe that these men and women have time in their lives for anything else apart from their normal jobs and their service commitments as reservists. I pay tribute to their dedicated service to this country, and I believe it is not too much to ask that, when they serve overseas, their families be included in the scope of the policy that the government has put forward but that is not reflected in what is before the House. Before returning to the bill in detail, I would also like to acknowledge the contribution of Major John Caporn, a long-serving member of the reserve and the 13th Brigade. I understand that in 2008 he celebrated 40 years of service-outstanding service. I know that not just the reservists but the whole Army is rightly proud of such an example of dedication. I note that the bill also deals with the vision of health care to cadets, although this point is in need of further clarification. I can make the assumption that we are talking about the cadets of the three services as opposed to the staff cadets of Duntroon or the officer cadets of the Australian Defence Force Academy. The clarification of which I speak is that, while cadets are participating in camps sponsored on ADF bases, health care would be provided similar to that provided with the continuous service undertaken by reservists on annual camps. However, does health care get provided to officers or instructors of cadets or their families under these sorts of circumstances? That is the question. Of course, the minister would be aware that most defence families have placed their private health insurance needs in the hands of the health insurance companies Defence Health or Navy Health. Will the families still need to maintain their health cover? How will this work under the policy that the government has put forward but that, again, is not fully reflected in this bill? Similarly, can we assume that defence families will not have to pay a Medicare contribution? There remain a lot of questions that need to be answered about how this policy and, in fact, this bill will deliver on the expectations created by the government. I believe that this bill-this policy-will provide great problems for the government. The term ‘free health care' carries with it the expectation of an equivalent standard of care to that provided to ADF members. I cannot see anything like that in this legislation, yet the icy said free health care, beginning with 12 clinics. I cannot even see that. The question remains: when will we see this government's stated policy enacted in full and in accordance with the expectations of defence families-those expectations so clearly set by the pro- Labor Party during the election campaign? I have dealt with the changes put forward by the government for the Defence (Special Undertakings) Act 1952 and its regulations. I will now turn to the proposed amendments for the Geneva Conventions Act 1957 and the Criminal Code Act 1995, being amendments put forward to incorporate a third universal emblem, with the red crystal to join the red cross and the red crescent. If you examine the history of symbols of protection, you would be aware that, from the time the red cross was officially approved in 1863 in Geneva-the red crescent began being used around 1877 and was approved in 1929-a number of different symbols have been put forward. Generally, and despite differing religious faiths, most nations have adopted either the cross or the crescent. These symbols are authorised for use for facilities for the care of injured and sick armed forces members; for use by armed forces medical personnel and equipment; for use by military chaplains; and for use by international Red Cross and Red Crescent movements such as the International Committee of the Red CrossICRC-the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies-IFRCand the 185 national Red Cross and Red Crescent societies. The need for the red crystal has been generated over a number of years and addresses the needs of nations such as Israel that have not been able to adopt either of the two previously recognised symbols, which have perceived residual religious connotations. The polneed for the legislative changes embodied in this bill before the House originated with the signing on 8 March 2006 of the additional protocol to the Geneva convention of 12 August 1949. In conclusion, we embrace the need to make the amendments to recognise the red crystal symbol. With regard to the amendments that impact on looking after Defence families, I reiterate that great expectations have been built by the Labor Party, now this federal government. What the government said and what Defence families heard is vastly different to what has been presented to this House. I would suggest to the government that they stop playing around in this area. This is not a matter of semantics. This is a matter of raised expectations that are not being delivered. I suggest to the government that they reflect on what they are doing and get on with delivering exactly what was promised.",68
35,Mr MARLES,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"I rise to speak in support of the Defence Legislation (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 2008, which is a bill that will, in three parts, amend the Geneva Conventions Act 1957, the Criminal Code Act 1995, the Defence Act 1903 and, finally, the Defence (Special Undertakings) Act 1952. The first part of the legislative package which is contained in this bill puts into legisnotations lative effect the protocol additional to the Geneva conventions of 12 August 1949 relating to the adoption of an additional distinctive emblem for the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, otherwise known as protocol III. Australia signed up to protocol III on 8 March 2006 and it entered international force on 14 January 2007. Protocol III was placed before this parliament on 9 May 2007 and the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties considered it and reported on it on 16 August 2007, recommending the adoption of protocol III, leading to the bill that we have before the House today which gives legislative effect to protocol III. The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement is a movement that we are all aware of which seeks to protect human life and health and to alleviate human suffering. It does so without discrimination based on nationality, race, religious beliefs, class or political opinions. One of the issues, however, in stating that non-discriminatory basis of the assistance which is provided by the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement is that the symbols-namely, a cross and a crescent-are perceived by many to have religious overtones. The symbols are, of course, very important in marking hospitals and facilities in which activities are undertaken in accordance with the Geneva conventions and which are undertaken by this international movement. The situation is that in Israel, for example, Magen David Adom, the national emergency, medical, disaster, ambulance and blood bank agency of Israel, has had difficulties in becoming a part of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement because it adopts the use of a different symbol, namely, the red shield of David. So there is a need for this international movement to have a different symbol, one which has no religious conat all, so that organisations such as the MDA, which have precisely the same kinds of humanitarian aims and objectives, can become a part of this international movement. With that in mind, a different symbol has been added to the list of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, namely, the red crystal, a symbol which has no religious connotations at all. Indeed, if you go to the website of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, you will see that they have now, in accordance with protocol III, placed this third emblem on their website, namely, the red crystal. What this legislation does is protect the red crystal in precisely the same way as our law currently protects the symbol of the red cross and the red crescent, including providing for offences related to the misuse or inappropriate use of the red crystal, such offences also plying currently to the misuse or inappropriate use of the red cross or the red crescent. Talking about this legislation does afford the opportunity to briefly reflect upon the work of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, particularly at this moment in time. The Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement was founded by Henry Dunant, a Swiss businessman who, when visiting the emperor of France, Napoleon III, in 1859, happened upon him at the Battle of Solferino-a battle between France and Austria. The experience of witnessing it so moved him that he wrote a book entitled A Memory of Solferino, which was published in 1862. That became the inspiration for the establishment of committees which ultimately became the international Red Cross, and they were established by Henry Dunant. Those committees were devoted to providing humanitarian assistance to those affected by war. Henry Dunant had an up-and-down life after that, but he was accorded a very rare honour by being the first recipient-a joint recipient, but the very first recipient-of Nobel Peace Prize in 1901 for his work in establishing the International Red Cross Movement. Since then, the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement has been one of the most important international humanitarian movements that we have, providing assistance to those affected by war but also now providing assistance to those who have been affected by natural disasters. In Australia, the Australian Red Cross is the organisation in Australia which forms part of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. It was founded nine days after the commencement of the First World War by Lady Helen Munro-Ferguson, who was the wife of the then Governor General. The Australian Red Cross has been very active in both world wars and in a range of apnatural disasters which have affected this country-most notably, of course, the disaster which has so affected this country in the last week, the Victorian bushfires. Indeed, all of us are aware of how important their work is, with the wonderful relief efforts that they have undertaken in the Victorian bushfires. I think all of us are particularly aware of the Red Cross now. Many of us will have dialled their number and many of us will have visited their website in order to make a donation as they are coordinating the Victorian Bushfire Appeal. For the record, people can visit that website at www.redcross.org.au. The first part of the legislative package is an important element in increasing the breadth of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement so that this nonreligious symbol of the red crystal can be used by those organisations which seek to use it. The second part of the legislative package relates to putting in place the legislative underpinning of a commitment made in the May budget last year, and this involves an amendment to the Defence Act 1903. The commitment that was made in the May the budget was of $12.2 million towards a trial for providing GP facilities and certain dental care facilities to the families of ADF personnel at Singleton, Katherine, East Sale, Cairns and Karratha. When ADF personnel are engaged in remote areas, moving from what has previously been their home is often a sacrifice for their families. One of the difficulties that is faced is obtaining medical assistance and medical care, and so a policy was taken to the last election to provide for that. What is in the budget of last year is a trial in relation to those five sites, but it is ultimately with a view to establishing this program for the families of all ADF personnel who are currently in receipt of free health care. This amendment to the Defence Act will provide for the regulations which will allow this commitment to occur. The final part of this legislative package is an amendment to the Defence (Special Undertakings) Act 1952 which will provide for the better safety of the Joint Defence Facility at Pine Gap. In May 2007 a protest occurred at Pine Gap. There have been numerous protests over the years but the protest at Pine Gap in May 2007 resulted in a number of protesters unlawfully entering the grounds in an act of trespass. Those protesters were prosecuted but, in the course of the proceedings for those prosecutions, queries were raised about the legislative ability of the act to provide the basis for a successful prosecution. So this bill seeks to amend the act to make it clear that the Defence (Special Undertakings) Act will be a proper basis for the prosecution of a person unlawfully entering the Joint Defence Facility at Pine Gap. It does that by expanding the constitutional basis of the act. This is important protection for the base. Pine Gap is a facility that was built in 1967. Its activities are confidential but in broad terms they involve the collection of intelligence by technical means as well as providing ballistic missile early warning information. It is a joint facility between the American and the Australian governments and, whilst its activities are confidential, knowledge and concurrence in all the activities which occur at Pine Gap on the part of those Australians who are working at Pine Gap as well as the Australian government is the basis upon which activities are undertaken. That is a very important principle of operation at Pine Gap because it establishes the sovereignty of our country in that facility, something that has often been questioned by those protesting about the facility. The Pine Gap facility contributes greatly to global peace and security through the intelligence gathering at the facility and through the early warning of ballistic missile launches that it provides. It is key to USAustralian military cooperation, a cooperative relationship which unquestionably assists the United States but which is also of enormous benefit to the Australian military in being able to work closely with and, at times, within the US defence forces. It is a very important relationship and forms a key part of the US-Australian alliance. The USAustralian alliance is often formally dated to the commencement of the ANZUS treaty in 1951 or perhaps even earlier, to the famous article of Prime Minister John Curtin in his New Year's message which was published on 27 December 1941, when he described Australia as looking to America in the context of the Second World War. Without question the prosecution of the Pacific theatre of the Second World War, with Douglas MACArthur being based in this country and the close personal relationship between MACArthur and Curtin, which in turn fostered a relationship between the Australian and American governments, was ultimately the basis for the US-Australian alliance. We share key values with the United States of America: a love of human rights, a value of freedom, a system of democracy. The United States is our major economic full partner and we are both engaged in a shared sphere of influence in the world, namely the Pacific. That is evidenced through the shared role that we both played during the Pacific theatre of the Second World War. There is no more important bilateral relationship that this country has than the one that it has with the United States of America. That relationship is a pillar in our foreign policy. Pine Gap is an intrinsic part of that relationship and providing for the security of that base is a very important obligation that our nation has. This bill will enhance our ability to provide security for the base and for those reasons I commend it to the House.",72
36,Mrs GASH,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"The Defence Legislation (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 2008 contains three elements and I will speak briefly on the first and last before my main area of interest-that is, the enhanced medical and dental benefits promised to our Defence Force members and their families by the current government in the course of their election campaign in 2007. The first issue is in relation to the adoption of the emblem described as the red crystal and sometimes referred to as the third Protocol emblem, pursuant to the protocol III amendment to the Geneva conventions. I understand that 28 countries have so far agreed to ratify the convention, but I am open to correction as to an up-to-date number. Nevertheless, the amendment which this bill asks us to ratify for Australia demonstrates a gradual evolution from identifying organisations based on specific cultural or religious origins. The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement uses symbols that reflect religious backgrounds, being a red cross to symbolise the Western world and a red crescent to symbolise the Muslim world. There is no denying that this distinction is causing some difficulties on the international stage, despite the fact that both elements ganisation work towards the same end. My research indicates that there was an attempt to introduce a red shield of David that would represent Israel's humanitarian organisation, but that did not succeed. As an initiative to neutralise these differences so that energies can be focused on the task at hand, the adoption of a universally accepted symbol is a positive move. It allows a third option to be adopted-that is, the symbol of the red crystal. I applaud the convention because it does not seek to overturn the use of either of the existing symbols, which some countries may prefer to continue to use. Without entering into a contentious debate over religious icons, I just say that I support this initiative unreservedly and will move on to the last provision of the bill. I think the critical function that the Pine Gap joint facility plays in Australia's defence structure is self-evident. Since its establishment some 40 years ago, it has sometimes been the focus of groups protesting various military activities related to the United States. That has certainly created some law and order issues, which have led to some legal challenges for the authorities. The provisions in the bill clarify the legal status of the facility and should assist in addressing any grey areas in terms of future legal challenges to its existence. Again, I support the provision. I now move on to the core of my interest in this bill-that is, Labor's 2007 election promise of free medical and dental care for ADF families. It is worthwhile repeating their promise. This is what they said prior to 10 November 2007: ADF families can face significant difficulties obtaining access to general medical and dental care for dependants, especially in regional and remote localities. Posting to a remote location can mean that ADF families struggle to access the sort of health care of the or- that Australians enjoy. A Rudd Labor Government will progressively extend free health care currently provided to ADF personnel to ADF dependent spouses and children. Labor will begin this with a $33.1 million investment starting at 12 Defence Family Health Care Clinics, with a focus on remote bases locations and major regional centres. It cannot get any clearer than that. Moving now to the 2008 budget, Labor's first budget, what do we find? Their absolute promise was downgraded to a trial-so all bets are off. Instead of $33.1 million to give life to their core promise, the promise morphed into $12.2 million over four years to trial the cept. This is tantamount to a breach of fair trading legislation, which outlaws the practice of advertising non-existent bargains. When you go to get the bargain, they have suddenly just sold out and say, ‘How about this other great deal?' The question needs to be asked: what on earth possessed you to make such a core promise when it is clear you had no idea what was involved? If you were so certain that you could state the promise in unequivocal terms then what has happened since? I well remember the Labor candidate for Gilmore making his one and only promise for Gilmore, and that was the free medical and dental services for our Defence Force personnel and families at HMAS Albatross. He made no other undertaking during the campaign, and banking all your chances on a single promise can hardly be described as a challenge. However, there being only one issue for Gilmore does not say much for the importance of the residents of Gilmore to the Labor Party-just one promise, and even that could not be met. I think this broken promise is a serious breach of faith and trust with members of our defence forces and their families. To rub salt into the wound, the government now wants to cut defence jobs. Where is their credibility as far as supporting our troops is concerned? Nevertheless, I am compelled to support this bill-not that I agree with it, but at least something is better than nothing. In these uncertain times, our defence forces are our best insurance policy in protecting Australia's sovereignty. We just deployed a contingent to assist in the Victorian bushfire tragedy, as we have done in countless civilian emergencies in the past. Yet what we are seeing here is the government turning their backs on our defence forces with a broken promise. They want to cut back on spending, and that will certainly conhave an impact on my electorate, not only for defence personnel but also for all the civvy jobs that are reliant on defence. Labor's now broken election promise acknowledged: ADF families can face significant difficulties obtaining access to general medical and dental care for dependents, especially in regional and remote localities. After that admission, why break your promise? The situation has not changed, and it is not the case that since that promise was made pre-November 2007 somehow ADF families no longer face significant difficulties. Gilmore is a garrison town and we are very proud of our defence men and women. HMAS Albatross is essential to our economic well-being. Our men and women are still serving in remote locations and Labor promised a free medical and dental service. The need still exists and that promise must hold. Labor must now explain why they have broken their promise. This breach brings into question Labor's credibility in respect of their relationship with the defence forces. In Gilmore it resurrects the doubt that was created by the dissolution of the Fleet Air Arm, the the civilianisation of the Defence Force under the previous Labor government and what is generally perceived as the antimilitary attitude of some in the Labor Party. I support unreservedly the adoption of the red crystal convention and the enhancement of the legislation affecting the Pine Gap joint facility, but I support with reservations the provisions of this bill that allow only a partial trial of an unequivocal promise. There remain a number of unanswered questions, such as whether these provisions apply to the reserves and whether the families of cadets are included. Can the government provide clarification on how a household will be defined? What will this do to Navy Health and other defence-only private health insurance funds that currently provide reduced health cover for ADF families? Can the government detail what model is to be used to determine dependency? There are more questions that need to be asked and we will certainly be scrutinising even more closely what Labor are actually promising and, more so, whether the government have brazenly adopted Graham Richardson's infamous motto of ‘whatever it takes'. My final question to the government on this matter right now is: will the government provide honest and open detail of the relevant proposed regulations?",75
37,Ms MARINO,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"The Defence Legislation (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 2008 was presented to the House in December 2008 and seeks to make amendments to three separate measures. The Senate has referred this bill to the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade to conduct an inquiry into the three distinct policy measures. It is due to report on 20 February this year. The first of the three measures will amend the Geneva Conventions Act 1957 and the Criminal Code Act 1995 to implement the third protocol to the Geneva conventions in Australian legislation. The second measure will amend section 124 of the Defence Act 1903 to explicitly enable regulations to cover the provision of medical and dental treatment, including pharmaceuticals, to an ADF member or cadet or family member of an ADF member. The third measure amends the Defence (Special Undertakings) Act 1952 to insert a provision for specific arrangements for the joint defence facility at Pine Gap to be a prohibited area. Schedule 1 of the legislation seeks to amend the third protocol of the Geneva Conventions Act 1957 to recognise the red crystal in situations where the red cross could be considered culturally inappropriate, predominantly in Islamic countries. The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement is renowned as an international humanitarian movement with a mission to protect human life and health and to prevent and alleviate human suffering without discrimination based on nationality, race, religious beliefs, class or political opinion. Since its inception, the movement has utilised the red cross and red crescent emblems as devices to protect its medical services, but some countries have found it difficult to identify with the symbols, believing them to have religious significance or meaning. The red crystal emblem has no religious, ethnic, racial, regional or political connotations. The amendment ensures that the new emblem is used only with the consent of the Minister for Defence. The bill also amends the Criminal Code Act 1995 to ensure that the new Geneva emblem is covered by the existing offences relating to the improper use of the emblems of the Geneva conventions. The introduction of an additional neutral protection symbol has been under discussion for a number of years, and the red crystal has been the most popular proposal. This new symbol is referred to as the ‘third protocol emblem' in additional protocol III. It entered into force internationally on 14 January 2007, and in May 2007 protocol III was tabled in parliament. It is now time to take binding treaty action to ratify the protocol. Therefore, this bill incorporates the red crystal emblem along with the existing emblems, the red cross and the red crescent, into Australian statutes. I support schedule 1 of this bill. I also want to take this opportunity to talk about some of the 115 million Red Cross volunteers, particularly those in Australia who do such a wonderful, quiet but invaluable job, as we are seeing in the Victorian bushfires. Tonight I want to focus on the Brunswick Red Cross unit in my electorate, which is the oldest unit in Western Australia having been formed in July 1915 in historic Alverstoke by members of the Clifton family. The unit now has 45 members. While many units in Western Australia are closing owing to a lack of support, especially in wheat belt towns, the Brunswick unit continues to attract members. The Brunswick Red Cross unit has a disaster committee. They are specially trained personnel on standby in an emergency situation to cover registrations and inquiries for disaster affected people and to do tracing if required. The Brunswick group assisted with the 1964 Brunswick floods, the 1979 Cyclone Alby that caused widespread devastation, and the 2002 Bali bombings, organising for clothing and blankets to be sent to Bali for survivors. The Red Cross is always on hand to provide food and assistance for firefighters during the bushfire season, and we are seeing that this week with the hands-on, selfless but vital work of the countless Red Cross volunteers in the Victorian fires. I have no doubt that countless numbers of Red Cross volunteers are working right now across the fire ravaged areas. The Brunswick volunteers are currently working as well with the community in providing information about how south-west residents can donate to the Victorian bushfire appeal. In around 1920, the Red Cross in Brunswick played a vital role in my own life. My mother was a little girl of probably between four and six when her family's farm was razed by fire. One of the vivid memories my mother had was that, because it was wash day, everyone had only one set of clothes as all the washing was on the line. So effectively the little children had no clothing, their house was burnt down as well. It was the Brunswick Red Cross that came to the family's aid and provided the basic, simple things in life to allow the family to go on. The Brunswick Red Cross unit covers the shires of Harvey, Dardanup and Capel, working in conjunction with many organisations offering services during an emergency. Brunswick has several older members and other unit members make certain they are picked up for meetings and outings, because some of these ladies do not have transport, as this allows them to keep in contact and enjoy a social atmosphere away from their homes. The city of Bunbury in my electorate has a Red Cross shop, and volunteers provide a soup patrol, carer support, multiple births support, cosmetic care and Telecross. The towns of Donnybrook, Collie, Augusta and Busselton also have popular Red Cross shops. A blood bank is located in Bunbury, and the van travels to towns all over the South West. Fundraising is still a very important part of Red Cross activities, and door-knocking is coordinated in Queensland. Equally, I am sure the Red Cross units in Queensland are an integral part of the management and support of those affected by the floods. Red Cross units are continually briefed by headquarters on the international activities of the Red Cross and continually receive the latest updates when they attend regional rallies. With regard to schedule 2 in the bill, the intention is to provide a broadening of regulations to cover the provision of medical and dental treatment to an ADF member, cadet or ADF family member. Labor's election promises were very clear, promising free medical and dental care for ADF families, stating that: A Rudd Labor Government will progressively extend free health care currently provided to ADF and personnel to ADF dependent spouses and children. Labor will begin this with a $33.1 million investment starting at 12 Defence Family Health Care Clinics, with a focus on remote bases locations and major regional centres. Instead of honouring this promise to invest $33.1 million to start those 12 defence family healthcare clinics, with a focus on remote base locations and major regional centres, defence families in these limited locations are now having to source their own doctor and dentist. The commitment to provide defence healthcare clinics in Townsville and Darwin has also been scrapped, with the two defence family healthcare clinics promised at Lavarack Barracks in Townsville and Robertson Barracks in Darwin replaced by a plan in which defence families will have to access health department GP Superclinics in Darwin and Townsville. I also note that the government's plan mentions only five of the 10 rural and remote defence locations. I can only conclude that this means it will not deliver on its promise to defence personnel in Townsville, Edinburgh, Elizabeth North, Amberley, Williamtown and Darwin. I am concerned that this bill does not vide details of proposed regulations for the entitlements for family dependants of ADF members, firstly, to be entitled to a standard consultation by a general practitioner for no charge and, secondly, to be entitled to benefits of up to $300 per dependant per annum for basic dental services as stated by the member for Lingiari in October. It is also not clear whether the nature and extent of the medical and dental treatment will be detailed in the proposed regulations or whether it will be left to the discretion of the diarchy or individual service chiefs as is the current case with the relevant defence instructions. In the interest of transparency and accountability it would be preferable that the medical and dental care entitlements be contained in regulations which would be subject to disallowance under the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 rather than in Defence documents such as the defence instructions. The extent of medical and dental treatment, if any, available to persons other than members of the ADF and their families is also not clear. The terms ‘member of the household of the member' and ‘a dependant of the member' are not defined in either the Defence Act or the bill. It is therefore not clear whether the proposed medical and dental treatment could, for instance, be extended to people other than spouses and dependant children who are ‘members of the household of the member'. It would seem to rely on the extent of their dependency. It is not clear whether the member of the household of the ADF member must be totally or need only be partially dependent on the member in order to receive the proposed medical and dental care. With regard to reservists, section 4 of the Defence Act defines a member as including any officer, sailor, soldier or airman. It is not clear whether the bill intends that reserves and their families are to be included in the proclass of persons who will have access to the proposed medical and dental treatment. This is probably unlikely given that in section 4 and elsewhere in the Defence Act-for example, section 58B-a distinction is drawn between the terms ‘member' and ‘member of the reserves'. The legislation amendments deal with the provision of health care to cadets. However the extent of health benefits available to cadets has not been made clear. The government must provide details of the relevant proposed regulations in relation to the the free health care currently provided to ADF personnel and to ADF dependent spouses and children. I have other questions about the lack of detail and explanation-for example, are the families of cadets not currently included in the scheme going to be covered in the future? What are the ramifications for Medicare cover for ADF dependants? Will there be fringe benefits tax to family members? The bill, the EM and the second reading speech are remiss in answering the question of whether reserves and their families will be covered for medical and dental treatment. Under section 4 of the Defence Act 1903 a member includes an officer, sailor, soldier or airman, which would suggest that reserves would be covered. Are reservists and their families going to be included in the provision? And why do families receive preferential treatment over reservists? Why is free health care offered to non-ADF persons before reservists, many of whom are currently serving their country overseas? What are the cost implications of the inclusion of reservists and their families? Also the terms ‘member of the household of the member' and ‘a dependant of the member' are not defined. It is not clear whether the proposed medical and dental dependants could be extended. Can the government detail what the model to be used to determine dependency is? The term ‘member of the family' includes but is not limited member of the household and a dependant of the ADF member or cadet. Can the government provide clarification of how a household will be defined? What will this do to Navy Health and other Defence-only private health insurance funds that currently provide reduced health cover for ADF families? ADF personnel are able to access free medicines through the pharmacies on base. Does this mean that the government's policy will provide for free medicines to ADF families as well, and what are the cost implications of this? Labor's election promise acknowledged that ADF families can face significant difficulties in obtaining access to general medical and dental care for dependants, especially in regional and remote localities. Now that the plan to provide ADF health clinics in these locations has been scrapped, how will the proposed trial where people must source their own GP and dentist help these families? Given that $203 million per year is spent on Defence health, Labor's plan does not come close to delivering on their promise. Also, given the Australian Defence Force is still experiencing some recruitment challenges, this broken promise to ADF families will not assist in attracting people. Labor promised his $33.1 million investment starting with those 12 defence family healthcare clinics, with a focus on remote base locations and major regional centres. The fact is that only $12.2 million over four years is now allocated for a pilot program, and this is $20.9 million short of the election promise. This means that only $2.4 million is allocated for the 2008-09 year. We have only four to five months left out of the year. This is forced savings indeed. Labor's plan for defence acknowledged that posting ADF personnel to remote locations may mean that those families can face significant difficulties obtaining access to general medical and dento a tal care for dependants. I assume the government means those Australians living in metropolitan areas and not those living in regional and rural and remote areas, struggling to access the sort of health care that Australians elsewhere enjoy. I also note that the allocation of $2.4 million limits dental care to $300 per dependant and the families must source their own doctors and dentists. In the five months to 30 June I would be very interested to learn how many ADF families have been able to adequately and regularly access GP services and dental care in these areas. The amendments proposed under schedule 3 in relation to the joint defence facility at Pine Gap will specifically declare the facility a special Defence undertaking and prohibited area directly under the act rather than by the existing process that requires a ministerial declaration and will provide a formal basis for any future prosecutions by removing the opportunity for argument about the validity of the declaration. I support schedule 3 of this act. I would have to add that I strongly support the Australian Defence Force.",77
38,Mr SNOWDON,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"Lingiari-Minister for Defence Science and Personnel) (7.30 pm)I might make an observation about the member for Forrest. I wonder why she voted against the government's stimulus package which put up $241.6 million for Defence Force housing. And why are opposition members in this place and in the Senate opposing this legislation? I note the member for Herbert is not in the House. I understand he is in his electorate in North Queensland dealing with issues to do with the floods. But he, amongst others in this chamber, voted against the government's legislation to provide additional houses for Australian Defence Force personnel. So do not let us hear the member for Forrest and other members of the opposition come in here and say they support Australian Defence Force families when in fact they have voted against a provision which is explicitly designed to provide additional housing for Defence Force families. I will come to some other elements of the opposition's contribution shortly. In summing up the debate on the Defence Legislation (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 2008, I want to begin by thanking all participants, including the member for Forrest and the shadow minister and everyone else in the chamber who spoke on the legislation, for their thoughtful comments and support for this very important legislation. I note that there will be differences, I am encouraged by the fact that the opposition has seen fit to support this bill. The bill makes amendments for three separate measures. The first amendment is to the Geneva Conventions Act 1957 to specifically incorporate a reference to and description of the red crystal emblem and reference to protocol III in part IV of the act, and to annex protocol III as the schedule to that act. The bill further requires amendments to the Criminal Code Act 1995 to specifically incorporate protocol III and the red crystal in the Dictionary to the Criminal Code and to ensure that the improper use of the red crystal is caught by the offence of improper use of the emblems of the Geneva conventions. The amendment also ensures that the new emblem is used only with the consent of the Minister for Defence. The red crystal will be of significant benefit in combat zones in helping secure the safety of eligible humanitarian workers from all countries, regardless of their location or political situation and free of any implication of religious significance. Incorporation of protocol III will be consistent with Australia's long standing support for the Geneva conventions and their additional protocols. The new emblem is unlikely to be used in Australia for either indicative or protective purposes, given the long standing recognition accorded to the red cross emblem. The new emblem may, however, be used by the Australian Defence Force in certain regions overseas. Incorporation would further demonstrate and enhance Australia's credentials in international humanitarian law. It would also enable Australia to encourage states not yet a party to the protocol to ratify it both within our region and beyond. The second amendment relates to the Defence Act 1903 to explicitly enable the making of regulations to cover the provision of but medical and dental treatment, including pharmaceuticals, to an Australian Defence Force member or cadet or a member of the family of an Australian Defence Force member. The amendments to section 124 of the act enable a more comprehensive regime in the Defence Force regulations. The amendments will broaden the regulation-making power to enable the making of regulations to cover the provision of medical and dental treatment, including pharmaceuticals, to an Australian Defence Force member or cadet or a member of the family of an Australian Defence Force member. In relation to pharmaceuticals, it is intended that the regulations will cover the possession, storage, supply, dispensing and administration of scheduled pharmaceuticals by Australian Defence Force pharmacists, medics, nurses and civilian health professionals engaged by the Australian Defence Force. The effect of the amendments will be to create a regime that would ensure that the Australian Defence Force and its members are not hindered in the uniform application of their duties, here and overseas, by competing state and territory laws and will allow the proper embedding of uniform standards and procedures across the Australian Defence Force. The third issue covered in this bill relates to the Defence (Special Undertakings) Act 1952 to explicitly provide that the joint defence facility Pine Gap is a special defence undertaking and a prohibited area, with the insertion of a purposive clause to make it clear that the defence power is not the only constitutional basis relied upon to support the act. These protections are essential to a of such sensitivity and importance to Australia's defence and external relations to deter mischief makers and those with more sinister intent. The importance of this facility I am sure is well understood by those on both sides of this House. The consequences of damage or disruption are grave both in terms of our defence and that of our principal ally, the United States. As such, it would adversely affect our external relations with that country. I once again thank honourable members for their examination of and comments on this bill. I commend it to the House. Before I conclude I want to make some observations about contributions made by members opposite-including the member for Forrest, who scurried out very quickly-in relation to this commitment made at the last election: A Rudd Labor Government will progressively extend free health care currently provided to ADF personnel to ADF dependent spouses and children. This is not a policy that was previously undertaken, advocated or understood by the opposition. It is not something that they went to the last election with. They did nothing about it for the 11 years they were in government. As befits our proposal, announced in the 2008-09 budget and consistent with our policy, we are initiating a pilot of free health care in the regional and remote locations of Singleton, Cairns, Katherine, Sale and the Karratha-Pilbara region. This first stage, which will commence in May this year, will cost $12.2 million over four years. In recognition of our desire to look at other opportunities, in October last year the government announced stage 2, which sees expansion of the trial to Townsville, Darwin and Puckapunyal. This means that we will be helping 16,000 spouses and children through the trial. This second stage will cost an additional $14.4 million in its first year and will facility commence in the second half of 2009. I want to make it very clear that we are committed to this initiative. We have made certain that we will use an approach that looks at developing the best possible way and the most appropriate way of providing these services to Australian Defence Force families. I would ask the opposition that, when they are making observations and commenting about this, at least be factually accurate and understand the intent of what we are trying to do, and perhaps even support the intent of what we are trying to do rather than try to take cheap shots in the way in which they have done this evening in this debate. I understand, despite the rhetoric I used previously, that all sides of this House support the Australian Defence Force, and it is important that we work together to make sure they have the best possible conditions. It is important that we work to make sure that Australian Defence Force families are treated well and we know and believe that the extension of these trials will not only be of great benefit to Australian Defence Force families, but will be supported by them. I commend the legislation to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Third Reading",81
39,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"by leave-I move: That this bill be now read a third time. Question agreed to. Bill read a third time. NA (CARTEL CONDUCT AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2008 Second Reading Debate resumed from 3 December 2008, on motion by Mr Bowen: That this bill be now read a second time.",83
40,Mr HARTSUYKER,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"I welcome the opportunity to speak on this proposed amendment to the Trade Practices Act. The minister, in his second reading speech, noted that competition is the primary means by which consumers get the best possible product or service at the lowest possible price. I think that all members of this House would be in furious agreement with that proposition, with the concept that competition delivers lower prices, better services and a more efficient economy. He also noted that competition enhances Australia's welfare generally because of the efficiencies it creates and which lead to improved productivity and ultimately to increased standards of living. There would be no argument from the opposition with regard to the positive impact of competition on efficiency and our standard of living. Given the minister's support for competition and his acknowledgement of the great benefits of competition for individuals and the general economy, one might ask: why would this same minister introduce the Fuelwatch legislation, which would reduce competition, drive independents out of the market and drive up the price of fuel? Here we have a minister introducing this cartel legislation into the House-the very same minister who brought us the screaming dog that was Fuelwatch. I am delighted that the parliament rejected the Fuelwatch legislation. I am delighted that the parliament rejected the notion of price fixing for 24 hours. What would be the logic of fixing prices for fuel for 24 hours? I put that to one of the ACCC commissioners. I asked: what benefit could there be? Why must prices be fixed for 24 hours? He said that the information is of no use to motorists unless it is actually fixed for 24 hours because, if a motorist saw a particular price, if it was not fixed for 24 hours he could not guarantee he would get that same price when he came back to fill his car up. I would maintain that that statement was nothing more than an unsubstantiated value judgment. I would say that, in any other market, I think it is pretty well universally agreed that price fixing of the nature that was proposed under Fuelwatch would be considered unlawful. If two companies were to engage in such a practice they would be pursued by the ACCC and vilified by the ACCC, but here we had this minister, the minister who has introduced this cartel legislation into the House, being the minister responsible for Fuelwatch-legislation that was clearly anticompetitive and was clearly not in the best interests of the motorists. It was legislation that was designed to be nothing more than a political fix for the Rudd Labor government, for the Prime Minister who made promises on fuel-promises he could not keep, promises he had no intention of keeping, and yet they came up with Fuelwatch. It does seem a strange irony that this minister who sought to introduce that legislation-legislation that would constrain the free market-is here championing this anticartel bill. Let me say at the outset that the coalition supports the broad thrust of the Trade Practices Amendment (Cartel Conduct and Other Measures) Bill 2008 legislation. But we do have reservations with regard to some potential unintended consequences. Regrettably, the government has form in relation to unintended consequences-one needs to look no further than the bungled bank guarantee that was introduced by this government without proper consultation with the Reserve Bank and without carefully thinking through what was a very important decision. As a result, thousands of self-funded retirees and other Australians had their deposits frozen. And why? Because this Prime Minister had to make a quick decision to meet the six o'clock media cycle. These were absolutely outrageous unintended consequences that were very severe for many people out there. So whilst the opposition supports the broad thrust, we are certainly mindful of the potential for this government to deliver legislation that has unintended consequences which could have great adverse effects on Australians. I will revisit the issue of unintended consequences later in my contribution. Criminalising cartel conduct is really about protecting the consumer. It is clear that the penalties available in the past have been inadequate to deter cartel activity of a hardcore nature, and the availability of criminal sanctions should provide a deterrent to those who might engage in such activities. This bill also provides the mechanism through which relevant agencies can use electronic surveillance. This will be useful in prosecuting cartel offences which may, by their nature, be difficult to prove. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, or the OECD, defines hardcore cartel conduct as: … an anticompetitive agreement, anticompetitive concerted practice, or anticompetitive arrangement by competitors to fix prices, make rigged bids (collusive tenders), establish output restrictions or quotas, or share or divide markets by allocating customers, suppliers, territories, or lines of commerce. The OECD considers hardcore cartel conduct the most egregious of violations of competition law in that cartels may injure consumers in many countries by raising prices or restricting supply, perhaps making goods and services unavailable to some consumers and making them unnecessarily expensive to others. Furthermore, the OECD recommended that member companies should ensure that their competition laws effectively halt and deter hardcore cartels. The OECD said, in particular, that their laws should provide for, firstly, effective sanctions of a kind and at a level adequate to deter firms and individuals from participating in such cartels and, secondly, enforcement procedures and institutions with powers adequate to detect and remedy hardcore cartels, including powers to obtain documents and information and to impose penalties for non-compliance. International experience, and experience in Australia, demonstrates the need for effective cartel legislation. There has been a range of high-profile cases in relation to the operation of cartels. We had the global vitamins cartel. Other major cartels included the Spanish sugar cartel, where Spanish sugar prices were for many years five to nine per cent higher than those in the rest of Europe-four different producers received a total of ¼ million in fines. There was the global lysine cartel that doubled the world price of lysine, an amino acid, for three years. There was the global graphite electrodes cartel that affected between $5 billion and $7 billion in sales worldwide, and there was the air cargo cartel which involved our local airline Qantas. By way of an indication of the timeliness of this legislation, it is interesting to note that, today, the ACCC instituted proceedings in the Federal Court against four airlines, seeking penalties for alleged price fixing between 2003 and 2006. The alleged contraventions relate to fuel surcharges applied to the international carriage of air cargo during that period. The airlines which are the subject of the allegations are Air France, KLM, Martinair and Cargolux-major names in the international airline industry. Australia has also experienced local cartel operations, most notably the Visy case, a very high profile and widely documented case in this country. This legislation, in criminalising serious or hardcore cartel behaviour, brings Australia into line with the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom-countries which have similar sanctions in place. This becomes particularly important in a globalised world where businesses and cartels operate across a range of jurisdictions. The legislation before the House makes it an offence for a corporation to make or give effect to a contract, arrangement or understanding between competitors that contains a provision to fix prices, to restrict output, divide or share markets or rig bids. The legislation provides, for an individual, a maximum jail term of 10 years imprisonment and a fine of up to $220,000 and, for a corporation, a fine that is the greater of $10 million or three times the value of the cartel or, where that value cannot be determined, 10 per cent of the turnover. The penalty for individuals brings Australia into line with the penalties of the United States. The amendments to the Trade Practices Act proposed by this bill would make a cartel offence a relevant offence under the Surveillance Devices Act and, although the ACCC is not a law enforcement officer under the Surveillance Devices Act, the amendments to the bill will allow the AFP to obtain a surveillance device warrant to aid in the investigation of cartel conduct. only Amendments to the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979 would facilitate this surveillance. The minister, in his second reading speech, referred to consultation which occurred in relation to the bill, the exposure draft and the period of public consultation, and that it should be said that during that time of public consultation there were significant concerns. The government issued its second cartel conduct exposure draft on 27 October last year, which it indicated would be the final bill. This bill prompted concerns to be raised by competition experts who warned that legitimate commercial arrangements and conduct that are not currently prohibited under the Trade Practices Act might inadvertently be captured as cartel conduct. Competition lawyers complained that the bill was lacking crucial anti-overlap exemptions. Minter Ellison have been reported in the media as saying: … would have had significant consequences for corporate structures and operations that have historically been clearly compliant with the Trade Practices Act. … This would have caused substantial implications for joint ventures, joint buying groups, franchises, co-operatives and any supply arrangements between competitors that contain exclusivity restrictions. Quite clearly there are a range of business operating models that, by necessity, require territories to be divided-not for the purpose of having an adverse effect on the consumer but more for commercial practicality. I think that was a very important observation by Minters. Blake Dawson Waldron partner Peter Armitage said: People could go to prison for entering into pretty ordinary commercial arrangements. That is quite worrying. Competition expert Brent Fisse has been quoted as saying that it is impossible to understand why the government would have omitted the anti-overlap provisions. He also said: The need to introduce cartel offences does not justify amendments to the TPA that are illdesigned and bound to produce unsatisfactory and counterproductive results. The Australian Financial Review, in an editorial, said: The resort to criminal sanctions brings added dangers that innocent company officers, engaged in tough competition, may get caught up in unwarranted legal action that can blacken their reers, even if acquitted. That is one of the real challenges of competition law-that dividing line where rigorous and rugged competition ends and corrupt conduct starts. It can be a grey area and one that legislators have to be very mindful of. The opposition welcomed the amendments which were subsequently made and incorporated in the bill as introduced, which addressed many of the concerns-though some concerns remain. The opposition will be reserving our position on the bill until the Senate Standing Committee on Economics delivers its findings. The final bill, tabled in parliament on 3 December, was accompanied by a memorandum of understanding between the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and the Director of Public Prosecutions. The revised MOU that was introduced set out the respective roles and responsibilities of the ACCC and the DPP in relation to the prosecution of cartel conduct and how the organisations would interact. It is interesting to look at this document, which is entitled ‘Memorandum of Understanding between the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission regarding'-and the next bit is very interesting-‘Serious Cartel Conduct'. But clause 4.3 of the MOU says: The ACCC will not ordinarily refer relatively minor cartel conduct to the DPP for consideration for prosecution. It is a document that says it is in relation to serious cartel conduct, but clause 4.3 says that the ACCC would not ordinarily refer minor cartel conduct to the DPP for prosecution. Certainly the spirit of this legislation is that the criminal sanctions relate to serious, hardcore cartel conduct and that conduct of a minor nature would be dealt with in a civil ca- jurisdiction, not in a criminal jurisdiction. But 4.3 is worryingly ambiguous. Clause 4.4 goes on to say: Referral of possible serious cartel conduct will concentrate upon conduct of the type that can cause large scale or serious economic harm, and the ACCC will have regard to considerations including such as whether: - the conduct was long standing or had, or could have, a significant impact on the market in which the conduct occurred - the conduct caused, or could cause, significant detriment to the public, or a class thereof, or caused, or could cause, significant loss or damage to one or more customers of the alleged participants - one or more of the alleged participants has previously been found by a court to have participated in, or has admitted to participating in, cartel conduct either criminal or civil - the value of the affected commerce exceeded or would exceed $1 million within a 12 month periodwith regard to the combined value of all those involved in the cartel. And the final part of clause 4.4 is: - in the case of bid rigging, the value of the or series of bids exceeded $1 million within a 12 month period. This is of concern to the opposition, with regard to the lack of clarity in the definition of ‘hardcore' and the fact that clause 4.3 of the memorandum of understanding is exceedingly ambiguous where it says that the ACCC would not ordinarily refer relatively minor cartel conduct to the DPP-but it might. That certainly is of concern. I put this thought clearly on the public record and, as I said, the opposition will be waiting for the results of the Senate inquiry into this legislation. Competition policy is vitally important to ensuring that we have an efficient economy that allocates resources effectively and ensures that, if you start a business, you can operate that business in an environment where you are free from illegal competition. It is not about protecting businesses, large or small; it is about protecting competition. When you have a cartel, you have the potential for the community to be paying very substantial additional funds-far more than it should be paying-for a particular good or service. You have the potential for the losses to the community and the loss of efficiency to be very great indeed. So this is very important legislation. That is why the opposition support the broad thrust of the bill. But we are certainly concerned about the issue which I raised about the lack of clarity in relation to that definition. It is something on which we will be waiting for the results of that Senate inquiry. The memorandum of understanding between the DPP and the ACCC is quite an interesting document. It says: Price fixing, market sharing, output control and bid rigging … adversely affect Australia's domestic and international competitiveness. Such conduct harms consumers, businesses and the econbid omy by increasing prices and reducing choice, service, innovation and efficiencies. I think that that opening comment pretty much sums up the intent of the legislation in ensuring that we do not have a situation where cartels are fixing prices, where they are sharing the markets, where they are dividing up the cake and where they are colluding with their mates to get a better deal at the very significant expense of the consumer. It is a very important concept that Australia may well be a less efficient country and have a less efficient economy because of the actions of cartels. I believe that the community will welcome this legislation. I believe that if an executive from the big end of town is ripping off the Australian public, he should face the consequences. If someone goes into a 727 store and robs the till of $1,000, he would go to jail. But without criminal sanctions against serious cartel conduct, a cartel could rip off the 727 chain for $50 million and the executives of the cartel who are conducting the operation would not go to jail. There is a question of equity here: robbing a store through the front door by stealing the money out of the till is a crime; robbing the store through the loading dock-effectively taking money and causing consumers to pay more than they otherwise would for a particular product by making the 727 chain, for example, pay more than they need-is not a crime. This bill not only puts us into line with Canada, the UK and the US but it also meets community expectations. Cartel crooks deserve to go to jail, and people involved in the legal system need clarity. That is why the opposition was keen to see the issue of the definition of hardcore cartel conduct considered. That is why we raised that concernbecause cartels have the potential to seriously disadvantage the interests of consumers. Cartels have the ability to make consumers pay more than they need to for a particular product. Cartel activity can cause substantial inefficiencies in the market. As I have said, we certainly support the thrust of the legislation and we await the outcome of the Senate inquiry.",83
41,Mr BUTLER,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"I rise to speak in support of the Trade Practices Amendment (Cartel Conduct and Other Measures) Bill 2008. Cartels are the white-collar version of organised crime. Essentially they represent companies colluding to squeeze undue profit from their customers and other businesses by market sharing, bid rigging, restricting output and fixing prices. Whilst their covert nature makes it difficult to determine their true impact, it is estimated that cartel behaviour causes prices to rise by 10 per cent on average, costing billions of dollars across the globe. Cartel conduct is theft, and this legislation is long overdue. Due to the need for secrecy and containment, cartels tend to arise in industries with few competitors. Our small markets and concentrated industries make us in Australia particularly susceptible. Cartel conduct can come in many guises. For example, three major companies in our freight industry were eventually fined $11 million for a price fixing and market sharing scam that lasted for 20 years. One aspect of the deal involved customers having their freight deliberately lost or damaged if they shifted companies from the one they had been secretly allocated. It is vital that Australia is armed strong legislation to tackle this scourge. Globalisation has ensured that borders do not contain or constrain cartels, and we must have a global response both with the sharing of information and the enacting of tough legislation. An international vitamin cartel ating in the 1990s was estimated to have affected about US$20 billion worth of business globally. Criminal prosecutions were brought in a number of countries. In Australia in 2006, criminal proceedings were not an option but an indication of the cartel's damaging effect was the class action brought against three multinational pharmaceutical companies for animal vitamin price-fixing being settled for $30.5 million. We are now in a global economic and financial crisis on a scale not seen since the Great Depression. Whilst this government will do all it can to shield our country from the effects of recession, our economy does not operate in a bubble. Both internationally and locally the pressure for profits is increasing and likewise the temptation to boost those profits through cartel behaviour. Deceptive practices that raise costs for consumers and other businesses are always reprehensible, but to distort the market through artificial prices at a time of economic vulnerability is particularly dangerous. Living costs are increased by inflated prices and small businesses are strangled. On a broader scale, anticompetitive behaviour encourages a sluggish attitude to business. Captive profits reduce the drive for efficiency and innovation, leading to decreased international competitiveness and stifled growth. It is vital that we act now by sending out a clear message to business that cartels will not be tolerated, investigative powers will be effective, and penalties will be harsh. This bill, long overdue, will do just that. In 1998, the OECD issued recommendawith tions to all member countries for effective action against hardcore, or what we term serious, cartels. Recognising the need for concerted international action to halt and deter what the OECD called ‘the most egregious violations of competition law', it was operrecommended that member countries ensure that their laws provide, in particular, effective sanctions and adequate enforcement procedures. When he was the ACCC Chairman back in 2002, Professor Allan Fels proposed introducing jail terms for serious cartel conduct. Cartels are created and maintained by the actions of individuals. These are not legitimate actions on behalf of shareholders. This is unlawful behaviour with direct personal gain in the form of increased bonuses, salaries and influence lurking behind fraudulently obtained corporate profits. Restricting cartel prosecution to the civil arena means that penalties are limited to the financial. Corporations can find ways to restore the money levied on their executives in fines, damages or costs. What they cannot do is find ways to restore their liberty. For deterneed rence to be effective, the punishment must be meaningful. Australia's biggest detected cartel case so far provides a good illustration. Between 2000 and 2005 two major companies in the cardboard industry were estimated to have overcharged businesses by around $700 million. In 2007, the company that did not blow the whistle attracted individual and corporate penalties of around $40 million. The company admitted that it would cover the fine levied on the CEO; the other individual fined was the billionaire owner. In January 2003 the OECD recommended criminal sanctions if they were consistent with the nation's social and legal norms. In Australia an individual can be jailed for welfare fraud or tax evasion, yet the scale of their theft is minuscule when compared to that perpetrated by a serious cartel. Jail sentences already exist for other white-collar crimes. It is entirely consistent with our social and legal norms-to use the terms of the OECD recommendation-to apply criminal sanctions to those who steal through manipulation of the market. In 2003 the Dawson review of competition provisions in the Trade Practices Act added its weight to the calls of the ACCC and the OECD. It recognised that growing international experience showed that criminal sanctions provided effective deterrence for serious cartel conduct and recommended their introduction in Australia. In 2005 the then Treasurer, the member for Higgins, finally announced that the Howard government would introduce criminal penalties for serious cartel conduct. This announcement proved as sincere as the promise of no GST. Despite 15 separate warnings from the ACCC, despite repeated calls from the OECD, despite our responsibilities as an OECD member state, despite other nations toughening their legislation and despite the to protect Australians from this extortionate practice, the coalition failed to act. Now, a decade on from the initial OECD recommendations, there can be no more excuses for dragging our feet on this important reform. Cartel conduct is notoriously difficult to detect and successfully prosecute. Strong deterrent measures, combined with effective powers for investigation, are vital to give the clearest possible message to the international business community, as well as our own business community, that Australia will not tolerate cartel activity. In line with the ALP's election commitments, we released a draft bill in January last year. The amendments in this bill reflect an extensive consultation process with industry experts and the consideration of international best practice. Persons involved in serious cartel conduct will now face both criminal charges and civil sanctions, with protections against double jeopardy incorporated into the Trade Practices Act. In recognition of the need for strong deterrence, and in concert with US practice, this bill doubles the proposed maximum jail term to 10 years for serious cartel conduct. We already have the same jail term for the protection of body corporates against fraud, deceit and the fraudulent appropriation of property by their employees. Consumers and other businesses deserve no less. Unlike our predecessors, we believe it is a contradiction in terms to claim that an individual who engages in serious cartel conduct can also be a good citizen. This sort of message that actively encourages cartel conduct. The outward respectability of those who engage in cartel conduct should never be an excuse to whitewash unlawful activity predicated on greed and deceit. One of the strongest weapons that enforcers of anti-cartel laws can use is whistleblower knowledge. This bill provides for protection of cartel information provided by whistleblowers as well as immunity, with some clear provisos, from civil and criminal prosecution for the first active member of a cartel to come forward. Those who hesitate stand to lose much more than their reputation, and expectations are that the strength this legislation will bring an early rush of confessions. A memorandum of understanding between the Department of Public Prosecutions and the ACCC provides clarity for whistleblowers by ensuring a uniform approach to immunity and leniency between the civil and criminal provisions. This bill improves enforcement measures by removing the requirement that an offender acted dishonestly. The Dawson review had expressed concern that proving dishonesty beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury was so difficult that it would weaken enforcement. The ordinary criminal fault elements of intention, knowledge or belief will apply instead. This is in line with international best practice. The only other jurisdiction that the dishonesty defence is the UK, and its own experts cite that as a reason for its poor conviction rates. Another key enforcement measure introduced by this bill is enforcers having the power to use, amongst their tools, telecommunications interception for detecting possible breaches of the law and identifying the main players. The 10-year jail term brings the cartel offences within the threshold for is exactly the the use of such powers. This bill does not endanger legitimate business operations. Joint ventures are protected. It clarifies what constitutes a cartel provision within a contract, arrangement or understanding and requires the satisfaction of two alternative tests, as well as threshold requirements for a requisite level of competition. Serious cartel conduct is an unfortunate reality in our market and one that costs consumers, other businesses and our market economy heavily. In tough financial times, the incentive to engage in this form of theft is even higher than usual and we must not of delay in implementing this long overdue legislation. I strongly commend the bill to the House.",88
42,Mrs MOYLAN,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the Trade Practices Amendment (Cartel Conduct and Other Measures) Bill 2008. It is an important piece of legislation. It is legislation that has evolved over a long period of time, it has been the subject of much debate and academic interest and yet it is legislation that remains vexed and problematic. This legislation is aimed at criminalising serious cartel conduct; it is aimed at protecting the consumer. That is a commendable goal and, indeed, the overarching concern to protect the consumer should lie at the centre of all debates surrounding this bill. But a uses commendable goal is not enough to make inherently worthy legislation. This bill should be supported on the grounds that it has the potential to reduce consumer harm, but it is also necessary that it be subject to stringent review and further debate. Having perused some of the submissions to the Senate Standing Committee on Economics regarding this bill, I can say that it clear that there are still stakeholders with considerable reservations, and these reservations warrant discussion. In one such submission, it was stated: The need to introduce cartel offences does not justify amendments to the TPA that are illdesigned and bound to produce unsatisfactory counterproductive results. That said, those who set out to deliberately manipulate the market to disadvantage their consumers and to make dishonest personal gain should be punished-businesses that practice anticompetitive conduct contrary to the central notions of our economy. However, the process of criminalising cartel conduct is not straightforward. It is extremely complicated and requires not just a deep understanding of the law and the Trade Practices Act but also innate awareness of Australian business practices and needs. It is the complexity of this reform that prevented its earlier introduction. Despite the lengthy consultation period in government deliberations, this bill continues to have significant flaws. The bill that is fore us is of a lesser standard than should be expected with such an important and far-reaching change to the existing law. It has been rushed and it shows the government's neglect in failing to properly consider the issues and opinions surrounding the criminalisation of cartel conduct. There is a host of issues concerning this bill-issues that I am sure will be discussed further within the Senate committee review relating to the technicalities of this law. I am not a lawyer, but I do have significant experience in business-and, indeed, in business law-so I will focus on those issues which I believe are going to affect the Australian business community. Firstly, the broad and ambiguous drafting of this bill will surely create uncertainty for businesses curis rently conducting legitimate, procompetitive transactions that will, under this bill, expose them to criminal liability. Secondly, the penalty regime that has been amended in the version of the bill before us poses serious questions of inconsistency. The process to criminalise cartel conduct and began in 1998 with the OECD recommendation that members ‘ensure that their laws adequately prohibit such cartels and that they provide for effective sanctions, enforcement procedures and investigative tools with which to combat them'. In this respect the OECD was referring to ‘hard-core' or serious cartel conduct, which includes such practices as price-fixing, bid-rigging, output restriction and horizontal market sharing. In the case of ACCC v Visy Industry Holdings Pty Ltd No. 3, Justice Heerey noted: The whole point of price fixing and market sharing is to obtain the benefit of prices greater than those which would be obtained in a competitive market. It must follow that customers pay more than they would in a competitive market, and so suffer loss. be- The coalition strongly believes that protection of the consumer should be the driving consideration behind this amendment to the Trade Practices Act. I believe that there is bipartisan support to pursue criminal sanctions for those involved in serious cartel conduct. It is important to remember that this bill was targeted at criminalising only serious anticompetitive behaviour. However, there has been much commentary on the fact that the government has now taken an overzealous and, in some cases, a hurried approach. The approach taken within this bill to broadly define offences and then provide specific defences poses a number of problems. Having been involved in business and having previously been the shadow minister for small business, I am acutely aware of the risk that legitimate, innocuous commercial transactions that have not been foreseen in the drafting of this bill will become illegal. I am also aware that the broad drafting style is a contravention of good legislative practice and will open up an extremely wide discretion for the ACCC. With so many commercial transactions at risk of prosecution under this bill, the ACCC will be forced to decide which transactions to pursue. Of those that are pursued, the ACCC will then need to decide which are so serious as to attract criminal liability and those that are worth pursuing for civil remedy. One does not need to contemplate too hard to see that this wide level of discretion has the potential to create enormous uncertainty within the Australian business community. We cannot attempt to map out new offences and not clearly delineate where the proper boundaries lie. In response to the draft legislation, the American Bar Association noted: In a world of ever-increasing regulatory complexity, the distinction between criminal and civil matters is not always as clear as it should that lack of clarity creates unnecessary risks and can lead to potentially devastating costs. In this time of unprecedented uncertainty for business, we cannot allow any confusion surrounding new legislation to cause businesses to stop conducting legitimate commercial transactions for fear that they will be found outside the blurred boundaries that the ACCC will, in time, decide. There is a real risk that businesses will cease worthwhile trading and err on the conservative side of caution, losing out at the hands of the government's hastily designed and poorly articulated legislation. The government, which was democratically elected, has a responsibility to make laws, to determine what constitutes criminal behaviour and not to abdicate such powers to a body such as the ACCC. The issue with drafting has been described well in a quote in the Australian newspaper by a partner at Mallesons Stephen Jaques: The attempt to cover all cartel conduct means we've ended up with a fairly complex and prescriptive bill, which may catch some things that shouldn't be caught … There are legitimate business practices that are going to be put into doubt by the very breadth of these provisions. Australia needs to have laws which can effectively deter serious cartel conduct. As businesses continue to spread their operations outside of national boundaries, it is more important than ever that our laws do not provide a safe haven for international cartel conduct or tempt businesses into such conduct with soft, lackadaisical prosecution. The penalties for such conduct must serve as a punishment but, more importantly, as a deterrent, and Australia must present itself on an international stage as a country which will not tolerate serious cartel conduct. In the draft exposure bill and discussion be, and paper released on 11 January 2008, the maximum jail term envisaged for individuals found guilty of serious cartel conduct was five years. This has since been increased to a 10-year jail term. The Assistant Treasurer and the Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs stated that this increase was to ‘send a clear message about cartel conduct'. I find it somewhat misleading that the government can purport that ‘together with the United States, that 10-year jail term puts Australia at the forefront in fighting illegal cartels'. While it may be true on paper that the United States is the only other jurisdiction with a maximum jail term of 10 years, one cannot assume that the practical application of these penalties will be comparable. The Dawson review noted that in the United States plea bargaining is used to settle the majority of cartel cases. Plea bargaining is uncommon in Australia and indemnities against prosecution are rarely issued as they are in the United States. The Dawson review noted that in 2000, 18 individuals were imprisoned under the United States anti-cartel laws for an average of just eight monthssome deterrent! Most other OECD members have a maximum penalty ranging from three to five years imprisonment. The government's attempts to legitimise the criminal penalty of 10 years imprisonment for individuals-double what was recommended by the Dawson reviewon the back of a United States precedent is wholly misguided, not to mention misleading. Imprisonment is used as a penalty in this context to be a deterrent. It would seem that the ACCC submission to the Dawson review recommending that the term of imprisonment be seven years maximum is quite fitting for this offence. The penalty should also ensure that the proposed amendment to the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act would remain viable, as the penalty will still be serious enough to warrant the additional investigatory powers. I support the prosecution of those individuals and companies involved in serious cartel conduct. Their behaviour is designed to create a benefit for themselves at the expense of the consumer and the market. But I cannot withhold my reservations about a bill that will have the practical effect of exposing Australian businesses that are legitimately conducting their affairs with no ill intention, dishonest motives or desire to manipulate the market in an unconscionable manner to the risk of criminal liability. That is my concern, and I think it is a legitimate concern. This bill has been a long time in the making. The coalition, when in government, spent a number of years ensuring that, when legislation to criminalise cartel conduct was introduced, it would be legislation that would appropriately address the distinction between criminal and civil conduct and do so with minimal impact on the majority Australian businesses that operate within full compliance of the law. On the other hand, this bill shows clear signs of having been rushed. Criminalising cartel conduct is not as easy as the Labor Party may have envisaged when they promised to do it within the first year of being elected to government. This promise was populist-made in the heady wave of momentum less than 24 hours after Visy's Richard Pratt made a guilty plea in by far the biggest cartel case ever conducted in Australia. Having been swept away in the excitement of this high profile case, the government have since found themselves struggling to uphold unrealistic and empty promises. The promise to introduce legislation of this nature within 12 months of election is surely a promise that could only be made by a party with little understanding of the concerns of the Australian business community and with little understanding of the reality of legislating on such complex matters. On the same day that the Labor Party condemned themselves to a year of rushing through complex and important legislation, the former Treasurer, the member for Higgins, said: … the Government has been consulting very carefully. But you have to be careful here, to make sure that when conduct passes from civil to criminal the lines of demarcation are quite clear. And it's quite technical and it's very, very important to get the consultation right and to draw the statute accordingly. The member for Higgins' appreciation of the complexities of this legislation is a testament to his experience and his deep understanding of the needsDebate interrupted. NA",90
43,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 8.30 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Victorian Bushfires Solomon Electorate",94
44,Mr HALE,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise today to offer my condolences to the people who have felt the full brunt of Mother Nature's fury over the past few days in the great state of Victoria. The people I so proudly represent in this place, the people of Solomon, have had their own history of natural disaster and mass human suffering. On their behalf, I say this to the people of Victoria: our hearts go out to you at this terrible time. You have suffered more than any human beings deserve to suffer. Our thoughts are with you as you wait for news of your loved ones who have not been accounted for, as you learn of your loved ones who did not make it and as the realisation comes of the valuable lifelong possessions, family homes and much loved pets that have been lost. It is my hope that you feel the arms of the entire country wrapped around you. The hurt I feel in my heart for you is equalled by the hurt felt by my people back in Darwin and Palmerston. I have had many emails and phone calls from my people offering support. While we can understand to a point, none of us will really know the horror that was bestowed on you and your communities. Last week the Prime Minister and the Treasurer announced a plan that delivered a welcome investment to local infrastructure and to support jobs in Darwin and Palmerston. This plan strikes the right balance between supporting growth and jobs now and delivering the investments needed to strengthen the economy for the long term. In the past four months, the outlook for the global economy has deteriorated significantly, with the IMF now forecasting a deep global recession. The global slowdown has driven almost all major advanced economies into recession, including those of the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan and Europe. China and India are now also slowing sharply and the global mining boom which has provided a big stimulus to Australia's growth in recent years is unwinding. Faced with this situation, the Australian government had a choice. The first option was to do nothing and let the market rip. The second was to act now to support jobs and growth. The Rudd government is committed to the latter-that is, when the markets have failed the government must intervene and support jobs and growth. The plan will deliver almost $30 billion in direct investment into schools, housing and roads as well as other essential local infrastructure. It also includes almost $3 billion in temporary tax rebate expansion for small business to encourage private sector investment. Over 6,000 families in Darwin and Palmerston will receive a back-to-school bonus of $950 to help with the cost of kids returning to school. Over 2,000 students and people looking for work in Solomon will receive a training and learning bonus of $950 to support their study costs. Every one of our hard working primary schools-some 41 of them-will have capital funding provided for essential new buildings and upgrades. At Lyons, 185 new Defence houses will be built, which will have a positive flow-on effect for the rental market. There will be a $1,600 rebate for solar panel installation which is not subject to means testing. National programs include an additional $30 million in 2008-09 and $60 million in 2009-10 which will be allocated to an extended coverage of the Black Spot Program. As the chairman of the NT black spots committee I know that this additional funding will be extremely welcome and it will save lives. The plan is also to provide an additional $500 million over two years to expand the Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program strategic projects. This program invests in community infrastructure such as town halls, libraries, community centres and sports centres, something I know the hard working lord mayors of Darwin and Palmerston will be very excited about sharing in. The initiative also provides funding of $6 billion over 3½ years for the construction of new social housing and a further $400 million over two years for repairs and maintenance to existing public housing dwellings. This will help stimulate businesses which supply construction materials and help to retain jobs in the industry, something I know my mates in the building game are very happy about. The Nation Building and Jobs Plan is a decisive action to support and bolster the economy in the short term. More importantly, it will also lay the groundwork for the stronger economy when we emerge from the global recession. I would like to also take this opportunity to acknowledge all the speakers in the last two days, led by the Deputy Prime Minister, who was fantastic yesterday, and the Leader of the Opposition. The contribution today from all speakers was excellent under very trying and difficult circumstances. It shows that all members of this House-150 of us-care for the nation. There has been a fantastically united, sombre feel in the House and I would like to acknowledge those speakers. Mr William Marshall OAM",94
45,Mr MORRISON,ADJOURNMENT,"In these last few dreadful days, we have rightly spent much time paying tribute to the service of so many selfless and dedicated Australians who choose to stand in harm's way, on our behalf, to protect life itself. As it says in the Scriptures, greater love has no-one than the one who will lay down their life for another. It is therefore fitting to have this opportunity this evening to pay tribute to a giant of a man who similarly committed himself to a lifetime of vigilance and service for his community in our Sutherland shire. The late William George Marshall OAM, patron of his beloved Cronulla Surf Club for 21 years and a member of that club for 66 years, passed away on 30 December 2008. As I attended the crowded memorial service in January along with the hundreds of people who came in his honour, it was not just his extraordinary service to surf-lifesaving that was on display. Bill's was a rich life. Bill was a loving husband, a devoted father and an adoring grandfather. His story is like that of many of his generation and those who came before him of similar mould, who built our local community in the Sutherland shire. Their modesty, humility, dedication, sense of duty to others and above all their absolute and unwavering commitment to make a better life for their children and community defined their lives, and in Bill's life this was particularly the case. It provides a path for all of us who now seek to follow. It was said of Bill that he had a wonderful ability to inspire others to be better people. I can think of no better tribute. The tender stories of Bill's family recounted by his daughter Vanessa at the memorial service were incredibly moving. They spoke of a family home created by Bill and his loving wife, Faye, that I would hope all Australians could know-a home of warmth, love and generosity in which children were truly valued. It was said that family always came first for Bill-but, as his wife recounted at the service, ‘not quite always, particularly if there was a carnival on'. The other side of Bill's tremendous story was his love and passion for surf-lifesaving. Bill was not someone who was involved in surf-lifesaving. Bill was surf-lifesaving in the Shire and, more specifically, in the Bate Bay clubs, having joined the Cronulla club at age 15 during the war years, gaining his bronze medallion-No. 18891-in December 1943 and continuing in membership for a total of 66 years. Bill would probably take issue with this tribute as he always believed that the club was bigger than the man, but there was no mistaking the importance of Bill's contribution to all those who gathered to celebrate his memory in January. Prior to the service Bill's coffin was placed in a surf boat-at his direction, and much to Faye's indignation at the time of the planning-for a final salute across Bate Bay and each of the four clubs. The procession proceeded back onto land and by road up the Kingsway to the Shirelive Church at Sutherland, where he entered via an honour guard in a procession led by Club President Greg Holland and my local pastor, Michael Murphy. His casket was laid at the front of the church in another surf boat suitably named in his honour and positioned between the flags. Bill's extraordinary contributions to surflifesaving were acknowledged at all levels: national, state, branch, district and club. served in many capacities through his career in surf-lifesaving, and they are too numerous to mention here. At Cronulla he was club captain, club president and esteemed patron for 21 years. He played an important role in the support and membership of each of the other Bate Bay clubs-namely, North Cronulla, Elouera and Wanda. Bill held many senior and executive posts at branch, state and national levels, including five years as president of the Sydney branch, of which he later became patron after the sad passing of the late Bill Singleton, also from the Shire, whom I had the opportunity to honour in this place last year. For his contribution to surf-lifesaving Bill was awarded life membership of his club in 1958, his branch in 1979, his state in 1982 and at a national level in 1987. He was awarded a world lifesaving certificate of merit in 1983, and in 1996 his many years of service were recognised with the award of the Medal of the Order of Australia. However, he will probably be most remembered for the crowning legacy of completing the centenary history of his club, which was published and launched by Governor Marie Bashir on the eve of the November 2007 election. At Bill's memorial service Barry Ezzy said farewell as a lifelong mate and friend of Bill, while Ken English, a life member of Cronulla and Sydney branches, concluded his tribute to Bill in saying: Bill will no longer feel the sand between his toes from his beloved Cronulla beach … but he can rest peacefully, safe in the knowledge that he has completed his patrol with the vigilance and service required of an Australian Surf Life Saver. Franklin Electorate: Health Services",95
46,Ms COLLINS,ADJOURNMENT,"I start by adding my voice to the many condolences today for those in Victoria who have Bill had a harrowing few days. Our thoughts and sympathies are with them. I will talk more about that situation in the debate on the condolence motion in the Main Committee. I now want to talk about some health initiatives in my electorate of Franklin. It was my pleasure a week or so ago to announce over $400,000 going to a small community in my electorate for rural health. It came from the National Rural and Remote Health Infrastructure Program, which is a result of the government's election commitment to reform the Rural Medical Infrastructure Fund. The government is committed to improving important projects in rural and regional communities. We all know the importance of those projects, particularly as they have been highlighted to us in the last few days. The National Rural and Remote Health Infrastructure Program was funded in the budget and there will be $46 million over four years to provide rural and remote communities with strategic planning for small rural private hospitals. This is to improve health services by funding projects where a lack of infrastructure is a barrier to the lishment of new health services. I was recently talking to one of my local councils, the Huon Valley Council in southern Tasmania, about some issues that they have had with GPs and retaining GP services. A GP recently retired in the small town of Geeveston, and attracting other GPs to the area was causing them great difficulty. The money that we have announced will give them a real boost and help improve the Geeveston Medical Centre. Improvements were undertaken by the council that are quite extensive, including things like home visits, hospital and nursing home visits, family planning, antenatal care, cardiac monitoring, hearing tests, counselling, vaccinations, childhood immunisations, minor surgical procedures, sports medicine, nutritional advice and others. The new medical centre, as I said, was left to fill the gap left by a doctor retiring. Because of this new medical centre and the funding that it has received, the council has been able to attract two new GPs from overseas to the area. That has really expanded the services available to the local community and has been a great success. As I said, they were able to recruit these doctors from overseas to service the local community when the local GP retired. Some of the money will also be going to the Esperance Multi Purpose Health Centre in Dover. They are going to make some improvements there, including additional consulting rooms, improved waiting areas for patients, improved reception areas for visitors and patients, separate ensuites in the two acute care rooms, rearrangement of consulting rooms and construction of a new staff room to cater for training requirements. There will be new equipment purchased, including new electric beds, an overhead lifting system for patients, medical equipment, an examination bed for an emergency room as well as other furnishings and mediestabcal equipment. The multipurpose centre at Dover, as its name suggests, is multipurpose. The facility will also provide residential aged care, acute care for inpatients and outpatients, respite services, independent unit accommodation for the elderly, a private GP medical practice and rooms for visiting health professionals. A palliative care facility is also due to open in March this year and will provide a much needed service to those in the area. So there have been improvements at Geeveston and at the Esperance Multi Purpose Health Centre in Dover, which is about an hour's drive from Hobart. It is quite a rural community that really needs this funding and infrastructure. I was really pleased to be able to provide that support to the local community with the recent announcement. Initiatives like these support and build local communities, and I was very proud to be a part of that announcement. The other initiative in my electorate that I wanted to talk about just quickly was the GP super clinic. The federal government has recently signed off to the state government on the GP Superclinic; $5.5 million will come from the federal government and money will also be coming from the state government. This initiative has been very well received. The federal government carried out consultations last year, and there will be a whole heap of services provided at the new GP Superclinic. It will provide multiprofessional care, bringing together health professionals from general practice, community health and allied health services. much-needed facility in my electorate. It was very well received as an election commitment and I am very proud to deliver on that election commitment. The GP Superclinic will be part of an integrated care centre that the state government will build. This has been a very important health win for the people of Franklin.

47,Mrs MARKUS,ADJOURNMENT,"Greenway) (8.45 pm)Today I would like to momentarily focus on Victoria and what is facing all of Australia. There is a deep sense of grief and loss, and there are many questions still to be answered. For all Australians it is a time when compassion and offers of practical help are pouring out towards Victorians. I think it is important that we continue to pray and support them in whatever way possible. Today is also a date when we need to acknowledge the very important and tragic event that happened to the people on the HMAS Voyager and the HMAS Melbourne some 45 years ago. Today there is also a deep sense of loss which has been ongoing for many years. Today we remember the loss of 82 lives on the HMAS Voyager, which sank on the night of 10 February 1964, some 45 years ago. The destroyer Voyager was operating as ‘rescue destroyer' for night flying operations just off Jervis Bay in New South Wales when she collided with the aircraft carrier HMAS Melbourne. The Voyager was cut in two. The bow section sank almost immediately while the stern section remained on the surface for several hours. There was great bravery on that night. I would particularly like to highlight the ery of one man. I mention Chief Petty Officer Jonathan Rogers, who was serving on the Voyager. The story of his courage is well told in the Australian War Memorial's ‘Fifty AusIt is a tralians'. It reads: Rogers was one of more than 50 men trapped in darkness in a compartment of the sinking forward section. He took control and tried to bring calm in the disastrous situation. He probably realised that not all would be able to get through a small escape hatch and that he, being a large man, had no chance at all. “He was more intent on getting the younger chaps out first,” said a survivor. The forward section finally sank about ten minutes after the impact. Rogers was heard leading his remaining doomed comrades in a prayer and a hymn during their final moments. Rogers was later awarded the George Cross, the highest bravery award then available in peacetime, “for organising the escape of as many as possible and encouraging … those few who could not escape … to meet death alongside himself with dignity and honour”. As we reflect today we must also remember that for 45 years the survivors have had to deal with loss. I refer to those men on the Voyager and the Melbourne and their families and friends who were left behind. The collision of the Melbourne and the Voyager is an example of the sad and too common occurrence of lives being lost in the service of Australia during peacetime. It is also a reminder that we must constantly strive to do better for all our young men and women in the Australian Defence Force and their families in both war and peacetime. We must remember them, we must honour them and it is important that we never forget. Page Electorate: Workplace Relations",98
48,Ms SAFFIN,ADJOURNMENT,"I express my sympathy, strong support and solidarity to all people grieving and suffering as a result of the catastrophic Victorian bushfires, brav- and I will say more on that later when I speak on the condolence motion. Re-establishing fairness to Australian workplaces was one of the hallmarks of the Rudd Labor government, so when I hear of workers in my electorate of Page being treated more like cattle than people it makes my blood boil. One of my first jobs after leaving school in Ipswich was as an abattoir hand. It was hard, physical and sometimes dangerous work. On staggered days last year-28 November, 1 December and 2 December-up to 23 employees turned up to a south Grafton abattoir for work to be told by embarrassed foremen that they were out of a job due to ‘a WorkCover thing'. They were handed a week's pay, shown the gate and thrown out on Armidale Road to uncertain futures. Appallingly, they did not receive their rightful entitlements: termination pay, redundancy, annual leave and long servicenothing. Coming up to Christmas, with mortgages to service, bills to pay and presents to buy, this was a very cruel, bloodyminded and gutless way to treat employees, some of whom had been veterans of the slaughter floor. All of these workers tell me they were employed by Tempus Holdings Pty Ltd, a labour hire company that provided labour to abattoir owner Stuart Ramsey's company Ramsey Food Processing Pty Ltd. The sacked workers were informed in writing that Tempus Holdings would on 28 November 2008 cease to be a labour hire company supplying labour for Ramsey Food Processing Pty Ltd. The local Daily Examiner newspaper, which has been championing the plight of the affected workers and their right to entitlements, has repeatedly asked Stuart Ramsey, Tempus Holdings director Michael Considine and their solicitors about the complex corporate structure attached to the abatentitlements toir. The Daily Examiner's inquiries have been met by silence and stonewalling. I have twice written to Mr Ramsey, on 12 December and 12 January, on behalf of my constituents seeking clarification on exactly who is responsible for paying the sacked workers their outstanding entitlements, but I have had no response to date. My constituents have names and they are happy to be mentioned in this House. Robert Baker, 57, of Grafton was a level 5 slaughterman and had worked at the abattoir as far back as 1970. Robert estimates that he could be owed $40,000 in entitlements. He hurt his lower back in 2006 and was on reduced hours under WorkCover before he was sacked. Paul Lumley, 44, of Grafton was a level 4 slaughterfloor labourer who had been at the abattoir since 1994. He is owed $20,000. Paul had lodged a claim with the Workplace Ombudsman against Tempus Holdings for unauthorised pay deductions. He believes this was the reason for his dismissal. Grant Tomlinson, 44, of Waterview Heights was also an experienced abattoir worker-working there for 10 years in all. An injury to his left shoulder on the slaughterfloor in 2005 meant he was on light duties under WorkCover; but, as he put it, there are no light duties in an abattoir. I can attest to that. Supporting a partner and a 10-year-old child, Grant is owed about $3,000. John Woods, 29, of Westlawn in Grafton was at Ramsey's for three years, working as a labourer and knifehand. He badly tore tendons in his right shoulder about nine months ago, an injury requiring an operation in Coffs Harbour Base Hospital. John was off work for two months but was gradually building up his hours under WorkCover. He had just signed a contract to buy a new $25,000 car before his sacking on 1 December. John has a partner and two-year-old daughter to support at home and could do with the $5,000 in that he is owed. Paul Windler, 41, of South Grafton had been at the abattoir for a year. He did the dangerous job of operating the bandsaw in the small boning room. He hyperextended his right wrist in an accident last September and went to Grafton Base Hospital for treatment. Paul developed tendonitis in his wrist but went back to work on the bandsaw. He is chasing $3,000 in entitlements. I have arranged for any sacked abattoir employee to get free legal advice on unfair dismissal or unlawful termination from the Lismore based Northern Rivers Community Legal Centre. I have raised this with my colleague the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations the Hon. Julia Gillard. I raised the allegations of these men with the Commonwealth Workplace Ombudsman and am heartened to say that they have given a high priority to their investigation. I know that the Workplace Ombudsman recently served a notice to produce documents on the director at the registered office of Tempus Holdings and that significant resources are being directed at the investigation. I am encouraging more affected workers to come forward and provide evidence so that they can recover what is rightfully theirs and perhaps discourage rogue employers out there from running roughshod over other workforces in regional Australia. I do not care what tricky, albeit legal, company arrangements may have been put in place, the person morally and ethically responsible for paying these workers their entitlements is the person who owns the abattoir-Stuart Ramsey. (Time expired) Hume Electorate: Telstra",98
49,Mr SCHULTZ,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to speak on an incident involving Telstra and the Mandemar Rural Fire Brigade at High Range just west of Mittagong on the Wombeyan Caves Road in the electorate of Hume. In July last year the Mandemar Rural Fire Brigade undertook to de-silt a dam that was located in the grounds of St Thomas's Church at High Range. The purpose of the de-silting was to increase the storage capacity of the dam, which is used by the Mandemar brigade along with other rural fire brigades in the Wingecarribee shire both for training and refreshing purposes and as a water source during the outbreak of bushfires in the area. De-silting is a way of increasing the storage capacity of a dam without actually enlarging the dam. It removes the debris and mud that builds up over time on both the floor and walls of a dam. It is recognised that the way to de-silt a dam is to employ the services of an excavator and an experienced operator. In this case a member of a neighbouring volunteer rural fire brigade who is also an earthmoving contractor offered the services of his excavator and his time voluntarily to undertake the dam desilting. Before the commencement of the desilting of the dam the captain of the Mandemar brigade and the excavator operator made an inspection of the site and discovered that a Telstra cable was located in the paddock in close proximity to the dam. The de-silting process was then started. About 10 minutes into the job the excavator pulled up a cable and damaged it. The cable was identified as a Telstra cable. It was located about a metre from the dam wall in the water. This was not a very sensible place to have laid a Telstra cable in the first place, one would suggest. Telstra was immediately advised of the damage and arrangements were made for its repair. The volunteer contractor then finished the de-silting of the dam. Upon completion of the de-silting, the volunteer contractor without hesitation proceeded to dig a more appropriately located trench in which the repaired cable could be laid. Telstra repaired the cable, relocated it into the new trench that had been dug by the volunteer excavator operator and left the trench open. Within a couple of days the volunteer excavator driver returned with his machine, refilled the trench and tidied up the area. This additional work was completed by the volunteer contractor at no cost to either the Mandemar brigade or Telstra. At this stage it was thought that all was resolved satisfactorily and that the matter was closed. Not long after the completion of the desilting and the repairs to the Telstra cable, volunteer earthmoving contractor received a bill from Telstra in the amount of $1,075.92 for ‘damage to Telstra assets'. The contractor duly paid the invoice. The Mandemar Rural Fire Brigade subsequently wrote to Telstra inquiring as to the possibility of having the amount refunded as all the work on the dam was done by volunteer labour and they felt it was unfair that the volunteer contractor should be made liable for the damage, given the inappropriate location of the Telstra cable in the dam. Telstra, I might add, did not recognise the work performed voluntarily by the contractor in assisting Telstra by digging a new trench for the relocation of the repaired cable. Mandemar Rural Fire Brigade received a letter of reply from Telstra advising and acknowledging, ‘Your brigade is a volunteer organisation and the contractor was volunteering his time and excavator. However, damage to Telstra plant costs millions of dollars per year and damagers are financially liable for the damage caused to cables as a result of negligence or carelessness. Telstra considers that there is a liability in this matter by the responsible party and Telstra is entitled to recover costs where repairs are done that restore Telstra's network to a predamaged state. It is realised that this damage was not intentional. However, in cases where there is no wear and tear, and like any accidental damage, there is a cost for work which would otherwise not have been necessary. Telstra will recover these costs from the person that has caused the damage. Therefore a reimbursement will not be provided.' There was no mention by Telstra of the work that was carried out by the volunteer contractor at no cost to Telstra and assisting them to carry out the repair. I subsequently made inquiries into the matter with Telstra and Mandemar Rural Fire Brigade, but in the first instance my reprethe sentations to Telstra fell on unsympathetic ears. It has only been after some further pressure from me and some further investigation and recommendations by a most competent and efficient member of Telstra's customer and infrastructure support team assigned to matters in the electorate of Hume-who recognised what trying to enforce Telstra's corporate muscle to recover the sum of a mere $1,000 or so from a volunteer charity organisation may have caused to Telstra's already strained public reputation-that a more appropriate outcome occurred. I am pleased to announce tonight that common sense has prevailed and Telstra has now agreed to refund in full the amount of $1,075.92 to the volunteer contractor. I would hope that Telstra now recognises the significant contribution that volunteers make to their communities and will look sympathetically at any further such incidents that may inadvertently occur from time to time. I thank Dawn from Telstra for her professional and prompt action on this issue.",100

I discovered teacher has lost her home-she lives in Strathewen-and others in the kindergarten in organising things brother quite often in the last few days, because from the latest threat in Healesville. He was children, listening to the ABC and scanning get out of there. These are limited connections most of the members of the Victorian delegation some perhaps more telling, and that most Victorians those events and will have people whom they help, to worry about or to look after. In a sense, us, these events are extraordinarily immediate connected to us and to our communities, even the centre of Melbourne. The second point that I want to make is that ments, understandably, about these events wrong, what bad decisions were made or who people to exercise restraint and withhold judgment, we are in a position to truly understand where cated, and what the factors are that have caused complex, and inevitably you are seeing some in commending this condolence motion to and Deregulation) (8.08 pm)-Like so the shadow of bushfire.

I do not have been very amply and eloquently expressed by points that arise from the terrible events that people and spread so much wider than just comments by you, Madam Deputy Speaker Burke, last night that my daughter's kindergarten my wife is already involved with to assist there. I have been on the phone to my he lives in an area that is now not far away up all Saturday night with his wife and two small the internet, with two suitcases packed, ready to with these events, but I have no doubt that to parliament will have similar connections, will have connections of some kind to are connected with-people whom they need to that is a good thing. It means that, for most of and familiar in so many terrible ways. They are for people who, like me, are in and represent already we are seeing a wide variety of arguemerge in the community-about what went is to blame. That is understandable, but I urge because it will be quite some time before blame should be allocated, if it should be alloso many deaths. All of these things are quite people emerge who are running particular NA themes which may or may not have some merit dear irrespective of whether Whether it is the level of back-burning, should be allowed to have homes in areas that the fire plans and arrangements and the instructions implemented by the CFA, whether it is climate the member for Mallee get up and point out that case of the Horsham fire has turned out to be apparently-it is extremely important that we all means, raise questions, but it will be some out of respect for those who have lost their should all avoid drawing firm and unduly emphatic we are predisposed to believing anyway before derstood all that has gone on. I have been involved in controlled burning-many, idea of what a complex thing that is and also start a fire in October or November in a very reduce the fuel, but sometimes it does not quite very difficult judgements; they involve very tricky again, I would urge people to avoid The third point I want to make is to throughout Australia-particularly in Victoria, indeed, in some other parts of the world-who For example, I note that the AFL has rescheduled occur between my team, Essendon, and the Western be held on Friday at Telstra Dome with all of all the proceeds to go to the fire appeal. televising that. I am going to be attending just one example-and you can already see amongst ordinary citizens and in workplaces-of kinds of ways. It is a good example of just each other when things are so difficult. The fourth thing I would like to mention-and you, Madam Deputy Speaker Burke, in your before-is that many people have quite correctly extraordinary sacrifices they make and risks viduals actually fighting fires in one location ones, in another. I certainly endorse all those cause I think there is a group of people who unteers there are large numbers of employees ronment whose job it is to look after the bush, the line, to work around the clock-to do all They, too, make an extraordinary contribution. dozer drivers, the labourers, the variety of but which happen to be themes that they hold or not these events had occurred. whether it is planning issues and whether people are exposed to such bushfire risk, whether it is people are given and how well they are change or whether it is arson-we saw today what was originally thought to be arson in the the product of a faulty insulator on a power pole, withhold judgment on all of these matters. By time before we can draw conclusions. I think, lives and property and for those close to them, we conclusions that may happen to suit things having seen all the evidence and having unmany years ago-so I have got some of how risky it is. It seems like a great idea to thickly forested or overgrown area in order to work out as you intend. These things involve questions for the authorities concerned. So, drawing conclusions too early. commend all of those people and organisations most obviously, but throughout Australia and, are already stepping up and offering to help. the NAB Cup game that was scheduled to Bulldogs in Darwin. That is now going to the people involved donating their services and I also commend Channel 7, Foxtel and AUSTAR for that game representing the government. So that is such examples across corporate Australia, how people are stepping up to help in all how Australians do come together and work for again this follows on a little bit from what capacity as member for Chisholm, talked about acknowledged the CFA volunteers and the they take, even to the extent of one or two indiwhile they were losing homes, or even loved comments. But I do want to add something, beare often overlooked. Alongside those CFA volof the Department of Sustainability and Envito step in and fight fires, to put their lives on kinds of extraordinary things to keep people safe. They are the professional foresters, the bullpeople who work for the state government who are NA always in the front-line of dealing with these is extremely important that we acknowledge that of the volunteers. I might add to that the other professional services, whether police, involved. It is worth emphasising that this relatively modest bushfires that threaten property have both CFA volunteers and professional firefighters-including, politan firefighters as well. It is important both of them are crucial to the effort. Finally, can I give some hint of optimism photos of communities like Marysville, Kinglake, think that these places will never recover or quicker than that. I was fortunate to be a part-owner well before I became a member of parliament-in property. I bought that property about six completely devastated Aireys Inlet. This house Inlet had-it was one of the key locations years, you would barely have known that. As was nothing obvious about this community to had been three-quarters wiped out by bushfire. I believe that these communities, with the of the rest of the Australian community, the ment, will recover physically and will re-establish might have expected at the peak of such a terrible economically and physically that recovery will emotional scars and traumas in those communities ferent matter. I conclude by reference to what is, perhaps, epitomises the Australian character and how shows how we get the balance right in conducting and tragedy when coming together and helping-leaving itself. It is the Henry Lawson poem called The not know it, the squatter and the selector, position, because they were fighting over the part of the poem there is a fire on the selector's squatter and his son go to help the selector-the the land-put out the fire. That epitomises kinds of things when all other antagonisms, may be, are set aside and people just step up people who are in such terrible difficulties. We are already seeing that again and I think and months. That is what gives me great confidence enormity of these events, the appalling tragedy damage that has inevitably emerged, those communities things whenever there is a bushfire, and I think it their heroism and dedication, as we acknowledge that we acknowledge the dedication and bravery of ambulance or the various others who are also is a team effort. Even when you are dealing with but perhaps do not threaten life, you will in this instance, metrothat we acknowledge both of those groups because in all of this. When you see those terrible aerial Strathewen or elsewhere, it is hard not to that it will take decades. It will happen a lot of a home in Aireys Inlet many years ago, fact, well before I owned any other kind of or seven years after the Ash Wednesday fires had had not been burned down, but much of Aireys of the Ash Wednesday fires.
