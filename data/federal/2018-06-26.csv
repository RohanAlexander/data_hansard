National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Bill 2017 Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Bill 2017 Second Reading Cognate debate. Consideration resumed of the motion: That this bill be now read a second time.",19
1,Mr DREYFUS,BILLS," On 7 December last year, just hours after marriage equality was voted into reality by an overwhelming majority of this parliament, the Prime Minister walked into a near-empty House and moved the second reading of three bills. The first was the National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Bill 2017, the second was the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Bill 2017 and the third was the Home Affairs and Integrity Agencies Legislation Amendment Bill 2017. Today's debate is on the first two of these bills: the National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Bill 2017 and the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Bill 2017. These bills are quite distinct in what they do, and I will come to their intended operation a little later, but I will begin by briefly discussing the threats that these bills aim to address. We in Labor agree with the government on three fundamental points. First, we agree that it is a paramount obligation of all members of parliament to do what we can to ensure that our nation is secure and our community safe. Our record of constructive engagement on national security bills over recent years makes this clear. Second, we agree that, in a rapidly changing global environment in which technology is also constantly evolving, the threats facing Australia are also changing rapidly. Third, we in Labor are in no doubt that the laws of Australia, including our national security laws, must be under a constant state of review so that they can be adapted as necessary to be fit for purpose. In the national security area this means that laws that were developed to deal with threats to our nation as they existed a  century ago need to be updated when necessary to address the threats that we face today and that our agencies warn us we may well face tomorrow. The key threats that these two bills seek to address are those of covert foreign interference and covert foreign influence in our democratic processes. As a democratic nation with a policy of openness marked by public participation not only in elections but also in governmental decision-making we are more open to the threats of covert foreign influence and covert foreign interference than are some other nations with political systems that are largely closed to public involvement. While we in Labor recognise that threat and the need to respond to it, one of the reasons we've been in such a lengthy debate with the government about these bills is that we do not want to respond to the threat of foreign interference by shutting down the openness of our society and of our democratic processes. That would be less a response to the threat than a capitulation to it. In the form that these laws were introduced by the Prime Minister in December last year, these laws would have had a totally unacceptable impact on our openness as a democratic society. For example, unamended, these bills would have threatened journalists with severe criminal penalties for reporting on matters in the national security space that might have embarrassed the government. They would have imposed enormous administrative burdens on charities across our country-and even on those who supported them-backed up by criminal sanctions for non-compliance. These laws would have required any Australian academic engaged in joint work with an overseas university or academic to register as a foreign agent, again, on pain of criminal prosecution if they did not. Clearly, these outcomes would have been completely unacceptable to most Australians, and it is concerning that the Prime Minister thought that these measures and others of a similar nature were acceptable. It's also concerning that the Prime Minister sought to so rush the process for review of this legislation by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. The original reporting date for the committee was in February this year. This would have required all submissions to be written, public hearings to be conducted and the committee's report drafted, debated, agreed to and vetted by our agencies in the weeks during the lead-up to Christmas and over the summer break. The view that these bills could be introduced in the last hours of the last parliamentary session and then dealt with before parliament resumed suggests a lack of respect for the public's right to be consulted on laws that would so impact on our democratic rights and freedoms, including the vital freedom of the press to hold governments to account. Fortunately, the government relented and allowed a more reasonable but still not fully adequate timetable for these bills to be considered by the intelligence committee, and I thank the government for realising its mistake. It is now over six months since the committee received its references on these bills, and many key stakeholders still believe that there has been inadequate time for consultation on these bills and the raft of amendments that have been made to them in the last weeks and hours. As it is, the committee only tabled its report on the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Bill yesterday, and substantial amendments were prepared and provided to us only late yesterday. I do want to put on record that the government's claim that these bills have to be passed by the parliament now to ensure that they are in place for the by-election scheduled for 28 July was directly contradicted by evidence given by the Attorney-General's Department to the committee, which made clear  that it would take several months to put in place the register of foreign interests that will be established by the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Bill. I now turn to the specific provisions of the National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Bill. This bill reforms the Commonwealth's espionage, sabotage, treason, treachery and secrecy laws in the Commonwealth Criminal Code and the Crimes Act 1914. The bill also introduces new offences aimed at criminalising the activities of foreign actors who are seeking to interfere with Australia's democratic and political processes, which are described as foreign interference offences. On 8 December 2017, the Prime Minister referred the bill to the intelligence and security committee. It was an appropriate referral and allowed the committee to continue its important, independent work reviewing security legislation for the parliament. In referring the bill, the Prime Minister acted in keeping with the bipartisan convention of ensuring proper scrutiny of security legislation. The committee was asked to review the single largest overhaul of Australia's national security legal framework since the 1960s. There are some 38 offences in this bill. Most of them are expanded or reformed offences that have existed in one form or another in Australia's criminal law since 1914, and there are seven new foreign interference offences. Given the scale of the task presented to the committee, I should note that the government's approach before introduction left a lot to be desired. Given the scope and significance of this legislation, it would've been preferable for the former Attorney-General the Hon. George Brandis to publish an exposure draft of the bill or consult with experts. Because criminal sanctions are so serious, criminal law reform needs to be carefully thought through, subjected to public scrutiny and comment, and refined and designed so that it only captures the conduct that we rightly say as a society should be criminalised. This bill reforms and amends laws which have long carried the potential for long prison sentences. Careful, thoughtful law reform aided by consultation and expertise was most certainly needed for these laws. This was not done. The first that experts and interested parties heard of this bill was when the Prime Minister and the former Attorney-General gave a press conference on their intention to introduce the legislation on 5 December 2017. This lack of proper consultation was compounded by the government seeking submissions from interested citizens, civil society groups and those experts so vital for assisting in the policy development process by 18 January 2018. The submissions that were ultimately received made clear to all members of the committee, Labor and government members like, that the bill was deeply flawed. It contained numerous drafting errors, significant overreach and inadequate safeguards. I can say that, in the light of significant and growing criticism over the first months of this year, the new Attorney-General, the Hon. Christian Porter, in March presented by way of a submission to the committee inquiry a set of amendments to the bill which attempted to resolve some of the criticisms that had been levelled at the secrecy offences contained in schedule 2 of the bill. That criticism came from, among many others, the joint media organisations, who suggested to the committee that the bill, as presented, could make it a criminal offence, with substantial criminal terms of imprisonment as possible penalties, for journalists and staff of media organisations who innocently received secret information, whether or not that information was classified.  The Law Council of Australia, who made a very detailed submission running to some 78 pages, detailed extensive problems across the entirety of the bill. The Human Rights Law Centre made another helpful submission which focused on the secrecy offences, and that submission reflected that there were significant conceptual difficulties with the bill. They also noted how it deviated from the Australian Law Reform Commission's report titled Secrecy laws and open government in Australia, which was published in December 2009. The Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security made a submission which outlined her concerns that some of the offences would make it impossible for her and her staff to fulfil their statutory duties. Similar concerns were raised by the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner and the Commonwealth Ombudsman. None of these organisations or government office holders had been consulted about the proposed laws. I'm glad to say that, following months of constructive bipartisan work, with exceptional support from the staff of the committee secretariat, a mammoth 404-page report was tabled on 7 June 2018. The report made 60 recommendations, more than any other committee report on a national security bill since the Abbott and Turnbull governments came to power in 2013. It is my and Labor's hope that, in future, such significant laws are the subject of proper consultation, considered drafting and thorough preparation before they are brought to the parliament. It makes the job of all of us in this place easier. It also makes it easier because Labor has always been determined to ensure that our law enforcement agencies and national security agencies have the powers that are necessary to keep Australians safe. These include the full suite of criminal offences that our security agencies tell us are necessary to disrupt and combat criminal attempts to undermine our democratic system and to use Australia as a venue for conducting espionage against Australia's allies. Had these laws been properly prepared subject to public scrutiny and debate prior to being brought to the parliament, it would not have been 25 June when this debate was taking place. Had proportionate, considered and well-developed law reform been proposed to the parliament, it's possible that our security agencies would already be working in an environment which provided the legal framework that they have sought and need to limit the permissive environment in which unprecedented espionage and foreign influence is taking place. It is with all of these matters in mind that Labor has engaged in a constructive manner through the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security with the government on this bill. As I have noted, the PJCIS report made 60 recommendations, 59 of which were for improvements to the bill or explanatory memorandum or making suggestions to the government as to how the bill should be implemented. The fact that there are 60 recommendations in the report reflects that there was always more work to do to try and get the balance right. We believe that the recommendations in the report which have been implemented by the government in the amendments before the House address many of the concerns raised by civil society groups and the media and improve the effectiveness of this bill. The government has produced, in the last sitting week, amendments-those now before the House-responding to and accepting the recommendations of the report. I thank the Attorney-General, the Hon. Christian Porter, for working constructively on the further amendments which were necessary to make this bill workable. The bill now before the parliament and the two substantial amendment sheets overhaul a significant number of offences traditionally associated with criminalising the malicious  interference in Australia's democratic and security apparatus by foreign countries. The bill modernises and reforms offences against government, including the offences of treason, treachery, mutiny, assisting the escape of a prisoner of war and military-style training involving a foreign principal. These will all continue to be in part 5.1 of the Criminal Code. The PJCIS report made it clear that these offences were in no way designed to capture humanitarian work in conflict zones or circumstances where a journalist covers a conflict and presents information which might be seen as supporting a particular group that has been designated an enemy under a proclamation. The new division 91 in schedule 1 of the bill amends and modernises the existing espionage offences in division 91 of the Criminal Code. Under the new division 91, the number of espionage offences will increase to cover the gaps in the criminal law that Australia's security agencies have identified as being presently exploited by foreign actors conducting espionage against Australia and in Australia against other countries. I place on record that the interpretation offered by some civil society groups that the espionage offences are capable of criminalising the disclosure of alleged breaches of international law or human rights by Australia or another country is simply not correct. It's not the parliament's intention that a civil society group which discloses to an international organisation otherwise secret information about Australia's or another country's breach of international obligations could be prosecuted under these offences. The object of these offences is to disrupt espionage activities. Further, for a construction of these offences to have the effect suggested relies on the Commonwealth's only-hypothetical wrong being exposed in order to commence a prosecution. The espionage offences are premised on some element of harm or damage being caused to the Commonwealth. While it might be embarrassing if some future wrong were uncovered and disclosed by civil society groups, mere embarrassment will not be enough to make out the elements of any of the espionage offences. This requirement is coupled with the fact that a prosecution would have to prove beyond reasonable doubt that a civil society organisation or an individual whistleblower had intended to cause prejudice or was reckless as to whether prejudice would be caused to Australia's national security. In circumstances where the disclosure to the relevant international organisation is made to ensure that Australia rectifies and in future does not breach its international obligations, it's difficult to see how that fault element could be proved. Finally, the espionage offences all require the consent of the Commonwealth Attorney General. Attorneys-general hold obligations which go beyond the usual political and legal obligations of other ministers. They are the first law officer of the Commonwealth. A Commonwealth Attorney-General who consented to a prosecution in factual circumstances like those given as examples by some who have criticised this bill would, in my opinion, not be fulfilling those high obligations. I say this to assure any concerned citizens that this bill and these espionage offences do not seek to limit the role of civil society and do not threaten the essential role that civil society plays as a vehicle for the improvement of the Australian community, particularly where that objective is sought by improving Australia's status in multilateral institutions. The bill introduces a new division 92 of the Criminal Code which contains several offences completely new to Australia's criminal law. The object of these offences is the disruption and  criminalisation of covert acts of foreign interference which threaten Australia's democratic processes. I take examples that were given by the Prime Minister in introducing these bills: the interference in the US 2016 presidential election, in the Brexit referendum in the United Kingdom and in the presidential election in France, examples which happily have not yet been replicated-or at least no evidence has been presented that these activities have been replicated-in Australia. It's apparent that in other parts of the world, in other countries, covert actors are seeking on an unprecedented scale to interfere with and manipulate the political processes of democratic countries, particularly by attacking free and fair elections. Australia will not allow this conduct to arrive on our shores. The parliament will not allow interference in our elections. Labor will not allow our democratic processes to be the subject of foreign interference, and we will not allow the subversion of our politics to the interests of covert actors. Labor, whether in government or opposition, will not allow foreign interference, and we join with the government in safeguarding our nation's system of government and representative democracy which all Australians cherish and are, rightly, proud of. The bill updates and modernises Australia's sabotage offences. Labor recognises that, in a complex modern world, it is necessary to criminalise intentional or reckless damage to a broad range of public infrastructure. As with the criticisms that I dealt with earlier in relation to the espionage offences, some critics have suggested that these amended sabotage offences might be used to criminalise innocent and peaceful protest. I would simply say that that is not the way in which these offences are intended to operate. It is not the way, in my view, that a court would interpret them. They are, absolutely, intended to criminalise sabotage, a serious attack on our country, and in no way would be used-as has been suggested and, I say, wrongly-to criminalise peaceful protest. The bill introduces a new 'theft of trade secrets' offence to protect Australia from economic espionage by foreign government principals, and it makes a number of other appropriate, modernising amendments to a range of other offences, including the offence of interfering with political rights and duties and, as I've indicated, important reforms to Australia's secrecy laws. As a consequence of the amendments put forward by the Attorney-General in March, the secrecy offences are now to be split between offences committed by Commonwealth officers and offences committed by non-Commonwealth officers, which is an appropriate distinction to be made in the criminal law. Through the PJCIS process, Labor has ensured that there will be more limited circumstances applying to non-Commonwealth officers. In particular, Labor has ensured that there will be a robust and broad exemption for journalists and those people engaged in the business of reporting news and engaging in editorial activity. Those exemptions will stop the laws from being used to censor or suppress freedom of expression, which is an appropriate safeguard. Generally speaking, this bill is much improved by the 59 recommendations for amendment and change both to the bill and to the explanatory memorandum. There will now be 'prior publication' defences. There will now be a public interest defence for the secrecy offence. It is important that there be these limitations. It's important that there are now amendments to make explicit that the protections and immunities for whistleblowers which already exist in the Public Interest Disclosure Act, the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Act and the Freedom of Information Act are not affected by this bill. As I've noted already, the bill  will now include a requirement for the Attorney-General to consent to a prosecution for espionage and to consent to a prosecution for a secrecy offence, which is an important further safeguard. Many of the recommendations of the PJCIS-which I thank the government for implementing in full in these amendments now before the House-have the effect of narrowing the impermissible conduct to be criminalised by the offences contained in the bill. In particular, I note the requirement that the offences which use the phrase 'prejudice to Australia's national security' are to be interpreted as requiring a degree of damage or harm to Australia's national security. It's not in the interests of our nation that mere embarrassment would be sufficient to make out this element of the offences containing that phrase. Labor has worked constructively and in good faith with the government to make sure that this bill has been significantly improved. It now properly targets the conduct which the parliament is seeking to criminalise, while always safeguarding those fundamental and essential rights and freedoms which we in Labor will always defend and promote. I will turn now, in the available time, to the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Bill. This bill also was introduced by the Prime Minister on 7 December, and it's quite a different bill to the espionage and foreign interference bill, which of course is dealing with amendments to the criminal law. This bill sets up a registration scheme for persons who act on behalf of foreign governments, foreign government related entities or individuals and foreign political organisations who are seeking to influence an Australian governmental or political process. As with the espionage bill, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security received many submissions opposing the bill which were particularly directed to the breadth of the bill. Submitters pointed out that thousands of Australian individuals and organisations whose foreign connections were entirely overt would have been required to register under the bill as originally put forward. The committee had public hearings on 30 and 31 January and again on 16 March. It was quite apparent, even by mid-March, that the government was going to have to very substantially amend this Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Bill, but the committee had to wait until six months to the day from when the bill was first introduced by the Prime Minister-7 June 2018-for the Attorney-General to submit a very large set of proposed amendments to this Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Bill. It was such a large set of amendments that it's fair to consider what is now before the House an almost completely different bill. The government at that point, on 7 June 2018, indicated that it wanted this further bill, the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Bill, to be passed in this sitting week, and happily the committee was able to complete a short further inquiry, by calling for submissions again from all those who had made submissions earlier to the committee, on the new set of amendments produced by the Attorney-General. This resulted in some 30 further submissions, a hearing conducted by the intelligence committee last Monday and some extremely active work by the committee and its secretariat over the succeeding week, leading to the tabling of the report of the committee yesterday, recommending something over 40 further changes in addition to those suggested by the Attorney-General on 7 June. The changes have the effect that the scope of the bill is now greatly narrowed. It is now clear that the registration scheme is to focus on the activities of foreign governments, foreign  government related individuals and entities, and foreign political organisations. That last term too-because it does sound a like a broad term-has been further restricted by the amendments which are before the parliament so as to make it clear that a foreign political organisation is to be treated as a foreign political party or an organisation which is directed wholly or primarily to political activity, and the amendments to the explanatory memorandum will make it clear that an environmental group or other civil society group whose activities are directed to other matters and not solely to political activity is not intended by the parliament to be caught by the term 'foreign political organisation'. Again, the scope of registerable activities has been limited so that it now is clear that it's intended that registerable activities will cover parliamentary and general political lobbying where the relevant conduct is undertaken for the sole or primary purpose of political or government influence or the government's communications activity. The media organisations who had participated in the earlier part of the inquiry have expressed their satisfaction with the narrowing of the scope of this bill so that, in a very real sense, media organisations will not be caught by its provisions. So, too, charities that had expressed great concern that they were going to be caught up in onerous obligations and paperwork that took them well outside what they would prefer to be spending their time on have also expressed their satisfaction that they are to be exempt. So, too, arts and cultural organisations are to be exempt from the registration requirements under this scheme, and trade unions are to be exempt from the registration requirements under this scheme under particular circumstances. There was already in the bill as originally proposed a religious exemption. That religious exemption has been clarified as a consequence of both the recommendations of the committee and the amendments that the government now brings before the House. Again, that's appropriate. In its original form, the bill introduced to this House on 7 December was very much using a sledgehammer to crack a nut, when what in truth was required was a more scalpel-like approach. Happily, the government has listened to the very many concerns that have been expressed by civil society and has narrowed the scope of the bill, increased the number of exemptions, and clarified in a very real way the way in which the scheme is intended to operate. I have to mention an important further matter, which is that there is now to be a complete restoration of parliamentary privilege. It might, in the bill's original form, have been the case that parliamentary privilege was abrogated. It is now made clear by the proposed section 9A of the bill that this is not the case. This bill, if enacted, will not affect anything to do with parliamentary privilege, and, indeed, MPs will not be required to register under the scheme. The committee has recommended that this House and the other place devise, understanding orders, an appropriate matching scheme for members of both houses so as to ensure that there is proper disclosure of any foreign governmental influence working on members of either house. In a very real sense, there's been constructive work engaged in by both parties on these bills. There's been a great deal of work in the intelligence committee. The government has acted on those recommendations, and I commend both bills to the House.",19
2,Mr HASTIE,BILLS," The Prussian scholar/general Carl von Clausewitz has left an indelible mark on Western strategic and military culture. I first became immersed in  his famous work On War as a young officer cadet under the late Professor Jeffrey Grey at the University of New South Wales at the Australian Defence Force Academy some 15 years ago. This is not a unique experience for young minds schooled in the Western military traditionhis writings have taken a pre-eminent place in the way our political and military leaders think about war and strategy. His key insight was into the primal nature of war. 'War,' wrote Clausewitz, 'is an extreme trial of strength and stamina. It is an act of force to compel our enemy to do our will.' But his most quoted dictum, 'War is the continuation of politics by other means,' has led many in the West to insist on a comfortable separation between peace and war. We see war as a distinct form of statecraft conducted outside the realm of peacetime relations. George F. Kennan, the American diplomat and historian, wrestled with this problem in 1948, just as the Iron Curtain was descending across Europe. In a US state department memo entitled The inauguration of organised political warfare he wrote: We have been handicapped however by a popular attachment to the concept of a basic difference between peace and war, by a tendency to view war as a sort of sporting context outside of all political context, by a national tendency to seek for a political cure-all, and by a reluctance to recognize the realities of international relations-the perpetual rhythm of struggle, in and out of war. This was a phenomenon unique to Western democracies. Kennan argued that the Soviet Union under Lenin had fused Marxism and Clausewitz, and this allowed them to develop the most refined and effective political warfare in history. The Soviet Union flipped Clausewitz's logic and read his dictum backwards: 'Politics is the continuation of war by other means'. Political warfare for the Soviets could be both overt and covert. It was part of the rhythm of struggle that Kennan described as an underlying reality of international relations. Liberal democracies grappled with political warfare during the Cold War and today we face the same problem. We know that today Marxist-Leninist authoritarian regimes are conducting espionage and foreign interference against Western liberal democracies, including Australia, on an unprecedented scale. This has been described as a unique form of authoritarian political warfare, known as comprehensive coercion. I refer to the recent monograph published by the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments entitled Countering comprehensive coercion: competitive strategies against authoritarian political warfare, which was co-authored by Australian Ross Babbage, along with Thomas Mahnken and Toshi Yoshihara. The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security is privy to a lot of classified information, and in my considered view this open-source document accords most closely with the threat described by our intelligence agencies. The problem we all face is simply this: authoritarian states are using political warfare to undermine the legitimacy of Western democracies by targeting our media, political processes, financial networks and personal data. These authoritarian states view political warfare as a standard instrument of statecraft rather than a specialised tool. Their centralised regimes can leverage all elements of their national power towards their strategic objectives. They can mobilise all elements of society for political warfare-not just government but also nongovernmental organisations, industry, think tanks, civic associations and individuals. They use political warfare to suppress dissent, discourage foreign narratives that are inimical to their interests, generate support for policies they favour, enhance their freedom of action by keeping their rivals distracted, and mitigate pushback against overt acts of revisionism.  What do these political warfare operations look like? Overt operations are conducted to influence, pressure, coerce, bribe, corrupt and exploit Western countries. To advance their national objectives they mobilise elements of their diaspora residing in Western countries. Embassies and consulates play a vital coordination role in recruiting and controlling ethnic diaspora. They task students in foreign countries to suppress views inimical to their interests on Western university campuses. They influence and manipulate foreign language media in diaspora communities to comply with state-approved narratives. They sponsor pro-regime educational institutions to foster their world views and support their strategic aims. They provide financial support and inducements to individuals and institutions abroad, usually members of the political system, to foster them as agents of influence in the service of their national objectives. They seek to build influence within Western media organisations. They leverage trade and investment dependencies to coerce partners. They mobilise state-owned business enterprises to act in the interest of their strategic goals. They recruit business leaders who have strong economic interests in their country. They penetrate Western research and other institutions to access cutting-edge technology. They conduct sophisticated cyber operations against targeted countries. They conduct espionage operations against Western and partner countries, and they conduct geostrategic manoeuvres to extend their influence over new areas through the acquisition and building of roads, rail, airheads, ports, pipelines, and power and electronic communications infrastructure, to link up their economic aims with their geostrategic ambitions. All of these operations that I have described thematically are reflected in real-time examples. I do not wish to name individual countries except to say this is a real problem for Western democracies. But I do acknowledge the courage of Australian investigative journalists who have sought to uncover examples of these operations here in Australia. They have done so in the national interest and often with the threat of expensive defamation cases for their efforts. In fact, our defamation laws are at risk of being weaponised in the service of authoritarian states. I think we must consider reform of these laws to prevent our own institutions being used against us by our strategic rivals to suppress free speech. In the meantime, we need to take legislative action to secure our sovereignty, our political institutions and our economic prosperity. This government has taken action. On 7 December 2017, the Prime Minister introduced the two bills that are now before us in the House. On 8 December, the Prime Minister asked the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security to inquire into and report on both bills. For me as chair of the committee, it has been a privilege to be involved in the process of reviewing these bills on a bipartisan basis and making recommendations to improve them with amendments. It is a task that we as the PJCIS take very seriously, given the unprecedented scale of the threat that we seek to mitigate. We are also deeply conscious of the need for this parliament to balance security with personal liberty. Two weeks ago the committee reported on the National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Bill, and yesterday we tabled our report on the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Bill. Importantly, both bills have received bipartisan support from the committee, and they need to be passed for the sake of our national interest. I've already covered in previous speeches the key elements of each bill and our committee  recommendations for improvement. I won't traverse the same ground here, but it is worth reminding ourselves why we are passing this legislation. Our intelligence and law enforcement agencies and prosecutors do not presently have the tools to counter the threat that we are facing. This bill equips them for the task of protecting our security and sovereignty. The espionage and foreign interference bill replaces and broadens existing espionage and sabotage offences. It introduces new categories of offences, including foreign interference and theft of trade secrets. It revises other offences against the state, including treason and treachery. It creates a new aggravated offence of giving false or misleading information in connection with a security clearance. Significantly, this bill, under the foreign interference offences, makes it criminal to influence state or federal elections on behalf of a foreign power. We've seen authoritarian powers interfere in Brexit and the French and US presidential elections. We cannot afford the same risk in Australia. That is why we are taking action to secure the integrity of our electoral system. When the espionage and foreign interference bill becomes law, those charged with shielding our democracy will be equipped for the incredibly complex task before them. Complementing the National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Bill is the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Bill. The Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Bill seeks to bring into the light covert or obscured foreign influence in our political institutions. It will empower the Australian people with more information about who is shaping our political decision-makers. We cannot have foreign states exercising covert influence over our political landscape. Of course, we welcome overt foreign influence as a necessary part of our democratic processes. We have many foreign partners who engage in regular dialogue with Australian government and civil society through lawful, legitimate and transparent channels. We welcome this. It strengthens us as a country. But it must be declared, and this is what this scheme seeks to do. The scheme will involve a public register. That register is intended to provide visibility of the level and extent of covert or obscured foreign influence in the course of political and governmental decision-making in this country. Under the bill, a person will be liable to register if they undertake certain activities that seek to influence Australian political or government decisions on behalf of individuals and entities that are closely linked to a foreign government. As I've said, this transparency will empower the Australian people to better understand the foreign influences at work in our political processes. This is a very good thing, because an informed citizenry means a healthy democracy. I want to say a bit about those who've done a lot of work towards getting these bills to where they are now. They have not occurred in a vacuum, nor can any one individual be credited with their passing. We are here today because a network of committed individuals across government, the media and civil society have worked in the national interest to make the private and public case for these laws. The Australian public can be confident that bipartisanship is still alive and that the network broadly reflects the political colours of blue and red. The Attorney-General has been outstanding in his principled, rigorous and realistic approach to securing bipartisan support for this legislation, and I thank him on behalf of the intelligence and security committee. Justin Bassi, Daniel Ward, Tim Wellington and Parker Reeve have been instrumental in the passage of these laws. You have done great work in the  service of Australia. I think of the deputy chair of the PJCIS, the member for Holt, and our Labor colleagues on the committee, and I also think of the Labor backbenchers who have shown their support for this suite of legislation during this committee process with a quiet word or note. I think of unlikely allies like Clive Hamilton who have shown courage where others have taken counsel of their fears. Many contributors have no political affiliation and are members of the media, government and civil society. Their defining characteristics are analytical courage, clarity and integrity. They have made clear what is at stake for Australia if we fail to act to protect our institutions. I shall not name them, but I will make special note of John Garnaut, who has spoken truth to power and may yet pay for it. Finally, I thank the secretariat of the intelligence and security committee. Your diligence, perseverance and flexibility have enabled us to get to this point. I think I speak for all involved when I commend this historic and landmark national security legislation to the House.",26
3,Mr BYRNE,BILLS," I'll be brief. I thank the shadow Attorney-General, the Leader of the Opposition in this House, the Attorney-General and the chair for their indulgence in allowing me to speak on the National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Bill 2017 and related bill. I note that my friend and colleague the member for Denison wants to speak shortly about these matters too. I speak today to those abroad who have listened to discordant voices in the course of this debate about our nation's sovereignty. I speak to those who have listened to representatives who have served in this place or other legislatures in this country who provided false hope or false comfort to those who may wish us harm. Today you are hearing the true voice of this nation and of this parliament. We effectively speak with one voice-a stentorian voice destined to be heard everywhere by those who wish us well or wish us harm. Our nation has a right to defend itself. It has a right to protect and defend its democratic structures, its way of life and the freedom of its people-all of its people, wherever they have come from, near or afar. When you come to this country and become a citizen, you are entitled to the full measure of protection that this country affords. This legislation must offer these protections to you, and, after the exhaustive processes undertaken by the PJCIS, it will. The perception of autocratic regimes about democracies like ours, the United Kingdom's and the United States's is that the openness of our societies creates weakness and that this weakness can be exploited. This is an act of historical folly that seems destined to be repeated unless common sense and a study of history prevail. Also this misconception could not be further from the truth. Our openness is our greatest strength. Our way of life and our expression of it are also our great strengths. It has come from centuries of struggle and sacrifice from many different nations and many different cultures. Its foundations were laid thousands of years ago by societies whose light still burns bright today and whose impact reverberates throughout our laws, our values, our art and our culture. We are the children and heirs of this foundation and tradition, and we must not squander this hard-won inheritance. Because even through this openness we can be slow to respond to threat, when that threat is revealed something ignites in our democracy: a thirst and an unquenchable desire to protect that democracy and our way of life, whatever the cost, whatever the sacrifice, with the full measure of devotion. I am from the party which gave this nation one of its greatest treasures-Prime Minister John Curtin, a humble man who stood tall and proud for our country in the darkest days of  World War II. He stood tall. He stood for our nation alongside giants such as Winston Churchill and Franklin Roosevelt. Our Prime Minister, who was described as a one-time mild-mannered trade unionist, addressed his nation's first direct radio broadcast from Canberra to American citizens on Friday, 14 March 1942. Praising the people of America during peak-hour broadcasting, Prime Minister Curtin spoke of their shared commitment to total warfare and the importance of preserving Australia as a democratic bastion between the US west coast and Axis enemies. 'I say to you,' he said, 'that the saving of Australia is the saving of America's west coast.' He also said: I speak to you from Australia. I speak from a united people to a united people, and my speech is aimed to serve all the people of the nations united in the struggle to save mankind. He stated: We fight with what we have and what we have is our all. We fight for the same free institutions that you enjoy. We fight so that, in the words of Lincoln, 'government of the people … by the people, shall not perish from the earth'. Our legislature is elected the same as is yours; and we will fight for it, and for the right to have it, just as you will fight to keep the Capitol at Washington the meeting place of freelyelected men and women representative of a free people. He further stated: Be assured of the calibre of our national character. This war may see the end of much that we have painfully and slowly built in our 150 years of existence. But even though all of it go, there will still be Australians fighting on Australian soil until the turning point be reached, and we will advance over blackened ruins, through blasted and fire-swepted cities, across scorched plains, until we drive the enemy into the sea. I give you the pledge of my country. There will always be an Australian Government and there will always be an Australian people. We are too strong in our hearts; our spirit is too high; the justice of our cause throbs too deeply in our being for that high purpose to be overcome. These great words echo down throughout the years to this day. The laws that we debate today may be imperfect, as other speakers may highlight, but they state and embody bipartisan intent. It is our job as legislators and Curtin's heirs to fulfil our commitment to those in our clandestine services, our law enforcement agencies and the Attorney-General's office that we seek these powers to keep our nation safe. We in this parliament, together, have ensured that there are reviews and safeguards required to offer protection as needed. With that in mind and with Curtin's words echoing in my ears, I commend these bills to the House.",30
4,Mr WILKIE,BILLS," It goes without saying that maintaining the security of our nation is clearly one of the most important roles for government, and doing so as a general principle has my full support. But, when it comes to the achievement of our national security, no government whatsoever has any right to ever be misleading or hypocritical. No government has any right to misuse national security in the lead-up to by-elections or an election. No government has the right to take us down the road to being a police state. I regret to say that there's more than a whiff of all of those concerns in the National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Bill 2017 and the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Bill 2017, which we are debating here in this place today and which we will shortly vote on. Yes, we do need legislative reform to counter foreign interference and foreign espionage in our country, but the way we do it has to be ever so carefully crafted and crafted in a way that safeguards the liberties that we hold so dear. These bills today do not achieve that standard, and I won't support them. I think the way they are currently presented to the parliament is  disappointing. They are bad bills. I think the fundamental deficiency in both of the bills today is in the broad definition of 'national security' and 'foreign influence'. Clearly, they are way too broad definitions, and they should have been remedied before the bills came before the House. For example, with the way the bills are crafted presently, the act of simply protesting could be deemed sabotage if that protest in some way could be seen to disadvantage or impede our economic security. What about the people who might protest against the Adani coalmine in Queensland-a project that, if it were stopped, would be, on the face of it, a downside to our economy? It could be said that those protesters are engaging in sabotage of Australia's economic security and could be prosecuted under these bills. Also, what about the need we have sometimes to report matters to international organisations like the United Nations? It is something which I've done myself. I have made complaints to the court in The Hague about our response to asylum seekers. Under these bills, people who do that in the future would be liable to be prosecuted because they could be deemed to be engaging in some sort of foreign interference. What about international organisations like Amnesty, the PEW environmental foundation or Save The Children? Are they foreign agents? Regrettably, with the way the bills are currently crafted, they could be held to be foreign agents and fall within this framework. Even possessing information sensitive not to Defence but to Australia's economic security could be deemed a breach of security. With the way the bills are currently crafted it is left to the relevant government minister, the Attorney-General, to determine against whom action should or shouldn't be taken. We should never rely on legislation which, at the end of the day, is at the whim of a minister. We have a good minister in the current Attorney-General, and he has my confidence, but what about a future Attorney-General in this government or a future government? Can we have the same confidence? What if we have a downright bad and mischievous Attorney-General or Prime Minister in a future government who would misuse these laws? These laws have the scope within them such that they could be misused. I say to honourable members that we should never sign off on any legislation where there is that freedom to manoeuvre for a government and the relevant minister. We should always craft our laws so tightly that they can never be misused by anyone in the future. Many years ago now I was involved in a whistleblowing episode, and I have a particular interest in maintaining or creating rights for whistleblowers, because I think they are a very important check on the power of governments. There's nothing in these bills today to give any protection to whistleblowers that might need to speak up about any of the matters to which these bills relate. Not irrelevant is the Public Interest Disclosure Act, which was passed by this place some years ago now. I remind members that there is a specific carve-out in the Public Interest Disclosure Act for national security material and national security officials. Any hope we might have that someone genuinely speaking up because of government misconduct or a security concern relevant to these bills would have any protection is dashed. They don't have protection before these bills; they don't have protection in these bills; and they don't have protection after these bills. I say to the Attorney-General that I would dearly love the government to revisit the carve-out for national security and national security officials in our whistleblower legislation in this country.  I wrap some context around these bills today, because I think that's important. Far too often we look at legislative reforms in isolation and don't take a step back to look at the overall situation. When we do that, I think we should be concerned about the direction this country has gone in since the 9/11 attacks in late 2001. Since 9/11 more than 60 security reforms have come through this place. Some have been necessary and had my support; many have not been necessary, did not have my support and will not have my support. At the end of the day so much of what we're talking about in this place, in the past and today, are ultimately just criminal offences which the laws already on the books have been adequate to deal with. Far too often in this place we're quick to pass a new law using the excuses of border security, national security or foreign espionage-scary words that make people think, 'We need more laws.' Often we don't need more or better laws; often we simply need to better apply the laws we have. Sure, make information-sharing between intelligence agencies and the justice system more effective and efficient, but we don't always need to race to pass another law when it comes to national security. I make the point again: since 9/11 more than 60 security reforms have passed this place. I would remind honourable members and anyone in the gallery of some alarming security changes passed in the 44th Parliament. For example, there were the amendments made to the Commonwealth Crimes Act in 2014 which allow ASIO officers to conduct controlled operations and, in those controlled operations, to actually commit very serious criminal offences such as burglaries, assaults, kidnapping and fraud knowing they will not be prosecuted and knowing that those controlled operations must be kept secret and that there is scant opportunity for journalists to publicise such controlled operations. Also in the previous parliament there was the Australian Border Force Act, which makes it an offence for people to reveal what goes on in our offshore processing centres overseas. Also, of course, in the previous parliament, who can forget mandatory metadata retention? I would remind the public, because far too often we forget these things, that today there is in place an arrangement where all of our metadata from our phones, our tablets and our computers at home is being recorded and held for two years. It can be accessed by the authorities without warrant. Even in this parliament, we have the three bills, two of which we're dealing with today. What of the reports just some weeks ago that police are going to be allowed to pull you up in the airport and demand to see your identity papers, even if you're not suspected of anything? Just on a whim, a police officer can pull you up and say 'Show me your papers!' and you have to hand them over. That's not good enough. That's not what should be allowed in a country like Australia. Deputy Speaker, when you look at the context, when you look at the bills we are dealing with today and the deficiencies of them, I will go so far as to say that Australia is a pre police state. We have passed far too many security laws, and far too many of them have been unnecessary. Our independent media is slowly being diminished with reductions in their funding. Papers are being checked at airports with no good cause. The right to protest, in these bills, is effectively diminished. As I said earlier, if the government wants to say any protest, such as a protest against the Adani Mine, is a threat to our economic national security, then you can be accused of committing an act of espionage and be charged under these bills that we're dealing with today.  Also diminished is access to foreign bodies. What happens the next time someone wants to make a complaint to the United Nations? Are they going to be accused of fostering foreign interference and be charged under these bills? Presumably not, because the Attorney-General has got more sense than that, but what about the next Attorney-General, if he doesn't like the cut of your suit and the fact that you're making a complaint to the International Criminal Court, for example? Will he have you charged for foreign interference and hauled before a court? We can't be sure that he or she won't do that. I made a reference at the start of my speech to hypocrisy. Governments-and the opposition, I would add-far too often are fired up to beat the national security drum and talk about the grave threats this country faces, but at the same time they took the AFP away from Hobart Airport. At the same time that governments are saying that our greatest security threat is home-grown terrorism-we know there are smart terrorists and would be terrorists who would target high-profile, iconic soft targets-they take the police away from the airport and refuse to put them back. What about the hypocrisy that we learnt of today that 12 members of this parliament have been flown to China as guests of Huawei, a company with known links to the Chinese government? That's okay. It's okay for people from this place to jump on a plane-in business class or maybe first class; I don't know how deep Huawei's pockets are-and fly off to China for one or two weeks, go in the tent, drink the Kool-Aid, look at a couple of telephone manufacturing plants and come back, no doubt, great friends of Huawei and great friends of the People's Republic. Then those same MPs will walk in here and vote for these bills today, saying, 'We're gravely concerned about foreign influence and our democratic process.' Just don't mention the business class flight to China in recent times as a guest, effectively, of the Chinese government through their middleman Huawei. What hypocrisy, and what a rush! The PJCIS has only just finished looking at these matters. We're only just getting our minds around all of the amendments, and we rush it in here. I'll finish in a bit over a minute, the member for Melbourne might speak for 15 minutes, and then I reckon they're going to try to ram this through before 90-second statements, because there's such urgency to energise this issue before the five by-elections. What absolute rot! Since when should this country's national security be pegged onto the political self-interest of the government and the opposition before five by-elections? We should look at these things carefully and slowly and make sure that ultimately what this place deals with and passes is in our national security best interests and not in the political self-interest of a government or an opposition. I would have liked to support both of these bills, because I'm the first to say we should maintain our national security. After all, I'm the fellow who did 20 years in the Army and a number of years in the intelligence services. I'm the first to fight for our national security, but I will not be party to reckless, poorly crafted legislation that unnecessarily diminishes even further our civil rights.",31
5,Mr BANDT,BILLS," The National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Bill 2017 criminalises dissent. This bill makes it a much more dangerous proposition to stand up to this government or any future government. It makes it a much more dangerous proposition to stand up on human rights and point out our government's record or other governments' records internationally on human rights. It makes it much more dangerous to protest against things that have an economic impact, like the  Adani coalmine, because, if these bills pass, there will be sweepingly broad new definitions of what counts as national security, what counts as Australia's economic interests and what counts as our international reputation, and, if you fall foul of those very broad definitions, you could find yourself in jail, because you will have breached espionage laws in this country, which are usually considered some of the most serious offences that there can be. Many, many people have spoken up about these bills and said not only that these bills are unnecessary but that they take us a step further down the road of becoming the kind of society that these bills are meant to protect us from. As Amnesty International said today, notwithstanding the cosy deal that's been done to rush these bills through the parliament-and I'll talk a bit about that in a moment-these bills still, despite all of that, make it a crime to hold the Australian government to account on human rights, and as such they help shield government from accountability. In their words: These draconian laws proposed will make Australia more like the authoritarian countries this bill is supposed to protect us from. When it comes to putting people in jail because they dared to speak up to a government, we should tread very, very carefully in this place. A very strong case needs to be made before we criminalise what most people would think is an everyday right of free speech. To go to a protest against a company doing something that you don't like, even if it potentially embarrasses Australia, to stand up to something that Australia is doing either by itself or with another country, even if it might embarrass Australia, or to say that a government needs to be held to account, even if it might be seen to be harming our international interests, is something that most people in this country would think is a fundamental right. It's what marks out democracies from other forms of society. But now doing things like protesting against international trade agreements like the TPP, saying governments and people internationally aren't pulling their weight in global climate change negotiations or saying you don't want a new coalmine that might have international consequences are potentially captured by this law, because the government has drawn very, very broad definitions. This has been pointed out by many organisations who've looked at this in the limited time that they've had available and have said, 'There are some big red flags here.' When you look at the way this government treats refugees, who are human beings, and when you look at the way this government takes away the basic rights of other people who've not even committed a crime, that is a precursor, I think, of what they'd be prepared to do to other people in our society, and that is why it is essential, any time a government wants to take away some of the basic precepts of the rule of law or of individual freedoms, that they be held to account and scrutinised very, very carefully. But what have we got here? We've got a couple of bills, one of which criminalises dissent and the other of which casts a broad net over other people around the world, meaning you'll potentially fall foul of law if you deal with them. The government puts out this bill and says, 'Oh, we need to rush it through very, very quickly.' Then it goes into a committee where there are secret discussions that take place between the government and the opposition, and about 10 minutes ago we just got 50 pages of amendments and were told: 'Trust us. It's okay. Pass this bill with these amendments. We've fixed it all up.' Well, maybe the opposition has secured some good amendments from the government and made this bad bill less bad-and good on them, if they have-but parliament is meant to be the place where you scrutinise  what the government is doing. When the government wants to criminalise dissent, when the government wants to say, 'You could face jail time tomorrow for doing something that was perfectly lawful yesterday,' I'm sorry, but we don't take them at face value. We have seen what you, the government, do to other people when you've got the legal power of the state behind you. We've seen what you do to refugees. We've seen that you take away people's incomes if you don't think they're spending their money properly. We've seen people's lives broken because of the way this government has treated them. And so I am sorry, but we are not prepared to take it on trust that somehow everything is going to be okay and that dissent will not be criminalised in this country. It is against everything this parliament stands for to lob almost 50 pages of amendments at the parliament and say, 'Right, we're going to pass it today.' We just started debating this bill today. We're going to wind up very soon because a secret deal's been done behind closed doors, and we're told, 'It's okay; just push this through.' Well, I've got news for you, Labor and the Liberals: a growing number of people are not buying what you're selling. A growing number of people are not prepared to take it on trust anymore that you've got the Australian population's best interests at heart, because for too long we have seen people in this place feather their own nests and protect themselves at the expense of everyone else. It is not good enough, when it comes to potential jail time, to say, 'We've got to rush through some legislation,' because there are some by-elections or whatever other reason people happen to pull out of a hat at that particular time. Once we start using national security as the basis for taking away people's rights, and once we start being told, 'You can no longer question governments publicly or else you'll face jail time,' we start going to a very bad place. But we go there even quicker when the parliament, which is meant to scrutinise government, is told, 'Here's 50 pages of amendments; just vote it through and we'll rush it through very, very quickly because of some spurious reason that we invented last night.' I've seen the recommendations that have come out of the review into this bill. Many of them are good and will make a bad bill better. But we as parliamentarians are entitled to look through the amendments that we've been given and work out whether they live up to those recommendations. We've seen things rushed through this place before that have had very, very significant consequences. When things are done quickly, when they're done on the basis of a backroom deal, they get denied the scrutiny that we are entitled to and that this parliament is meant to be here to do. So I ask Labor and the government to give this bill the time to go through a proper and open inquiry, to now allow these amendments that they've cooked up in a back room together to be looked at by all of the organisations who have very legitimate concerns about this bill. The Greens have legitimate concerns about this bill, including what it does to freedom of speech in this country and what it does to the right to dissent. Amnesty has concerns about this bill. GetUp! has concerns about this bill. Lawyers have concerns about this bill. People say, 'Yes, we understand that we need to take steps to protect our national security,' but they also say, 'It should never come at the expense of trading away the basic principles of individual rights and the rules of law that define us as a society.' If these new amendments to a very bad bill are as good as you, the government, say then give us the time to go over them and to let everyone comment on them and inquire into them, because these almost 50 pages of amendments are an admission that the bill was bad to begin  with and had to be amended to within an inch of its life. Now that we've seen those amendments, give us a chance to scrutinise them, because, if they don't do what you say then you've sold us all out and taken everyone for a ride. So, at the very least, I say to these people who have cooked up these amendments: put them out to public scrutiny so we can work out whether they do what you say and so that we can then work out how to vote on the bills and whether the bills should be voted on differently and separately after you've amended them back and forth. But if what we're being asked to do is just take it at face value that Labor and the Liberals-the parties that lock up refugees offshore and keep them out of sight and out of mind-have now come up with a wonderful scheme to protect our rights, well, sorry, I don't believe you. I don't believe you, and I bet a bunch of other people don't either. When the starting point is that doing something that affects Australia's national interests and its economic interests can potentially land you in jail, I think most people in this country would want to know that every last 'I' has been dotted and every last 'T' has been crossed before we sign off on a bill like that. Many of them, myself included, probably wouldn't support the bill being passed, but, at the very least, everyone would agree that something that so fundamentally affects people's rights in this country ought to be subject to proper scrutiny. If you want to know why this place and politicians have an increasingly bad reputation and why people don't trust us, you need look no further than this bill. We are being asked, yet again, to just accept a backroom deal that has been done, to take it at face value and to whack it through the whole parliament in a day or so. That is not good enough. The Attorney General should explain why such a significant piece of legislation can't go through the usual process of scrutiny by the usual Senate committees and allow other people to come in and have a look at it. He may well have struck a deal with the opposition-he may well have done all of that-but the public haven't yet had a chance to look over this and, worse, parliamentarians haven't either. I think it is outrageous that we are being asked to debate, and to vote in just a few minutes on, amendments that we were given maybe half an hour or so ago-when we're dealing with bills which, if passed, may result in people going to jail. I think the starting principle should be: you are entitled to dissent against a government; you are entitled to hold a government to account; and you are entitled to do things that the government may even say are against the country's interests-if what you're doing is trying to uphold human rights, if what you're doing is to trying to make sure climate change doesn't devastate us, and if what you're doing is trying to make sure there is some accountability and integrity in parliament. If the test becomes, 'Are you embarrassing the government in the international sphere?' then we're all in strife, because then it means you can't stand up to deals that governments do with each other, and you can't hold governments to account for human rights abuses, for environmental abuses or for abuses of their population. That is the road that we are going down. And so I plead with the opposition and with the government, one last time, to allow the full scrutiny of this bill, all its amendments and the associated bill; to not rush this through the parliament; and to give civil society in Australia, and everyone who is going to have their rights diminished by this legislation, time to fully digest it.  Deputy Speaker, by thanking all of my parliamentary colleagues for their contributions to the debate on these two bills that we are considering cognately, the National Security Legislation  Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Bill 2017, which is known as the EFI bill, and the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Bill 2017, which has become known as the FITS Bill. These two bills have been considered in detail by several parliamentary committees, and I thank all of the committees for their contributions. I would particularly like to express my thanks to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, the joint committee, for their detailed consideration of these two bills. The work of the joint committee was critical in forming the deliberations of government on the necessity and the effectiveness of the critical offences provided for in the EFI bill and the ways to improve the operation of those offences, as well as on the scope of the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme and its best and most effective operation. I would like to offer specific praise, which is appropriately recorded here, for the parliamentary joint committee chair and its deputy chair and to the shadow Attorney-General, whose dealings with my office have been temperate and skilled and have been conducted in the best of faith. The government has amended the explanatory memorandums and will move amendments to each of the bills to implement recommendations from committee consideration of the bills. I therefore present a replacement explanatory memorandum to the National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Bill, which responds to issues raised by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights in its Report 3 of 2018; by the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills in Scrutiny Digest 4 of 2018; and by the PJCIS in the Advisory report on the National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Bill 2017, tabled on 7 June 2018. I also present a replacement explanatory memorandum to the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Bill, which responds to the concerns raised by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights in its Report 3 of 2018; by the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills in Scrutiny Digest 3 of 2018; and by the PJCIS in the Advisory report on the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Bill 2017, tabled on 25 June 2018. I also present the government response to the Advisory report on the National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Bill 2017. I also present the government response to the Advisory report on the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Bill 2017. With respect to the EFI bill, it's the case that covert interference and espionage by nation states are an unfortunate but long standing global reality and that they have the potential to cause immense harm to our national sovereignty, to the safety of our people, to our economic prosperity and to the very integrity of our democracy. To counter this threat, Australia must have a robust, modern legislative framework to ensure our law enforcement and national security agencies are sufficiently empowered to investigate and disrupt malicious foreign interference. The reforms in the EFI bill are comprehensive. They represent the most significant counterintelligence reforms since the 1970s in Australia, and the measures in the EFI bill will fundamentally reshape our national security offences to protect Australia's sovereignty, its information and the democratic principles and values that underpin our society. The EFI bill will strengthen criminal offences targeting espionage, official secrets, sabotage, treason and other offences against the government, and it will introduce, for the first time, new offences targeting foreign interference and economic espionage by foreign actors.  This is the 11th tranche of reforms to our national security legislation framework, but in scale, importance and complexity it completely eclipses the preceding changes. With respect to the issue of espionage, the EFI bill includes comprehensive new espionage offences that are designed to capture the full range of conduct undertaken and designed to compromise sensitive information and prejudice our national security. These offences will criminalise a broad range of dealings with information, including possessing or receiving information, and protect a broader range of information, including some appropriately unclassified material. The new offences will target not just the person who discloses the relevant information but also the actions of the foreign principal who receives the relevant information. The EFI bill will also, for the first time, criminalise soliciting or procuring a person to engage in espionage and will introduce a new preparation or planning offence which will allow law enforcement agencies to intervene at an earlier stage to prevent harmful conduct from occurring. The EFI bill will also introduce an offence criminalising economic espionage or the theft of trade secrets, which will apply to dishonest dealings with trade secrets on behalf of a foreign government principal. Until this point, astonishingly and dangerously, no criminal offence in Australia existed to criminalise economic espionage of the type defined in this bill. Government amendments to the espionage offences and the EFI bill will narrow the scope of the offence at section 91.3-that being dealing with security-classified informationremove the classification of strict liability to elements of the offences, introduce a prior publication defence and require the Attorney-General's certification that information was appropriately security classified prior to prosecution. Government amendments will also provide further clarity to the offences by narrowing the definition of 'security classification' and defining key terms such as 'prejudice to national security' and 'advantaging the national security of a foreign country'. With respect to foreign interference, the EFI bill will introduce, for the first time, a suite of foreign interference offences into the Criminal Code of the Commonwealth. These offences will complement espionage offences by criminalising a range of other harmful conduct undertaken by foreign principals who seek to interfere with Australia's political, governmental or democratic processes to support their own intelligence activities or to otherwise prejudice Australia's national security. The foreign interference offences will apply where a person's conduct is covert or deceptive, involves threats or menaces, or does not disclose the fact that conduct is undertaken on behalf of a foreign principal. Government amendments to the foreign interference offences will clarify that the offence of supporting a foreign intelligence agency is limited to providing material support. With respect to secrecy, the EFI bill contains a suite of new Commonwealth secrecy offences which replace sections 70 and 79 of the Commonwealth Crimes Act. The new secrecy offences will apply if the information disclosed is inherently harmful, such as security-classified information, or would otherwise cause demonstrable harm to Australia's national interests. Government amendments to the bill will ensure that there are separate offences that apply with respect to secrecy to Commonwealth officers and nonCommonwealth officers, with the offences applying to non-Commonwealth officers being narrower in scope and attracting lower penalties.

6,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS," The debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 43. The debate may be resumed at a later hour, when the minister will have leave to continue. NA Status Resolution Support Services",40
7,Ms KEARNEY,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Australia is about to become a country whose so-called leaders are willing to cut a vital form of assistance that will force people into destitution and see children end up on the street. Minister Dutton and the Prime Minister are about to cut the Status Resolution Support Services, without any legislative redress. All they need is one stroke of their red pens. Many people currently in Australia waiting for a decision about their visa or protection status are about to lose a tiny amount of financial support, support that is less than Newstart, that allows them to eat, be clothed and be housed while they learn English or look for a job. It is not their fault that their protection status is in limbo. They are waiting on the Minister for Home Affairs's department to do its job. I have spoken to people who have been waiting nearly a decade for their cases to be finalised. It is not their fault that they cannot find work. Work is hard enough for anyone to find these days. The fault lies with this terrible government. Let's be clear: the people who rely on SRSS are people who want to make a go of it here. They want to be productive members of our community, they want to be part of the Australian way of life and they want to be good neighbours, to put in and make good. They are exactly the same mould of people who have come through hard times, like so many of us, to find a place of safety. They are tough, brave and resilient, but the minister wants to break them, demonise them and kick them when they are down, and Australians are not like that. The Australians I know would always give someone a start in the hope they make the most of it. Beaumaris Secondary College Mr TIM WILSON (Goldstein) (13:31): Today we celebrate last Saturday's opening of Beaumaris Secondary College. After the old 'Sandy College' campus fell into disrepair, a vision for a modern standalone Beaumaris Secondary College was the answer. Hundreds of residents attended: parents and grandparents, former students and aspiring ones, as well as state Sandringham MP Murray Thompson, Liberal candidate Brad Rowswell, Bayside Mayor Laurie Evans and fellow southern ward councillor Clarke Martin. The official ceremony, led by school captains Alice Tedstone and Fin Burgess, acknowledged former 'Sandy College' teacher Bob Whiteway OAM, followed by the opening by the member for Mordialloc, with the school's foundation principal, Debby Chaves. My husband and I were fortunate to be given a tour by passionate School Council President Steve Pearce. The pride in the new school facilities was clear in the smiles and the smart uniforms that the year 7 students wore, and I'm proud to say I'm sporting one of their ties today. Equally exciting is the school's partnership with the Melbourne Cricket Club, brought about by the leadership of the member for Sandringham, which led to co-investment in ovals and sports facilities for the school and the community. No single person owns Beauy Secondary's success. It is a victory for the Beauy community. Congratulations to everyone  involved and best of luck to the year 7 students' first intake and for all future intakes of students to come. Congratulations. Child Sexual Abuse Ms O'NEIL (Hotham) (13:33): I have the great privilege of representing Chrissie Foster in this parliament. With her late husband, Anthony, Chrissie has been one of the most vocal and effective advocates for victims of sexual abuse. Chrissie's willingness to turn her life to the protection of Australian children is nothing short of extraordinary. I rise to highlight a case she has drawn to my attention. One recommendation of the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse is that the confessional seal, as it is called, should be broken in cases where a child is in danger. Doctors, nurses and teachers are subject to mandatory reporting of child sexual abuse. Catholic priests are not. I believe that must change. I want to draw to the parliament's attention the case of a priest, Michael MCArdle, who pleaded guilty in 2003 to sexually abusing generations of Australian children. This person confessed 1,500 times to 30 different priests over 25 years. He swears that each time, instead of being told to get treatment, or the police being notified, he was told to go home and pray. I call on MPs around the country to make themselves aware of this case. I respect the role of the church and the act of confession and I deeply respect religious freedom, but I think you draw the line at sheltering child abusers. In the past, institutions such as the church have been too complicit in turning a blind eye to these heinous crimes. That must change. La Trobe Electorate: Queen's Birthday Honours",40
8,Mr WOOD,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise to congratulate Queen's Birthday honours recipients in La Trobe. I congratulate Professor Timothy Charles Lindsey AO, from Emerald, for his distinguished service to international relations, particularly in promoting understanding between Indonesia and Australia, as an academic and to legal education in Islamic law. He is the Foundation Director of Melbourne Law School's Centre for Indonesian Law, Islam and Society. Professor Lindsey is also a Malcolm Smith Professor of Asian Law and a Redmond Barry Distinguished Professor. He is the founding editor of the Australian Journal of Asian Law. Congratulations, Professor Lindsey. I'd also like to congratulate Queen's Birthday honours recipient Mr Frank Edward Stamford OAM, from Emerald, for his service to rail transport history. Mr Stamford, whose love of trains was inherited from his uncle and father, said that it was a trip to Powelltown that left him with a desire to ensure that the history of railways and the industry they serve did not disappear into the past. He has dedicated his life to this cause. Mr Stamford has also worked with Puffing Billy helping to resuscitate the Climax steam engine, as well as helping the reconstruction of the track from Lakeside to Gembrook in the 1990s, which all families enjoy. Congratulations, Mr Frank Edward Stamford OAM from Emerald. FIFA World Cup",41
9,Mr KEOGH,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," There has been commentary in recent days about the pronunciation of names, countries and locations as part of SBS's brilliant coverage of this year's FIFA World Cup. I grew up watching the World Cup on SBS with the dulcet tones of Les Murray, who set the important legacy of ensuring that Australian audiences, no matter their background, would hear the names of players and countries said correctly. As an Irish  Australian growing up in what was at that time a very white community, these were not names and pronunciations I was used to. Here in Australia, as in many other Anglo-speaking countries, we pronounce my name as 'key-oh'. I, like many other families who have moved to Australia over the centuries, have had my name badly mispronounced. In fact, the Irish pronunciation is actually 'keogh'. I know Lucy Zelic and Craig 'Foz' Foster-my apologies for my mispronunciation-addressed this issue head-on yesterday. I want to congratulate them for that. My community is becoming more and more ethnically diverse and it is through this increasing diversity that our community and our nation become stronger and more prosperous economically, socially and culturally. SBS's World Cup coverage helps us to all better engage and understand our communities. I extend my best wishes and support to the Socceroos as they take on Peru tonight. I think I speak for us all when I say that we would like to see Tim Cahill take to the pitch during the game as well. May you continue to go far in the tournament, just as the Matildas have done in theirs. We hope for a win. We also hope for a French win. Good luck. North Sydney Electorate: Gallery Lane Cove + Creative Studios",41
10,Mr ZIMMERMAN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," My electorate has always been home to some of Sydney's most important contributors to the cultural life of our city-be it writers, musicians or artists. Inspired by our harbourside location, it's a tradition that dates back thousands of years, as the rock carvings of the Cammeraygal people still remind us in places like Balls Head. It's a tradition that is alive and well today. This was evident at the opening of the new Gallery Lane Cove + Creative Studios, which I attended last weekend. I want to congratulate Lane Cove Council for their vision and work to support local artists through the creation of this new centre and the studio committee for their work in bringing it to fruition. The studio is located in the heart of Lane Cove in a building that started life as a bicentennial project. It was originally a community centre. It has now been entirely converted to a creative space, which I know will be well used by the local community. The new facility provides space for pottery, printmaking, photography, textiles and other arts activities, supported by teaching rooms and artist-in-residence spaces. Some of the most important local artists have been recognised through the naming of different studios within the building, including Elizabeth Rooney, Joy Warren and Guy Warren. As Saturday's open day demonstrated, the studios will be well used by residents of all ages, but it will be particularly important in introducing local children to the various art forms it supports. It will be an important addition to the cultural landscape of our area and a wonderful creative hub. Trade Unions Mr BRIAN MITCHELL (Lyons) (13:38): On Friday, Jasmyn Smith visited Parliament House. Jasmyn is a 21-year-old electrical apprentice from Launceston. She was here for National TAFE Day to speak to MPs about issues faced by young apprentices. Jasmyn is a concerned young citizen seeking to contribute to the national debate on skills and education. She is exactly the sort of person we should be welcoming to this place, but when Jasmyn visited the parliament she was immediately ordered by a security guard to cover up her clothing and, if she could not do that, to take off her top and wear it inside out. Why? It was because her top bore the logo of the CEPU, the Communications, Electrical and Plumbing Union, of which Jasmyn is a proud member. Jasmyn ended up wearing a borrowed jacket.  Unions are democratic, regulated institutions. They have an essential role in civic and public life, and acts such as this seek to delegitimise them. If a standing order that prohibits a display of union logos can be pointed out to me, I would like to see it. Should we now expect members of the Farmers' Federation, the Banking Association or the chamber of commerce to be told to remove their badges? Are footy scarves to be confiscated and lobbyists from Apple and Optus to be ordered shirtless? I stand with Jasmyn and I think she deserves an apology for the way this parliament has treated her. Bennelong Electorate: Local Sporting Champions",42
11,Mr ALEXANDER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," One of the great joys of this job is getting to present grants to young aspiring sportspeople through the Local Sporting Champions grants scheme. This excellent program provides funds for local athletes to travel and compete in tournaments around Australia and internationally. This gives our local competitors the experience that will allow them to become world-beaters. Last month, I was delighted to hand out another eight awards to deserving young athletes. Bennelong's position between two rivers clearly dictates our sporting trends. Six of these athletes are participating in water sports. We will be represented particularly well at the Australian Open Water Swimming Championships, where Robert Thorpe, Benjamin Crook and Eden Horne will be showing what Bennelong's locals can do. Additionally, Tara Ogilvie will be competing in the Hancock Prospecting Australian Swimming Trials, and Charlotte Stanwix and Bianca Camroux will be competing against each other in rival teams at the Australian dragon boating championships. Back on dry land, we have Amy Wolken playing volleyball at the Australian Volleyball Schools Cup and Suzanne Porter at the all schools cricket championship, holding up Bennelong's end in the huge growth in women's cricket in Australia. I would like to congratulate all of these deserving competitors. I hope this small contribution will allow you to chase your goals, make friends and embody the spirit of competition and sport along the way. Congratulations and good luck. Youth Politics Camp",43
12,Ms MCGOWAN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Colleagues, as you know, participation in politics is in the blood of my electorate of Indi. Next week, young people from right across north-east Victoria will come together for the annual Indi Youth Politics Camp, where young people will talk about what works, what doesn't work and how they can value-add to our community. Previous participants are Ashlee Fitzpatrick, who is now a councillor with the rural city of Wangaratta at 19 years old, and Jacqui Hawkins, who is standing for the state seat of Benambra in the next election-all power to them! The youth camp is sponsored by the Victorian government and youth coordinators from my local government areas of Alpine, Benalla, Indigo, Mansfield, Strathbogie, Wangaratta and Wodonga. It is a terrific effort, youth workers. Congratulations to all the organisers, to those attending and to local government, who make it possible. My call-out is to the young people of Indi: get involved, have your say, actively engage, be courageous, use your member of parliament and come to parliament to visit this place, but the most important thing, I think-and I hope you learn it on this camp-is to have the courage to stand up and be the change you want to see. There's no better time than now for leadership. There's no more important time for young people to stand up, have their say, get engaged in politics and help make our electorate of Indi the most wonderful place it can be.  Colonel Light Gardens Senior Citizens Club",43
13,Ms FLINT,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," On Wednesday, 13 June, I attended the Colonel Light Gardens Senior Citizens Club's Devonshire afternoon tea, along with my hard working state colleague Carolyn Habib MP, the member for Elder, and Mayor Glenn Spear and Lady Mayoress Tracey Spear. Along with club members, we were treated to an afternoon of entertainment by cabaret singer Marianne while enjoying scones made by the committed club members. The afternoon tea was just one of many events held by the Colonel Light Gardens senior citizens, who meet weekly at the Colonel Light Gardens RSL for bingo, to hear from guest speakers, to listen to musicians or to take daytrips. We know that being active is vital for healthy ageing. The Colonel Light Gardens senior citizens, with their range of activities, are certainly leading the way. When I spoke to club members, I was not surprised to learn that, like so many local volunteers, they don't just volunteer with senior citizens but also with a range of other community organisations. The Turnbull government know how important it is for our senior Australians to stay active and happy, which is why we have committed over $100 million to tackle isolation, loneliness and mental health issues in older Australians. We have also committed a further $22.9 million to encourage increased physical activity in our senior citizens. Thank you to the Colonel Light Gardens Senior Citizens Club for what they do to provide a support network and activities for the local community. Thank you to President Jill Carlaw and her committee for everything they do for the community. Diabetes",44
14,Dr ALY,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Recently I attended the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation ball in Perth. It was a wonderful night, and they raised a record amount for the development of crucial research towards finding a cure for this debilitating disease. Today, I met with the adorable little Lawrence. Lawrence is five years old and was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at just 13 months old. He has never known life without diabetes. His mum describes type 1 diabetes as a relentless illness, but there is hope for Lawrence to live free of this disease. Hope lies in the kind of research being done by the Clinical Research Network, which was initially funded with bipartisan support, but funding runs out next year. Funding has supported more than 30 projects across 65 institutes, and the next phase will focus on the key areas of trials, translating research into clinical practice and supporting emerging talent in research. It needs a funding commitment of $10 million a year over the next five years. That would support the ongoing funding of this kind of research, which is making a huge difference to the lives of type 1 diabetes kids and their families and is the best hope of producing a cure for this disease. I'd like to thank Lawrence and his mum for coming to visit me, and to also to thank Lawrence for the beautiful picture that he coloured in for me while he was in my office. Breast Cancer Network Australia",44
15,Ms BANKS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," As the Chair of Parliamentary Friends of Women's Health, I'd like to acknowledge the wonderful work of Breast Cancer Network Australia, BCNA, the peak national organisation for Australians affected by breast cancer. It consists of a network of more than 100,000 individual members and 300 member groups. Its CEO, Kirsten Pilatti, leads a wonderful team who work every day to raise awareness of breast  cancer. Their work includes the iconic Field of Women at the MCG. Their work, no matter how large or small, in some way will help make a difference to women's lives and support women through treatment to wellness. With Kirsten's leadership, BCNA's State of the nation report for 2018 was launched last week here in Parliament House to mark BCNA's 20th anniversary. This was a wonderful occasion. The report is a testament recognising the importance of the 18 months of work and consultation that continues under the superb leadership of Kirsten and the team at BCNA, but, importantly, it's also a testament to the thousands of women who contributed to this report and shared their experiences. I thank you. It's your courage and resilience in talking about your experience that will undoubtedly help other women as they journey through the confronting and frightening journey that a cancer diagnosis brings. I am proud to be part of the Turnbull government, which has implemented pragmatic policies and resources that will directly help to save lives and improve women's health. Wyong Hospital",44
16,Ms MCBRIDE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," On 5 July it will be one year since my community on the Central Coast of New South Wales saved Wyong Hospital from privatisation. It was a huge victory for our community. It was a victory for everyone in our community who needs quality, affordable local health care. It was a victory for the thousands of people who rallied and petitioned and travelled to state parliament to make their voices heard. It was a victory for the dedicated people who work in Wyong Hospital. I know how hard they work; I used to be one of them. It was a victory for the people who, over decades, raised money to help build Wyong community hospital so it could serve our local community. I acknowledge the efforts of our state member for Wyong, David Harris, and his colleagues in state parliament David Mehan, Liesl Tesch and Yasmin Catley, and the unions who stood shoulder to shoulder with our community: the HSU, the New South Wales Nurses and Midwives' Association, Unions NSW, the Central Coast Community Union Alliance and ASMOF. The New South Wales Liberals were forced to backflip on their plan to privatise Wyong Hospital and have now been forced to do the right thing and fund a much-needed redevelopment. They have allocated $30 million in this year's budget, but $200 million is needed for this project. It's a start, but the fight's not over yet. The Turnbull government has backed away from its commitment to public hospitals. The states will have to pay more or services will be cut. Only Labor will invest the $2.8 billion needed to properly fund public hospitals across Australia. Only Labor is committed to public hospitals. Mallee Encouragement Award",45
17,Mr BROAD,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," This week Mallee encouragement awards will be going out to our year 12 students. One year-12 student from each school can receive one of these awards. One of the things that's very important to me about this award is that it's not about scholastic achievement; it's about encouraging year 12 students who are doing their best. I want to say to the all the students doing year 12 at the moment: 'Just do your best. It doesn't really matter whether you get the perfect score. What matters is that you do your best. The one thing that you must graduate with is a sense of self-worth, a sense that you've done your best.'  When I was first running for the electorate of Mallee, I wrote two things on my wall: you build wealth by building capacity in people-that was one of the things I said I was going to do-and you build community by bringing people together. The Mallee Encouragement Award is really about building wealth by building capacity in our people. We produce great food in the Mallee and we produce great manufactured goods, but the best thing we produce is our young Australians-young Australians who love Australia and who have a belief in the future. And I want to say to them: 'Even if you didn't get an award, be encouraged. You're doing a great job. You're doing your best. Thank you for your contribution. The future is yours.' Schools Foreign Investment",45
18,Mr GOSLING,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I want to bring to the attention of the House two issues of importance to my seat of Solomon-Darwin and Palmerston in the far north. On Friday I visited Jingili Primary School, which is in my electorate, and I promised young JD, a student there, that I would take his message direct to the Prime Minister. I do so now: JD says, 'We need more funds for our primary school.' With $70 million cut out of education in the Northern Territory, it's a message that I hope the Prime Minister takes on board. Secondly, yesterday I heard the member for Dawson raise some valid concerns about human rights abuses in China, but he then went on to say that the lease of the port of Darwin to the Landbridge Group should be terminated because of what he said were its links to the Chinese government. I point out to the member for Dawson that it was those opposite, the conservative Abbott-Turnbull government, that leased our port to a foreign entity, and I point out that it was his colleagues that took the big dollars for a 99-year lease of our strategic northern port. Where was the member for Dawson when news of this deal surfaced? He was nowhere to be seen. And where was the Prime Minister? He was laughing at the President of the United States, saying that he should read the NT News. Well, this Prime Minister should read the NT News because it says he simply does not care- (Time expired) O'Connor, Mr Damien",46
19,Mr BROADBENT,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise to pay tribute and to acknowledge the dedicated service to the Country Fire Authority by Wonthaggi's own Damien O'Connor. Damien was acknowledged recently with an Australian Fire Service Medal as part of the Queen's Birthday honours. For 33 years Damien has provided selfless service to the CFA and to the communities of the Bass Coast, distinguishing himself as a committed leader. Damien goes out of his way to share his knowledge and skills in order to develop existing and future crew leaders and brigade officers. With a reputation for driving continuous improvement and positive change, Damien is tireless in his endeavours to improve the management of fires and incidents. Damien has said that he doesn't remember a time when he wasn't up at the CFA shed on Sunday with his parents. His family have also long been members of the brigade, with his dad, Phil, a life member and former captain and his mum, Mary, the group communications officer for 20 years. Damien's parents are to be commended for encouraging his volunteerism and highlighting the importance of the CFA in our regional towns and communities. This medal awarded to Damien is the first of its kind for Wonthaggi, and the local community can  be justly proud of him. Damien is to be admired for his prolonged and distinguished service to the CFA and his commitment to improving community safety. Again, I thank Damien for his service and for his great sense of humour. Income Tax",46
20,Ms RYAN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I represent the electorate of Lalor in this place. It's a wonderful electorate. It has 250,000-plus people, mostly families, obviously working families. Less than one per cent of individuals in my electorate earn over $180,000 a year. I want to talk today about what this government has done for the people in the electorate of Lalor. Let's have a quick look at the list: they've cut funding to their schools, they've cut funding to the states to support our public hospitals, they've cut families' incomes through cuts to social services and they want older people in my community to work until they're 70. What do the people of Lalor get from this government after all of these cuts? Ten bucks a week if they're lucky. That's going to get them to, what, change their mind and become wealthy overnight? This Prime Minister and the government across the aisle from me now, as I speak, expect the people in my electorate to accept a $10-a-week increase from a tax cut while government members give themselves $7,000 a year. I've always been a big fan of Peter Garrett, and I think Peter Garrett got it right; the rich are getting richer, and the people in my electorate are getting the picture. Income Tax",47
21,Mr BUCHHOLZ,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," There used to be a time in this country when, if you worked hard, you could get ahead. I believed that, if I worked hard, I could make something of myself. For a long time, it was the Australian dream to work hard, aspire and give it one's all, but not everyone in this place believes in that. Labor doesn't believe in rewarding those people who work hard. Labor doesn't believe in Australians getting ahead. The Leader of the Opposition has been clear that he'll come after the new wealthy: those with incomes over $75,000. That's right, he's going to roll back the tax cuts-the same tax cuts that the Turnbull government delivered. If you're a hard working, experienced teacher, a school principal, a clinic nurse, health professional, a miner or a diesel fitter, you are seen as this country's next elite. He is coming after you. I take the case of a schoolteacher six years out of university. Just as that teacher is working hard to get ahead, at the time when they are starting to settle down, start a family and buy a home, Labor wants to come after their hard-earned wages. Make no mistake: the teacher would become part of Australia's new wealthy, the new elite-the Australians that the opposition leader hates so much. He's coming after you, just as he is going to come after Australian businesses and Australian companies. In contrast, the coalition government says, 'Work hard, aim higher and aspire.' The government values hard work, and we're ensuring through our reforms that if you work hard you can get ahead. Every Labor member in this House voted against- (Time expired) Prime Minister",47
22,Ms RISHWORTH,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," It's so typical of this Prime Minister that when we talk about Australians who want a fair go, like people who want a good education for their kids, people who want decent health care for their family and pensioners who want to be able to afford to put the heater on this winter, this Prime Minister thinks it's all the politics of envy.  He assumes that everyone is just jealous of him. He thinks that everyone wants to live in his bubble. I've been in this parliament since 2007. I saw the member for Wentworth fall for a fake email scam from Godwin Grech. I saw the member for Wentworth oppose the stimulus that saved jobs and livelihoods during the GFC. But I have never-not once-seen him speak with any passion or conviction about the things that matter to ordinary people. I've never seen him fire up about better hospitals, proper aged care or manufacturing jobs. I've never heard him speak with any passion about education, about TAFE or skills or about giving working class kids a chance to go to university. None of that interests him. The only time he gets angry and shouts and carries on is when he's defending the things he cares about: multinational companies and the big four banks. We don't envy the Prime Minister for that; we pity him. Mackay Ring Road",47
23,Mr CHRISTENSEN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I've been accused of doing some crazy thingsthat's probably an understatement, say some of my colleagues-but I never thought I would ever don lycra and dance like Beyonce to 'All the Single Ladies'. But I have to tell you the deed is done, the die is cast and, as Annabel Crabb noted on Insiders, what is seen cannot be unseen. Some have rudely called this a stunt, but the fact is that we have a fantastic program, with the government's funding, with stage 1 of the Mackay Ring Road under construction, though it's more of a right angle than a ring; stage 2 completes the ring. The message to Canberra is: if you like it, you'd better put a ring road on it. I must inform the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport that the threat is real, and more will be revealed with the release of the full version of that lycra-wearing, Beyonce-bopping video if we don't get stage 2 of the project. Stage 1 takes the heavy traffic out of the city and creates about 600 jobs. Stage 2, which has been dubbed by the Deputy Prime Minister 'Beyonce Boulevard', puts a ring on it and provides direct access to the port for heavy traffic from our sugar mills and coal mines. It is definitely something worth dancing about, as embarrassing as that might be, and, through you, Mr Speaker, to the Deputy Prime Minister, I just have one message: if you like it, you've got to put a ring road on it!",48
24,The SPEAKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"In accordance with standing order 43, the time for members' statements has concluded. NA Energy",48
25,Mr SHORTEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. This morning, the environment minister said: 'I would welcome a new coalfired power station.' Does the Prime Minister agree?",48
26,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Coal has a very important role in our energy mix, and I have no doubt it will for many, many years to come-possibly forever. Who can tell? The reality is that we have a technology-agnostic approach to energy policy. The subsidies are coming to an end. The renewable energy target will be complete in 2020. It will all be met. And what we have with the National Energy Guarantee is, for the first time, the combination of abilities to ensure that power is affordable, that it's reliable, that you  have enough dispatchable power to keep the lights on, and, of course, that you meet the Paris commitments that we've entered into. We are already seeing our energy policies working. Already we've seen that the wholesale price of gas has halved in the last 18 months. There was a massive shortage of gas on the east coast of Australia created by the Labor Party, created by a federal Labor government and a Queensland state Labor government, which allowed gas to be exported from the east coast without any regard to the domestic consequences. We've resolved that with additional gas supply. We've already seen the wholesale cost of generation down 30 per cent over the last year. And, finally, we're now starting to see a reduction in the cost of energy for mums and dads, for small businesses, for families. Retail prices are starting to come down for both families and small business. So, we're turning the corner on energy costs-energy costs driven up by the combination of left-wing ideology and Labor incompetence. Ideology and idiocy are a very dangerous combination. That is what the Labor Party brings to economics. Today we've heard in the Leader of the Opposition's latest captain's call, his latest attack or riposte to the member for Grayndler. The member for Grayndler went out and said Labor should be friendly to business. So what does the Leader of the Opposition do? He says to thousands of family-owned small and medium businesses across the country: if he's elected Prime Minister, he's going to jack up their tax. That's what he wants to do. He is going to put at risk millions of Australians' jobs. Not only is he going to put up personal income tax; he's going to put up the tax of the businesses that employ more than half of the Australian private sector workforce.",48
27,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister will resume his seat. The Manager of Opposition Business has the call.,49
28,Mr Burke,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I'm just asking if there can be a passing reference that's relevant to the question about coal-fired power stations. Mr Frydenberg interjecting",49
29,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Minister for the Environment and Energy will cease interjecting. The Manager of Opposition Business makes a valid point of order. There can be a passing reference. I was about to pull the Prime Minister up. That was a very specific question, and it was very specific to coal-fired power stations. Taxation",49
30,Mr CREWTHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister outline to the House how and why lower taxes are an important part of the government's plan for a stronger economy, including in my electorate of Dunkley? Is the Prime Minister aware of alternative approaches, including how higher taxes discourage investments and jobs?",49
31,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the honourable member for his question. We know that lower taxes encourage businesses to invest. We know that lower company tax encourages business to invest and to employ. It supports stronger economic growth. It supports more jobs and higher wages. And every Labor leader, including the gentleman opposite, has made exactly that point in defence of reducing company tax. The member for MCMahon famously wrote a book about it, so committed was he to it-25 per cent tax. The government has already achieved, through the parliament, a reduction in  company tax for businesses with turnover of up to $50 million a year. These are overwhelmingly small and medium businesses, family owned. They employ over half of the private sector workforce. They have been responding to the encouragement we've given by investing and building, and growing their employment. Today I spoke to Wayne Licht, who is one of the owners of Stubbs Constructions in Burnie. It's an 80-year-old firm. Wayne started off in that firm 40 years ago as an apprentice. Aspiration wasn't a mystery to him-no, it wasn't. He worked hard, he wanted to get ahead and now he owns part of the business. His business has a turnover of around $20 million a year. It has 63 employees. Ms Chesters interjecting",49
32,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Bendigo is warned.,50
33,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That business would face, were Labor to become the government, an increase in their tax. This is a strong Tasmanian business. It's the type of business that Tasmanians are proud of: family owned, long standing. It's a construction company. It's building houses, schools and all sorts of facilities there on the north-west, and that is a company that we are backing, as we are backing thousands of other Australian companies. What does the Labor Party have to say to them? 'Pay more tax.' That's what the Leader of the Opposition wants them to do. This announcement was made today by him without any reference to his shadow cabinet or caucus. We remember the moment when the member for MCMahon was asked what Labor's approach to our small and medium family company tax cuts would be, and he said: We have further policy announcements to make which will be in this space … There was no 'we' in the space today. It was just the Leader of the Opposition, with a captain's call, seeking to counterattack against the member for Grayndler. The only job he's interested in is his own. (Time expired) Energy Dr MIKE KELLY (Eden-Monaro) (14:07): My question is to the Prime Minister. The CEO of Snowy Hydro has clearly stated that building new coal-fired power plants 'doesn't stack up', and the chief operating officer has said it would mean Snowy 2.0 is not viable. As the government is the sole shareholder, has advice been sought from Snowy Hydro about the impact of building new coal-fired power plants on the viability of Snowy 2.0?",50
34,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Partisan divisions aside, I cannot thank the honourable member enough for asking me a question about Snowy Hydro. What a great demonstration of Australian engineering! What a great example of the vision of Labor and coalition governments in the past! Snowy Hydro 2.0 is the next stage that is going to deliver thousands of jobs into the Eden-Monaro electorate and provide secure, dispatchable, baseload power into the future. The honourable member referred to some remarks by Paul Broad. He is entitled to his opinion, but we have a policy that is entirely technology agnostic. The National Energy Guarantee provides no disincentives for anyone to build a new coal-fired power station or refurbish an existing one, any more than it provides a disincentive for people to build more gas or, indeed, more hydro. Mr Hart interjecting",50
35,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Bass is warned.,51
36,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What it does is prioritise dispatchability, which had been sadly missing from all of the green-Left energy policies of the Labor Party. That, of course, supports thermal power. As far as Snowy Hydro 2.0 is concerned, I'd remind the honourable member of this: Snowy Hydro 2.0 will be a big baseload customer of all providers of energygenerators, renewables, but including coal-fired power. A power station that runs 24 hours a day, like a coal-fired power station, does not have the same demand 24 hours of the day. A big pumped hydro scheme will be buying power from coal-fired generators in the off-peak times and will provide that off-peak baseload demand. So it is one that will provide support right across the industry, but the bottom line is: let the market decide on which technology to determine. Let the market decide. What we are prioritising is affordability, reliability and meeting those emissions reduction targets. We can do all three. The NEG does it. It will bring down energy prices for the reasons that Paul Broad has advanced. It will bring down energy prices, and that is going to be good for families, it's going to be good for businesses, large and small, and above all it's going to be great for Australian jobs. Taxation",51
37,Ms LANDRY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer outline to the House why it is important to have lower and more competitive taxes as part of a plan for a stronger economy? Is the Treasurer aware of the impact of different approaches?,51
38,Mr MORRISON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Capricornia for her question. Once again, this year's budget was a plan for a stronger economy, and lower and more competitive taxes for individuals and for businesses are a key part of that plan for a stronger economy. Substantially, that plan has been legislated. Personal income tax relief of $144 billion has been legislated by the parliament. Our relief for small and medium-sized businesses up to $50 million has been legislated by the parliament. Our plan for a stronger economy is being implemented. We're getting on with the job, and we obviously want to see the balance of that plan for a stronger economy by ensuring all businesses have access to competitive taxes because of the jobs that depend on them. We know that Labor is going to roll back $70 billion worth of tax relief for personal income taxpayers in Australia. They're going to continue to oppose the extension of more competitive tax rates for all businesses. But one thing the Leader of the Opposition, the leader of the Labor Party, announced today in his captain's call was that he is going to remove the tax relief for businesses between $10 million and $50 million. Unilaterally he went out there after the end of the speech. The member for MCMahon was nowhere to be seen. Normally, when they announce tax policy, they're there side by side, but not today. He went out there and he just snuck it out there. For businesses with $10 million to $50 million in turnover they are rolling it back. That's 20,000 businesses paying higher taxes. There are 1½ million Australians who work for those 20,000 companies. That's an average of 75 people working at each of those businesses, and the leader of the Labor Party thinks there's some multinational juggernaut. Well, GP Graders at Mount Waverley have a turnover between $10 million and $50 million. They've got 90 staff. ModularWalls in my own electorate, in Kurnell, have 50 employees. And, of course, in the member for Capricornia's electorate, as I've reminded the  House before, Coxon's Radiators have 35 employees. That's not a multinational. That's not the top end of town. Those are hard working Australian family businesses in regional Australia, and the leader of the Labor Party wants to kick them in the guts by jacking up their taxes. They're not the big end of town; they're family businesses. We used to have leaders of the Labor Party who talked about the ladder of opportunity. Do you remember that? Well, this Labor leader is all about the snake of envy. That's what he's about. Australians will slide down the totem pole under this Leader of the Opposition's policiesMr Gosling interjecting",51

41,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Moreton is warned. Energy,52
42,Mr BUTLER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. Just last month, the chair of the Energy Security Board repeated the consensus view that there would be absolutely no way that anybody would be financing a new coal-fired power generation plant and that this was not contentious at a factual level. So how can the Prime Minister today tell the parliament that coal-fired power might be around forever? Is there nothing this Prime Minister won't do to stop the members for Warringah and Hughes from crossing the floor and undermining his government?",52
43,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Mr Speaker, I'm not quite sure what the honourable member believes qualifies him to have some sort of infallible crystal ball, but, over the years, I've found that predictions about technology are often mistaken. So you're better off recognisingMr Butler interjecting",52
44,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Port Adelaide has asked his question.,52
45,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The reality is that coal-fired power is a big part of our energy mix at the moment. It will be a big part for a very long time, and may very well be forever. We'll find out in many years to come. The reality is, in the here and now, we need to have cheaper and more reliable power. And the honourable member knows better than most that in his state that combination of left-wing Labor ideology led by the now dismissed Labor government, dismissed by the people of South Australia, and utter incompetence resulted in his state having the most expensive and the least reliable electricity in Australia. We are delivering more reliable and more affordable power because we are working on it with the benefit of engineering and economics. I know they are strangers to the honourable member, but, believe me, they are the guides to a more affordable and reliable energy future for all Australians.  NA The SPEAKER (14:16): I would like to inform the House that present in the gallery this afternoon is a delegation from Vanuatu led by the Minister of Infrastructure and Public Utilities. On behalf of the House, I extend a very warm welcome to you. And we also have joining us this afternoon a delegation from Fiji. On behalf of the House, I also extend a warm welcome to you. Honourable members: Hear, hear! NA Tasmania: Government Procurement",52
46,Mr WILKIE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, federal government departments are increasingly entering into single contracts with national suppliers at the expense of smaller Tasmanian companies, hoping to supply goods and services exclusively or principally in Tasmania. The result of this discriminatory contracting is often substandard and expensive goods and services because Tasmania is obviously a unique regional and rural market physically dislocated from the mainland. Quite simply, Tasmania is entirely unfamiliar to many national suppliers who don't even have a presence there. Prime Minister, will you review this matter so that Australians relying on federal government agencies located in Tasmania and Tasmanians relying on local federal government services start getting a better deal?",53
47,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I want to thank the honourable member for his question. In March 2017-so, last year-the government made significant changes to procurement rules to maximise competition and ensure that Australian businesses of all sizes are able to compete for government contracts on a level footing. We want to see more government work going to local businesses, and there are many reasons why that should be done-accountability being one of them, local jobs being another, the connectedness and engagement with the community being vitally important. Of course, taxpayer value for money is the primary test. Naturally, it is taxpayers' money, which must be spent as prudently as possible. The new Commonwealth Procurement Rules require that benefits to the Australian economy be considered when assessing the value-formoney of tenders for non-construction procurements above $4 million and construction procurements above $7½ million. And potential suppliers to government will continue to be treated equitably and cannot be discriminated against based on their size, location or ownership. More broadly, the government is backing business to create local jobs, including in Tasmania, where there are over 1,200 businesses with a turnover between $2 million and $50 million. One of them that I mentioned a moment ago, Stubbs Constructions in Burnie, is a good example of the type of Tasmanian business that the member for Denison should be fighting for as he stands up and condemns, as I trust he will, Labor's disgraceful announcement today that it is going to jack up the company tax on small and medium familyowned businesses, including in Tasmania. The honourable member knows that Tasmania is doing better than it has for many years. It has a good Liberal government, under Will Hodgman. It's benefiting from our pro-growth policies here in Canberra. We have provided real incentive to those Tasmanian businesses and others like them around the country. In this captain's call aimed at the member for Grayndler,  a rebuke to the member for Grayndler, out of the indignation and vanity of the Leader of the Opposition, he's announced today, without any consultation, that those very Tasmanian businesses are going to have to pay more tax under a Labor government. The honourable member should be well aware of that and should be saying to his constituents what a shocking threat to their jobs the Labor Party represents. NA The SPEAKER (14:20): We also have present in the gallery the Hon. Ben Carroll, Victorian Minister for Industry and Employment. On behalf of the House I extend a warm welcome to you as well. Honourable members: Hear, hear! NA Economy",53
48,Ms BANKS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment. Will the minister update the House on how the government's plan for lower taxes, jobs and growth through trade and investment is helping grow the economy? Is the minister aware of any alternative plans?",54
49,Mr CIOBO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I'm grateful for the question, because it does highlight the fact that on this side of the House we are so absolutely committed to and focused on making sure we open up more export opportunities for Australian businesses. We've done that in a number of ways. We have opened up important markets, export markets, that are helping to power Australia's economic growth and job creation-like China, Japan, Korea and the TPP-11, which the Leader of the Opposition said was a vanity project and a waste of time, and the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement, which the Leader of the Opposition called a dud deal. But we continue to open up these opportunities because we know they're good for Australia's businesses. We know the Export behaviour and business performance report showed that Australian export businesses pay their employees more and increase wages at a faster rate. Ms Butler interjecting",54
50,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Griffith is warned.,54
51,Mr CIOBO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Many of these export businesses are small and medium-sized enterprisesbusinesses like King Island Kelp, which exports to the EU and other markets, a great example in north-west Tasmania of a business that's exporting to the world, helping to drive our economy and helping to make sure that it creates jobs. The question was: are there alternatives? Well, there are alternative approaches, because what we saw today in the captain's call from the Leader of the Opposition was a decision to abandon those small to medium-sized enterprises, a decision to walk away, despite the fact that historically this Leader of the Opposition backed it. He actually said in 2011, 'Reducing the corporate tax rate will then flow on to workers in the form of higher wages.' Now we see a backflip on tax, but he's combining that backflip with a triple rollback-a rollback on small-business tax cuts, a rollback on personal income tax cuts and a rollback on border protection. They're going to take away income tax cuts from nine million Australians. They're going to hit 20,000 businesses, businesses that employ 1.5 million Australians, with a  tax sledgehammer. But the fact is that not all are like that on the Labor side. There are one or two over there who have a different view. We have, of course, the member for Grayndler.",54

54,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister will refer to members by their correct titles.,55
55,Mr CIOBO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Certainly. We know that that member has a different view. You see, he sees himself as the new Messiah of the Australian Labor Party. He wants to lead them into the Promised Land. But, like in the Life of Brian, on that side you've got the opposition frantically ringing up the backbench, saying, 'He's not the Messiah; he's just a very naughty boy,' because we can see today they're opening the gulf between the two of them. He too claims he's not the Messiah, but, like that immortal line from Monty Python, 'Only the true Messiah denies his divinity.' The fact is: we now see the splits opening up on Labor. He's going hard left and he's trying to be more centrist. (Time expired) Energy",55
56,Mr BUTLER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is again to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware that the Energy Council has called new coal-fired power stations 'uninvestable' and said the industry has no plans to start building new coal-fired power stations? Energy Australia has said coal-fired power 'is a legacy technology'; 'it's a solution that my grandfather would have built'. AGL has said, 'We do not believe any private capital will invest in new coal plants.' And Origin has said, 'It is unlikely we would be an investor in new coal.' So how on earth can the Prime Minister suggest, twice today in parliament, that coal-fired power might be around forever? (Time expired)",55
57,Mr FRYDENBERG,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I haven't had a question from the member for Port Adelaide for 250 days. He lost his seat, he lost the presidency and now he's lost his relevance. The reality is, as the Prime Minister said, coal is a critical part of our energy mix. It makes up around 70 per cent of the capacity in the National Electricity Market. And the member for Port Adelaide knows what happened in South Australia when the Northern Power Station closed-the wholesale prices went up by more than 80 per cent. And the member for Maribyrnong now turns his back, because it was a Labor government in Victoria that tripled the royalties on the coal-fired power stations of Victoria and saw the closure of Hazelwood-which also saw wholesale prices in Victoria go up by 80 per cent. Now it's up to the Labor Party to tell the blue-collar workers in the mines and power stations across the country that Labor policies will close them down and put them out of a job. Will they go to the electorate of Flynn and tell the 230 workers at the Gladstone power plant that under their policy they will be out of a job? Will they go to the electorate of Gippsland and tell the 500 workers at the Yallourn power plant that under the Labor Party's emissions intensity scheme they'll lose their jobs? And will they go to the member for Shortland's electorate and tell the 300 workers there at Vales Point that under the Labor Party's policy they'll lose their jobs? When it comes to coal, we know that we can't trust what the Labor Party says-because the member for Shortland is the shadow assistant minister for climate change, and he proudly put this on his website about the Carmichael mine: 'I welcome the jobs it will provide in Queensland.'

61,Mr FRYDENBERG,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He's gone to the same school of websites that the member for Barton went to, because now his website says the following: 'I remain opposed to the Carmichael mine.' So the Leader of the Opposition will go to the miners in Mackay and tell them he supports coal. He will then go to the baristas of Batman and tell them that coal has no future. Don't look at what Labor says; look at what Labor does. Only the coalition can be trusted to deliver more reliable and affordable power. Taxation",56
62,Mr WOOD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Revenue and Financial Services. Will the minister update the House on why it's important to have a tax system that rewards all Australians, including in my electorate of La Trobe? Is the minister aware of any threats posed by alternative schemes?",56
63,Ms ODWYER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Higgins-Minister for Revenue and Financial Services, Minister for Women and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service) (14:28): I thank the member for La Trobe for his question. Like those on this side of the chamber, he knows that 94 per cent of Australians, under our Personal Income Tax Plan, will pay no more than 32.5 cents in the dollar, which means hard working Australians will be able to keep more of the income that they earn. He also knows that we on this side of the chamber encourage enterprise. We believe in having an enterprise tax plan that will ensure that businesses in Australia will be able to-again-employ more Australians, invest more in their businesses, and remain competitive in our global economy. And it will allow businesses, including around 16,000 small and medium-sized enterprises in his electorate of La Trobe, to be able to grow, to invest and to pay their workers even more. These are tax policies that reward hard work and aspiration. Those opposite used to believe in enterprise and aspiration, but, sadly, no more. They have a different view on these policies, because they voted against lower, simpler and fairer taxes for millions of Australians. Andthanks to an absolute cluster of a captain's call today from the Leader of the Opposition-they have confirmed that they will, in fact, roll back tax benefits for small and medium-sized enterprises, small and medium-sized enterprises that, by the way, employ around 1.5 million Australians. Do they not understand that smalland medium-sized enterprises make up 97 per cent of all businesses in this country? They are the hard working engine room of our Australian economy. They consist of mechanics, restauranteurs, builders and car dealers. These are the small, medium-sized and family businesses that those opposite want to impose higher taxes on. According to the Leader of the Opposition, with his cluster of a captain's call today, they are apparently the top end of town. I can't believe it. These are the top end of town. He wants to hike taxes on these small, family-sized enterprises, he wants to hike taxes on the people they employ and he also wants to hike taxes on retirees with his mega retirees tax. Do they not understand that these are the hard working people of Australia creating opportunity in our economy? They are the people that we should back and support. They are  employing fellow Australians, yet those opposite would punish them. Only the coalition can be trusted to protect their interests. The Leader of the Opposition cannot be trusted. Taxation",56
64,Mr SHORTEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. It's reported that a deal between One Nation and the government to give big business an $80 billion handout will be more likely after the upcoming by-elections. Why is the government negotiating with One Nation to give big business an $80 billion handout after the by-elections? Don't voters in Longman, Braddon, Mayo, Fremantle and Perth deserve to know the truth about this government teaming up with One Nation to give the banks $17 billion?",57
65,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," The honourable member asked me about the voters in Longman being entitled to hear the truth. That is absolutely right. They are, and they did not get the truth from the Leader of the Opposition on 22 June when he said on radio that you could not get chemotherapy on Bribie; you'd have to go to Brisbane to get it. You couldn't get it anywhere near Caboolture. A lady called Patsy rang into the radio program and sought to correct the Leader of the Opposition. It is one of the most excruciating calls to listen to-the patronising way in which he talks over Patsy, cuts her off, does not want to listen to her, and finally says, 'Patsy, I can't see why you're so frustrated.' Patsy spoke for all Australians-and certainly all the voters in Longman-when she said, 'I'm frustrated because you're not telling the truth, for God's sake.' Mr Tim Wilson interjecting",57

76,Ms HENDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Small and Family Business, the Workplace and Deregulation. Will the minister update the House on how the government's tax cuts benefit small and family businesses, including in my electorate of Corangamite? How would small and family businesses suffer if these tax cuts were repealed?",58
77,Mr LAUNDY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Reid-Minister for Small and Family Business, the Workplace and Deregulation) (14:36): I thank the member for Corangamite for her question and her passion for small and family businesses. Today we've seen the latest demonstration of the ignorance of the Leader of the Opposition when it comes to how small and family businesses in this country operate. One of the most valuable business lessons I have learnt in my life is that you don't live off turnover; a business lives off its profit. Parramatta Road runs right through my electorate, and the Leader of the Opposition would have you believe that Tom and his wife, who are car wholesalers-they flip four to five cars a week at an average of 20 grand a car and are turning over $5.5 million a year-have a big business. They work out of a briefcase and off a mobile phone. The Leader of the Opposition will tell you that Rob and his father, who sell farm equipment in northern New South Wales-they sell bits of gear that average between $2,000 and $500,000 a pop and turn over $25 million a year-have a big business. The reason the Leader of the Opposition doesn't get it is he's never done it. He wants to sully the reputation of the Prime Minister, who, in his life pre-politics, has taken on truckloads of bank debt, employed truckloads of people and paid truckloads of tax. He wants to sully not just the Prime Minister's reputation but the reputation of anyone who's done that. The reality is, when it comes to the Leader of the Opposition, the biggest financial transaction he will undertake in his life is signing his mortgage documents. That's the reality. He wants to run the biggest business in this country with no understanding of how business actually operates. What do small and family businesses do? Like the Prime Minister, like Tom and like Rob and his father have done, they put their family's home on the line. Why? It is to give their children more opportunities than they've had. They are an invaluable part of the local community. That is why, for 4½ years, the Turnbull coalition government have stood with them. That's why, today, we stand shoulder to shoulder with them. That's how we got the result of a million jobs, the highest business confidence and 158,000 small and family businesses net opening in the last 4½ years. That's how you get the numbers.  The Leader of the Opposition doesn't get it because he's never done it. He wants to take an axe to people prepared to put their family home on the line to get their family ahead. That's what aspiration is. We on this side of the House get it. A lot of us have actually done it prepolitics and-who knows?-may go back to doing it post-politics. The Leader of the Opposition has never done it in his life, yet he wants to present himself to the Australian people as an alternative and, at the same time, sully the reputation of someone who gets on. Today, Labor declared war on small and family business-make no bones about it. Taxation",58
78,Ms PLIBERSEK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. Last year, the National Australia Bank made a net profit of about $5 billion but cut 6,000 jobs. Why is the Prime Minister trying to cut a deal with One Nation to reward the big banks with a $17 billion handout? Why do this Prime Minister's arrogant and out-of-touch policies always reward the top end of town while workers get punished?",59
79,Mr MORRISON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the Prime Minister for the opportunity to respond to the question. The Labor Party keep talking about 'the top end of town'. We talked about this yesterday. What the Labor Party are doing by opposing the Turnbull government's Enterprise Tax Plan, which will ensure that Australian businesses pay competitive rates of tax-if we don't make this change, Australia will have the second-highest tax rate of businesses anywhere in the developed world. That's where they want Australia to be. They want Australia to be up there with the second-highest rate of business taxes in the world, and somehow that is supposed to drive our economy forward. As I said yesterday, the top end of town that benefits from what Labor are doing is the top end of town in Manhattan, in San Francisco, in Dallas, in Houston, in Singapore, in Hong Kong, in London and in all of these places, because what the Labor Party want to do is ensure that the businesses that Australian businesses compete with will have lower rates of tax than Australia will. The Labor Party want to send jobs offshore; they want to send investment offshore. This is the Labor Party that do not understand, as the Minister for Small and Family Business has just demonstrated, how the economy can grow. We are now the absolute inheritors of the ladder of opportunity. We have always been that. We have always understood the aspiration of people who have been able to get ahead in lifeno better demonstrated than by the Prime Minister himself, working away over many, many years. We understand that. But the snaky way that this Labor Party go about economic policy, setting one group of Australians against another, demonising one while trying to pretend they're doing something for the other-it's very snaky. I was talking about the boa constrictor before-the one that suffocates and constricts the blood supply to the body as it defeats it. That's what Labor's policy will do to our economy. But there are plenty of other snaky characters-plenty of them. If you look at the king brown snake, it has the largest recorded venom output of any in the world. Who does that remind me of? The Leader of the Opposition!",59

Taxation Infrastructure",59
82,Mr GEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport. Will the Deputy Prime Minister update the House on how tax relief for hard working Australians and record infrastructure spending is benefiting communities around Australia? And do alternate ideas pose risks for hard working Australians trying to get ahead?,60
83,Mr MCCORMACK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Riverina-Deputy Prime Minister, Minister for Infrastructure and Transport and Leader of The Nationals) (14:42): I'll happily update the House on that. Hardworking Australians should be able to keep more of their money. The Liberal and National government's policy is as simple as that. The member for Calare is part of a government rewarding hard work and opportunity, rewarding hard working Australians-a government helping them to get ahead: a government backing their aspirations. Ms Plibersek interjecting",60
84,Mr MCCORMACK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It's not mystifying, Member for Sydney. That's why we legislated once-in-a-generation tax relief for workers last week, due to take effect from 1 July. That's why we cut the small business tax rate to its lowest level last year in 77 years. That's what we redefined to help more job-creating local small businesses qualify for tax relief-small businesses like that of Angus Barrett, a saddler and leather goods retailer in the member for Calare's electorate in Orange, so he can grow and expand his small business. He can hire more locals. He can put on more people. He and his wife, Sarah, already have 16 hard working staff. But Angus and Sarah aspire to keep growing and to keep hiring. They want a bigger local business. He told the member for Calare: 'It's impossible to grow, hire more staff, and spend more money on a business if we're hamstrung by taxes.' And he's so right. The Liberals and Nationals are backing the central-west through infrastructure investment, through tax relief and making sure that product gets to market sooner and safer. This includes more than $2.3 million in infrastructure for bridge replacements, including the Browns Creek Road Bridge, which the member for Calare and I visited recently; a $2.5 million upgrade of Bathurst Airport; and $10 million for Velocity Park under the Building Better Regions Fund. Around Australia, our tax cuts and our infrastructure investment are creating confidence. They're helping hard working Australians and small businesses to get ahead, like the 12,201 small businesses in the electorate of Longman, throughout places such as Caboolture, Burpengary and Bribie Island. We have legislated tax cuts for all those small businesses in Longman. The member for Calare represents many small businesses. He represents the town of Bathurst. I had great cause the other day to reflect on Bathurst and the sorts of people who come out of Bathurst, such as the great Labor leader Ben Chifley. He was from that great central western New South Wales town. Labor had a leader who was a worker, a railwayman, who wanted to help workers get ahead. He was a leader whose vision became the light on the hill. Gone is the light on the hill. Now we have a light on the Bill-and who's putting a light on the opposition leader? That's right; it's the member for Grayndler. He's putting a light on  the Bill. We know that he has put him in the spotlight. Under the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Maribyrnong, Labor's legacy is in tatters. (Time expired) Taxation",60
85,Mr BOWEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Treasurer. This morning the Treasurer said about his $80 billion big business tax cut: 'I don't consider tax relief a cost to the budget.' Is the government's $80 billion big business tax cut unfunded because the Treasurer believes he can conjure the money out of thin air? Isn't it a fact that spending $80 billion on a big business tax cut just means more cuts to Medicare, schools and the pension? ",61
86,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Barker is warned.,61
87,Mr MORRISON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," 'Reducing company tax … promotes investment, creates jobs and drives growth'-who said that? The member for MCMahon in 2013. The snake charmer over there, the member for Rankin",61
88,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,No. The Treasurer will withdraw that.,61
89,Mr MORRISON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I withdraw. 'Australia would go well out of a lower company rate than it is right now'-that was in 2016. 'Cutting the company tax rate increases domestic productivity and domestic investment. More capital means higher productivity and economic growth and leads to more jobs and higher wages.' That was the Leader of the Opposition. The member for Lilley said: 'Reducing company tax will create new jobs and grow the economy right around the country-to the ultimate benefit of all Australians.' Former Prime Minister Julia Gillard said: 'If you're against cutting company tax, you're against economic growth.' The hide of the member for MCMahon. My point is simply this: we on this side of the House understand that what people earn is their money, and I'm not going to call it a cost or a giveaway when we give them tax relief. The revenue estimates are set out in the budget. The budget returns to balance a year earlier than we projected; net debt turns the corner this year-$30 billion down over the next four years, $230 billion over the next 10 years-unemployment is falling, with more than a million people in jobs; and we've got a AAA credit rating. That's our record. Their record was gross debt running at over 30 per cent. In this budget we've got that down to two per cent. It was 30 per cent under Labor and it's now down to two per cent. No longer under this government are we borrowing to pay for everyday expenditure, like on pensions, schools and hospitals. The only reason we're issuing government securities today is for the defence industry plan, which is creating jobs; for the infrastructure plan, which is creating jobs; and we refuse to raid the Future Fund. We refuse to raid the Future Fund. I look forward to the shadow Treasurer being told what his policy is with the next captain's call from the Leader of the Opposition. Defence Equipment",61
90,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I ask the Minister for Defence Industry to update the House on how equipping the Australian Defence Force with the Triton unmanned aerial vehicle will enhance the capability of defending our national interests. I ask him, secondly, whether he is aware of any approaches that would undermine this.   thank the member for Menzies for his question. Because of the government's excellent management of the economy and because of the Treasurer's management of the budget, we can afford to make announcements like the one we've made today to purchase the first of the Triton unmanned aerial vehicles at a cost of $1.4 billion-the first of six, at a cost of $6.9 billion. Governments like this one can do that because we're managing the budget and managing the economy. Governments like the one that we replaced-the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government-couldn't do that because of the way they couldn't manage the budget or manage the economy. In fact, under Labor, spending on defence dropped to 1.56 per cent of GDP, the lowest since 1938 and the lowest since the last year of appeasement. Because of this government's management of the budget and the economy, we'll get to two per cent of GDP in 2020-a year ahead of schedule, a year ahead of what we had promised-because we're pulling our weight. We want to be a good ally. We want to look after our own national interests. Today we went even further along that road by announcing that we would buy the Triton unmanned aerial vehicles, a capability which means we'll have reconnaissance and surveillance across 10 per cent of the world's surface. One of the most important things we do as a nation, as part of the Five Eyes, is the reconnaissance and surveillance of the Indian Ocean, the Pacific, South-East Asia and, of course, Antarctica. It's an important responsibility. These Tritons will be able to cover that area, working with the Poseidons, which are replacing the Orion aircraft, at a cost of $6.9 billion. That's not all; $2.6 billion of that will be spent here in Australia, growing Australian industry capabilities-the sophisticated, highly technical jobs that we want in an advanced manufacturing economy. Businesses like Ferra Engineering in the member for Bonner's electorate and Mincham Aviation in Adelaide are real businesses that are being given a leg up because of the company tax cuts we managed to deliver. If we can get the rest of our company tax cuts through the Senate, we will be growing the economy, growing jobs and reducing the tax burden. Today the Leader of the Opposition said that he was going to rip those tax cuts away from small and family businesses. It was an absolutely disgraceful captain's call on the part of the Leader of the Opposition, without any consultation. I can tell you it is the beginning of the end for leaders of the opposition when they start thinking they can get away with this stuff. The truth is that he needed to consult with his party room and his shadow cabinet before he decided to throw to the wolves all those small and medium businesses with a turnover of between $2 million and $50 million a year. They need the certainty of tax policy that we are providing. They don't need the Leader of the Opposition. Taxation Ms CATHERINE KING (Ballarat) (14:52): My question is to the Prime Minister. By the time they are fully implemented, stage 3 of the government's personal income tax scheme and its big business handout will cost at least $25 billion a year. Where is the money coming from? Won't this government giving $25 billion to big business and the top 20 per cent of income earners just mean even more cuts to schools, to Medicare and to pensions? ",61
91,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," The Deputy Leader of the Opposition is mystified by aspiration, and the honourable member who has just asked me the question is mystified as to where the money comes from to fund government services. Ms Butler interjecting",63
92,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Griffith will leave understanding order 94(a). The member for Griffith then left the chamber.,63
93,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I'll let the honourable member know that it comes from hard working Australians' income. It comes from Australian businesses making profits and paying tax. It is their energy, their enterprise and their aspiration which drives the Australian economy. Nothing more clearly distinguishes the unreality, the disconnectedness, the out-of-touch nature of modern Labor than the fact that they do not recognise that everything we do hereevery dollar we spend-comes from the efforts of hard working Australian families. It is them-it is their work, it is their money. When we cut taxes, what we are doing is enabling Australians to keep more of their money. The Labor Party thinks it is the government giving them a gift. Well, that's wrong. It is not the government's money; it's hard working Australian families' money. We are able, through good budget management, to pay for all of those essential services, including the ones Labor neglected, like those pharmaceutical benefits listings which were deferred in 2011, as Labor's budget showed. Labor couldn't fund the PBS. Labor neglected those services. We're funding them fully with increasing amounts every year. We're keeping our nation safe, as the minister has just described; we're providing more tax relief to hard working families and Australian businesses and bringing the budget back into balance a year earlier. That is the difference between strong economic management under the coalition versus the shocking performance-the debt and the deficit-and the failure and disappointments of the Labor Party. National Security",63
94,Mr IRONS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Minister for Home Affairs. Will the minister update the House on the importance of a strong and consistent approach to maintaining the integrity of Australia's borders? Is the minister aware of any differing views which may put our borders at risk?,63
95,Mr DUTTON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Dickson-Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Immigration and Border Protection) (14:55): I thank the honourable member for his question. Like all Australians, he's very concerned about making sure that our country, as an island nation, has secure borders. We need to secure our borders so that we can keep our country safe. Ms Plibersek interjecting",63
96,Mr DUTTON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I hear an interjection from the African Queen of,63
97,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,No! The minister will withdraw.,63
98,Mr DUTTON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I withdraw. Aspiration is not a location within Africa, just to clarify for the honourable member opposite. This has been a very confusing week for the honourable member opposite. Don't forget-she was one of the people sitting around the cabinet table in the glorious Rudd-Gillard-Rudd years when 50,000 people came on 800 boats and, tragically, 1,200 people drowned at sea. Remarkably, the Labor Party under this Leader of the  Opposition want to return a future Labor government to the delivery of that disaster. It would be an atrocious outcome. If you live in Caboolture, Burpengary or Wamuran at the moment and you're thinking about voting in the upcoming by-election, you will recognise that Labor says anything in opposition but does the complete opposite in relation to border protection when it gets into government. This Leader of the Opposition is tricky, and people have doubts about him. Have a look at his track record-they have justification for thinking that he is tricky. At the moment, he's just holding together the Labor Party's position on border protection with the support of our old friends from the CFMEU. The CFMEU is essentially a modern-day mafia, an organised-crime group. We know that they have paid $15.2 million in fines and that members of the CFMEU have been charged with 982 offences. Last time that happened, under the BLF, Bob Hawke had the guts and the leadership to disassociate the Labor Party from the BLF-to deregister them and not accept their money. What we're seeing from this Leader of the Opposition, a man who is more unworthy than any leader of the Labor Party in modern times, is somebody who accepts every dollar for the Labor Party and relies on the CFMEU to get his policies through. The constituents in the electorates of Longman, Braddon and elsewhere around the country, in the by-elections, know that this man is unfit to hold high office in this country. We know that Labor says one thing in opposition but, when it gets back into government, delivers disaster, particularly when it comes to border protection policies. Taxation",63
99,Mr SHORTEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister consider that the big banks deserve a $17 billion tax cut? Mr Rob Mitchell interjecting,64

102,Mr Morrison,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It's $2 billion a year.,64
103,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, so it's a very substantial additional levy. The honourable member, despite the protestations of the member for Grayndler, is running his campaign against business. It's not just the big banks or big companies he's against; it's right down to businesses of $2 million turnover.

107,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Members on my right. The Prime Minister has the call.,64
108,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yet again, you hear him talking about tax handouts. The reality is this: the government's every dollar-the government's revenue-comes from Australian families'  efforts and Australian businesses' efforts, and what we need to have is a competitive tax system. The honourable member opposite used to say that lower company taxes give us a more competitive economy, as most of his front-bench have done at one time or anotherthey've all said the same thing. They understand that you've got to have a competitive tax system in Australia to encourage investment and growth and to secure jobs. The Labor Party used to believe that, and they have failed on it. The honourable member opposite should remember that his ability to keep on repeating falsehoods doesn't make them true. It's not just Patsy on Brisbane radio who is awake to him; we all know there is one falsehood after another. It's about time he started telling the truth.",64
109,Mr Burke,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I'm raising the point of order that there wasn't a ruling earlier as to whether or not the Prime Minister was being relevant, and I'm asking for that ruling to be given.",65

117,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The question was about company tax. I was listening very carefully to the Prime Minister's answer. I agree it was a specific question, but the Prime Minister was relevant to the question of tax. Has the Prime Minister concluded his answer? Yes. Energy",65
118,Mr RAMSEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Minister for the Environment and Energy. Will the minister update the House on the action the government is taking to bring down energy prices and support business and industries across the Australian economy? What are the alternatives to the government's plan for affordable energy?,65
119,Mr FRYDENBERG,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Grey for his question. He has lived experience of the failure of Labor's energy policies. He comes from the state of South Australia, which has the highest prices in the country and had the inglorious experience of a statewide blackout that cost the state $500  million. $500 million! That's enough to build 30 primary schools, to upgrade 10 local hospitals and to build important regional roads. One of the biggest casualties of that statewide blackout in South Australia was BHP, with 3,000 workers in the member for Grey's electorate at Olympic Dam. They had $100 million of costs because of Labor's statewide blackout. Today BHP, the largest resource company in the world, came together with the CEO of BlueScope, Australia's largest manufacturer, and the leaders of the National Farmers' Federation, the Minerals Council of Australia, the Australian Industry Group and the Business Council of Australia, and they came to parliament with a very clear and unequivocal message that the National Energy Guarantee is in the national interest. They have told us that under the National Energy Guarantee electricity prices will fall, stability will increase and we will get the investment certainty that the sector so badly needs. Those companies and those groups represent five million Australian workers, more than 150,000 businesses and more than $200 billion of exports each and every year. Under the National Energy Guarantee, wholesale prices will fall by 23 per cent. So, if you're a chemical manufacturer, this could be a worth a million dollars in decreased energy bills to your business. If you're a paper manufacturer, it could be worth $10 million a year. If you're a large supermarket, it could be a reduction of $400,000 a year, not to mention the average Australian household, which will be $300 a year better off under the National Energy Guarantee than under the Labor Party. Now power prices are falling. We've seen the big three across New South Wales, South Australia and Queensland reduce their power prices. Powershop, as I mentioned to the parliament yesterday, an emerging retailer, have decreased their offerings for small business in Queensland by more than 14 per cent, worth more than $1,400 a year, and more than eight per cent for households, worth more than $140 a year. So the National Energy Guarantee is good for jobs, it's good for business and it's good for the economy. Only the coalition can be trusted to deliver lower power prices. Taxation",65
120,Ms PLIBERSEK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister said earlier that the government's budget is funded by hard working Australian families. So why is the Prime Minister taking $80 billion from hard working families and the services they rely on and giving it straight to big business?,66
121,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Well, it's obvious that economics has joined aspiration and geography as mysteries to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. When governments reduce tax, whether it is personal income tax, as we did last week, or business tax, as we did last year-and of course the opposition is proposing to jack up business taxes again-they are not giving anything away. It is taxpayers' money. It is taxpayers' money that the government is taking less of. The fact that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition does not understand this speaks volumes for the contempt the Labor Party holds for hard working Australians and businesses, large and small. Rural and Regional Health Services",66
122,Mr BUCHHOLZ,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Health. Will the minister outline to the House how a strong economy enables government to deliver record investment and critical health services for both regional and rural health in Australia, and is the minister aware of any other approaches? ",66
123,Mr HUNT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I want to thank the member for Wright, who came to this place as the owner and operator of a family business, a trucking business-Scotty the truckie. The whole point about that is that he knows that you can only create a successful business in the same way that you create a successful economy: with a plan. That plan can help create jobs, and those jobs-in the case of this country, over a million jobs-help allow us to provide essential services such as record funding for Medicare and record funding for the PBS, along with the guarantee that we will list every medicine that the PBAC recommends. We compare that, of course, with what Labor said in its 2011 budget: … given the current fiscal environment, the listing of some medicines would be deferred until fiscal circumstances permit. So that's what Labor does with health. We know that, in the member for Wright's area, what we've been able to see from the record funding is an increase in hospital funding. In particular, the Gatton Hospital is part of the West Moreton district. How much has funding gone up under the Commonwealth? By 25 per cent. How much has it gone up under Queensland Labor? By five per cent. That's 25 per cent under us and five per cent under Queensland Labor. That's a pattern. It's a pattern we've also seen in Tasmania. In Tasmania, we had $294 million of Commonwealth funding from Labor last year, but already there's been $419 million under us, and it's increasing every year to $515 million under the National Health Reform Agreement that the Prime Minister has put forward and which we have already agreed with Tasmania. Now, an interesting thing here is that Labor has a pattern of lying. They've said that we're trying to cut funding in Tasmania to northern Tasmanian hospitals by a million dollars. Yet our funding isn't up by $1 million, $10 million or $100 million; it's up by more than a billion dollars. We see $370 million over the course of the hospital reform agreement and $730 million for Mersey Community Hospital-$1.1 billion all up. So funding is up under us. Funding is down under Labor in the Caboolture area, and they're failing the challenge in the West Moreton area. Around Australia what you see is that the coalition, because of its economic management, can protect the PBS, invest in hospitals, increase spending and deliver new jobs. That's about managing the economy and delivering essential services. (Time expired) Taxation",67
124,Ms TEMPLEMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. The finance minister has said tax cuts for the top 20 per cent of income earners would go ahead even if another GFC hits. Given gross debt under this Prime Minister has blown out to a record half a trillion dollars and he has already made savage cuts, won't this just mean that, if a downturn hits, this government will again cut schools, Medicare and pensions?",67
125,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," The honourable member should take to task the person who wrote that question for her because it was very, very unfair to her, having her asking a question that is so misleading and so inaccurate. In fact, spending on hospitals is increasing substantially. The Minister for Health just described the $30 billion increase over the next five-year agreement. Spending on schools is increasing every year because we have introduced the first truly national, consistent, needs based Commonwealth funding policy for schools. So I thank the honourable member for her question, but the premise of it was entirely wrong.  We are able to keep funding for those essential services increasing because we have the budget under control. At the same time we're going to bring it back into balance a year earlier, and at the same time we are able to provide tax relief for hard working Australian families and, indeed, for small and medium family businesses-the very businesses that the honourable member has many of in her electorate, which will be hit hard by a Shorten Labor government. They will be hit very hard right through the electorate of Macquarie, whether it's in the Hawkesbury or whether it's in the Blue Mountains. There are plenty of small and medium businesses, and they are getting ahead now-they're hiring and they're working. The honourable member will be doing the rounds there and she will be saying, 'Vote for the Labor Party and pay more tax.' Well, I don't think that will be a very compelling message, but we don't have long to wait. Telecommunications",67
126,Mr WALLACE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Urban Infrastructure and Cities, representing the Minister for Communications. Will the minister update the House on how the Mobile Black Spot Program is continuing to benefit rural and regional Australians, including in South-East Queensland? Is the minister aware of any threats to this program?",68
127,Mr FLETCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I do thank the member for Fisher for his question. He has been a strong champion of the needs of his constituents for better communications infrastructure. It was in response to advocacy from the member for Fisher and many other members on this side of the House that the coalition has, to date, committed $220 million to the Mobile Black Spot Program, including, on 10 June, another $25 million. And the outcomes of this investment have been very, very significant. Since the first round was announced in 2015, 540 base stations around the country have been activated. Five hundred and forty base stations-that is delivery. In total, 867 base stations were funded under the coalition government-and, of course, the obvious question is: how many base stations were funded by Labor? Zero! Labor funded zero. Why? They don't really care about rural and regional Australia. It is outside the latte line. It is beyond the goat's cheese circle. They don't care. But on this side of the House we are committed to delivering for the people of rural and regional Australia, including, in the electorate of Fisher, three base stations: Maleny-Kenilworth Road-now operational; and Beerwah and Glass House Mountains-committed to. In the nearby electorate of Longman, the last LNP member in Longman, Wyatt Roy, was very, very active. He secured five base stations: Mount Mee-delivered; Belthorp Range Road-delivered; Stanmore-delivered; Beachmere and Donnybrook-in train. That's what the Turnbull government is delivering for Australians in rural and regional Australia. What did the former Labor member Susan Lamb deliver when it came to mobile coverage in Longman? She delivered nothing. She delivered absolutely nothing, not one thing, when it came to mobile blackspots. We know she is a bit hazy on the detail-she's very hazy on the detail. Over the weekend, she claimed that Caboolture has consistently rated as having the highest number of complaints in Queensland for the NBN. If you look at the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman: annual report 2016-17, page 39, it's false! Caboolture did not have the highest number of complaints. Were there, as she claimed, 50,000 complaints? No; actually, there were 453. She was out by a factor of 99 per cent. And how  was Longman served by the NBN under Labor? 330 connections. Under the coalition? 43,581. That's delivery.",68
128,Mr Turnbull,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. AUDITOR-GENERAL'S REPORTS Report No. 50 of 2017-18 The SPEAKER (15:18): I present the Auditor-General's Audit report No. 50 of 2017-18, entitled Performance audit: primary healthcare grants under the Indigenous Australians' Health Program: Department of Health. Document made a parliamentary paper in accordance with the resolution agreed to on 28 March 2018. NA Child Care Workplace Relations The SPEAKER (15:18): I have received a letter from the honourable member for Kingston proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The Government's unfair cuts, including those cuts to childcare and penalty rates which begin in July. I call upon those honourable members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",69
129,Ms RISHWORTH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," At the end of this week, families are going to be hit twice by this government and its cruel cuts. On Sunday, we are going to see the penalty rates that Australian workers rely on cut by this government. And then on Monday, the Turnbull government's new, unfair childcare system will come in-a system that will make it harder for so many children to get access to early education and childcare. We know that cutting workers' entitlements is an article of faith for the Liberal Party. It is an article of faith for the Liberal Party to cut from workers-to cut penalty rates and to cut their working conditions. They have never shied away from that. But I thought they cared about early education and access to early education for so many people. But of course it is clear now that their ideological crusade is not just about penalty rates and cutting and stripping workers' rights but also about denying children-often the most vulnerable children-access to early education. When these new childcare changes which the minister has been talking up come in, we know from the government's own information that 279,000 families will be worse off as a result. The majority of these are low-income and vulnerable families. That is 279,000 families across this country. We know the plight of families is absolutely no concern for this government. The fate of this activity test that the government's introducing will come to fruition shortly. We know that the government is now requiring families to meet a set of complex activity and income tests in order to qualify for the childcare subsidy. This activity  test is all about treating early education as glorified babysitting. It doesn't seem to understand that your child, no matter where you come from, should get access to early education. Children in families where parents aren't working will have their child care cut in half, to 12 hours of subsidy per week, and children in families earning over $65,000 where one parent is at home caring will have no access to subsidies. Where is the National Party when it comes to these families? The National Party says that it stands up for families and that it loves to support families. Well, the National Party has gone missing in action, and instead we are seeing families being denied access to early education, and we will have many families in electorates right around this country that will no longer get access. The minister has often said that it's only Labor that has spoken out against these changes. Well, he is misleading the Australian public and the community, because, of course, there have been many people in the sector who have been vocal about the impact that this activity test will have. Australian Community Children's Services have said that the changes take Australia backwards in the early childhood policy arena. The Early Learning Association Australia said: … we're very concerned about the notion of children being impacted because of effectively the actions or inactions of their parents. The New South Wales Liberal government-the Liberal government-said: … reducing the minimum hours of subsidised care for vulnerable and disadvantaged children is inconsistent with universal access commitments. So there are all these groups-all those that work at the coalface-that understand that the government's new, unfair changes will have an impact on children. But of course this Turnbull government is so arrogant and out of touch it does not believe that children in families that may not meet its cookie-cutter activity test deserve access to early education. The minister has stated that those parents at home should basically go and get a job and stop bludging off the taxpayer. In January he said it would be 'a waste of taxpayers' dollars' to 'support child care for people who are sitting at home'. There you have it: Australia's education minister saying that parents that may have complex family arrangements where one parent may need to stay at home are just couch potatoes and their children are less deserving of early education. Let's just consider who these families might be. There are cases that have been widely canvassed in the media involving ill parents and carers such as Rebecca Tucker, who has breast cancer and cannot look for work because she is undergoing chemotherapy. She needs access to early education and child care, but what will she get under this government? Nothing. Olivia White is self-employed, has wide variation in the hours she works and will regularly fail the fortnightly activity test. This government says that she's not doing enough. They say she's just a couch potato. Of course, there's the mother-or father-at home with two or three children who is also caring for elderly parents who can no longer live independently. She's just a bludger, according to this government. She doesn't deserve early education for her young children. So it is inappropriate and absolutely disgraceful that this government is cutting support for so many children. We on this side of the House know the importance of quality early education. It leads to a range of better educational, social and health outcomes for children later in life. It literally  lays down the solid foundations for life. But this government would rather give $80 billion away in corporate tax cuts than invest in early education. Talk about priorities! If it were just utter ideology, I could probably understand it, because we know that this government does not care about working people or about families. We've seen in this area of childcare changes complete incompetence by the minister as well. Currently, with only a few days to go, 235,000 families have not been able to register on the new system-20 per cent of families are not registered-and from 2 July they are going to miss out on support. In response to these families not registering, what has the minister had to say? The minister said: 'It is their fault. Why are families being so lazy? They just need to get onto myGov and register.' That just demonstrates that the minister is completely out of touch. What else has happened is that a number of providers have not been able to register. Once again the minister's response is just to say that they are lazy. This minister doesn't take any responsibility. These are his childcare changes and this is his program. He needs to stop blaming families and centres. The government's new system was meant to put downward pressure. 'The hourly fee cap will put downward pressure on prices'-that is what the minister said. This is his usual spin and it is not backed up by facts. We are now hearing that fees are going up by 10 per cent. Under this government, families are already seeing increases of more than $2,000. What has the minister had to say? He said, 'I encourage any families being ripped off to consider what alternatives may be available to them.' There is proof again of an out-of-touch minister who has no idea about moving your child from one childcare centre to another. Children develop relationships with their carers and develop connections with the other children, and often there are no vacancies available. Plucking children out of one centre and putting them in another centre and letting the free market rip is just not the answer when it comes to early education. Unfortunately, that is the attitude of the minister. Finally, we heard the minister representing the minister in the House talk about compliance and quality. The budget just handed down by the government ripped out money when it comes to compliance and quality. They took $20 million out of ensuring and enforcing quality in the sector. So, while they want to give $17 billion to the big banks, they take $20 million out that was supporting states and territories actually improving quality. This means that there will be fewer checks on centres, less compliance and less security and confidence for families. It's not good for this minister to take a hands-off approach when it comes to early education. We want to see a minister committed to early education, committed to quality and committed to access. Unfortunately, this minister has proven he is not up to the job. Labor are up to the job. We will deliver quality early education for families across this country. We won't blame families and centres when it comes to his failed system.",69
130,Dr GILLESPIE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," Hypocrisy, thy name is Labor. There is $2.5 billion extra for our new childcare subsidy system. That's on top of the $1.2 billion safety net that we have in the system. Some of the biggest beneficiaries are in electorates that those on the other side represent. In fact, Lalor is the electorate that will benefit the most out of this-with 13,303 new beneficiaries of this system. Over one million families will benefit as a result of this government's reforms to the childcare system.  We saw under the previous Labor government a massive spike in costs. That amounted to a 53 per cent cost increase. Child care is not affordable when you have increases of that magnitude. We will provide the greatest subsidy. We will remove the cap for those on low and middle incomes. Unless you're earning over $187,000, there will be no cap on the number of hours you can claim as long as you are meeting the activity test. The subsidy will be paid directly to the childcare centre, but there's an hourly rate cap to prevent that exponential increase in the cost of child care. For those with an income of under $67,000 per year the subsidy will go up from 72 per cent to 85 per cent. They're the people that need the most support. A family on a $60,000-a-year income whose childcare centre charges $100 a day will be up for only $15 a day. As the income increases up to $351,000, it drops down from that 85 per cent to 50 per cent, 20 per cent and so on, then to zero. That's because we feel that people earning $351,000 per year should be able to look after themselves. The biggest subsidy goes to those most in need. The member for Kingston has mentioned in public that she will not upset the new system but will observe it for a year, and I'm very pleased to let the member for Kingston know that in her electorate 7,160 more people will benefit from the system. The beneficiaries are far greater than those who have adequate income to put their children in child care. In my electorate 4,300 will benefit. In nearby Paterson 6,900 will benefit. North of me in the seat of Cowper 5,800 will benefit. In Braddon 3,000 will benefit. The other criticism put up is that vulnerable people and children will suffer. We have an additional childcare subsidy that provides extra subsidies to families with children at risk of serious neglect or abuse, those experiencing temporary financial hardship, grandparent carers and people moving from income support into work. In fact children at risk of serious abuse will qualify for up to 50 hours of child care a week at 100 per cent of the subsidy rate and up to 120 per cent of the hourly rate cap. Families moving from income support will get a subsidy of 95 per cent of their childcare fees. That is encouraging them into work. The activity test is quite reasonable: volunteering, working or studying will easily be reasonable activity to qualify for the subsidies. The other criticism the member for Kingston brought up was that patients with health conditions will be left short. In the childcare safety net are conditions and additional childcare subsidies for people who are undergoing cancer treatment and have medical conditions or hospitalisations, and they're excused from the activity test. The member for Kingston needs to read the policy. At the moment they don't even have a policy. We just have a failed policy that we're trying to correct, and 950,000 people have registered for it. I encourage any of those that haven't to go onto the myGov website and enter their details. A moderate, middle-income family working full-time, earning $80,000 a year, with two children under the age of six in long day care will be $8,000 better off a year. For those earning $150,000 a year the benefit won't be as great, but they'll be $1,000 better off. We also have our commitment to universal access to early learning of a quality nature in the first year before school. That's $870 million over two years. It goes on and on. As I said before: 'hypocrisy, thy name is Labor' applies to the comments about changes to weekend penalty rates. The decisions were made by the Fair Work Ombudsman and the Fair Work Commission, which is a creature of the Labor Party. They dreamt up the scheme. They appointed all the current officers in there. Hypocrisy-you only have to look at how so many  workers were so short-changed by changes the Leader of the Opposition brought in when he was working at the AWU. At MCDonald's, young people lost all their weekend penalty rates. If you had worked at MCDonald's for three years you would now be $15,000 worse off. At Big W, where penalty rates were cut to zero, they'd be $13,400 worse off. As I said: hypocrisy, thy name is Labor. There are plenty of small businesses that are suffering because they have to pay uncompetitive penalty rates. There was a modest change in hospitality, retail and pharmacy that was gradually brought in. There are still very generous penalty rates on weekends, but they are just more affordable for small businesses. Some of the small businesses in my electorate actually can't operate at the moment. The penalty rates were so deleterious to these small businesses that the big unionised employers had a strategic advantage. They can't operate because the unions organised a worse deal for them. That's where the Fair Work Ombudsman came to this decision. It wasn't a government decision. And it was the Labor Party that created the Fair Work Commission and the ombudsman. It's hypocrisy, again. We are committed to supporting the independent umpire. We have such a good childcare system coming in. Almost one million people will be so much better off. The rate is dependent on how much work is being done-the more you work, the more you can claim. Those on low incomes are getting the greatest support. Those with incomes under $67,000 are getting the greatest subsidy. There is a childcare safety net so that those who can't work because they are ill or because they are grandparents who are no longer in the workforce are excused from the activity test. Those who are coming off income support and getting back into the workforce get a larger subsidy. Looking at these figures, the biggest beneficiaries are the electorates that are represented by members on the other side. My good friend the member for MCEwen is going to have 10,200 families that are better off. The members for La Trobe and Lalor will get big increases, and I've mentioned Kingston. Child care became unaffordable with this rebate cap and increasing the subsidy from 30 per cent to 50 per cent, which they brought in. The Productivity Commission said they were the architects of the increase, because there was no capping of the hourly rate. It just gave a free kick. There was criticism that quality assurance wasn't happening. In the last year there have been 4,500 visits to childcare centres in the compliance- (Time expired)",71
131,Dr FREELANDER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," There's no doubt about this government. It always wants its pound of flesh, but it takes it from the poorest. I rise today to speak about the priorities of this government and its unfair cuts to child care and its unfair cuts to penalty rates-because it's all about fairness. I have strong views on both these topics, but I'll start first with the cuts to penalty rates. It's simply incomprehensible that the government would even fathom allowing the penalty rates of the hardest working and most disadvantaged Australians to be ripped away. In my electorate of Macarthur, over 8,000 residents work in retail and an additional 5,000 work in the accommodation and food services industries. Collectively, this equates to about 20 per cent of workers from my community who are facing real attacks on their standard of living by Malcolm Turnbull and his government. I will not allow the government to continue on this trajectory without a fight. This is a fight that affects the poorest in my community. It affects people who are trying and struggling to make ends meet in an environment where housing, power prices and  transport are increasingly unaffordable. And yet this government is content to allow money to be ripped away from those most disadvantaged. Over Australia, almost five million hard working, everyday people rely on penalty rates to help make ends meet. On a backbencher politician's salary of over $200,000, some of those opposite might not understand what that means. But, for many in my community, getting fairly paid with penalty rates can mean the difference between being able to put a roof over their heads and putting food on the table. Maybe those opposite should understand that. These are cuts to the most hard working, disadvantaged, shift-working people in my community. Those opposite may not understand that, but this is a real cut to people's standard of living at a time when they're giving thousands of dollars in tax cuts to those earning large amounts of money. It is patently unfair. Workers like police officers, firefighters, paramedics, nurses, retail workers and hospitality workers and workers in manufacturing, tourism and many other sectors all rely on penalty rates to make ends meet. Yet, under the leadership of this Prime Minister, penalty rates for hospitality, fast-food industries, retail and pharmacy will be cut again on Sunday, 1 July. I see that as a tragedy. I see it as an attack on the most disadvantaged workers in my community, often workers with young families, who are trying to make ends meet, trying to put a roof over their heads and food on the table. It's dreadful. I wonder if those opposite have ever had to rely on penalty rates.",73
132,Mr Laundy,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Yes, 100 per cent.",74
133,Dr FREELANDER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,You're kidding me-you had to rely on penalty rates?,74
134,Mr Laundy,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,It's called my university career. I relied on them for years.,74
135,Dr FREELANDER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Come on! I dare say we wouldn't be in this position if you really had to rely on penalty rates. Under this national government, we've seen wage growth at a record low, and yet this out-of-touch Prime Minister and his ministers are allowing this to happen. This is a joke! On the second topic of child care",74
136,Mr Dick,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,You want to rip it away from everyone else!,74
137,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE, The member for Oxley.,74
138,Dr FREELANDER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"In addition to the government's agenda of cuts to marine parks, changes to the HELP scheme and axing of the pensioners' energy supplement, it is now cutting child care, again, for the most disadvantaged. As I've mentioned before, this is an issue of fairness; it's an issue that the government should be facing, but it can't. We know that the government's childcare changes will leave one in four families worse off, including the most disadvantaged. I could talk for hours about this, as a paediatrician, and how important it is that the most disadvantaged children in our community not miss out because of this government's policies. These are the consequences of the government's inability to look at fairness in our community, and it's a shame. (Time expired) Mrs PRENTICE (Ryan-Assistant Minister for Social Services and Disability Services) (15:43): If those on the opposition benches, including the member for Macarthur, want to support the vulnerable in our community, if they want to support the hard workers, then they will support the coalition policies, because the coalition policies are spending more money on childcare reform, more money on workers and more money on families in our country. Unlike Labor's shambolic childcare policy, which on their watch saw fees absolutely skyrocket, the  coalition government is putting $2.5 billion back into the sector. The opposition didn't do that. We are delivering a fundamentally fair package that provides the highest rate of subsidy to those on the lowest income levels, with more hours of subsidy for those who work the most. That is what is called fundamentally fair. The coalition is increasing the base subsidy from around 72 per cent to 85 per cent for more than 370,000 families earning around $66,000 or less a year. Lowand middle-income families earning up to around $186,000 will no longer be limited by an annual cap on the amount of child care they can access. That's more than 85 per cent of families using child care. Families earning more than $186,000 would also benefit from an increased annual rebate cap of $10,190. Introducing hourly rate caps recommended by the Productivity Commission will help put downward pressure on fee increasesMs Rishworth interjectingMrs PRENTICE: well, support our policies if you want to fix it-by setting a limit on what hourly fee the government will subsidise based on an efficient price of what it costs to deliver child care. The $1.2 billion childcare safety netMs Rishworth: They went up 10 per cent this week. It's not working. Mrs PRENTICE: It doesn't start until 1 July. Support this policy if you want to support hard working men and women in Australia-hard working families, the vulnerable in our community. The coalition government is increasing Australia's investment in early childhood education; it's not cutting it-once again another scaremongering campaign from those on the other side, probably suited to the campaigns for the by-elections, where they're not going down too well, because the coalition government is delivering an extra $2.5 billion over the next four years, which will help more than one million Australian families. Lowand middle-income families will be the greatest beneficiaries from this package. The opposition leader has always been big on promises and short on delivering. Instead of attempting to govern in the interests of their union puppetmasters, the opposition should be considering how they should serve their constituencies and the families in their constituencies. On penalty rates, it was the Leader of the Opposition who, as the employment minister, established the Fair Work Commission. It was the Leader of the Opposition who, as the employment minister, appointed a former trade union leader as the Commissioner of the Fair Work Commission. It was the Leader of the Opposition who instigated the four-yearly review of penalty rates by the Fair Work Commission, and it was the Leader of the Opposition who said he would accept the decision of the Fair Work Commission. He publicly went out there and said the opposition would accept the decision of the Fair Work Commission. But then, after 39 days of hearings, 143 witnesses and more than 6,000 submissions, the Fair Work Commission handed down, in February last year, a 500-page decision and the Leader of the Opposition doesn't like the decision. He doesn't like the decision made by the body he set up. He appointed the commission, and he should accept the decision. He doesn't like it, so he's spat his dummy. The Leader of the Opposition and the opposition",74

140,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," The member for Burt is warned.  Mrs PRENTICE: think it's fair that the local hot chicken shop should pay $8 more an hour for their workers than KC, because the opposition support the big end of town, for all their protestations. The opposition think it's fair that the local mum-and-dad hot food shop should pay $8 an hour more on Sundays for their workers than MCDonald's. The opposition think it's fair that the local hardware shop should pay more for their workers than Bunnings, because the opposition don't support hard working Australians. The coalition government are delivering record economic growth and record jobs. Unlike the opposition, we are the friends of the families and workers of Australia. It is no wonder the tree at Barcaldine died. (Time expired) Mrs ELLIOT (Richmond) (15:49): This is an arrogant and out-of-touch government with all the wrong priorities, and the people of regional and rural Australia have been abandoned by this government and, in particular, by the National Party. As I often say, National Party choices hurt, and their choices-their bad choices-hurt the people in the country time and time again. Whether it's the National Party's cuts to health care, their cuts to education, their cuts to penalty rates, their cuts to pensions or their cuts to child care, the fact is National Party MPs have time and time again come into this House and voted against the interests of regional Australia. That is a fact. The reality is that times are always tougher when the National Party's in government, especially with many of the changes coming into place on 1 July-firstly, the cuts to penalty rates. Nationally, up to 4.5 million workers rely on penalty rates: police officers, firefighters, paramedics, nurses and workers in health care, aged care, retail, hospitality, tourism and many other sectors. Penalty rates for hospitality, fast-food, retail and pharmacy awards will be cut again this Sunday, 1 July. In regional areas like my electorate, thousands are employed in these industries. The penalty rate cuts will hurt local workers and severely cut their take-home pay but will also be devastating for our local economy and local businesses as less money will be spent. Those opposite don't understand this issue. Cutting penalty rates hurts workers and impacts upon regional economies and local businesses; that is a fact. We believe it's fundamentally unfair to cut the wages of some of Australia's lowest paid workers-people who rely on penalty rates to pay the bills, put food on the table and raise their children. We need to protect those in our community who will be badly affected when these penalty rates are cut. This government won't do anything to help them, and it shows how wrong its priorities are and how harsh its choices are. The penalty rate cuts will be devastating throughout the nation, but they will hit really hard in regional and rural areas. We know the Prime Minister and his government continue to actively campaign for those cuts to penalty rates and refuse to protect workers who rely on those penalty rates. I call on the government to do the right thing and support our bill to protect penalty rates. Just this week the Leader of the Opposition introduced a bill to protect those penalty rates that will be cut this July, next July and the July after that. Our bill would stop those cuts and ensure penalty rates would never be cut again. Stopping those cuts to penalty rates could happen if the Prime Minister and his Liberal National government joined us to bring this bill on for a vote and voted for it. This government has had eight opportunities in the parliament to protect penalty rates, and it voted against protecting them eight times. That's eight specific times that National Party members have voted against the interests of people in regional and rural Australia-a  shameful record! This is an attack on low-paid workers, who will have those penalty rates cut again this weekend on 1 July. This time the cuts will be even deeper for them. Penalty rates are not a luxury; they put food on the table and pay the bills. It's clear that the only way to protect penalty rates is to elect a Shorten Labor government. That's something that people in regional areas know: only Labor will stand up for them. In the regions and rural parts of Australia The Nationals will be held responsible for their continued cuts to penalty rates and their continued refusal to support workers. As well as the harsh cuts to penalty rates, the government's unfair changes to child care begin next week. We already know the new system will leave one in four families worse off: over 270,000 families. It's an unfair package from an out-of-touch and arrogant government. The Liberal-National childcare package will hurt those families who can least afford it and reduce access to early education for those kids who need it most. Childcare fees under this government have gone up over $2,000 on average. It's time this out-of-touch and arrogant government understands that families are doing it tough and need assistance. It's not being provided by this government at all. This government and the National Party have totally abandoned regional and rural Australia. As I say constantly in this House, National Party choices hurt. People in the regions know how harsh the decisions that the National Party make are. In contrast to all of those harsh choices by the National Party, Labor has always fought for the country and for the regions. We have always delivered for regional Australia by investing in health care and schools, building roads and infrastructure, and addressing inequality. Very importantly, Labor supports a fairer tax system, unlike The Nationals, who, shamefully, support tax cuts for multinationals and big business. What a clear contrast and a clear difference! Labor stands up for the country. That's the reality. That's what we do. Only Labor deliver again and again for the people of regional and rural Australia, because we have their backs. We have the backs of people in country Australia, and we will always support them and always stand with them, unlike this government, which prioritises multimillionaires and big business over country people.",75
141,Mr WALLACE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," Talk about leading with your chin! The shadow minister over there really has led with her chin on this MPI. The government's 'unfair cuts'-I suppose the opposition are talking about the tax cuts, are they? Is that what they're talking about, the tax cuts? I don't know. This government has overseen some of the most significant income tax reductions in Australian political history. Ninety-four per cent of Australian workers will be paying 32.5 cents in the dollar. Australians will be getting to keep more of their hard-earned money. This is what it's all about. This is what good government is all about. It's ensuring that Australians get to keep more of their hard-earned money and spend it the way they choose. They can spend it on their family, or if they have their own business they can reinvest it into the business. But those on that side of the House would have no idea what I'm talking about when I talk about reinvesting in their own businesses, because they're all union hacks. That is an absolute fact. The tax cuts that we passed through the Senate just last week were absolutely the best tax reductions in Australian political history. We're trying to do the same thing with corporate tax. On this side of the House we believe that Australians should pay the least amount of tax that  is necessary. Those on the other side believe that paying tax is a privilege. If that's a privilege-I guess it just goes to the mind set and to the difference between us and them. Let's look at the Fair Work Commission. The Fair Work Commission is an independent body. Some of the members opposite are lawyers. Perhaps they may have been decent criminal lawyers in the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions but they seem not to understand the concept that the Fair Work Commission has made this decision. They talk about the government making this decision in relation to Sunday penalty rates but they know-at least the lawyers over there should know-that it wasn't the government's decision. It was in fact the independent umpire' decision. It's worth restating the transcript of an interview with Neil Mitchell and the Leader of the Opposition in April 2016: MITCHELL: … Will you accept their findings given this is an independent body assessing penalty rates for Sunday, if you're Prime Minister? SHORTEN: Yes. MITCHELL: You'll accept them? SHORTEN: Yes. MITCHELL: Even if they reduce Sunday Penalty rates? SHORTEN: Well, I said I'd accept the independent tribunal … Yet, here he is today, surrounded by his Labor colleagues, refusing to accept the decision of the independent umpire. You can't have it both ways. The Fair Work Commission is independent. The Fair Work Commission made a 500-page decision based on almost 6,000 submissions, 143 witnesses and 39 days of hearings. It is the Fair Work Commission that you established and stacked with your own commissioners. But, because they made a decision you're not happy with, you constantly say that this is not fair, that it is not right. It's your people who made that decision, so you don't have a leg to stand on when it comes to complaining about the Fair Work Commission. Before the penalty rate decision for permanent staff on Sundays, a bed and breakfast had to pay $10 an hour more than a five-star hotel. How can you call that fair? (Time expired)",77
142,Mr KHALIL,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," We all know that this Sunday 700,000 workers in hospitality, fast food, retail and pharmacy industries will suffer another cut to their penalty rates. For those workers and the 4½ million working Australians across other industries like emergency services-our first responders-nursing, manufacturing and tourism, penalty rates are essential to making ends meet. We know that, and many of us in this place have worked in some of those industriesMr Wallace interjecting",78
143,Mr KHALIL,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,despite what the member for Fisher says. We know how hard these people work and we know how low some of their wages are,78
144,Mr Wallace,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Are they being cut under this?,78
145,Mr KHALIL,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"But of course the member for Fisher and his leader, the Prime Minister, have probably never had to rely on penalty rates, have you, to get by? Because in all the Prime Minister's arroganceMr Wallace interjecting",78
146,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Fisher. ,78
147,Mr KHALIL,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"he just doesn't understand what it's like to need penalty rates. None of them over that side can comprehend that the estimated average cut of $77 that these people will suffer can be the difference between putting food on the table, buying shoes for the kids or keeping the lights on. He's never had to face that difficult question, has he? When I was younger, like many of us on this side probably, I worked some of these jobs to get by as well. I worked as a cleaner. I worked night shifts in a service station. I worked in retail and hospitality and washed dishes in restaurants. And, yes, I also went to university, because those aspirational Labor policies gave me access to a university education. Those are the policies of Labor governments. I've spoken before in this House about how I grew up in a housing commission. It was Labor policies and those visionary Labor governments that gave me and my family access to affordable housing, universal health care and education. I will forever be grateful for those Labor policies giving me, and millions of other Australians like me, the best possible start in life, despite our postcode. These are the things that Labor governments do. That's why we on this side of the House will never think it's fair to inflict a pay cut on some of the lowest-paid workers in this country, people who rely on that little bit of extra money to pay the bills and raise their children. And that's why Labor has introduced legislation in this place to protect the penalty rates. But the coalition is content to do nothing to protect these people. In fact, they voted against Labor's attempts to protect penalty rates-eight times in total. They back the big end of town; we know that. And they do it at the expense of the ordinary working and middle-class Australians who rely on penalty rates to get by. For a coalition government to treat a tax handout to millionaires and multinational companies as more important than protecting the most vulnerable in our communities is so bizarre and obscene that I can't understand it. I assume some on the other side are intelligent enough to understand how bizarre that is. Let's not forget that this government's unfair changes to childcare are also set to begin on 2 July, and we've heard about how this unfair package of cuts will hurt those families who can least afford it. It reduces access to early education for those kids who need it most. One in four families will be worse off because of the government's proposed changes to child care. That's some 279,000 families nationwide, and, in my electorate of Wills, that's 2,225 families that will be negatively impacted. The Turnbull government's unfair childcare package will hurt those families whose can least afford it because it reduces access to early education for those kids who need it most. While its attack on early childhood education is bad enough, education as a whole is within the sights of the government. Education, let's remember, is the key to opportunity. It was bequeathed to us, regardless of our postcode or our ethnicity, by successive Labor governments, who were committed to the idea of equality of opportunity and access to education. But that's now under siege by this government. This government has cut $2.8 billion from TAFE and about $22 billion from primary and secondary education. In stark contrast, under the previous Labor government, 1,600 people in my electorate of Wills were able to go to university because of the Rudd-Gillard government's policies, and it's projected that, under a future Labor government, under our policies, an additional 1,500 people in my electorate will receive the opportunity of a university education. That's aspiration. That's giving people the opportunity to achieve and progress based on their merit.  But the Liberals want to make Australian students pay $100,000 a degree, and the only reason $100,000 degrees aren't a reality is that Labor and the crossbenchers have blocked the Liberals' plan in the Senate. Australian students now make up the sixth-highest contribution to the cost of university education compared to other economies. (Time expired)",79
148,Mr RAMSEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," With this MPI, you have to hand it to Labor-you've got to give them a bit of credit. They're always misleading, always deceiving, always denying the truth. We just had the member for Wills over there tell us that we've been cutting money out of education-out of secondary and primary school. What is it about record spending that you do not understand? Record spending, by the very name, indicates to us that it is higher than the level that existed before. The Labor Party demonstrate complete amnesia when it comes to their statements in the past on so many issues. Most importantly, there is no baseless scare campaign, however unbelievable or however outrageous, that they will not promote. Apart from having no memory, they seem to have no shame either. I suspect, after their latest commitment to unwind the already legislated tax cuts to small and medium business, they have no brains either. Labor are conducting a consistent attack on business. The leader, the member for Maribyrnong, said no less in an address to the BCA. They now attack the independent umpire's decision on penalty rates. The Labor Party have a penchant for forgetfulness. They forget Mr Shorten's record. The PM says the member for Maribyrnong is the champion of stripping away penalty rates. Well, he's right. He made a deal with Cleanevent to abolish 50 per cent penalty rates with no compensation for workers, but he hoovered up a secret kickback for the union, which suggests that he is the champion. The shoppies' union have engineered deals with young workers at MCDonald's which have made them $5,000 a year worse off than the award. There were special deals for KC, Woolworths, Big W and Bunnings, all delivering substantially less than the award, while small, struggling businesses have to pay higher rates. For the workers, with friends like those, they sure don't need enemies. What is plain is that as a result of the unions doing these secret deals with big business for undisclosed reasons, small businesses have been handed a wages sheet which runs at a significant premium to competitors because they lack the ability to do these secret, under-the table deals. I say to the workers: have a look at what that mob does to you. Have a look at what the Labor Party are doing to you. Have a look at what they want to do. They want to destroy your jobs, take away your personal tax cuts and raid your retirement savings. The Fair Work Commission was established under Deputy Prime Minister Julia Gillard. It was designed by the ALP to protect Australian workers' rights so that Australian workers would never again be exploited, we were told. The member for Maribyrnong personally appointed the commission members that made the decision to reduce the penalty rates. We assume that he appointed people he trusted. We would assume that he appointed people that he considered to be intelligent and trustworthy. He also put in a mechanism dictating that awards would be reviewed every four years, perhaps even suspecting that when that occurred he might no longer be in government. The commission took 6,000 submissions, saw 143 witnesses and had 39 days of hearings. It was a well-considered decision. Why? It was because they knew that the scale of the penalty rates-particularly those inflicted on the hospitality sector-was destroying jobs.  They voted and they ruled in favour of those people who need jobs, the unemployed people. When asked on Neil Mitchell's program if he would accept Fair Work's decision-I know this has been brought up by previous speakers-the member for Maribyrnong answered twice, 'Yes, yes.' A bit like the cock crowing three times, he answered, 'Yes, yes,' and then said, 'I said I would accept the independent tribunal.' Now we know that he won't accept the independent tribunal's decision. Every possible variable was under the opposition's control, and now he sooks that his personally selected people at his government's organisation got it wrong. Perhaps he should consider that maybe he has it wrong. Perhaps he is driven by factors other than workers' interests.",80
149,Ms TEMPLEMAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," On Sunday, penalty rates will be cut again. That means nearly 700,000 Australians will be up to $77 a week worse off. In my electorate of Macquarie, one in six workers are in hospitality and retail, and they can now legally have their pay cut. These workers live locally and service our tourism sector, which, of course, booms at weekends. When the work is done, these same workers spend their money locally, but they'll have less to spend from Sunday. That's $77 a week less to spend on groceries; $77 less to pay for kids' shoes; $77 less towards that ever-growing electricity bill. The Prime Minister has no problem with these workers losing this money. Penalty rates have never been an important thing to him. He will never understand the reason why young people, older people, low-skilled workers, mums, dads and students opt for weekend and latenight work when they are filling in their availability for shifts. It is not because they don't want to have the same Sunday as everybody else; it's because they don't have a choice. They need the money and they need their penalty rates protected. When wages are stagnant and at record lows, this government is boasting about a $10 a week tax cut. It is sitting back, gloating, while some workers lose $77 a week. I see that hair and beauty workers are the next to face the threat to their penalty rates for Sunday work. This is one of the lowest paid trades in Australia. We will not sit on the sidelines and watch these workers being forced down the same dead end as their hospitality and retail colleagues. Only Labor will restore and protect workers' penalty rates, and the government should be supporting our bill. Penalty rates are not the only thing changing as the new financial year clicks over. On Monday, the support parents get towards their childcare costs changes. We know that a quarter of families will be worse off under the new system for a multitude of reasons, and that's 1,300 in my electorate of Macquarie. They don't work enough hours; they don't study or volunteer enough hours; or they earn too much money. One of my childcare centres in the lower Blue Mountains tells me that it has many families with one parent working who will lose benefits, and that means fewer days of child care. Whatever the reason for people losing their subsidy, I object to any child missing out on quality early learning that sets them up to better transition to school and is in the interests of every single child in every classroom. When we fail to invest in early childhood training, we pay a huge price further down the line. The implementation of this new scheme has been a total shemozzle. One father in my electorate said that he had to take a whole day off work to go into Centrelink, because he couldn't input the information in the online system. He said the whole process was a debacle and the staff at Centrelink felt that they had not been given sufficient training and information needed to help parents. Childcare services are confused. The training and support they've  received is inadequate. My childcare suppliers say they've looked at the information given to families and are finding it very difficult to make sense of it. What hope do parents have? There is so much uncertainty, but what is certain is that this government hasn't got it right for the most vulnerable families. There is another change happening this weekend. It isn't about penalty rates or child care; it is about our children and the world that we leave our children. On 1 July, the Turnbull government's marine park management plans will begin the largest removal of an area from conservation in history. No government anywhere in the world has ever removed this much area from protection on land or sea. Think about that. If you think this means people will now be able to go fishing in more places, you're wrong. The recreational fishers are losing the largest recreation-only fishing area in the world. The only people dominating these waters will be large-scale industrial-fishing and long-lining trawlers, who now have a standing invitation from the Australian government to exploit our marine life for their profit. The Coral Sea will go from being the jewel in the crown of the Commonwealth marine parks and protecting the eastern side of the Great Barrier Reef to now being a haven for longline fishing and trawling. It is an absolute disgrace. The Prime Minister and this environment minister will now forever have the global reputation of removing more area from conservation than anyone anywhere else, ever. We haven't given up. They should be ashamed, but we haven't given up. The plan to cut marine parks can still be disallowed in the other place, and we will keep fighting. (Time expired)",81
150,Mr BROAD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," I'm trying to work out how the government's unfair cuts, including those cuts to child care and penalty rates, have impacts on marine parks and fishing! It's a very broad scope, and I've got to say that for those fishermen who aren't getting their penalty rates, because they've got their children in child care, it's tragic! It's a great stretch, but it clearly shows that when it comes to the depth of this topic, those opposite have got nothing. They couldn't even fill out their MPI time to talk about the topic. It reminds me a little bit, I've got to say, of: 'promise and not provide, talk and not deliver, deceive, but, worse, disappoint'. That was the example of the opposition when it was formerly in government, when they talked about what is a cut and what isn't a cut. I want to run through this. It reminds me of when I was a good-looking young man and this nice girl was going to come up to me and we were going to go on a date that night. My mate said it was never going to happen. But I was there. I turned up. I had my little rose and I was all psyched up. Do you know what happened? She didn't turn up. I should have known: promise, not provide, talk, don't deliver, deceive, and I was disappointed. That has been the case when it comes to education, particularly. All of the 118 schools in the electorate of Mallee have got more under our government. Every childcare centre is going to be better off in our area. This is the contrast. We have a package here for child care that actually does deliver. It delivers for vulnerable children. There is a child safety net for families earning under $66,000-they are going to get a little bit of extra assistance. For a person earning $60,000 who has a family and child care costs of $100 a day, they will be subsidised to the extent that it is only going to cost them $15 a day. When it comes to looking after children and families, it actually is the National Party that is delivering. There was a lot of criticism of the National Party by the opposition, who said they represent regional  Australia. They don't even come out and visit regional Australia. I can't remember when a Labor MP actually visited my part of the world. Ms Stanley: A month ago; I was there!",82
151,Mr BROAD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"On a delegation, and that was a nice experience. I will talk about penalty rates for a moment. There is a very interesting argument going on here about who should determine the rates that an employer pays their employees. We go down a very dangerous pathway when we decide that this chamber is going to make that determination. If I was an employee, I would shudder in my boots at that concept. If I was an employer, I would shudder in my boots at that concept. Of course, people losing some working entitlements in penalty rates was not popular in my patch. It wasn't; let's be honest about it. But what also wasn't popular was shops choosing to shut because they couldn't afford to stay open. Ms Kearney: Shops will shut because people don't have money to spend in them!",83
152,Mr BROAD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"This is a reason you should come out to my patch. On a Sunday afternoon, shops would be shut in tourist towns like Stawell, Mildura and Swan Hill. Do you know who was missing out? It was the person who was working in that shop-they weren't getting a wage, because the shop was shutting.",83
153,Unknown,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Opposition members interjecting,83
154,Mr BROAD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"No, the invite is there. Come and have a look and talk to both the workers and the shop owners and you will know. You will find that the shops were shutting. That's just an example of how you have built an ideology, instead of actually coming and having a chat to the people involved. If those shops are choosing to shut because they can't afford to stay open-the takings aren't enough for those shops in those country towns-the worker misses out, the owner of the business misses out, and, ultimately, the town misses out. Ultimately, what I want is profitable shops. I want profitable shops that employ Australians. Ultimately, I think it's a very, very dangerous precedent to go down a pathway where you allow this chamber to pick people's wages. Just think about that for a moment. There is an independent commission. Governments and oppositions can put forward their points of view, but, ultimately, the commission makes the rulings, and their rulings need to be adhered to. I think this MPI is just tokenism. Be very careful of what you wish for, because it would undermine the welfare of workers right across Australia if Labor had their way.",83
155,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," The discussion has concluded. NA National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Bill 2017 Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Bill 2017 Second Reading Cognate debate. Consideration resumed of the motion: That this bill be now read a second time.  noting that defences will apply to ensure that the offences do not apply too broadly, including  a defence specifically applying to journalists. Government amendments will ensure that this defence applies to journalists as well as to editorial and support staff who reasonably believe that their conduct was in the public interest. The new secrecy offences ensure that harmful information cannot be released, while also providing appropriate defences to maintain freedom of speech, the press and expression. With respect to treason, treachery and other threats to security, the EFI bill will update and simplify the long standing offences of treason and treachery. These are some of the oldest offences on the statute book, and as such they require modernisation and updates to the language to reflect the modern environment and international law concepts of armed conflict. The EFI bill will also repeal archaic and outdated offences from part II of the Crimes Act. These offences will be modernised and moved to the Criminal Code to ensure that Commonwealth criminal law appropriately supports the needs of the Australian Defence Force and protects Australia's democracy. The new offences will criminalise threats to Australia's security, including advocating mutiny, assisting prisoners of war to escape, facilitating military-style training for a foreign government, and the use of force, violence or intimidation to interfere with Australian democratic or political rights. Government amendments to these offences include extending the good-faith defence to the offence of advocating mutiny, introducing a defence for staff of the United Nations or the International Committee of the Red Cross for the military-styletraining offence, and reducing the penalty for the offence of interference with political rights and duties. With respect to sabotage, the EFI bill will also introduce comprehensive sabotage offences into the Criminal Code. The new sabotage offences will criminalise conduct causing damage to a broad range of critical infrastructure where it could prejudice Australia's national security. The new offences will apply higher penalties where sabotage offences are committed on behalf of foreign principals and will also contain offences that apply where a person's conduct does not immediately cause damage but leaves an item or system vulnerable to future misuse or exploitation. Government amendments to the EFI bill will also broaden the defence to sabotage offences to include private owners and operators of public infrastructure. With respect to the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act, the final point is that the EFI bill will amend the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979 to ensure that the powers under the act are available to investigate the offences contained in the EFI bill. With respect to the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Bill, while it's the case that foreign actors are free to promote their interests in Australia and in our free and open society, this must be done in a lawful, transparent and open way. The FITS Bill will provide transparency for the Australian government and the Australian public about the forms and sources of foreign influence in Australia. Decision-makers in the Australian government and the public should know what interests are being advanced in respect of particular decisions or processes. However, it is difficult to assess the interests of foreign actors when they use intermediaries to advance their interests or activities, such as lobbying or the communication of information or material. This concealment ultimately undermines the ability of the decision-maker and the public to evaluate and reach informed decisions on the basis of those representations.  For the first time, the public and decision-makers in government will have access to information to enable them to accurately assess how foreign sources may be seeking to influence Australia's government and political processes. The FITS Bill will create a scheme that requires persons undertaking certain activities on behalf of a foreign principal to register. The person who registers will be required to disclose information about the nature of their relationship with the foreign principal and activities undertaken pursuant to that relationship. The disclosure requirements will be ongoing, and additional disclosure will be required during elections. Some of the information which a person discloses will be made publicly available, and the FITS Bill also introduces criminal offences for non-compliance with the registry scheme. The FITS Bill will require persons who undertake activities on behalf of a foreign principal to register under the scheme, depending on who the foreign principal is and the activities that the person undertakes. The term 'foreign principal' in the FITS Bill will capture a foreign government, a foreign political organisation, and persons and entities closely related to foreign governments and foreign political organisations. The FITS Bill will require registration where a person engages in parliamentary or political lobbying, communicates information or material designed to influence debate, or makes certain disbursements. Certain information about registrants and their activities will be made publicly available. With respect to transparency notices, the FITS Bill will empower the secretary of the department to issue a transparency notice setting out whether a particular entity or individual is related to a foreign government. This mechanism will ensure that a person who undertakes registrable activities on the entity's or individual's behalf will be required to register under the scheme. Transparency notices will assist potential registrants to understand whether they are required to register and will also shed light where a company or individual seeks to conceal their relationship with a foreign principal. The bill also provides for certain exemptions. The FITS Bill will exempt a range of organisations and persons from registering under the scheme. The exemptions extend to humanitarian assistance, legal advice, diplomatic activities, religious activities, commercial or business pursuits, industry representative bodies, individuals making personal legal representations, registered charities, activities with an artistic purpose, certain registered organisations and certain professions. These exemptions appropriately restrict the application of the scheme to those organisations and persons which seek to influence Australian political and government decisions or processes in a way that threatens Australian institutions. The FITS Bill will also introduce offences, which will ensure compliance with the scheme. It will be a criminal offence for a person who is liable to register not to be registered under the scheme. (Extension of time granted) Criminal offences will also apply for failing to fulfil responsibilities under the scheme or providing false or misleading information in purported fulfilment of responsibilities and also for destroying records. It will also be a criminal offence not to comply with a notice from the secretary requiring information in relation to the scheme. By way of conclusion I'd like to thank all of my parliamentary colleagues for recognising the important need for the measures in these two bills. Comprehensive criminal laws are a critical part of Australia's response to the threat of espionage and foreign interference. The EFI bill reflects the government's commitment to addressing this threat and to ensuring that our law enforcement and security agencies have the powers that they need to respond to the  broad spectrum of foreign interference and related criminal activities directed against Australia's interests. Legislative reform is clearly a critical step in shedding light on foreign influence. The FITS Bill reflects the government's commitment to addressing this issue and to ensuring that the public and decision-makers in government will have access to information to enable them to accurately assess how foreign sources may be seeking to influence Australia's government and political processes. Ultimately, no member of this House-indeed, no citizen of our great democracy-should underestimate the threat being faced by the Australian government, Australian society and Australian democracy. That threat is from new forms of espionage practised in the modern age. These bills are detailed and legally complex, but the central principle of their necessity can be described simply by saying that we cannot protect Australia against modern espionage in the age of Skyfall with counterintelligence laws drafted for the era of Goldfinger. In fact, the threat of espionage wedded to the technologies of a digital age is now catalysed by something even more potentially dangerous. Likely even more dangerous and potentially even more damaging than traditional espionage is the practice that traditional spying now morphs into a massively broad and inventive range of covert foreign interference, or hidden foreign influence, in our democratic systems. The phenomenon of foreign principals attempting to influence our democracy is neither new nor unexpected, but what in the modern age of information technology and digital communications demonstrates true cunning and what can cause immense harm are foreign influence cloaked in the disguise of a purely or uniquely Australian veneer or foreign advocacy channelled by and through a recognised and seemingly independent Australian voice, which might be paid for or directed by foreign principals in a way that is hidden from sight. Deception has always been at the heart of espionage, and so transparency is the evergreen counterintelligence to propaganda. So it is that this legislative combination of new foreign interference offences and a register to make transparent the links of Australian advocacy to foreign principals brings Australian counterintelligence laws into the modern age. Ian Fleming once said of his most famous character in espionage that boredom was the only vice that he utterly condemned, and indeed literary commentators have noted that this character displayed both a craving for routine and a hatred of boredom. The practice of modern espionage now being encountered in so many Western democracies across the globe-and the prevalence of deception wedded not merely to traditional spying but to interference and attempts to influence democratic outcomes-means that the only certainty our excellent national security agencies have is that there'll be nothing routine about the threats that they will need to counter and that their government will need to legislate accordingly against. I commend these bills to the House.",83

166,Ms HENDERSON,COMMITTEES," On behalf of the Standing Committee on Economics, I present the committee's report entitled Review of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority annual report 2017 together with the minutes of proceedings. Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).",121
167,Ms HENDERSON,COMMITTEES,"by leave-On 28 March 2018, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, APRA, appeared before the Standing Committee on Economics as part of the review of APRA's annual report 2017. As chair of this committee, I'm very pleased to table this report. The committee examined APRA's activities supervising and enforcing prudential standards and practices in the Australian financial system. APRA explained that its focus has been on improving resilience in the financial system. The committee scrutinised APRA on its work on issues of governance, risk management and culture in financial institutions. In particular, the committee focused on measures to reinforce sound lending practices to ensure that Australian banks remained prudentially strong. In addition, the committee examined the new Banking Executive Accountability Regime, otherwise known as BEAR. While APRA is seeking to improve responsible lending practices in the Australian financial sector, there is still a lot of work to be done in this area. The disturbing evidence coming out of the Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry suggests that the major banks, in a number of cases, are moving from a low base when improving their responsible lending practices.  In recent years, APRA has provided guidance on lending practices that was aimed at maintaining strong lending in an environment of heightened risks. The benchmark limiting the growth of investor loans to 10 per cent, issued in December 2014, was updated in guidance from APRA on 26 April 2018. From 1 July 2018, financial institutions will no longer have to meet this requirement if they are able to provide APRA with certain assurances about the strength of their lending practices. The benchmark limiting the flow of new interestonly lending, established in APRA guidance on 31 March 2017, remains in place. Strengthening accountability measures for senior executives was a key recommendation of the committee's review of the four major banks. The BEAR will provide mechanisms to make senior bank executives more accountable and subject to additional oversight by APRA. It comes into effect on 1 July 2018 for the major banks. There will be a measured transition for smaller institutions. The committee also sees a need to continue to improve competition in the banking sector. In its review of the four major banks, the committee previously called for removing barriers to new entrants to the sector. It welcomes the recent changes to the restrictions on institutions using the term 'bank' in lifting this barrier to new entrants. The new crisis-management powers introduced by the government provide important new tools for APRA. They will empower APRA to better prepare and take decisive action to more quickly and effectively address crises in Australia's financial system. The proposed changes to superannuation will improve governance and transparency in the industry. The committee expects that, once the measures are implemented, it will better position APRA-related superannuation licensees to deliver sound outcomes for their members. The committee notes that APRA has extended its strategic focus to superannuation and will monitor APRA's performance in this area. Certainly one of the issues raised in this respect was third-party transactions of superannuation members' funds, particularly to unions. This is money belonging to members, and I am concerned that APRA-these were issues that I raised-has not been focused enough on regulating these practices which undermine the confidence that members have in the trustees of superannuation funds. I trust that these matters will be better regulated and there will be a strong regulatory eye on these practices in the future. In closing, I want to reiterate the very strong action that our government is taking to reform the banking and financial services sector across Australia. Over and above the reforms that we have passed to bolster the resources, penalties and powers available to ASIC, the Turnbull government very proudly has passed legislation to establish the Australian Financial Complaints Authority, AFCA, and a one-stop shop dispute resolution scheme to provide consumers with independent and timely access to justice and access to compensation where appropriate. As I've talked about, the government has also passed legislation to create the new BEAR regime, with enhanced powers for APRA to remove and disqualify an executive or director, to direct adjustments to remuneration policies and variable pay and to enforce new prudential risk-management conduct obligations with penalties of up to $200 million where these are not met.  In March 2017, legislation was passed to establish a new Commonwealth company, the Financial Advisor Standards and Ethics Authority, to lift the professional, education and ethical standards of financial advisers. We've seen in evidence before the royal commission that some financial advisers have fallen well short of expected standards. We've passed legislation to cap the incentives paid to advisers for the sale of life insurance products. We've also passed new laws to ensure that retail client moneys are protected where financial firms become insolvent. In December 2017, the government introduced legislation to bolster the whistleblower protection regime in the Corporations Act by providing protection for a wider range of disclosures, protection for anonymous disclosures and easier access to justice for those who suffer reprisals as a result of blowing the whistle. These are all very, very important reforms in strengthening our banking and financial services industry and the sector across the country. On behalf of the committee, I would like to thank the chairman of APRA, Mr Wayne Byers, and other APRA representatives for appearing at the public hearing. I commend the report to the House.",121
168,Mr THISTLETHWAITE,COMMITTEES," by leave-When it comes to financial services, the main show in town at the moment is, of course, the banking royal commission. We've seen some shocking revelations from that inquiry at the moment into financial services and banks, particularly in the wealth management sector, where we saw numerous cases of victims of predatory lending, alleged fraud, fees for no service and clear breaches of the Future of Financial Advice reforms and section 961B of the Corporations Act. It should never be forgotten that it was this government, the Turnbull government, that opposed that royal commission for 600 days, and Labor ensured that we pushed the government to establish this important inquiry. Labor have been totally vindicated in our calls for a royal commission into banking and finance in this country. One of the worse offenders at the moment, unfortunately, is the once mighty Commonwealth Bank of Australia. It's got to the situation where there have been special inquiries by our regulators into what's been going on at the Commonwealth Bank. In the recent inquiry that we held with APRA, we discussed that with the representatives from APRA-in particular their inquiry into the Commonwealth Bank's governance, its culture and its accountability frameworks. What APRA determined in respect of what was going on in the Commonwealth Bank can basically be summed up in one sentence: too much focus on profit and not enough focus on culture, accountability and their customers. That's exactly what's been going on in the Commonwealth Bank and, unfortunately, in too many other banks and financial service providers in this country. It took a Labor government, when we were in office, to actually put in place a best-interests duty in our legislation to ensure that financial advisers actually have to act in the best interests of their customers, because-believe it or not-prior to Labor instilling that legislation in 2012, there was no legal obligation for financial advisers to act in the best interests of their client, and guess what: they didn't. In many cases, they didn't. It was this government and its representatives that opposed Labor putting those Future of Financial Advice reforms in that legislation. So if the government had had its way, when you look at it, the cases in the evidence that's coming out of the royal commission-those shocking cases of what the counsel assisting the royal commission is recommending be prosecuted as criminal conduct would not have been illegal. They simply would have been a bad look for some of the banks. That should never, ever be forgotten. So there has been too much focus on profit and not enough on customers, accountability and culture. The Commonwealth Bank has had to enter into enforceable undertakings and a remediation program that's now being overseen by APRA, and APRA have assured our committee that they will continue to monitor what's going on in the Commonwealth Bank. Heap on top of that the AUSTRAC scandal and the alleged clear breaches of Australia's antimoney-laundering and counter-terrorism-financing laws by our biggest bank. The Commonwealth Bank have entered into a settlement with AUSTRAC, and it's a record settlement fine, up to $700 million, that the Commonwealth Bank will pay. When I questioned, in particular, the chairwoman of the Commonwealth Bank and the former CEO when they appeared before our committee on the last occasion, they used this notion of the sub judice rule. They said: 'Oh, we can't answer many of those questions, because these matters are before the court. We can't answer these questions, because these matters are before the court and they may be sub judice.' I made the point at that hearing that I wanted the Commonwealth Bank to answer those questions because it was likely that the matter would be settled and the Australian people would never, ever find out what had actually gone on in the Commonwealth Bank's boardroom and their decision-making processes about the AUSTRAC scandal. Well, what do you know? That's exactly what's happened. The Commonwealth Bank have settled the matter, and the Australian public are none the wiser about what's actually been going on in this bank. So I'm looking forward to representatives of the Commonwealth Bank coming back to our committee in October this year to, hopefully, answer some of those questions. There was also clear discussion about the macroprudential standards that have been instituted by APRA-in particular the limit on the flow of new interest-only lending to 30 per cent of new residential mortgage lending, following an earlier 10 per cent benchmark. What the banks basically did in meeting that target was to push up the cost of interest-only lending. But they didn't do it only for new loans; they did it for existing loans as well. So existing customers got hit with the increase in the cost of credit on their existing loans, when clearly APRA and the regulator were talking about stemming the flow of new loans. I think most Australians would disagree with the approach of the banks there. Really, that's one of the reasons why a lot of Australians hate the banks-because they do things like this. They give an inch and take a mile when it comes to these macroprudential changes. That's exactly what the banks have done. There was also a discussion about the competitive nature of those reforms and the fact that they locked in a market share for some of the bigger players compared to the smaller players, and, in many respects, have stifled competition in that market. They are the issues that were discussed. We look forward to our continuing relationship with APRA. I thank the officers of APRA and I thank the officers of our committee for the fine work that they do. Human Rights Committee Report",123
169,Mr GOODENOUGH,COMMITTEES," On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, I present the committee's report entitled Human rights scrutiny report: report 6 of 2018.  Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).",124
170,Mr GOODENOUGH,COMMITTEES,"by leave-The committee's scrutiny reports provide parliament with a technical examination of the compatibility of bills and legislative instruments with Australia's human rights obligations under international human rights law. The reports do not assess the broader merits of particular measures. A number of bills examined in the current report are scheduled for debate this week, including in relation to counterterrorism, the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, mandatory comprehensive credit reporting, farm household support and underwater cultural heritage. Of the new bills in this report, six have been assessed as not raising human rights concerns, as they promote, permissibly limit or do not engage human rights. The committee is also seeking further information in relation to four bills and legislative instruments. Chapter 2 of the report contains the committee's concluded examination of seven bills and a number of legislative instruments. It includes the committee's concluded examination of the Underwater Cultural Heritage Bill 2018, which I would like to particularly highlight. In relation to this bill, the committee sought further information from the minister as to whether certain penalties in the bill may be criminal for the purposes of international human rights law and, if so, whether the provisions were compatible with criminal process guarantees. Following correspondence with the relevant minister, the committee considered that the civil penalty provisions may be considered criminal for the purposes of human rights law. However, the further information usefully provided by the assistant minister allowed the committee to nevertheless conclude that the penalties may be compatible with criminal process rights, such as the right to be presumed innocent. The committee's analysis highlights how, in the context of civil penalties, if a penalty meets the test of being criminal under international human rights law, this does not convert the relevant conduct into a criminal offence or mean that the civil penalty is illegitimate. Instead, it means that the civil penalties must be compatible with criminal process rights. The assistant minister's detailed and helpful response outlined how the penalties constitute permissible limitations on criminal process rights. This response from the assistant minister and the department is accordingly to be commended. It is also a strong example of the type of information that should be included in statements of compatibility in relation to civil penalty provisions. I encourage my fellow members and others to examine the committee's report to better inform their consideration of proposed legislation. With these comments, I commend the committee's Human rights scrutiny report: report 6 of 2018 to the House. NA Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2018 Second Reading Consideration resumed of the motion: That this bill be now read a second time.",125
171,Mr FITZGIBBON,BILLS," I begin my contribution this afternoon by acknowledging the severity of the drought our country currently faces, which is experienced by not only our farmers and their families but also the rural communities that rely so heavily  on the health of the farming sector. When our farming income is down then the local economy is also down. If ever there were an issue in the parliament on which we should be taking a bipartisan approach, this is it. I'm not suggesting that this speech will be particularly bipartisan, because we seem to be somewhat beyond that, but with the departure of the member for New England I believe there is still an opportunity for us to regroup and approach drought on a bipartisan basis.",125
172,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS," That's very good to hear, Member for Hunter.",126
173,Mr FITZGIBBON,BILLS,"It is all right to extend sympathy to our farming families, which I do tonight on behalf of the opposition, but they need much more than sympathy; they need a parliament and a government working for them, making the real and meaningful responses to drought that can take us well and truly into the future in a way that offers them confidence. Whatever those policies look like, they need to be underpinned by the basic acceptance that drought in our country should no longer be treated as abnormal event, something which will come along occasionally and which, hopefully, won't last too long, and that, rather, our climate is changing-and neither this evening nor the course of this policy debate is the time to argue about what is causing the change; that is for another day-in a way which is making it far more difficult for our farming communities. We need to recognise that is unlikely to change; it's the new normal. We need to accept that protracted drought will be with us again and again, part of our climate on a permanent basis, and approach the policy with those fundamentals in mind. I am still not sure why the Prime Minister recently had a drought tour. I would've thought that, after five years in government and at least seven years of drought, he might've understood the drought and what we as a parliament should be doing about it. More surprisingly, he didn't come back from the drought tour with a policy announcement. I accept that prime ministers look for a photo opportunity when parts of our community are facing natural disasters, but they usually do that ahead of a policy announcement, and on the Prime Minister's return, disappointingly, he offered no such thing. The fact that we are debating this Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2018 this evening poses four key questions for me. First of all, what has happened in drought policy over the last 10 years? I think that's worth sharing with the House. Second, why are we debating this bill before the House now in June 2018? Third, what does the future hold for drought policy in this country? That's something I've already touched on. Fourth, what are the government's policy priorities, and how do the agriculture, forestry and fisheries sectors rate in the government's considerations? Ten years ago now, back in 2008, Commonwealth and state governments started to reflect upon the history of drought policy in this country and its failings. In 2013 something quite historic took place: the Commonwealth and each of the states and territories agreed to a whole new approach to drought policy and entered into an intergovernmental agreement which will have lasted five years, coming to an end 1 July this year, only days away. A number of principles were embraced within that agreement. I should say that agreement had the support of key farm leadership groups like the National Farmers' Federation, and within this parliament it had bipartisan support. It was agreed, with the helping hand and guidance of a Productivity Commission report, that the way we were doing drought policy in this place was failing our farmers, our economy, our communities and indeed, of course, the budget. We  were spending a billion dollars a year on a number of initiatives which usually fall under the umbrella of exceptional circumstances. They were costing us a billion dollars a year. A considerable proportion of farming families, as the Productivity Commission indicated, have been on the welfare payment for many, many years-too many years. Of course, the Productivity Commission identified the fact that many of our farm businesses hadn't made a profit for many years, and it was clear that the drought policies that were in place were not working and were failing our farmers, our communities and our economies. So the states and the Commonwealth said, 'Let's try a new approach,' and the agreement was underpinned by a number of principles. I want to share them with the House. There are five of them. The first was to assist farm families and primary producers to adapt to and prepare for the impacts of increased climate variability. The second was to encourage farm families and primary producers to adopt self-reliant approaches to manage business risks. The third was to ensure families in hardship have access to a support payment that recognises the special circumstances of a farmer, and that's the principle which is leading us to this debate tonight. The fifth was to provide a framework for jurisdictions' responses during periods of drought. I missed the fourth; I'm sorry, Mr Deputy Speaker. It was to ensure that social support services are accessible to farm families. So they are the principles that underpin the intergovernmental agreement which comes to an end on 1 July this year. Of course, the governments-plural, because it commenced under the former Labor government-moved pretty quickly to establish farm household allowance as one of those key principles. Farm household allowance, for those who don't know this area well, is basically an unemployment benefit for farmers. It comes with a more generous or liberal assets test, because obviously farmers can be very cash poor in times of hardship-not necessarily just drought-but still be quite asset rich and unable, of course, to readily pass off those assets. So we need a welfare payment. I think the welfare payment is an important part of the equation, and farm household allowance represents that welfare payment. Importantly, the COAG discussion included an embrace of the idea that the welfare payment should not be ongoing ad infinitum. The concept is really that farmers should get income support for a period of time-three years was chosen-and in that time they should be expected, with some government support and guidance, to make themselves more resilient and more adaptable, to embrace new business models, maybe to get other off-farm income or maybe to leave the land, if that's absolutely necessary and they conclude that that's the only option available to them. What brings us to the debate tonight is the fact that a couple of thousand farming families have now reached the end of their three-year entitlement to farm household allowance, and the government is now seeking to extend it by one year for those who are already on it or have just left farm household allowance because their time has expired-and, indeed, for those who are coming onto it. I need to make clear to the House that, for new entrants on the farm household allowance, the period will now be four years, not three-thus the considerable impact on the budget bottom line. It's not just existing farmers; there will be future farmers as well. The problem with all of that is that the work simply hasn't been done along the way. We've lost five years, basically. The first act of the member for New England when he became the minister was actually to abolish the COAG process. The whole concept of the IGA relied  upon the idea of greater collaboration between the Commonwealth and the states. It's true that, as the mainland managers, under our Constitution the states have to be part of the equation; they have to be part of the solution. There was an entity called the Standing Council on Primary Industries, which dealt with these matters under the umbrella of COAG. SCoPI, the Standing Council on Primary Industries, was not only the ministers meeting but also the committee on which the secretaries were represented. It was the role of that COAG committee to continue to progress the next stages of that drought reform plan. That was then pulled away. Under pressure, it was eventually replaced with a thing called AGMIN-that is, the ag ministers group-which didn't have anything like the construction, secretarial support or resourcing that the Standing Council on Primary Industries had. I'll never understand why SCoPI was abolished, but it was a great mistake by this government. It was a decision authorised by no less than the Prime Minister of the day. It is something the current Prime Minister hasn't sought to turn around; he should turn it around. If we're going to have any hope of producing real and meaningful drought policy in this place, we need a COAG process and we need it very quickly. We've seen other areas of government policy where we've been let down by the diminution of the COAG process. What we have had over the last five years is an increasing reliance on concessional loans. It was a former Labor government that first went down the path of concessional loans for our farmers. At that time, it was not because of drought but because of high indebtedness. That was the major issue of the day. I still believe that, in the higher interest rate environment at that time, there was a role for concessional loans, but this government has fallen into the trap of offering concessional loans for just about any hill any business ever faces: Northern Australia infrastructure loans, concessional loans to farmers-and the list goes on and on. But, as a drought response, the reality is that more debt or switching debt is simply not a solution or an option for many farmers. It entails challenging your relationship with the bank. We've learnt time and time again in this place that it means going through a terrible number of hoops in terms of paperwork during the application process. It is very, very difficult. We've had this over-reliance on concessional loans, and of course the concessional loans have allowed the government to spruik the capital value of the land. We read in the Agricultural competitiveness white paper the government's $4 billion investment. It is a failed document; I think there's a general consensus in the sector on that now. It's $4 billion because that would be the total capital value of all the loans if they were all lent out. Of course, that's not the cost to the budget bottom line. The cost of the budget bottom line is the cost of administering the loans and any bad debts. We need to look at the difference between the government's bond-borrowing rate and the interest rate of the loans. The cost to government is not great. The government has become very fond of these loans because it doesn't cost the budget bottom line and it allows them to spruik that larger amounts of money are going to our farmers. It's a sleight of hand, it's not an approach which is conducive to bipartisanship in this place and it's certainly not a way of helping our farmers. By way of completeness, I acknowledge that the government has improved the farm management deposit scheme in recent years. That's a good thing. It's a very wise policy to allow people to put money away in good times for use in bad times and to use the taxation system to make that attractive. We should continue to make that a key centrepiece of drought policy. The government has also done a little bit of work around capital depreciation-that is,  accelerated depreciation for certain infrastructure projects on-farm, whether it be water or otherwise. The problem is that accelerated depreciation is no good to someone who's not making a profit. You have to spend the money in the first place but if you're suffering a very bad drought then you're not likely to have the money to invest. That takes me to the Regional Investment Corporation. The government is so fond of these loans that it's now going to establish the so-called Regional Investment Corporation in Orange. Why Orange? I think you know the answer to that: because that's where the Nationals lost a state seat for the first time in 69 years, and the best way to grab it back from the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers Party might be to run a little boondoggle or pork-barrelling exercise out to Orange. The problem with the Regional Investment CorporationMr Broad interjecting",126
174,Mr FITZGIBBON,BILLS,"I acknowledge that the member for Mallee would have liked to have had the Regional Investment Corporation, but I will put his mind at rest by saying, 'Don't worry; I don't think the Regional Investment Corporation will ever eventuate.' I don't think we're going to have a regional investment corporation. I've already mentioned 1 July, which is supposed to be day that the Regional Investment Corporation opens its doors and starts making farmers right around the country happy and gives a huge boost to our national economy. Everywhere Mr Littleproud goes, no matter what the problem in the agricultural sector, he says, 'Don't worry; you're going to have the Regional Investment Corporation.' Well, that isn't happening. There won't be any doors opening in Orange on 1 July-at the end of this week or whenever that is-because the Regional Investment Corporation has no real objective, no CEO and no staff. It doesn't even have a location, let alone a building. In fact, the board turned up in Orange I think for the first time last week. There is a board. The minister has appointed a board, and they met in a park. We had the APVMA team, small as it is, meeting at Macca's in Armidale, in the electorate of New England. Mr Broad interjecting",129
175,Mr FITZGIBBON,BILLS,"I'll pick up the member for Mallee's interjections-no reflection on Macca's; it's a good choice. Their coffee's not too bad. But we have the APVMA CEO holding her business in Macca's in Armidale and now we have the RIC board meeting on a park bench in Orange. This is a disgrace. It should stop and it should stop now. The new minister should walk away from the antics of the former minister and just say: 'This is enough. This is not working. This is $28 million of money which could go to drought-affected farmers tomorrow.' That would be a better use of the money. What is the RIC going to do if ever it opens, unlikely as that is? It's going to do the same thing the states are already doing through their rural adjustment authorities: it's going to administer concessional loans to farmers, but only new loans. We'll have a situation where the states will continue to administer old loans for up to 10 years and the Regional Investment Corporation will administer new loans. This is just silly. It's a duplication and an unnecessary one. The minister will say, 'The states weren't doing a very good job of it.' Well, I challenge that, but a good minister would work with the states, bring them in and say: 'I'm not completely happy with the way these loans are being administered. Let's do it better.' That's what a minister showing leadership would do, but it's certainly not what this minister is doing.  I should say that the RIC is allegedly also going to administer some water infrastructure loans. We shall see. While I think of it, I move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House notes the Turnbull Government's failure to provide timely and effective legislative amendments to support Australia's farmers and agricultural industries"". I'm sure the member for Griffith will be happy to second that for me. Ms Butler: Quite right!",129
176,Mr FITZGIBBON,BILLS,"The APVMA is a shocking pork-barrelling exercise that threatens our farming community. It's already destroying productivity in the farming community. The Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority is a critical part of our farm economy and makes sure not only that farmers get their crop sprays and other chemicals and veterinary medicines that they need but also that they get them in a timely way-when new products are offered to the market, they get to the market very quickly. This forced relocation to Armidale is destroying the joint. Staff have left in a mass exodus, and it's impacting on the entity's capacity to do its job. I'll make a bet now: in the not-too-distant future the new minister, finally, will be making big changes. He will be revisiting the general policy order and saying, 'We are going to extend the time available to the APVMA to make this work,' but, more importantly, they will be changing it in a way that will allow more people to stay here in Canberra to work. In the not-too-distant future this government will be admitting that the APVMA relocation has been a failure. They will be left with no choice but to pretend they're having a relocation to Armidale, but in fact a large number of staff will be working here in Canberra, because they cannot find the personnel-the expert lawyers and the regulatory scientists-they need to do that work. I challenge Minister Littleproud: he should just run up the white flag now and differentiate himself from the former minister and say: 'We're not going to waste $50 million or more on this relocation to Armidale. We're not going to undermine the productivity of our farmers. We're not going to threaten consumer health, because we eat the stuff that those sprays are used on and we want to make sure the regulator is up to the job. And we're not going to undermine our exports, because the APVMA plays a role in that regulatory regime, as well. We're not going to do that. We're going to gut this idea, forget the pork barrel and bring the APVMA back to Canberra, where it absolutely belongs.' In posing my question-why are we debating this bill now?-I've touched on the history. People have already gone off the farm household allowance. They have exhausted their entitlement and here we are, in the last sitting fortnight, rushing a bill through the parliament to create this extension. We are still very unclear about what hoops people will have to go through who have already come off the farm household allowance. I invite the minister to explain that further to us when he makes his closing remarks. Is it going to be as hard as it was for people when they first went on the farm household allowance? Remember the member for New England saying: 'Oh, they don't have to apply or wait; they just get it.' That is the statement that led to the doctoring of his Hansard and subsequently the dismissal of his departmental secretary-one of the darkest periods of our history in this place. Why are we debating a bill that needs to be given effect basically from 1 July-this week? The  government couldn't work out a month, two months or six months ago that in the absence of any other policy work in the last five years they're going to have to extend the farm household allowance? They had to wait until now? This is just incredible. Was it the drought tour that convinced the Prime Minister that he needed to extend the farm household allowance by a year? Surely not. I hope not, because that was just obvious to all and sundry. What does the future hold for drought policy in this country? This is an interesting question. Something very curious happened in the Federation Chamber last night. I welcome the fact that during the week of the Prime Minister's infamous drought tour the relatively new Minister for Agriculture and Water started talking about climate, recognising the things I was saying earlier about accepting drought as not an abnormal event. He talked about resilience, he talked about adaptation and he talked about the challenge for some people in some parts of the country that were capable of being farmed 100 years ago and are not so capable of being farmed today. He was using all the right language. But the member for Calare had a motion on drought last night in which he mentioned none of those things. Interestingly, the member for New England contributed to that debate and, again, mentioned none of those things. I'm glad the member for Mallee is here, because he did. He understands this subject pretty well, in my view, and I'll give credit where credit is due. But who's in charge? Is the former member for New England still in charge of drought policy? He's still in denial, still wanting to roll out the boondoggles and defend his legacy. Or is the new minister in charge, backed by people like the member for Mallee? I hope it's the new minister, and I wish the member for Mallee the best in that regard, because we do need to get this job done. We need to embrace the intergovernmental agreement review. We need to rebuild the SCoPI process and construction, because that's the first step. The other question I posed was on government priorities. Remember when agriculture was one of this government's five pillars of the economy? They hardly talk about the agriculture sector anymore. The member for New England was very fond of claiming credit when commodity prices were high and everything was good, but, now we have a crisis in all sorts of places, including the dairy industry, no-one wants to talk about agriculture anymore. Let's have a look at the legislative agenda. The Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Legislation Amendment (Operational Efficiency) Bill 2017 was introduced into this House on 25 October last year. This bill enjoys bipartisan support. It has disappeared. The Export Control Bill 2017, a very important bill, was introduced into the Senate on 7 December last year. It hasn't been prioritised and has disappeared. It's an important bill which enjoys bipartisan support. The Biosecurity Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2018, another very important bill, was introduced into the House on 28 March last year. It is still in the House. It was introduced and has disappeared. The penalties for breaches of animal welfare standards in the live export trade were introduced on 24 May, never to be seen again. We know the reason for the last one: I foreshadowed an amendment, and the government won't bring the bill back, because it's fearful of people crossing the floor and of losing the vote. How does this reflect on the government's priorities for agriculture? They won't even bring bipartisan bills into the House for debate and to be voted upon. They won't even put these bills on the legislative agenda. I don't have time to go through them tonight, but these are important bills. The department of agriculture is spending a very large slice of its time and  resources trying to work out how to make the APVMA work in Armidale and the Regional Investment Corporation work in Orange, when it should be focusing on these very important and meaningful matters that affect our agricultural sector. When the former minister was here, we heard about dams which were unproven, uneconomic and will never come to reality, and silly stunts around carp eradication. I said so many times that he was the worse agriculture minister in the history of Federation. That's in the past. I want the new minister to step forward and demonstrate that he's prepared to take the agriculture portfolio seriously. It's not just agriculture; they wiped fisheries and forestry out of the portfolio title-another silly mistake. We don't hear the new minister talk about fisheries or forestry. I know Senator Ruston does work in that area, but people want to hear their lead minister talk about these issues. For five years a crisis has been looming in forestry because of our failure to grow the plantation estate, and what have we had in response? We've had an issues paper, which was eventually turned into a discussion paper and, last year, by no less than the Prime Minister himself, turned into a plan to have a plan-and we're still waiting for the plan. For five years we've known about the problem and have had nothing but discussion papers, the formation of committees et cetera. It's not good enough. The opposition will be supporting this bill because, in the absence of any real progress on national drought reform for five years, we've no choice now but to further help farmers who haven't made that transition and haven't been given appropriate guidance or support by the government. Farmers will need another year, but what happens after that? Surely we'll be back here next year asking ourselves the same question if this government is not prepared to get serious about rebuilding the COAG process and about real collaboration with the states. Mr Littleproud has said it, but we want to see him walk the talk. They need to be serious about embracing the concept that the climate is changing and the change is here to stay. It has to be about resilience and adaptation. We have to help people find new business models, retrain and, sadly for some, acknowledge that they might not have an ongoing concern, because of a severely changing climate.",130
177,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, Is the amendment seconded? Ms Butler: I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.,132
178,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS,"The original question was that this bill be now read a second time. To this, the honourable member for Hunter has moved as an amendment that all words after 'that' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. If it suits the House, I will state the question in the form 'that the amendment be agreed to'. The question is now that the amendment be agreed to.",132
179,Mr BROAD,BILLS," In rising to speak on the Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2018, can I respectfully ask that the member for Hunter hang around for a few minutes-hopefully, he does. I sat here and listened for half an hour and, like a good opposition spokesman for agriculture, he did his best to dismantle the federal government's position on what it's going to do. But, also like a good opposition spokesman for agriculture, he forgot to talk about what he was going to do. The extension of farm household support is less than 12 months; I was hoping for a little more. Member for Hunter, it wasn't until 24 minutes into your contribution on the bill that you  actually started to mention what you might do, and I thought: 'I'm excited. There's going to be an alternate position-finally.' I actually believe that the member for Hunter can do it. He's probably the first Labor member that I've seen who genuinely has a real passion for the portfolio, and that's really welcome. He's got a genuine interest. I hope he hangs around, because I'm going to talk a little less about the politics and a little more about drought policy. In my maiden speech, I gave a recognition that successive parliaments over many, many years hadn't developed a good drought policy-and we probably still haven't, if we're honest with ourselves. The fact is that we live in a country that is going to experience significant rainfall at times; it is also going to experience significant dry times. It is right for the member for Hunter to talk about climate, because there is no doubt that we're having more challenging climatic conditions around our agricultural sector. If you're a believer in climate changesome of my farmers are and some of my farmers aren't-you will at least adhere to the concept that rainfall seems to be more sporadic and that, when rain does come, the downpours are heavier, which means that we need greater intervention, particularly around water catchments. There is a good argument for dams as a result of climate change. I want to talk about a number of things that have been good and then touch on some things that would be significant improvements. I think farm household support is a basic. It's not rocket science. If we have a family that is not working and is living in a poor suburb in one of our towns, we make sure that they've got groceries on the table. If you've got a farming business that might have a large amount of assets but then, even though they're having a go, because of the seasonal conditions they are in difficulty, it's only fair that they also have groceries on the table. It is nice that drought support is being extended for a fourth year. I wonder whether it should even be indefinite. What we simply want to say is that, if you're having a dip, we're going to ensure that you're able to feed your children and that you're able to put shoes on their feet and uniforms on their backs so that they can go to school. So it does surprise me that this support even had a three-year cut-off. Of course, what we want is farm businesses to be profitable, sound and not to have to rely on farm household support-and many of them are. The farm management deposit has been a good system. I point out that we have legislated so that a farm management deposit can be used against an existing loan. That has been taken up by Rural Bank. It's the only bank in Australia that has taken it up. That would be a very simple way of at least making those farm managements more attractive and more competitive in the interest rate component. I think we also need to be very mindful of time of entry. That's something we haven't got our head around. I bought my first farm when I was 22 years old. In the drought of 2002, when I harvested my crop-and, for those who are interested in grain growing, when you sow wheat, you sow it at about two bushels an acre, so about 60 kilograms an acre-my harvest was 30 kilograms an acre. I got less than half back. I remember that, when I was a young farmer, my wife was working, and, even though she was only earning $33,000 at the time, because she earned over $25,000 we weren't eligible for drought assistance-none at all. I remember getting the letter saying that I wasn't eligible. I got it and I nailed it to the shearing shed wall and said, 'I'll show you who's viable!' Anyway, we made a go of it. But I think that time of entry is incredibly important because, if you're going to support farmers through a difficult time, what you want at the other end of it, when the rains start falling again, is young farmers to be able to kick off and go, because they're the ones who are going to drive our  productivity gains, they're the ones who are going to take up the new technology and they're the ones who are going to drive the exports for the nation. So, whatever we do, we have to think about time of entry for drought assistance. The other thing that I think is working is the seasonal insurance model. This requires better forecasting. It requires a good network of Doppler weather radar. Essentially, what we're seeing across my farming sector now is that people will work out: what is the input cost of growing a crop? I'll just go on a per-acre basis, to put it in layman's terms-even though we talk in hectares, a lot of the country in my area is laid out in mile-square blocks, which are 640 acres. It essentially costs you about $30 or $40, up to $50, an acre to put in a crop by the time you write out your cheques for your fertiliser, write out your cheques for your chemicals and write out cheques for your fuel, your scarifier points and all those sorts of things. We are able now to access insurance products that will cover the costs of your inputs if you have a year that's a complete wipe-out. Say for example that, to put in 2,000 acres of crop, you would have needed $200,000 worth of inputs. You're able to insure those products at less than $10 an acre-so it's reasonably competitive-so that, if you get a lack of growing-season rainfall between June and September, you'll get a payout for that. I just want to point out why this is important. If you as a farmer start to develop a drought package in your own business, you'll say, 'I'm going to take this insurance product so that, if it doesn't rain, at least I've got enough money to put the crop in next year.' That's tick one. You'll also try to get your farm management deposit to equal what the interest component is on your loan. If you talk to any bank, most banks will roll you over another year as long as you've got the capacity to cover your interest. If you set up your business so you've got your interest component covered through your farm management deposit and you take out the insurance product so that you've got the input costs, it means that, okay, in a drought year you've made nothing, but you haven't gone backwards. You couple that with farm household support, so you've still got food on the kitchen table, and I think you start to look at a package that fundamentally works. Those are the things that I think we need to perhaps create greater incentives. Also, we need to be mindful that farmers will look, in their own farming system, at ways of developing a drought assistance package. That might be that they'll be putting in additional storage, so they'll put two years of grain aside so they've always got seed to plant. They might put a feedlot on to value-add. I think we need to be very cognisant of and open to accelerated depreciation packages when a farmer is saying, 'I'm doing this part of my business so that I can drive some productivity.' Ultimately, I would like to see the government having a good discussion with some of the big insurers. I'll just run through this because this is something that I looked at as a farm business at one stage. At one stage I looked at leasing 6,000 acres in Saskatchewan, in Canada, and farming over there. People ask, 'Why would you do that?' The logical answer was: because you get the northern hemispherical risk with the southern hemispherical risk in your grain growing. Not many farmers can look at how they can do that productively in their own business. However, what we're seeing now with companies such as QBE and big insurance companies is that, if you look at like-for-like countries-and the clear ones would be Canada and Australia-you could develop an insurance product that is local but also has a reinsurance component by a company such as QBE, and you could actually get a global  insurance company. Their input in that would bring the premium prices down quite substantially. There is some really quite practical stuff that we can be doing in insurance products, in assistance to farmers and in assistance through drought. Can I touch on one of the other things that were substantially beneficial for me as a farmer throughout the drought of 2002 and the drought of 2006, 2007 and 2008-the hat-trick drought, as I call it. I remember my father, who had farmed all his life, said: 'You only ever get in our area one drought in a row; you never get two. Always the second year is a good year.' That theory was blown in 2006, 2007 and 2008. It's very humbling to have worked as hard as you can physically work and at the end of three years realise that if you'd done nothing for three years you would have actually had a better life and made more money. The one thing that has helped us has been the opening up of markets. I think this is something we need to be very careful about, and it is something this place actually can benefit from. I'll give an example of that. In 2002, even though we had fairly skinny sheep, we were still able to sell those sheep for up to $100 a head. In 1992 we were shooting sheep. You couldn't give them away. People say, 'What is the difference?' The difference is this: in 1992 Australia was exporting sheepmeat to 12 countries, and in 2002 we were exporting sheepmeat to 96 countries. So opening up market opportunities is perhaps one of the most important things this place can do to build resilience in our farming sector. Ultimately, the greater utilisation of that carcass-with hearts and livers and bits and pieces out of the carcasses being airlifted across to the Middle East-put an underlying floor in the prices that farmers could get. If you looked to the mixed farming area that I was in, the one thing that sustained them through the drought years was that at least one part of their commodity was getting very good prices. We talk about farm household assistance; we talk about insurance products; we talk about accelerated depreciation for infrastructure on farm; and we talk about things that can be done in the way of loans and those sorts of things, but that factor of opening up markets must always be well stated. The other thing that we've substantially done-and it has been the role of government to assist this-has been building major water pipeline infrastructure projects. In my patch is the largest pipeline system in the world. People may not be aware of that. The Wimmera Mallee Pipeline was from a combination of the Victorian Labor government and the federal government. You can actually go to nearly every paddock across a third of the state of Victoria, and every paddock's got a tap on it and you can turn the water on. We've got two more projects we want to get funded: the East Grampians pipeline and the Mitiamo pipeline. We're funding the Loddon pipeline at the moment, with $20 million from the federal government and a contribution of $40 million from the Victorian Labor government. Those things have been very interesting because, call it climate change or call it what you will, we are seeing that areas that used to run a lot of livestock and that rely on catchment damswhere, essentially, it would rain and the water would wash into the dams-have had dam evaporation rates higher than they have had and less ability to hold water than they have had. So the ability to run poly pipe for hundreds and hundreds of kilometres has revolutionised the farming systems. It's opened up opportunities for BASF, formally Bayer, with a research facility in Horsham, which is the only canola genetics research facility in the Southern Hemisphere. It's opened up intensive animal husbandry such as Luv-a-Duck, which is  processing 90,000 ducks a day. It's opened up opportunities for feedlotting lambs. It has been a substantial thing. If you want to look at policies that can address drought communities, they are a combination of water infrastructure, trade policies and getting the settings right around loans, farm management deposits and insurance products. I just want to touch on one other issue that's also very relevant to this policy, and it's something that worked reasonably well in 2002 and in 2006, 2007 and 2008, and that has been assistance with rates. One of the things we've always found when it is dry is that the capacity for a farmer to pay their rates has been substantially diminished. Farmers pay a large burden of the rates in our country shires. Some of those rates can be $10,000, $20,000 or $30,000. There have been rate subsidies of 50 per cent which have also been a significant help. Those rates subsidies not only helped the farmers but also helped the rural community, because they meant that the shire had money coming in. If there's one thing we have learnt when it comes to dealing with drought, it is that you also have to remember that there's a rural community that has to have money stimulating it. There's much to be done in the drought space. There's more leadership to be had. There are many good ideas out there that we can learn from other parts of the world. But this is something that we must tackle, because if there's one thing we know about Australia it is that it is raining sometimes and it is dry sometimes and it will always be that way.",132
180,Ms SWANSON,BILLS," Have you heard the news today-news of the continued fighting in the Turnbull government's cabinet over the National Energy Guarantee; news that the former Prime Minister, the member for Warringah, will cross the floor on this issue if he doesn't get his way; news about the Turnbull government's incessant campaign to lock in massive corporate tax cuts for business? We could wind back the calendar a day, a week or a month and revisit the headlines and see this pattern ad nauseam, a pattern where an out-of-touch government puts its political priorities ahead of the interests of ordinary Australians, a pattern where the government is increasingly paralysed by party room dysfunction, a pattern where the Prime Minister's grasp on the leadership becomes more tenuous with each and every Newspoll. Meanwhile, the people of Australia couldn't really give a toss about most of it. To be frank, they're fed up. They are fed up with the government's obsession with itself, at the expense of all Australians, and fed up with a government that seems to want to serve the top end of town while the rest of us hang out and hang on, desperate to try to pay for clothes and shoes for our children and desperate to try to pay the ever-increasing energy bills. They really just want some leadership and policies. Nothing could be closer to this than this bill on farm household support. I'm glad that the government has decided to support our farming families and extend the farm household allowance by one year, from three to a maximum of four cumulative years. But I ask why this has taken so long. I spoke in the chamber yesterday about my anger that it has taken Prime Ministers Turnbull and Abbott and agriculture ministers Joyce and Littleproud an unacceptable and indeed unforgiveable amount of time to act on this. I spoke about the great hardships that have been experienced by farming families in my electorate of Paterson for many months. Vegetable farmers were unable to grow crops due to hot and arid conditions, tanks were bone dry and salinity levels in the depleted rivers made irrigation impossible. Beef  farmers were forced to handfeed and spend exorbitant amounts of time and money on water cartage to prevent stock deaths due to dehydration. The livelihood of our milk producers in my electorate was further threatened by the unavailability of water, which made sanitation of their dairies almost impossible and really incredibly difficult. Carefully crafted bloodlines of really prized animals were unceremoniously sent to market or to the slaughterhouse because it was financially impossible for farmers to keep them alive. I remind the honourable members opposite that this situation did not suddenly spring up at the beginning of the month when the Prime Minister decided to conduct the whistlestop selfie tour of the big dry. We have properties and communities in New South Wales and Queensland that have been paralysed by drought for the last seven years. So, while my colleagues and I on this side of the House do not decline to give the Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2018 a second reading, there are some points that really do need to be made and called out on. I support the member for Hunter's call for an amendment to the motion that notes the Turnbull government's failure to provide timely and effective legislative amendments to support Australia's farming families and, more broadly, the agricultural sector, because this faffing around is nothing new from this Prime Minister and the cohort he has around him. The Turnbull government has a penchant for selectively pursuing legislation that promotes its political agenda at the expense of everything else. Time and time again, the people of Australia are left waiting for this government to govern. In my electorate of Paterson, where the community of Williamtown is ground zero in Australia's PFAS contamination nightmare, my constituents have been pleading for nigh on three years for this Prime Minister and the members of his cabinet to do something-to publish their anticipated report, to honour their avowed commitments to release their promised policy and to offer a pathway out of the living nightmare my constituents have been trapped inside since 4 September 2015. Yes, there are critical matters that this government could turn its attention towards. But no; far too much energy is spent pandering to the bloke who's going to throw his toys out of the pram if he doesn't get his way or pandering to the pork-barrelling former minister feathering his own electorate nest. This government has had years to put in place a structure that would have helped these farmers, right now, to make a living. It could have provided advice and support for those who aim to droughtproof their operations over the long term. It could have helped farming families make that difficult call about whether they can or cannot make a quid out of farming, given the changed market conditions and ever more volatile climatic extremes, and it could have offered pathways and retraining for people who choose to leave the land. The government could have used the SCoPI process to put these supports in place. It could have done this some time ago and it did not, and that is a disgrace. And now our farming families are meant to rejoice that the government has seen fit to extend household assistance for a further 12 months. Yes, it is something but, as I said yesterday, it's nowhere near enough. It's a small sticking plaster on a gaping wound. Our farming families are an important part of Australia's agricultural landscape and the fabric of our nation. Elsewhere in our agricultural sector we have primary producers and those who rely on them stuck in limbo waiting for the government to act. My electorate of Paterson is home to beef farmers, dairy farmers, fishers, prawners and oyster growers. They work  incredibly hard, and times have been tough. I've spoken before in the House to share the plight of my constituents, who suffered through the driest season in 80 years-stock farmers who were forced to sell or face exorbitant hand-feeding costs. Even water came at a premium in terms of both time and cartage, and, if the tanks weren't dry, as I mentioned earlier, the salinity levels in the river were as high as some farmers had ever seen them. Vegetable farmers just watched entire crops fail. In the face of the uncontrollable challenges of climate and weather, we owe it to our farming families to appropriately support their industry and, in turn, their livelihoods. We should be turning our brightest agricultural minds to this and saying, 'How can we make this better for those people who work so hard every day and who really have been the best in the world?' It is completely unacceptable that the Turnbull government continues to fail Australian farmers and agricultural industries through legislative delays. Right now, Prime Minister Turnbull and the members opposite have amassed quite a stockpile of outstanding bills while they attempt to ram home their own agenda. This is patently not good enough. The people of Australia are looking to Prime Minister Turnbull and his government to do precisely that: govern in the interests of those who saw fit to elect them. Instead they wait and they wait and they wait some more. I might just add that I find it particularly disappointing that members of the National Party always talk about being agrarian socialists, say that they just want to do the best by the bush, and say that they want to support the agricultural sectorswell, I think that they've put their hands up and stood on the wrong side of the House in many votes and particularly",136
181,Mr Katter,BILLS,They are not agrarian socialists. They are definitely not. I am!,138
182,Ms SWANSON,BILLS,"I will take that interjection: perhaps you are, but we could do with some more of those. The Turnbull government has made a considered choice to prioritise parliamentary business ahead of our farmers and agricultural industries. It seems to find all the time and press releases and media opportunities in the world to promote the corporate tax cuts for big business, yet this parliament is headed for a six-week-long break at the end of this sitting, and critical legislation will need to wait until August to be even considered-such as the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Legislation Amendment (Operational Efficiency) Bill, also known as agvet chemicals legislation. This innocuous-sounding piece of legislation is actually tied up with the infamous APVMA, the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority, where we saw the member for New England relocate a government authority to his own electorate in a case of blatant pork-barrelling. The agvet bill involves minor amendments, mostly technical, that should assist with streamlining APVMA operations. But it should be no surprise that, after the debacle of its forced relocation, APVMA is now on life support-its current financial position is reportedly untenable, as is its technological infrastructure. So not only are industry stakeholders waiting to have the agvet bill passed; the Prime Minister has decided that APVMA is in need of a governance board, which, of course, will require an amendment to the bill in the Senate. What does that mean for our constituents? It actually means more waiting, because a former minister of the Turnbull government put his own interests ahead of the country's. There are a number of other examples of this government prioritising its political gameplaying ahead of our farmers and the agricultural industry. There was the decision to pull the  Export Legislation Amendment (Live-stock) Bill, and the Export Control Bill has been lost in transit since it was briefly debated in the Senate earlier this year. And, in a matter very much in the interests of my constituents in Paterson, there is the Biosecurity Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2018. I first met Sue and Rob Hamilton when their family prawning operation was shut down in 2015 when the RAAF Base Williamtown PFAS scandal broke out. That's right: we had professional prawners whose businesses were closed. The Hamiltons and other commercial fishers working Tilligerry Creek and Fullerton Cove were stripped of their livelihoods when it was discovered that firefighting chemicals PFOS and PFOA had leeched from the base into the waterways of our community. This is an absolute reality. Fishing bans lasted 12 months. This took a toll on many families like the Hamiltons and other fishers in Paterson. The Hamiltons battled through, however, and returned to the water and their industry. Sue contacted me again in October last year to raise her concerns about the prevalence of white spot syndrome, a virus that is imported in green prawns. Importation of the prawns had been suspended following an outbreak of the virus in commercial prawn farms in Queensland and then around the wild prawns in Logan River and Moreton Bay. It had spread. Sue reached out to me after the then Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources, the member for New England, Barnaby Joyce, lifted the suspension on the importation of green prawns into Australia. Sue was concerned because white spot is a massive deal. It leads to a highly lethal and contagious viral infection. Outbreaks have been known to wipe out the entire populations of prawn farms in days. The virus is not dangerous to humans and it is killed when the prawn is cooked, but the Aussie tradition of putting a green prawn on a hook and throwing a line in puts our waterways and our seafood industry at risk. Sue and her husband, Rob, still reeling from the year-long PFAS shutdown of their family business, were incensed by the biosecurity issues that remained in play even after the importation ban was lifted. And it's no wonder: the situation was and is nonsensical. As a matter of fact, the failings highlighted by Sue and Rob were exposed in 2016, two years ago, and legislation to shore up those biosecurity failings and breaches is still yet to pass this parliament. We have a precedent where imported prawns infected Australian wild prawns and prawn farms. The Australian wild prawning areas and prawn farms were slapped with a ban. Meanwhile, the ban on the very source of white spot, the imported green prawns, was lifted. In what universe does that make sense? We must have a system that is able to respond quickly to biosecurity failings and breaches. This is why the government must prioritise legislation that will strengthen our biosecurity system. This bill was introduced into the House in March this year and received Labor's support. That was three months ago, and that's a lot of water under the bridgemetaphorically and literally. Three months, however, pales in comparison to the length of time our farming families have waited for the government to take any meaningful action towards long-term drought reform. More than four years ago, Labor supported the government's Farm Household Support Bill. This was the product of a 2013 Standing Committee on Primary Industriesotherwise known as SCoPI-meeting which continued to commit to the previous Labor government's commitment to provide a new, nationally agreed approach to drought. It's now 2018. The intergovernmental agreement on drought reform, of which farm household support  is part, will expire on 1 July this year. That is literally days away, yet our farming families wait for a plan that is fit for the future. The Prime Minister and his colleagues must park their self-interests and put the ordinary folk of Australia ahead of the select few at the top end of town. We must insist that this government that seems increasingly out of touch put the interests of ordinary Australians front and centre.",138
183,Mr DRUM,BILLS," It's always fun to follow on from Labor when they're talking about agriculture and water issues. We're talking about drought through New South Wales and Queensland. It's a very serious issue. If Labor had their way, they'd have a man made drought. They'd follow the Greens down the path of handing all the water in the Murray-Darling Basin back to the environment. They'd have a water crisis in the Goulburn Valley. They'd have a water crisis throughout the Murrumbidgee. They'd have a water crisis down throughout the lower reaches of the Murray River. They'd have a water crisis made by politicians. They'd have a water crisis that's fake. They would inflict that pain gladly on the people down the Murray-Darling Basin just by carrying out their policies-their policies that they are very proud of when they come into this House. In relation to looking after our farmers throughout the Goulburn Valley, we spend most of our time fighting Labor and their ridiculous stance on water policy. So it's a bit tough when we have the Labor Party come in and want to lecture us about how we should be doing more for our farmers when their own policies would see many of our farmers unable to carry on the farming practices that they have done for two, three or four generations-ever since we've had irrigation throughout the Goulburn Valley and the Goulburn region. This support package, the Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2018, is critically important. I was able to see first hand how important this sort of assistance package is during the milk crisis that took place in the early months of 2016, when Murray Goulburn announced that it was going to drastically cut the price of milk. It was quickly followed by Fonterra and many of the other processors. Not only did they cut their prices for milk into the future but they then requested this ridiculous clawback where they wanted the money that farmers had, in their opinion, been overpaid. They wanted tens of thousands and, in many cases, hundreds of thousands of dollars repaid to the processors. This put so many of the dairy farmers throughout the Goulburn Valley and Victoria in an incredibly tough position. With the little that they were being paid for milk in those months, it was virtually impossible for them to process milk for the cost that they were able to sell the milk. This put them in a ridiculously tough position. Many of them were forced to park their cattle in different locations where they didn't have to rely on irrigation water. They had to take the charity of hay that was brought down from other parts of the nation to assist them with their feed. More than anything, they simply had to plough on. They had to get out of bed at 4.30 or five o'clock in the morning, milk the cows in the morning and milk them again in the evening, knowing that they were financially going backwards all the time to the tune of many thousands of dollars per week. I must acknowledge the previous Leader of the Nationals Barnaby Joyce on his role during that milk crisis. He went immediately down to the Goulburn Valley to talk to and meet with the dairy farmers, the milk producers and the processors. He was there to immediately offer this support with the farm household allowance and to immediately offer low-interest loans, which were picked up. Yes, there were problems with the extent of the forms that needed to be filled out. But, when you think about the many hundreds of thousands of dollars of  commercial loans that the government was effectively taking over, offering security for those properties was a very complex issue. We were able to act and to try to put in some assistance for many of these farmers during these very stressful times. It's an issue that gets lost often when we're talking about these times of drought and the milk crisis, where production costs rise above the farm gate milk prices. The traditional farmer in that situation is under an enormous amount of stress and financial pressure, and mental health becomes a very important issue that needs to be dealt with very carefully. This is where, again, the counsellors from rural finance come in-mediation counsellors and people who are able to help with the financial restructuring and to help the farmers fill out many of these applications. The big message that we were telling our farmers was: 'Do not self-assess. Make sure you get the help that you need so that you can have independent people come in and look at your books and your business and, in relation to other pieces of off-farm income that may have been coming into the household, see whether or not you are able to access part or all of the just under $2,000 per couple per month at the maximum.' Effectively, just in the area of the farm household support, that is putting about $23,000 to $24,000 per year on the table for those families. When you read that in conjunction with access to a low-interest loan-again, the former minister was able to make these low-interest loans available for up to half of your loan-we found that many people were taking advantage of that as well, and the combined saving was somewhere in the vicinity of $50,000. This is a fantastic opportunity for government to help those farming businesses that have the capacity to see their way through this to a fruitful future in the following years, and that's the way it has been. The dairy industry now has improved markedly. There are still many farmers out there that are really doing it tough, and there is no set model of a dairy farmer at the moment. If someone were to ask you, 'How's dairy going at the moment?' you can't really answer that question, because the models within the dairy farming structures are so diverse and so different. If a farmer in the Goulburn Valley owns their own water, that's an enormous benefit, an enormous plus. Obviously the debt profile of the various farmers makes a huge difference. Their ability to produce their own hay and feed also makes a very big difference to the economic viability of our farmers. All of these factors swirling around together will somehow or other give you a profile as to how our dairy farmers are going. As I said, they are just so diverse and so different. It is very difficult. But this bill is now going to show the benefits of this farmer support package. The benefits to these households are going to be extended for another 12 months, and it's a fantastic thing that the Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources, David Littleproud, has been able to push through. As I said just recently, the right thing to do for the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and the Assistant Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment, Mark Coulton, along with the Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources, David Littleproud, was to tour those outback regions of New South Wales and Queensland to make sure that they see first hand what seven years of below-average rainfall has meant for those areas from northern Victoria up into Queensland. I have been speaking to quite a few farmers about farm household support and farm household allowance recently, and I just want to quote one farmer who spoke to me just recently and said:  As a farmer directly impacted by the Murray Goulburn Milk price drop in April 2016, the effects have been long lasting. The impacts on cash flow have been long and unrelenting. Being able to access the Farm Household Allowance during this time has provided some breathing space and peace of mind knowing that assistance with reduced cash flows; you can put food on the table each week and provide the essentials for your family, while you attempt to rebuild your business. Our assigned case manager has been very supportive through the process over the past 2 years in assessing our situation, providing guidance and developing a plan for the future. This is the part that often gets left behind. Yes, we are helping initially with farm household support by putting some cash on the table to help pay for groceries, for school fees and the essential bills. We are helping out in the medium to longer term also with the low-interest loans that can be worked into a business to take up to 50 per cent of outstanding loans. The case managers from Rural Finance are put in the business as well to give them the support they need with counselling. They have that financial acumen introduced into the farming business as well to see where their future lies. In the message I received that was hugely appreciated. It is great when you come into this place and see these genuine benefits. We're helping these people and making a real difference. This is a practical situation. We are making a difference to these people who are in a very tough position at the moment. They needed this support. Some of these three-year periods of drought are coming to an end. Now it's going to be extended for a further 12 months. This, along with farm management deposits, gives us an opportunity to help people get themselves through really tough times. This is something we in the National Party are really supportive of. It's fantastic that many people have seen the worse of the dairy crisis and are now working through it and can see a bright future. There are still many others who, with their water costs and debt profile, are in a very precarious situation. It would be a good thing if they could produce milk at a price below what they are paid for it. Certainly the 830-odd farmers who were assisted through the dairy crisis have been very appreciative. Hopefully, this is something that they will look back on and say: 'Thank goodness the government of the day understood what was needed and were able to move quickly and give us the assistance they gave us so that we got through the very toughest of times. They put counselling around us so that we could in a calm and measured way assess our future and either exit the industry with assets intact or push ahead and create a more promising future.' I commend this bill to the House. I certainly hope that these measures are there for the next crisis, because we know that when you live in Australia you are always going to have crises when it comes to farming practices.",140
184,Ms CHESTERS,BILLS," At the beginning of my remarks on the Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2018 I want to correct the record on something that the member for Murray said in relation to Labor's approach to the Murray-Darling Basin and our history on reaching a bipartisan approach to the management of the Murray-Darling. It was a former Labor government that ended the water wars, the dispute between the states, and that brought the states together and actually implemented the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. You can tell that the member for Murray didn't actually live in the electorate of Murray during the water wars and the crisis, because he would have remembered that the Murray was actually dry. Farmers didn't actually have access to the water he stood up and said that Labor stole  from his farmers. We all accept that he was involved in football and was off playing or coaching AFL, but he shouldn't stand up here and mislead the House and say that it was Labor who stole the water off the farmers during that millennium drought when there was no water. The Murray was dry. It was that crisis that triggered Labor to work with the states to reach a bipartisan position to end the water wars and restore the health of the Murray. The health of the Murray is critical to farmers. We know that. We understand that. Labor continue to work with agricultural industries and communities on ensuring that: the next generation of farmers, and the generation after, have access to water for agriculture over the long term; our environment has the water it needs to regenerate; all states have their fair share; and, most importantly, the Murray-Darling system is healthy. That's not the only area where the government is failing agriculture and our farmers. They've become known as the government that likes to talk, to meet and to tinker around the edges. They're also a government that likes to smash things and blow things up in some ways, and we've seen that countless times from this government in agriculture. In the area of labour this government is failing to ensure farmers have not just a seasonal workforce but a skilled workforce, ready to plant and harvest crops in the regions, so that the agricultural industry continues to be viable. Labour is one of the big issues raised with me by farm organisations throughout this country. Only this afternoon I met with Voice of Horticulture, who are furious and frustrated with this government for its failure to crack down on migrant worker exploitation and, more importantly, close existing tax loopholes that allow these dodgy firms to thrive. We talked about the need to restrict access to ABNs. This is part of Labor Party policy. If we stopped international students and backpackers from accessing ABNs then they would be less likely to be exploited or to start a labour-hire business and exploit other people here on temporary arrangements. It's becoming less rare that Voice of Horticulture stand side by side with Labor on a policy announcement, yet nobody in the government says that is possible to do or believes there is a need to do it. When it comes to labour, the government is also failing to ensure our TAFEs in the regions have courses that meet the needs of farmers and the agricultural industry. TAFEs throughout the regions have been gutted. That has been driven by the massive funding cuts state and federal Liberal governments have imposed on the vocational education and training sector. That has left a skills gap in the regions, and more and more farmers in our agricultural industry are looking to 457 visa holders and backpackers to fill those gaps. They say to me on a regular basis that, if a local were available, they would hire a local. They want people to live and work in the regions, but local workers simply don't have the skills to do so. That is such a shame when we look at the youth unemployment rate, which is at 19 or 20 per cent in some of these regional areas. We have the young people; we just need to give them the skills and the opportunities and to match them to existing farming and agricultural jobs. This government is also failing to support farmers and the agricultural sector when it comes to innovation. A few weeks ago I had the opportunity to meet with strawberry farmers in South-East Queensland who, off their own bat, have decided to introduce tabletop strawberry farming, where it's off the ground. They're among the first to do this in Australia. That means they're using fewer chemicals to keep pests off their crops. It also means that, because they are now off the ground, they are more water efficient and have higher yields.  If you're in Coles and see Taste 'N See strawberries, pick them up, because they are an example of innovation within the strawberry industry. This government did nothing to support them in doing that. These growers, knowing that there would be a change in the chemicals that they could use, got in front. They wanted to increase their yield, but they knew that the quality of their soil was such that it would really start to diminish the returns on their crops. They had to go to the banks and argue for finance to introduce this new capital, this new farming technology-and they're glad they did so. They're hoping to get a return on that capital. They're also employers. As farmers, they directly employ all of their staff. That's another reason why you should buy their strawberries. They are not alone when it comes to saying that too often this government is looking backwards, sticking on bandaids, only moving a few steps forward, being reactionary and not out there driving the innovation, the productivity and the investment in our agricultural industries. When it comes to exports, this government is failing. For all of its championing of the free trade agreement-oops, it forgot about the non-tariff barriers, which are killing our agricultural industries when it comes to exports. It doesn't matter whether it's wine, which is a big part of my world, or it's our horticultural produce or it's our red-meat exports, non-tariff barriers are blocking our ability to expand export markets and therefore expand farm gate prices. This government is also failing farmers and agricultural industries when it comes to climate change. Our farmers recognise that our climate is changing. You hear every day and you learn every day about the amazing innovative projects that our farmers are embracing in a whole range of areas to improve their productivity and water efficiency to adapt to climate change. Whether it be greater use of the NBN and mobile technology or it be improving their cropping and crop rotations, our farmers get that the climate is changing. They want to continue to be productive and profitable on the land, and so they want to see innovation, partnership, coordination and leadership from the government in this space. The reason why I mention climate change is that it is linked to drought. This is where we get to talk about how this government has spectacularly failed on drought mitigation and drought reform. Under Labor, there was an approach through COAG where we brought the states together to say that we need to start investing and delivering long-term drought policy. We said: 'Let's actually do the research. Let's actually look at what we are farming. How can we farm better? How can we droughtproof our industries going forward? How can we mitigate the effects of drought?' When this government came into office, it did a classic thing and abolished that entire approach. It has not been picked up since Labor was last in government. It is not being dealt with. In fact, the government has just shelved it. People in the government don't even believe in climate change, let alone believe in tackling the effects that climate change is having on drought. When it comes to the farm household assistance legislation before us, the government is, as with so many approaches that it takes, literally just tinkering at the edges. I remember when this legislation was first introduced. We used to have a rural financial counselling service in my electorate of Bendigo-before this government abolished it and sacked all of those people-and, shortly after this legislation was introduced, they came to me and said: 'We're meeting with farmers, and they're really frustrated because they're not meeting the criteria. The criteria are too rigid, and they're struggling to get the paperwork forms approved by  Centrelink in the period of time before they would have to start the paperwork all over again.' It took many of them almost 12 months to get access to the loans. All of us might remember how the minister at the time had to come in here and correct his answer, and then he corrected the Hansard, because of comments that he had made in relation to this. It is an issue where the government has really dropped the ball. Yes, I'm sure farmers will welcome an extra year when it comes to the farm household support; however, it's not enough. It's not a long-term solution. It's not an ongoing solution. It doesn't really work with people to resolve the broader problems and challenges that we're facing in horticulture, in agriculture and in our farming industries. The previous speaker and other members have spoken about concessional loans. I've never met a farmer yet who wants to take on more debt if they're drowning in debt. Most of them are saying, 'We've got to do better than this.' Farmers who are doing well, who innovate, might be willing to risk extra debt because they can see light at the end of the tunnel. But, if you're already drowning under a mountain of debt and if you've already got the banks coming after you, more debt is not what you're interested in. While we're talking about debt, we also need to remind the House about the disaster which is the government's newest creation: the Regional Investment Corporation, which we think will be in Bathurst; they don't quite have an office yet. Media reports are that they were meeting on a park bench to talk about their organisation starting. I'm not quite sure we want financial decisions from an investment corporation meeting in a park or on a park bench, particularly given that we have Rural Finance based in Victoria now managed by the Bendigo Bank, a sound financial institution that has been doing this kind of work for many years here in Australia. This is who the government wants to take work away from-the Bendigo Bank and Rural Finance-and give it to the Regional Investment Corporation, which at the moment doesn't have an office and which is meeting on a park bench. This is another example of just how hopeless this government is when it comes to the agricultural industry. Whether it be farm household assistance loans, whether it be in relation to financing, whether it be policy around labour hire, whether it be policy and implementation on the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, whether it be around innovation and embracing innovation in our farm industries or whether it be about abolishing or working to abolish non-tariff barriers or about climate change, this government is really failing to support Australian farmers in our agricultural industries. The amendment that has been moved by the member for Hunter allows people on this side to call the government out for its rhetoric. The government has to do more than just extend a welfare payment from three years to four years. Our farmers want to be innovative. They want to exist into the future. They need a government that will work with them and provide leadership, not just more tinkering at the edges.",142
185,Ms LEY,BILLS," I'm pleased to speak on the Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2018. In listening to speakers on both sides of the House, I cannot help but observe the political nature of this debate, even though there's broad acceptance that it's not a particularly political issue-it's not. Farmers who may be tuned into the proceedings-and I'm sure most of mine would not be-would probably be pretty scathing in their assessment of the way that many members of this place have approached this debate. If I consider a man in my electorate who was awarded at the recent Queen's Birthday honours, Brendan Farrell, he has physically and mentally exhausted himself, as have many of the people around him, in order  to transport hay from our region to western Queensland. He's very critical of politicians. He acknowledged that the government has recently increased some drought relief measures, but called for further assistance, mainly relating to hefty freight costs. Brendan heard about a farmer in the New South Wales town of Bourke struggling with drought, and that galvanised him into action. He has now completed more than 11 hay runs to help the drought-affected farmers across New South Wales and Queensland. He has noted that it's an emotional rollercoaster: 'One minute you're laughing, the next minute you're bawling your eyes out. You can be standing there with people and their kids, just talking about how much it will take to get better.' Brendan Farrell has been doing this for 4½ years, assisting struggling farmers around the country. He was driven by a desire to simply lend a hand. I'm sure he treats his Queen's Birthday honour with the larrikin disrespect that we would expect from an Australian of his stature. I want to bring something of his spirit and his attitude to this debate this evening because this is not a political issue and, unfortunately, so many people in this place treat drought and legislation as something that's-I won't say going wrong in our farming communities, because drought is part of a way of life and a farming way of life. They think there's something that must be done; it's all about what we do in here. Do we tinker around the edges, as the previous speaker said? Do we add more money, as we did during the millennium drought, in huge quantities that we no longer have? Do we put more personnel on the ground? Of course, we do many of these things, and so we should, particularly around mental health and support, but governments can't always make it better, and it's very important to recognise that. Certainly climate change is biting in rural Australia. Certainly it is in rural New South Wales and in my electorate of Farrer. I can remember people who talked about water flows in the Darling River, the Murray and the Murrumbidgee-I represent substantial parts of those three great river systems-reflecting on how much less water there is. When we talk about the environment and irrigators, we also have to factor climate change in. The extremes of temperature are more noticeable. If you talk to the old timers, you certainly get a long and pretty consistent narrative. I remember the late Peter Cullen, who was a hero in environmental water circles. I clashed with him on many occasions, being very much on the side of the irrigators. I remember him saying Australia has more than 40 years of wetter-than-average temperatures followed by 40 years of drier-than-average temperatures. Clearly that pattern is persisting, but within those broad blocks of years the extremes are getting greater. We are going to be confronted with drought and we are going to be confronted with the necessity to support our farmers. I'm very pleased that I believe this government has a strong and supportive drought assistance policy. We must work more closely with state governments, of course, because farmers don't notice the difference. The No. 1 thing they are calling for in my electorate is freight subsidies. I talked about Brendan Farrell and his hay runners, and that's what they do-they pick up hay and they transport it north from farmers who donate it. Members of the community donate the money to allow that to happen. Freight subsidies are vital because that's what you're doing-you're moving fodder to animals and keeping your breeding stock going because, if you lose your breeding stock, you lose a lot of heart. I've been a farmer myself for 17 years, through some of the worse droughts and the worse times on the land. There were some highs in there as well, although sometimes, looking back,  I find it harder and harder to find them. I remember reading a Time international article talking about the Australian drought, when it didn't often talk about Australia at all. There was a quote on the back page from somebody in rural Australia saying, 'You can't send a man out day after day to shoot his stock.' I cut that page out and pinned it on the wall of the office. I looked at it every day because the last thing I wanted was to go out and shoot stock. Eventually, with the price crash for sheep, that's exactly what happened, but it wasn't necessarily in the context of a drought. I represented western New South Wales during 10 years of the hardest drought we have ever seen, with dust storms and heartache. I can remember visiting properties where people had destocked. You would think that once you had destocked, you could then put everything in a holding pattern because you didn't have to worry about your stock dying and you didn't have to worry about transporting them away or transporting feed in. But, interestingly enough, what actually happened to farmers when they destocked and lost their stock was that they suddenly felt completely irrelevant; they'd lost the reason to get up in the morning. It had an extraordinarily negative affect. We had some amazing rural financial counsellors in my electorate during that time. I want to mention Brian Dodson, who was one of them. He's still well known. You're only supposed to deal with the finances, but he was there for every single member of a farming family. They didn't want to talk to someone they didn't know about personal problems-it gets very personal-so they talked to him. I'm sure he crossed the line a few times when it came to the engagement that he was supposed to have. But he was there when he was needed, because when you have to make the tough decisions-and we talk about the tough decisions-they are extraordinarily difficult to make. We, as a government, probably spent a billion dollars in interest rate subsidies for exceptional circumstances interest rate relief and household support during that drought. That was an extraordinary transfer of funds from taxpayers to farmers. If you look back on what happened to that money and where it went, an awful lot went to the banks. I would regularly challenge them with, 'What are you going to do about it, because you're getting your payments made where, in different circumstances, you would be writing them off?' A lot went to the banks. A lot went to farmers who subsequently didn't make it. The difficult thing with farming is that, when you're well set up and you've worked hard to give yourself a buffer, it's not just about hard work. A lot of it is luck. If you don't have a huge amount of debt and you're not a young farmer, then clearly you're going to be better prepared for a drought. A lot of it was: 'I've done all of the things that I'm supposed to do, and I don't qualify for any drought support because my partner works off-farm and I've got too many assets.' There was genuine annoyance from some of the farmers when they saw others who, in their view, might not have prepared so well or might not have run their properties so well, or whose farm programs were effectively getting quite a lot of government support. It did create divides in rural communities, and that was unfortunate. If our objective, as a government, is to sustain the rural sector, then there isn't any point in large transfers of funds to people who ultimately don't stay in the rural sector, whose properties get bought out. But there certainly is a point in supporting those families from a human perspective, making sure that they have time to adjust, to properly exit their properties and to do so with dignity and move on to another stage of their lives. Certainly, the drought  support did that. I would run into those individuals in the towns of Western New South Wales and North-Western Victoria quite regularly and realise that they'd left their farms behind. Sometimes they had been fourthor fifth-generation farmers, and they were fine. It always surprised me a little. I'm not saying that all of them were fine. There were two things that made them fine. One was that they actually had sold their properties for good money. No matter how tough it got, the value of land didn't go down-we don't expect that, and it's very difficult to see that that could happen in the current situation. They sold and they got paid a good sum of money, and the next thing they did actually validated their purpose in life-they had something to get up in the morning and do. Often it was working at an engineering shop or working for a rural services industry that supported farms, so their extraordinary knowledge about farming and the rural sector was put to really good use. It is the sort of knowledge that they used every day but never realised had a value. So there is always light at the end of the tunnel, but the task for government is to make sure that we put the supports in place. Whether that be rural financial counselling-we've expanded the service and we have good rural financial counsellors in my electorate. I just want to talk about the local situation. Griffith and Hay have had no rainfall this month and very little for the previous three months, so it is critical that the government assists farmers and rural communities during these times of hardship. The Farm Business Concessional Loans Scheme, the farm household allowance, the Managing Farm Risk Program, the Rural Financial Counselling Service and so on support the effects for farmers and managing-it might be pest animals; it might be weeds in drought-affected areas; and it might be financial preparedness. The farm household allowance, which is the subject of this bill, was launched in July 2014, and it has helped more than 7,900 people, which is pretty good. It's essentially an adjustment payment that comes with free financial counselling, through the Rural Financial Counselling Service, to help farmers restructure their businesses. The amendments that we are moving today include an extension from three to four years of the time that these services are available, which is a more appropriate time frame to assist farmers when they might need to transition to get back on their feet. It has been pretty scary for some of them. Many, I have to say, who have been the recipients of government support year after year after year have recently been told by their financial counsellors: 'Actually, that's it. There isn't anything left.' So this extra year is very valuable. I want to give a shout out to those rural financial counsellors: Darren Macartney at Hay, Graham Christie at Coleambally, Murray Freshwater at Deniliquin, Haidee Laycock, who looks after Griffith and Leeton, Linda MCLean at Hillston and Graeme Witte, who's the counsellor at Wentworth. You think of drought in Australia as being about the wide plains, with dust and no grass growing, and of course it is, but it's also about irrigation water, because, when a drought bites, the requirements for water for irrigated agriculture increase considerably, the reason being that you don't have any prewatering of your pasture. The other tension that enters the equation is that your water allocations-which next month, I suspect, will start off at zero-stay pretty low, so you really have to be concerned about your farm program. If you're an irrigated farmer, you've invested a lot more money, it's a much more intensive operation and you often need activity, which means you need to run a farm program.  With the drought in about 2003, I remember taking the then Prime Minister, John Howard, to Finley. No other Australian Prime Minister had visited Finley before or has done so since. He was incredibly impressed by the people who serviced the rural sector there and the fact that irrigation was different. What we then did was change the rules for the exceptional circumstances program to assist irrigators, recognising that the normal parameters of that program meant they didn't qualify-but they then did. We also added small businesses because John Howard met an incredible woman called Robyn Mott in an accounting service in Finley. She did so many things for the community for nothing, and she made an amazing sponge cake which I'm sure he's never forgotten. He came back and said to Sharman Stone, the then member for Murray, and me, 'We need to find a way to extend this to small businesses as well.' I use those examples because I know that the government now stands ready to do exactly those things-or not exactly those things but to act in a similar way: to watch closely to see how bad this drought gets. It's creeping from northern New South Wales down into my electorate. You don't say things are bad or worse; it hasn't gone on as long as what we saw in 2003. But, if it does, I know that this government and this parliament will stand ready to assist and take the necessary next steps. Coming back to Brendan Farrell and his hay runners, he does it without government-he doesn't particularly like politicians-and he does it with the community. The community is always ready to help. So wherever you are in Australia, if you can help and there's an opportunity for you to do that, I encourage you to. I know that so many will step up and support our rural sector. Dr MIKE KELLY (Eden-Monaro) (18:57): I would like to acknowledge the contributions from the member for Mallee and the member for Farrer in this debate on the Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2018. There were a lot of important ideas and also observations from their experiences. I think all of us in this chamber who represent farming communities and communities that have lived through these intense drought experiences that we've been seeing multiply and amplify in recent years would really identify with and feel an emotional attachment with a lot of the issues that have been raised and discussed. But I would say that I am disappointed. I am particularly disappointed in the leadership of the Nationals in these last five years. As soon as a drought passes, it's almost like, 'Rightio, that's over and done with-no need to worry about proper planning for the future anymore.' It takes me back to the old Army golden rule that you always hope for the best but you plan and prepare for the worse. I don't think any sentient human being now can deny the threat that is being presented to our rural and regional communities by climate change. These circumstances of drought are definitely intensifying, deepening and becoming more variable, with fewer predictable situations. I've often said my region of Eden-Monaro is like the canary in the coalmine in many ways. If you look at, for example, our ski industry in the high country and you go and talk to the Snowy Hydro people, you will see their data is unequivocally showing that the ski seasons are crimping in at both ends, and the snow levels are going higher. We are at risk of losing a $2 billion industry that's half the economy of the Monaro. On top of that, our farmers-including the fruit growers over in the Batlow area, the famous Batlow apple growers-really depend on a very predictable weather pattern situation. That has been  completely distorted and difficult to do in recent years, and of course the drought affected the high country. It's affecting it right now and putting our farmers in the high country under severe stress. On the coast we have this increasing risk of salination and the like and also changes in rain patterns. So there's been a lot of intense distress. I'm pleased to say that at least, out of that last big millennial drought, the farmers in the high country formed Monaro Farming Systems and for the first time aggregated. That enabled them to look after each other a bit better and swap more ideas. But, most particularly, it allowed them to work more closely with the CSIRO, who helped develop a modelling tool, called GrassGro, to give them the ability to plan ahead for their properties over a 50-year cycle. It enabled them to do their paddock and beast management and it gave them something to latch onto, which was really important for their mental health. But what disturbs me is that, when we were in government, we were right on the trailing edges of that millennium drought-2008 and 2009 were particularly bad final years-and we did look at the exceptional circumstances regime. I think everybody would accept that it wasn't satisfactory. In my region, I had some people who were on one side of the boundary of the exceptional circumstances regime experiencing the same weather situation as the people over the other side of the harsh line drawn on the map but not getting exceptional circumstances relief. Again, I had a lot of farmers complaining to me that exceptional circumstances didn't distinguish between successful farmers-good farmers-and farmers who were in trouble not because of drought but because they weren't particularly good farmers. The farmers were raising these issues with me. As a consequence, we sent this issue to the Productivity Commission, which I think was a good way to look at it. We wanted to really get down to the nitty-gritty of how we were going to handle these droughts at the same time as we were addressing climate change policy. The review that was done by the Productivity Commission also led us to form the intergovernmental agreement using the COAG process, trying to address these issues on a national level, because we couldn't accept the patchiness of the state-by-state approach for a national issue. That led us to form the Standing Committee for Primary Industries and Resources and the Standing Council on Primary Industries-very important mechanisms that were working their way forward. They of course produced the review, which included the Intergovernmental Agreement on the National Drought Program Reform. It made some particularly important findings and comments, including an economic assessment of drought support measures and an assessment of social impacts of drought on farm families and rural communities, using an expert panel and a climatic assessment by the Bureau of Meteorology, and it conducted pilot studies. There was a focus on the relief that's needed and the mechanisms-and we're talking here about the farm household support arrangements as part of what they were reviewing-but more particularly they were looking at the key objectives: … assist farm families and primary producers adapt to and prepare for the impacts of increased climate variabilityand… encourage farm families and primary producers to adopt self-reliant approaches to manage their business risks  This is really the key. Most farmers and farming families will tell you that they want to find ways to deal with the challenges they're facing that don't involve just a draw on the taxpayer to get them through these situations; they want to get ahead of the curve. Added to the situation of trashing those arrangements that we put in place through COAG, which pointed the way of having to develop policy to address that longer-term issue and the management issue of these farms, we've seen more recently, in these last five years, the damage that's been done to the APVMA by the decentralisation policy. We've lost 30 per cent of the scientists in of that organisation. Evidence that we've heard says that the organisation has been set back seven years, and really it's the APVMA that helps design research and implement science into the management of these changed circumstances-how we can deal with managing the different types of pest situations that come from drought conditions. As an example of that, further down in the high country in my region we had a plague of wingless grasshoppers, and the science told us that was largely caused by the dieback situation. The parasitic nematodes that used to keep the numbers of the wingless grasshoppers down were not there because of the loss of forestation in our region, and it led to the plague of wingless grasshoppers that completely devastated farming land in that area. All of these are things that the APVMA helps with, and what we've done is cripple it through this decentralisation process. Also, of course, we saw other issues like getting rid of the inspector-general in relation to live exports. We know that is a really serious issue; it's put us back to square one and we're facing revisiting these issues with live exports. Every time we have one of these incidents and those videos, meat consumption goes down. The butchers tell me they can't sell the meat anymore. So there are a whole range of flow-on effects from not getting to grips with these issues, and getting rid of the inspector-general mechanism was a really retrograde step. On top of that, we saw the issues that emerged around the Murray-Darling Basin Authority. It seems that those growers and the allegations of mishandling and corruption et cetera in the northern edges of the Murray-Darling Basin were more of a priority than those farmers who were living downstream-the farmers all the way through southern New South Wales and South Australia. It didn't seem to matter what was happening to them, whereas, when we were in government, we put a lot of effort into water efficiency measures as a long-term solution to some of these issues. That included the need for farmers to pick up new techniques in irrigation-lining irrigation channels and covering them using pipes et cetera. We heard the member for Mallee talk about that as a step forward in his area. With the issue of drip irrigation, I was in the border portfolio with Senator Wong and we travelled all over the Murray-Darling Basin. I remember visiting an almond grower who had a perfect situation for drip irrigation with permanent plantings, and he said he didn't trust those lines, because he was worried about them getting clogged. Well, Israel-and the rest of the world that has faced these kinds of arid, water management situations-has been very productive and very efficient and has shown good results from adopting those types of techniques. Along with what we invested in government in water efficiency measures, there were also a lot of other benefits. We have to make sure that farmers can diversify and insulate themselves against these conditions but also adopt better methods to get through drier times and keep their soils healthy. One of the measures that assisted them that we introduced was the Carbon Farming Initiative. That allowed farmers to get involved with methodologies that  would help sequester carbon while at the same time introduce better health to their soils by getting carbon back into their soils. There was a lot of opportunity for them to diversify their income through adopting measures under the Carbon Farming Initiative. One of the things that I was looking at in particular was getting our farmers to aggregate in, perhaps, a forestry co-op where they could have portions of their properties dedicated to re-forestation and have a broker who could organise the whole arrangement of the methodology and approval and give them another stream of income on their property. There were so many possibilities in that Carbon Farming Initiative and in sequestration. Now we are seeing good, smart farmers like Charles Massy, a farmer near Cooma in my electorate, who has a PhD and is a very progressive and innovative farmer. We had a great meeting in Yass just a few weeks ago. A lot of farmers from the region turned up to hear about his regenerative farming techniques. We've heard a bit before about natural sequence farming. There's been a bit of controversy about that, but some of it is quite sound in terms of how we rehydrate the soil or maintain or slow down water through the landscape. But, certainly, what Charles Massy has been doing through his regenerative farming techniques is very important. It's about government really getting behind the science, the experience and the knowledge and arming farmers with the ability to survive, to prosper and to be able to conduct and plan models for their properties over a long period of time. One of the things that I mentioned last night was the no-till and stubble management approach. All of these things could be included and passed on. I'm fortunate that my family, who have all been dairy farmers for 170 years now down in the Bega Valley, are part of an aggregated farming group in the Bega Cheese co-op, which is now no longer a co-op but still operates like it is. Through that, they formed the Bega environmental management system. They were able to apply Commonwealth funding to develop and improve the management of their environment and to restore health to the soil as well. It also enabled those farmers to communicate with each other and pass on science and ideas. Bega Cheese also helps make sure that that happens through the benefits of its commercial operation and spreading that benefit to farmers. We saw this so-called listening tour happen just recently, and it didn't go down too well. Obviously they were coming to talk to farmers about issues like farm household support. I welcome the fact that it's been extended by a year, but that still doesn't deliver certainty to these farmers. It seemed from the reports that came back that farmers were singularly unimpressed by what was going on. People like Harry and Jack, who greeted the travelling circus, and John and Joy Haycock at Trangie, for example, were very unimpressed by the visit. I talked about this idea of hoping for the best but planning for the worse. We've seen the reverse of that in some of the approaches taken by this travelling circus. Mr Haycock said he couldn't understand why that leadership group was there if they didn't have anything to announce. He said: On Sunday night we had hope, now we know they're going to do nothing, when you take hope away people get desperate, they'd have been better off not coming. …… … I've voted Nationals all my life at state level, never again. I think that's one of the reasons why, when I was standing at the Gundagai booth at the Cootamundra by-election, there was a 43 per cent swing away. It was 43 per cent. You can  see the erosion. If the Nationals are going to ignore what's going on out there, they will get more of what happened in Orange and more situations like Tumbarumba. Tumbarumba absolutely went red-hot in support of me in the last campaign because of this issue. The Nationals are ignoring what their farmers are saying. In the last big survey of farmers-1,300 farmers in a Farmer Climate Survey-nine in 10 farmers surveyed said they were concerned about damage to the climate and about climate change and 88 per cent of them said they wanted their politicians to do more about it. They really are upset about this. There'll be some argument about what causes climate change and all those sorts of issues, but this is the result of a farmer survey-88 per cent say their politicians should be doing more. They accept that there is climate change and that there should be something done about it.",145
186,Mr COULTON,BILLS," I rise to speak on the Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2018. As the member for Eden-Monaro leaves, I'll say his was quite a thoughtful response until the last three minutes. It's a shame he wrecked it. This bill is in response to the tour that the Prime Minister, the agriculture minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, the local government minister, the regional telecommunications minister, the regional health minister and I had through western New South Wales and Queensland a couple of weeks ago. The sad reality is that this drought is really biting. In some places, people have used the household support for the three years that was part of the original requirement for this. This extension will certainly help those people out. This farm household support is more than just the financial support that helps pay those vital bills, that puts food on the table, that puts tyres on the family car, that pays for the phone and the like. With this support comes assistance from the Rural Financial Counselling Service to help those farms that are in that difficult circumstance come up with a management plan post-drought, whatever that may be, whether it's exiting the industry or restructuring their finances to enable them to continue on. The reports that I'm getting back from the people who have been on this household support-and I think it's now about 7,000 around Australiahave been quite positive. So this extension is a good thing; it is unfortunate that we've got a drought of this magnitude where we needed to do this. It is interesting that the member for Hunter has some ridiculous amendment attached to this very important piece of legislation. It was his party in government that removed the word 'drought' from the language of government. They were so obsessed with their discussions around climate change and emissions-trading schemes that they changed the word 'drought' to 'dryness' and said, 'This is how Australia's going to be for now and evermore; we just need to get used to it.' I want to comment on some of the policies that the government has that are really helping people to get through this drought. I understand that many people are in serious financial difficulties, but many aren't-because of the policies that were in the white paper. I'll go through them, and I'll start with the farm management deposits, now $800,000 per farm partner to be put away: they're very useful in helping with the vagaries of the climate. To use the Walgett region as an example: they've had one good year out of four. That good year was a very good year in a cropping region, with very high income for that year through the farm management deposits. They were able to even that income out to help them through the difficult times that they're having at the moment. Another one is the accelerated depreciation  for grain storages-hay sheds and silos. That has been very, very popular throughout my electorate, and as I'm driving around I see many new silo complexes and hay sheds where farmers have taken that tax advantage and invested, managing to prepare themselves for the dry times. The other one is the accelerated depreciation for water and fencing. Particularly in the grazing areas, more in the west of my electorate, those water schemes have enabled a better use of pasture, and farmers have managed to retain their pasture longer into this drought because they've had the water points in more strategic places, rather than central watering points through large dams and whatnot. Another policy that has been of benefit in some areas is the money that has gone into cluster fencing. Late last year, I was at the opening of a 220kilometre long fence at Gilgunyah, north-west of Condobolin. There are, I think, 10 properties inside the fence that have now been able to manage a lot of the pest animals that were really impacting on their pasture management and also on their animal health, with wild dogs and pigs having an effect on lambing percentages and the like. These are good, practical measures that we have put into place. The previous speaker, the member for Eden-Monaro, was talking about the innovation and the good work that farmers are doing, and that's true. When we get into a dry period like this, one of the disappointments is that it looks like farmers are not managing their situation, whereas the clear majority of them are. With the farming techniques that are being used, farmers are growing crops in a climate that their parents and grandparents would not have been able to grow in. The work that's being done with zero-till, and the advances in machinery with disc planters and GPS control-all of those things have enabled farmers to deal with the drier seasonal conditions. As I said, many of the farmers in my area are managing through this. There were some comments in the previous speeches about the Prime Minister's visit to my electorate in particular. I really think those negative comments don't relate to what I saw on the ground. The farmers were very pleased to see their Prime Minister and a large number of cabinet ministers there. If the Prime Minister had come to my electorate and made an announcement without consulting with anyone, the justifiable criticism would have been: 'Noone came and asked what we wanted. We're getting governed from Canberra.' In the Prime Minister's defence, in my 10 years-and we've had a variety of prime ministers over that period of time. I've never seen a Prime Minister put three days in regional Australia, listening to farmers, not being distracted, taking notes and being completely focused on the serious issue at hand.",153
187,Mr Dick,BILLS,What did Tony Abbott do?,154
188,Mr COULTON,BILLS,"I say what I said-in 10 years I've never seen a Prime Minister do that. I've had other prime ministers from both sides of the House visit my electorate, but not one that was so focused on the issue at hand. That was very well received. I think that we will look at other issues apart from the farm household support. I think the work around mental health is good. That sometimes is just creating activities as a distraction to get off the farm. I remember the 1990s, when we were going through a particularly dry time. I come to this place with some experience as a farmer dealing with drought. I was a farmer for 33 years before I came here, so I've got some idea what I'm talking about. I remember that in the 1990s in a particularly severe drought a group of my colleagues  undertook a beef management course. That was as much about getting together once a week, having a chat and having a few beers afterwards. It was about meeting with each other and talking through our issues and how we were dealing with things. Quite often these mental health programs in the bush are just a way for people to get together as a group and have a yarn. In Warialda a group of men are now doing yoga, believe it or not. Some of my friends would be horrified that I'm letting their secret out. They probably undo at the pub afterwards all the good they do at yoga in becoming more flexible, but it is an outlet for them to get together and work through the issues, because it is a very stressful time. I do support this important bill. I treat the addition from the member for Hunter with the contempt that it deserves. This is sensible legislation that's needed. I think there's probably more to come as we work our way through this drought. I think there's more work we can do in the fencing space. Those things will keep people busy and improve the management possibilities in those areas. I commend this bill to the House.",154
189,Mr GEE,BILLS," I rise to support the Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2018. Our farmers make an extraordinary contribution to our national economy and prosperity. In fact, agriculture has been the stand-out sector for the Australian economy in recent times. Our farmers don't have the tariff protections or subsidies that farmers in other countries enjoy. They deal with comparatively high power prices and labour prices, sometimes a high Australian dollar and sometimes low commodity prices. They are extraordinarily resilient, but they are not indestructible. That's why we have to support them through this latest trial-drought. The drought is certainly biting very hard in central western New South Wales. The paddocks in many areas have turned to dust. It's so bad that parts of the Calare electorate look like a moonscape. The ground is so parched and dry that sometimes it seems like it's literally crying out. Feed is scarce, increasingly expensive and also increasingly expensive to transport to the properties in need, if you can find it. We can't take our farmers for granted. If we want them here, creating wealth for our nation, we need to be supporting them at the time when they need it most. There are heart breaking stories in country Australia at the moment. I've heard them as I've met with farmers around the region, from Lithgow to Mudgee, Gulgong, Oberon, Bathurst, Orange, Cumnock, Yeoval and Wellington. The stories are real and they're stories of Australians, our fellow Australians, battling to get through. It's not just the drudgery of feeding every day and checking troughs and dams; there is an immense toll from the uncertainty with respect to what will happen. What's going to happen in the future? What will happen to breeding stock? How will they be fed? The financial uncertainty weighs heavily, as does the uncertainty as to how it will be possible to rebuild once the drought passes. All over central western New South Wales, as in other parts of Australia, communities are coming together to support each other, but they need a hand. Good intentions are one thing, but our farmers need support on the ground. The outlook, I have to say, is very worrying. If good rain doesn't come, a very bad and grim situation is going to get a whole lot worse in the very near future. The worsening outlook is why we need to be ramping up drought support as the season worsens and the conditions deteriorate. That's why I was very pleased to see the farm household allowance extended. The announcement followed the Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources' visit to the central west, where we met with local farmers. It also  followed the Prime Minister's tour with the minister to drought-affected areas. In fact, when the minister visited the central west, we stood in a paddock where a crop we were looking at had achieved only a 30 per cent germination rate, and that was one of the good paddocks in the region. The farm household allowance is an important drought assistance measure which aims at putting food on the table and diesel in the ute when farmers simply don't have enough money for the necessities. It was launched in 2004, and since then almost 8,000 people have been assisted, at a cost of $230 million. In terms of the amount of the assistance itself, you're looking at around $530 to $580 per fortnight for singles and just under $1,000 per fortnight for couples. It helps get farmers through, and it comes with counselling as well, so it is an important assistance measure. It provides the recipients with the opportunity to take steps to improve their circumstances and self-reliance through a farm financial assessment, financial improvement agreement and additional activity supplements of up to $4,000. The program is uncapped and demand driven, so no-one who is eligible will miss out. The fact that it's been extended from three to four years is, I think, a really important move, and it will be widely welcomed in farming communities across the nation. It is important to note that farmers should not self-assess when thinking about the farm household allowance and how they can apply for it. There are many stories of farmers selfassessing, only to discover later that they are in fact eligible. So I would encourage any farmers out there to reach out to the Department of Human Services via their hotline-I will give it now; it is 1800686175 or 132316-to find out how they can get more assistance. The federal government is also supporting farmers through the Rural Financial Counselling Service. This is a very important service, and $70 million has been allocated to it from 2016 to 2020 and, indeed, a further $20 million funding boost has just been announced. It helps around 4,500 people every year and it has about 3,000 clients at any given time, with about 130 counsellors around Australia. As I've said, this drought is taking a financial toll, but it is also taking a huge emotional toll. To many farmers with such a grim outlook, it just seems like things are never going to get better. The Rural Financial Counselling Service is there to help, and it does a great job. Debate interrupted. NA",155
190,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT," It being 7.30 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Asylum Seekers",156
191,Mr WATTS,ADJOURNMENT," Earlier this month I visited the Kakuma UNHCR refugee camp near the border of Kenya and South Sudan. It's a part of the modern international refugee challenge that is little discussed in the Australian political debate. Kakuma is 30 years old, and around 185,000 refugees are currently seeking temporary refuge in this camp. Many residents of Melbourne's west have called it home on their journey to humanitarian resettlement in Australia. Most spent around a decade in this camp before coming to our country. Australian aid and refugee resettlement policies have had a lifechanging impact on thousands of people who have been forced to seek refuge at Kakuma. Kakuma exists only because of the goodwill of the Kenyan government and the support of the  international community for the UN and non-government organisations operating in the camp. I saw first hand the role that Australian aid plays in helping both UNHCR and the World Food Programme support refugees living in this camp while they wait for a durable solution that will let them restart their lives. It's literally a life-saving investment. I also took the opportunity while I was there to make a delivery of a football kit with boots, keeping gloves, balls and jerseys from Barefoot to Boots, an Aussie NGO founded by two Australian brothers and former South Sudanese refugees-professional footballer Awer Mabil and 'Lost Boy' Awer Bul-and supported by Australian businessman Ian Smith. The mission of Barefoot to Boots is to provide the resources necessary to make refugee camps like Kakuma more sustainable, stimulating and accommodating for their residents. The soccer kit, donated by Altona City Soccer Club and Sunshine Heights Soccer Club and Their Beautiful Game-from my electorate-was the latest addition to more than 2,000 kilograms of football equipment delivered by Barefoot to Boots to refugees around the world. I was thrilled to see the Altona City Soccer Club kit worn by FC Talanta in the Kakuma Divas women's league opening round match last week. In addition to the sporting equipment, Barefoot to Boots also provides educational materials, medical supplies and sanitary products, as well as art and musical equipment, to the camps. I saw first hand how Barefoot's delivery of ultrasound and incubator equipment to the medical facility at Kakuma, which delivers 400 babies a month, has been a literal lifesaver. Kakuma-and the work of groups like the UNHCR, WFP and Barefoot to Bootshighlights the nature of the international refugee situation today. Last week the UNHCR marked Refugee Week by releasing its annual Global trends report. This report found that the number of displaced people around the world exceeded 68 million in 2017 and that refugees who had fled their countries to escape conflict and persecution now numbered 25.4 milliona 2.9 million person increase on the number of refugees in 2016, the biggest single-year increase UNHCR has seen. UNHCR highlighted that 85 per cent of refugees live in developing countries, and four out of five refugees live in countries adjoining their own-that is, living in places like Kakuma. The UNHCR also used the release of its Global trends report to reiterate its call for a new global compact on refugees. The areas of focus for this global compact tell the story of the modern refugee situation. The compact's four objectives are to (1) ease the pressures on host countries, (2) enhance refugee self-reliance, (3) expand access to third-country solutions and (4) support conditions in countries of origin for return in safety and dignity. These objectives are designed to enable the international community to respond to large movements of refugees and protracted refugee situations. They are also objectives that Australia can play a leadership role in achieving. Australian aid plays a key role in easing pressure on host countries by supporting the provision of essential services to refugees in these camps: food, shelter, sanitation, health care and-crucially for prolonged situations-education. This topic was directly raised with me by Kenyan members of parliament in meetings during my visit. Australian aid and diplomacy can also play an important role in resolving conflict and stabilising regions to enable the safe return of refugees to their homes. Finally, our humanitarian resettlement program is critical, too, for delivering on these objectives, particularly in light of the 40 per cent fall in the number of refugees resettled in  2017-a record increase in the number of refugees but a 40 per cent fall in the number resettled. New pathways like resettlement and like community or private sponsorship of refugees should play an important role in rising to this challenge. The Australian debate on asylum seekers and refugees is passionate and involves many people of goodwill but is also too narrow- (Time expired) Taxation",156
192,Mr EVANS,ADJOURNMENT," Earlier today I had a meeting with the Treasurer, and we discussed the personal income tax relief this government has just delivered for hard working Australians. We talked about what the tax relief really means in practice for people in Brisbane and how the tax relief is being rolled out year to year over the course of the government's plan. It's fair to say that I'm proud to be part of the government that's delivering this tax relief. We delivered it last year, firstly, for the 30,000 small and medium businesses that are the very base and the foundation of our local economy in Brisbane. Our local Brisbane economy is built by the upcoming professional firms, the award-winning microbreweries, the coffee roasters, the technology developers, the small start-ups and just everyday working family businesses. Now, we're delivering tax relief for the individuals and families around Brisbane who are working hard to realise their dreams. I told the Treasurer that 75,000 people in my electorate of Brisbane will benefit from the tax relief, some as early as 1 July-next week. The Treasurer and I talked about how this tax relief is going, first and foremost, to help to relieve the household budget pressures being faced by middleand lower income earners. The tax offset that lowand medium-income earners in Brisbane will receive will be up to $530 per year from 2018-19, and that means up to $1,060 for a family where both members of the couple are working. So step one of our Personal Income Tax Plan ensures that these lower and middle-income earners, these hard working Australians who deserve it most, get relief in their household budgets. Step two of government's plan reduces bracket creep. We believe that Australians should not face these disincentives from higher tax rates just for taking on an extra shift or pushing for a very well deserved pay rise, or even just through inflation pushing them into higher and higher tax brackets over time. Under the government's plan, the $87,000 tax threshold will go to $90,000 from next year and then eventually to $120,000 in 2022-23. Then, from 1 July 2022, we'll increase the low-income tax offset to $645. That will prevent about half a million Australians across the nation from paying tax at the 32.5 per cent marginal tax rate in 202223. This means that, for instance, Brisbane nurses and paramedics can take those extra shifts without fear of facing higher tax rates. Step three of the plan then removes the 37 per cent tax bracket entirely, commencing in 2024-25. At that point, the government's plan all comes together and the value of the reform is fully realised, because it's at that point that the tax system will be simpler for the vast bulk of workers. About 94 per cent of them, all up-so more than nine in 10 workers-will pay no more than 32.5 cents in every extra dollar they earn. Tradies and teachers in Brisbane, for example, will thereafter not have to worry about facing higher tax rates for taking on an additional shift or seeking that well-deserved pay rise. In closing, I want to say one thing about Australian fairness under this three-step plan being delivered by the government. By the end of this plan, every taxpayer around Australia will be paying less tax-all of them. At the same time, the highest income earners-that's the  top six per cent of Australians who are in that highest tax bracket over $200,000-will be paying 36 per cent of the total tax collected. So six per cent of the population will be paying 36 per cent of the total tax take. That 36 per cent is a higher proportion than the top tax-rate payers presently pay. That's what fairness in Australia looks like. No-one should buy into any class war that those on the other side are trying to whip up. The bottom line is that under Labor you will always pay more tax. Those opposite, sadly, will always spend more and tax more. At this point in time they are promising $200 billion in additional taxes-and who knows how high the number will go-presumably because they think they know how to spend your money better than you do. As I said to the Treasurer, the income earned by the workers of Brisbane is their money. They earned it through their hard work. This is about empowering people to aspire, to work hard and to have every possible opportunity to realise their dreams. Live Animal Exports Djap Wurrung Earthworker Cooperative Project Petition: Ethical Labelling",158
193,Mr BANDT,ADJOURNMENT," Australians have been shocked by the latest images of unimaginable suffering on Australia's live export ships. We have seen thousands of animals packed together condemned to suffer on an industrial scale. They are forced to live in mounting urine and faeces, they get trampled and it is so hot that the animals are literally cooked alive. Thousands die on every voyage in the worse conditions you could think of-and this is considered normal and acceptable! I defy anyone here to look at the images of those animals and say that this suffering is okay. It is not; it is unacceptable, and a big majority of Australians agree. It is beyond time that we end this cruelty. It is over five years since I first introduced a private member's bill into this place to ban live exports. But, because coalition and, in the past, Labor MPs have sided with a handful of vested interests, animals are still condemned to outrageous suffering. It is not good enough. The Greens will keep fighting this. We are working with animal groups and the meatworkers' union to end live exports and deliver a win-win alternative for regional communities that ends this cruelty. My office is inundated with calls from constituents who want an end to this obscene cruelty. To everyone who has contacted me over the years: thank you for your action. I will keep fighting until the day when not one more animal is condemned to these voyages of misery. Traditional owners and their supporters are gathered on Djap Wurrung country to protest the Victorian Labor government's planned destruction of over 250 sacred red gum trees near Ararat for a 12-kilometre road-widening project. They include an 800-year-old Djap Wurrung women's birthing tree which has stood for the birth of 56 generations. It is 2018 and it is not good enough for government to be proposing the destruction of sacred sites. The community won't stand for it. Nor will the community stand for the destruction of endangered species and habitats in these tracts of box gum woodlands just to widen this road. Protesters gathered outside the office of the Victorian Labor government's planning minister, Richard Wynne, last week to demand that the bulldozers be stopped. Greens candidate Kathleen Maltzahn  addressed this protest, and I support their demand. Labor needs to go back to the drawing board and stop this cultural and environmental vandalism. I would like to acknowledge in the parliament the success of the Earthworker Cooperative in the Latrobe Valley. Tackling climate change means that we have to get off coal and make the transition to renewable energy. But we can't leave it up to the big coal companies to decide when coal plants will close, as has happened in the Latrobe Valley and elsewhere. We need a plan for a transition that is just, that leaves no workers and no communities behind and that ensures that, the next time a coal-fired power station switches off, there are sustainable jobs for people to move into. Earthworker is pointing one pathway forward. They start from the premise that social and environmental exploitation are intertwined and that the problems of climate change, job insecurity and growing inequality must be tackled simultaneously. Earthworker uses a cooperative model to build grassroots economic ownership and jobs. It is creating Australia's first worker owned factory making renewable energy appliances and components. Their co-op factory in Morwell is up and running and will soon be producing solar hot water systems. To everyone involved in Earthworker: congratulations. Government should be getting behind initiatives like this one as part of supporting communities through a just transition to renewables. I would like to present in parliament a petition delivered to me by my constituents to tackle exploitation in global fashion supply chains. The petition is in the proper form and it has been approved by the Petitions Committee. The petition calls for the introduction of compulsory labelling on all fashion articles so that Australians know whether the clothes they are buying are produced ethically. As stated in the petition, 170 million children in the poorest countries are exploited in child labour, heavily within the fashion and textile industries. Nine out of 10 companies supplying clothes to Australian consumers fail to pay workers enough to meet their basic needs. The complexity and global nature of the fashion supply chain results in child labour conditions remaining invisible to both brands and consumers. This petition calls for compulsory and standardised labelling of all fashion articles sold in Australia, in terms of ethical and sustainable production, manufacture, finishing and associated child labour. Before I came to this place, I spent my working life standing up against companies who were failing to comply with the minimum conditions to stop the exploitation of outworkers. It's time we took this international so that every product sold in Australia is produced ethically. The petition read as followsThis Petition of Certain citizens of Australia To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives draws to the attention of the House: 9 out of 10 companies supplying clothes to Australian consumers fail to pay workers enough to meet their basic needs. They also fail to monitor their supply chains. With 170 million children in the poorest countries in the world victim to Child Labour (as defined by the United Nations), the burden of this lays heavily within the fashion and textile industries. The complexity and global nature of the fashion supply chain results in child labour conditions remaining invisible to both brands and consumers. Australians have a right to know whether or not they are purchasing items that kill or harm people, animals and the planet. Compulsory, standardised labelling is required to clearly identify to consumers the level of harm associated with their purchase. We ask that the house develop and implement industry-wide labelling of ALL fashion articles sold in this country. Non-Australian made fashion articles will not be allowed to be imported into Australia  unless they have been rated and labelled in terms of associated ethical and sustainable production, manufacture, finishing and associated child labour. We therefore ask the House to develop a standardised rating system, an auditing and certification process and a recognisable consumer iconography. We ask the House to legislate the above, and present this as an international case study to the World Customs Organisation (WCO) for implementation around the globe. from 129 citizens (Petition No. EN0377) Petition received. Marine Conservation",159
194,Mr FALINSKI,ADJOURNMENT," Let's make our reef great again. As a child, I grew up watching the yachts in Pittwater, the rock fishermen at Long Reef, surfers and swimmers braving the elements for an early morning dip, and the surf lifesavers that protect our beaches. These are some of my fondest memories from my childhood. For my constituents, this is just everyday life, a life intertwined with the ocean. Since I've taken office, protection of the marine environment has been raised over and over again. To my constituents I say: I've listened and I have heard. Our marine environment is precious and should be protected by every level of government. Sharnie Connell, a constituent in MCKellar, is part of the Australian Marine Conservation Society. I have met with her numerous times to discuss the importance of our unique marine environment. As well as discussing the Northern Beaches and Pittwater marine systems and the Great Barrier Reef, she and I both agree on the importance of establishing a Sydney Harbour marine park. We are an island nation with over 10 million square kilometres of ocean. We have the third largest marine jurisdiction in the world. Successive Commonwealth governments have worked to establish 60 marine parks in Commonwealth waters alone, representing over 35 per cent of our oceans, the second largest area of marine reserves behind the United States. The science behind these marine parks is unequivocal. We know they can increase the abundance and diversity of organisms and protect threatened and vulnerable species. They allow ecosystems to recover from past natural and human impacts, while protecting these areas into the future. The Great Barrier Reef is the crowning jewel in the Commonwealth's network of marine parks, contributing an estimated $6.4 billion to our economy and supporting 64,000 jobs. The protection of the Great Barrier Reef from threats, including crown-of-thorns starfish, increasing sea temperatures and acidity, and water quality issues, is one of the Turnbull government's highest priorities. Faced with these significant challenges, the Turnbull government is investing record funding to research and implement innovative solutions that work to improve the resilience of the reef to these threats. The investment builds on our Reef 2050 Long-Term Sustainability Plan, which has been endorsed by the World Heritage Committee and guides our work with the community, scientists, industry and other stakeholders to boost the reef's resilience. As a result of these decisive actions, the World Heritage Committee has removed the reef from the 'in danger' watch list and praised Australia as a global leader in reef management. This investment is designed to spark new and innovative investment in reef protection, delivering on projects which are proven to boost the health of the reef, improve water quality, tackle the crown-of-thorns starfish and work with traditional owners. The Great Barrier Reef is one of the largest reef systems in the world, and  it is vital that we do what we can to protect it and ensure it remains viable for future generations. Our marine environments are a precious gift, passed to us by previous generations and loved and enjoyed by millions every day, and therefore they should be safeguarded long into the future. I want to work with all levels of government to ensure these irreplaceable jewels can be preserved for all future generations to enjoy. In July last year, over 200 people in my electorate gathered at Palm Beach to recognise the importance of protecting our marine ecosystems. Joined by my state colleague, the Hon. Rob Stokes MP, my constituents were affirming the value of these environments and the lifestyle they enjoy every single day of their lives. Coalition governments have a rich tradition as true conservationists because we understand the value of past legacies and intergenerational responsibility. We believe that protecting what is good and great about our country, culture and way of life requires us to make significant investments to safeguard our future. This record investment by the Turnbull government delivers on this commitment to protect this national treasure. Racial Discrimination Act 1975",161
195,Mr DREYFUS,ADJOURNMENT," Sometimes politics is full of surprises, but at other times it is sadly predictable. So when I heard Senator Amanda Stoker say yesterday during a television interview, '18C has got to go,' I was exasperated but I was not surprised. It's almost as if the Liberal Party is governed by some kind of universal law: if they talk long enough, eventually one of them must bring up the destruction of section 18C. But I do not speak in jest. The importance of section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act in our multicultural society cannot and must not be underestimated. In case the House needs reminding, section 18C outlaws offending, insulting, humiliating or intimidating someone on the basis of their race. It is the strongest legislated protection that vulnerable minorities in this country have against racial hate speech. Over and over through the nearly four years I have defended this part of our law, I've been told by people around this country how important it is to themhow it helps them feel protected and at home in this country. I doubt that any of the Liberal MPs and senators who continue this ideological obsession with destroying section 18C have ever bothered to have these same conversations with the people who are protected by it. I believe that if they did, they would drop their vendetta immediately. As I mentioned before, I've been shadow Attorney-General for nearly five years, and four of those have been spent defending 18C from Liberal Party attacks. It's something I'm proud to do, but it should not be necessary. We've now had two serious attempts by this government to destroy section 18C. The first was in 2014 under the Abbott government and led by former Senator Brandis, who infamously declared that people have the right to be bigots. This attempt was met with a groundswell of opposition from civil society groups across the country, with marches, protests and letter campaigns that eventually convinced the government to back down. Any normal government would have been humiliated by this experience, but three years later, unbelievably, the government tried again, this time under a Prime Minister who everyone expected to be better: Mr Turnbull. Last year's battle once again exposed the party's  nasty, ideological obsession with section 18C and, once again, they failed in their vendetta. People who stood up in 2014 stood up again and they won again. Now, here we stand in 2018, and another Liberal senator casually calls once again for the destruction of section 18C. And what have we heard from this disappointment of a Prime Minister? Nothing. Crickets! Why won't this Prime Minister stand up for common sense and good policy and correct Senator Stoker? Why won'the make a public statement about the importance of section 18C as a backbone of our multicultural society to stop these ongoing attacks from within his own party? I'll tell you why: he's never been willing to stand up to the far right wing of his party. He's an arrogant, out-of-touch Prime Minister who serves them instead of the multicultural communities of Australia. Throughout last year's attacks by his backbench on section 18C, Mr Turnbull did not dare defend the protections against racial hate speech-even as a concept. It was a shocking dereliction of duty by a Prime Minister. But there is still time for him to fix this. In the meantime, I would ask those opposite, including Senator Stoker in the Senate: do they know the damage they do with their casual remarks when, from their position of privilege, they throw out a comment that protections against racial hate speech should be destroyed? Honestly, part of being a good member of parliament is the ability to put yourself in others' shoes, to have empathy and to imagine what impact your words and actions may have on people not like you. I sincerely hope that Senator Stoker's remarks are not the beginning of yet another push from the Liberal Party to destroy section 18C-but, if they are, the Labor Party is ready. We have fought and won twice and we will fight and win again. Section 18C is too important to leave captive to this Liberal Party. It is too important to too many Australians. Labor will always fight for and protect section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act. Conference of States Parties to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Mrs PRENTICE (Ryan-Assistant Minister for Social Services and Disability Services) (19:55): I want to thank the parliament for the honour and privilege of representing the people of Australia at the United Nations 11th session of the Conference of States Parties to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which was held in New York from 12 to 14 June 2018. While there, I was able to deliver our national statement on our progress in furthering the rights of people with a disability in Australia, which I would also like to share with the House tonight. The statement read: It is my honour to represent Australia at this eleventh session of the Conference of States Parties to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Australia commends the Committee for their continued work promoting the Convention. Disability is a priority for Australia's international engagement in development, humanitarian action and human rights. We continue to play a leading role internationally including as co-chair of the Global Action on Disability (GLAD) Network alongside the co-chair of the International Disability Alliance. This unique collaboration continues to enhance international cooperation towards more disability-inclusive development and humanitarian action. Australia is a leading global advocate on disability data.  The ability to collect accurate disability data enhances the visibility of people with disabilities and we welcome the decision to identify data as a cross-cutting theme for this years' conference. Australia is committed to protecting and strengthening civil society. We continue to support people with disabilities and their representative organisations in developing countries to advocate for their rights under the CRPD. Australia supports Ms Rosemary Kayess' candidacy for the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Her appointment to the Committee, alongside Australia's current seat on the Human Rights Council, will strengthen Australia's ability to promote and protect human rights both domestically and internationally as well as meaningfully work towards leaving no one behind through the full implementation of the CRPD. Domestically, all levels of Australian government remain committed to improving the lives of Australians with disability through the overarching framework provided by the National Disability Strategy. The development of the Strategy is the first time in Australia's history all governments have committed to a unified, national approach to improving outcomes for people with disability, their families and carers, and to providing leadership for a community-wide shift in attitudes. It is the key mechanism for driving a more inclusive approach to the design of policies, programs and infrastructure so people with disability can participate in all areas of Australian life. The Strategy focuses the efforts of each level of government to not only improve the performance of the disability service system but importantly, to improve mainstream systems for people with disability. Work has already commenced on the development of a national disability framework for beyond 2020 that responds to a changed disability policy landscape that includes a fully implemented National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS). Australia's National Disability Insurance Scheme now provides reasonable and necessary supports for more than 160,000 people who have a permanent and significant disability, including nearly 45,000 receiving support for the first time. Once fully implemented, the National Disability Insurance Scheme is expected to support more than 460,000 Australians with a permanent and significant disability, enabling choice and control over the support they need to achieve their goals, objectives and aspirations for social and economic participation. Australia also has a long-standing commitment to support jobseekers with disability into long-term employment through the Disability Employment Services (DES) program. Since the commencement of DES in March 2010, we have achieved more than 400,000 job placements for people with a disability. We are making changes to DES to empower the individual participants in the program, with the aim to increase the number of long-term employment outcomes for DES participants. Australia's commitment to implementing the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities remains unfailing and we look forward to the discussions over the coming days of the Conference. A key part of my speech was expressing our support for Rosemary Kayess, Australia's candidate for the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. I'm happy to report to the House that Ms Kayess was successful and was the third elected candidate out of 19 candidates. It is wonderful to have more women on that committee. Ms Kayess is an accomplished human rights lawyer, researcher and academic. She is currently chair of the Australian Centre for Disability Law and director of the Disability Innovation Institute at the  University of New South Wales, and I know that she will be an outstanding committee member and advocate. During my time in New York, I was also able to meet with a number of our colleagues from around the world to discuss and share a wide range of disability policy issues. It was a great opportunity to listen and learn from other countries. I was also pleased to see that in a number of areas Australia is leading the way. It was also an honour to deliver the MIKTA statement on behalf of our partner countries Mexico, Indonesia, Korea and Turkey. Also notable was that Colin Allen, an Australian, stood down as president of the International Disability Alliance, and he was honoured in this year's Queen's Birthday honours. Attending the United Nations 11th session of the Conference of States Parties to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities has further highlighted Australia's commitment to ensuring that the rights of people with a disability, and I want to thank everyone at the Post. House adjourned at 20:00 NA Ms MCGowan to move: That this House: (1) notes that: (a) the Government last year released draft legislation concerning pay day lending which would have capped the maximum amount a consumer could repay on a small loan of less than $2,000 at 10 per cent of their net income; (b) the draft legislation also called for pay day lenders to be barred from making continued offers of credit to vulnerable borrowers; (c) there is no legislation before Parliament despite the Government in late 2016 flagging new laws to protect consumers and releasing draft legislation; (d) people continue to get into financial difficulty because of high-interest contracts; (e) the 2016 Review of the Small Amount Credit Contract laws found payday loans were being inappropriately handed to low-income and vulnerable Australians-the high-interest, high-fee cash advances continue to trap people in cycles of debt; and (f) Good Shepherd, St Stephens and other consumer advocates are concerned about the impact of the delay in presenting this legislation to the Parliament; and (2) calls on the Government to bring the draft legislation before the Parliament as soon as possible in order to give consumer advocates an assurance that legislative change will be considered to address the increasing number of vulnerable borrowers impacted by these lending practices. Mr Vasta to move: That this House: (1) recognises the fantastic contribution that volunteers make to the community of Bonner, and to Australia in general; (2) notes there are 8.7 million volunteers around Australia in organisations like sports clubs, charities and schools; (3) congratulates the Government for allocating $20 million in funding to support volunteering; and (4) notes that volunteering efforts make an estimated annual economic and social contribution of $290 billion.  Mr Wallace to move: That this House: (1) recognises that mental health is a crucial area that needs attention; (2) notes that the Government has made mental health a priority and is a key pillar of the National Long Term Health Plan with a record investment of $4.3 billion; (3) further notes that Australians with severe mental health illness will now receive more support services in their communities following an agreement between the Australian and state governments; and (4) congratulates the Government for investing $160 million in the new national psychosocial support measure. Mr Morton to move: That this House: (1) notes that: (a) funding is available in the 2018-19 federal budget for the Australian Government's contribution to the construction of the Roe 8 and 9 extensions to complete the Perth Freight Link (PFL), despite the decision of the Western Australian Government to not proceed with the project; and (b) the Australian Government will provide $1.2 billion to the first Western Australian Government willing to build the PFL by constructing the Roe 8 and 9 extensions and is therefore recording this commitment as a contingent liability in the federal budget; (2) acknowledges the real benefits of these projects including 15 sets of traffic lights bypassed, 7,000 trucks and 74,000 cars off local roads each day, freeway access and travel time savings and a reduction of 450,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions; (3) welcomes strong community support for Roe 8 and 9; (4) condemns the Western Australian Government for not accessing the federal funding and building this critical infrastructure that will improve freight efficiency, make local roads safer and create local jobs in Western Australia; (5) calls on the Western Australian Government to: (a) consider all options that allow Roe 8 and 9 to proceed, like a longer bridge over the wetlands or a longer tunnel; and (b) immediately access the $1.2 billion available in the federal budget and build this critical infrastructure; and (6) calls on the federal Opposition to explain if it will keep or remove this critical funding from the federal budget if elected.

196,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOTICES,Mr Howarth) took the chair at 16:00. NA Vietnam: Human Rights,167
197,Mr ZAPPIA,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," Last week I attended a briefing on alleged human rights violations in Vietnam. The allegations came as a surprise to me. I have always seen Vietnam as a country on the rise, making great economic progress, of independent thinking and of balanced, stable government. However, it appears that, particularly in recent times, and since the election of a new government in 2016, there has been widespread persecution, including arrests, imprisonment and physical violence, in response to criticism of or protest against government. There are allegations of religious freedom also being restricted by authorities, with both Christian and Buddhist followers, in particular, being targeted, religious property being destroyed and religious leaders being prevented from travelling. Labour unions are also banned, and labour activists are being surveilled and harassed. Australia is home to some 295,000 Vietnamese people or people with Vietnamese ancestry, and I have no doubt that reports of what is occurring in Vietnam would be of grave concern to them. They would hold real fears for the safety and well-being of their family members and friends still living in Vietnam. Their fears would also relate to any return travel to Vietnam that they may have planned. Vietnam is a near neighbour to Australia and a growing trade partner. Vietnam is a party to the TPP, which Australia has an interest in. I therefore call on the Turnbull government, and, in particular, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment, who have regular contact with international countries, to use whatever influence they have to, firstly, raise questions about human rights abuse with the Vietnamese government; secondly, call for the release of prisoners of conscience detained by Vietnamese authorities; and, thirdly, lift travel bans imposed on Vietnamese civic leaders. I started my address by talking about allegations of human rights abuse. I don't know if those allegations are true or not, but I can only take them on face value, based on the reports that have been presented to members of parliament and that I have read in the paper. Whether Australia can, indeed, influence the Vietnamese government I don't know, but the best hope for the people in Vietnam who are having their freedoms, allegedly, restricted is for the international community, including Australia, to take an interest in and a stand over the growing allegations of human rights abuse in Vietnam. Western Values Mr TED O'BRIEN (Fairfax) (16:03): On the front page of The Australian today we again see an article on the withdrawal by the Australian National University from negotiations with the Ramsay Centre for Western Civilisation. I do not know any more than other people in this House. I'm not privy to confidential information, so I'm no expert in that debate, but I am deeply concerned that it is symptomatic of a broader issue, and that is a dilution of our values as a Western civilisation. At the end of the day, the liberal democracy that we celebrate in this chamber is built on values. Those values are very strongly Western values. I would say, more than any other Western country in the world, better than elsewhere, Australia has embodied those values of both Christianity and Enlightenment. By virtue of our history, Christianity and  Enlightenment did not have the same clash: they coexisted. And that is why we created a country that can, for example, embrace multiculturalism so well-so strong are our values. What we see with the Australian National University's rejection of a new course on Western civilisation is symptomatic of a lack of leadership through other institutions when it comes to fostering those key values of our liberal democracy: freedom, equality, justice and so forth. Unless we have our key institutions fostering such values, then, indeed, our civilisation will decline. Most students of international affairs or, even, of history would be familiar with Samuel Huntington's The Clash of Civilisations? where he talked about the fault lines of this century coming down to a clash of civilisations. Probably the most celebrated book last year on the same topic was by another Harvard academic, Graham Allison, who talked about the Thucydides trap and questioned the civilisations of the United States and the West and the Sinic civilisation. Regardless of whether you buy into these sorts of theories, there's one thing that we can do as a country, as we face an uncertain future. We can pull down hard and double down on the values that define who we are as a nation. Those values are Western values. And, unashamedly, that is why this government's foreign policy white paper starts with an anchoring to those values, and I ask other institutions across Australia to do the same. WestConnex",167
198,Mr THISTLETHWAITE,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," The people of Kingsford Smith and the surrounding community are absolutely fed up with the New South Wales Liberal government. They're fed up with the state government's poor planning of key infrastructure projects that continue to negatively impact upon our community and beyond. In particular, WestConnex is one of those disasters. I understand the local community's outrage at a number of trees to be felled or pruned as a result of the Alexandria to Moore Park connectivity upgrade. It's part of WestConnex, a mostly underground motorway being built across Sydney, and it's already taking its toll. The New South Wales government are responsible for all aspects of planning approvals, and they're destroying our community's natural heritage. Concept designs confirm that big fig trees on the eastern side of South Dowling Street next to Dacey Avenue will be 'affected' by road widening and also states that 'some impact' is expected upon Dacey Avenue. A shared cycle footpath would weave across and around trees 'where possible'. These trees are part of the character of the historic suburb of Randwick, and they're being taken without any notification to our wider community. There's simply no transparency about what the New South Wales government is doing in respect of this. The New South Wales Liberal government are out of touch, just like their federal colleagues. What really riles our community about their approach is that they simply won't explain what their plans are in terms of the bus services that are going to be affected by the light rail line that's being built to our community, how many trees are going to be taken in respect of the Moore Park connectivity upgrade and where they're going to be taken from, not to mention the changes to local traffic and local road networks that will be part of the upgrade and the effect that that will have on surrounding communities. They can't even respond to the community's requests for basic information. I wrote to the New South Wales transport minister requesting that information in March this year, and I still haven't got a response. For those who've had enough of WestConnex, it's time to translate that anger into action. I and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the member for Sydney, Tanya  Plibersek, will be hosting a WestConnex forum at Alexandria Town Hall at 6 pm on 12 July. You can find out more details about the forum on my Facebook page. I urge residents of Kingsford Smith and Sydney to join us on the 12th and express your outrage at what the New South Wales government is doing with WestConnex, the light rail project and our community. Come and have your say and let the New South Wales Liberals know that enough is enough when it comes to WestConnex. MCPherson Electorate: Surf Life Saving Australia Mrs ANDREWS (MCPherson-Assistant Minister for Vocational Education and Skills) (16:09): As members know, I'm very privileged to represent a stunning and special part of our nation-the wonderful southern Gold Coast. At the south of my electorate is the legendary Coolangatta, which many regard as the spiritual birthplace of the Gold Coast and which is home to the best surfing breaks on the Gold Coast, off the Snapper Rocks. This year, the Coolangatta Surf Life Saving Club celebrates 60 years of providing a crucial community service to local residents and tourists alike. The Coolangatta club works alongside other clubs in the Point Danger Branch. I've spoken often in this place about the enormous role that surf lifesaving plays in our local community. My own MCPherson Community Achiever Awards, which I host each year, have a special surf live saving category, in recognition of the many locals who give their time and contribute in this special way. I want to take this opportunity once again to acknowledge the work of surf lifesaving clubs. There are over 280 surf clubs across the nation, whose members are among the 80,000 surf lifesavers who volunteer their time to patrol our beaches. An average of 10,000 rescues are performed each year by surf lifesavers, who are trained to use rescue tubes, rescue boards, radios, inflatable rescue boats-the IRBs-oxygen equipment and provide basic life support. Earlier this month I joined with members of the Coolangatta Surf Life Saving Club for their annual dinner, a special occasion where they take the time to reflect on the achievements through the year and to acknowledge the work of their dedicated volunteers. I was pleased to present National Patrol Service Awards, which are given for a minimum of 16 hours of service every season. The 15-year service awards went to Garry Bell and Sean Smith. For their 10-year service, Danyelle Lipponen and Rohan Scaysbrook were recognised. Five-year service awards went to Christopher Gray, Gustavo Wescher, Hayley Dilger, Jake Mercer, Jessica-Lee Dreyer, Kim Mitchell-Darley, Sarah Mitchell-Darley and Tahnie Lipponen. The esteemed honour of the National Medal for surf lifesaving was presented to George Levett and Denis Henricks. This national award is part of our distinctive national system of awards and honours, and it is given for proficient service of at least 30 hours each year for a minimum period of 15 years. I take this opportunity in the federal parliament to thank these award recipients and all the wider community of volunteers who make up our fantastic surf lifesaving clubs and to congratulate the Coolangatta Surf Life Saving Club on 60 years of service to our Southern Gold Coast community. Cooper, Mr William",168
199,Mr WATTS,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," I rise today to congratulate the Australian Electoral Commission on its recent decision to rename the federal electorate of Batman after Yorta  Yorta activist William Cooper. National symbols matter. They are the way we project our sense of national identity; they show how we see ourselves, and they are the prism through which others see us. The symbols that we choose tell us something about the kind of country that we are. William Cooper was an outstanding Australian, someone who every Australian can be proud of. In the early 20th century, he helped establish the Australian Aborigines' League to advocate for a fair deal for Indigenous Australians, including land rights, enfranchisement and a direct voice to parliament. William Cooper also pioneered the establishment of National Aborigines Day. First established in 1940, it's now celebrated nationwide as NAIDOC Week. Importantly, he was an advocate for human dignity wherever he saw injustice. He is famous for leading a protest to the German consulate in Melbourne again the Nazi persecution of the Jews during Kristallnacht, recognised by Yad Vashem as the only protest of its kind to take place anywhere in the world. As the Australian Aborigines' League first offices were located in Footscray and Seddon, within the boundaries of my electorate, I had been running a community campaign to rename Gellibrand-named for John Batman's lawyer-after William Cooper. While I'm disappointed that I won't be able to represent an electorate named after William Cooper in this place, I am ecstatic that he is getting the symbolic recognition that he so richly deserves. While I am firm in my belief that symbols matter and that this decision by the AEC will make a difference, substantive decisions matter too. And in this way we should also learn from William Cooper's example. William Cooper was a strong advocate for an Indigenous voice in this building. Cooper drafted a petition to King George VI, signed by thousands, asking for this Indigenous representation in this parliament, only for the Prime Minister at the time, Joseph Lyons, to reject it out of hand and refuse to pass it on to the monarch. We clearly hear the echo of that moment in the Uluru Statement from the Heart and the current government's response to it. The fact that the substance of William Cooper's petition 80 years ago is so similar to the substance of the Uluru Statement from the Heart is telling. While the naming of a federal electorate after William Cooper means that 80 years after his petition to this place William Cooper's name will be regularly heard in the debates of this building, we need substantive reforms to ensure that the voices of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders are also heard in this building. The people in this building need to spend more time listening to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. We need to get to work on delivering constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and on implementing the Indigenous Voice to Parliament called for in the Uluru Statement from the Heart. Menzies Electorate: Stronger Communities Program",169
200,Mr ANDREWS,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," I rise this afternoon to encourage community organisations, voluntary groups, clubs, societies and the like in my electorate to look at opportunities in the next Stronger Communities Program funding round. This fund is an important fund because it provides amounts up to $20,000 for community organisations for a variety of things which can help them. What I've found over the years is that it's often small amounts of money that make a big difference to local communities, to the volunteers and organisations who are providing such important service in all of our electorates, including my electorate of Menzies.  For those who are thinking about what sorts of things are funded, can I just indicate the list of funding from the last round as an indication to other organisations of the sorts of things that might consider. For example, there was funding to the Templestowe RSL Sub Branch to upgrade their air-conditioning facilities. There was a grant for Quambee Reserve in Ringwood North to upgrade its female changing room facilities-I have spoken about this before. One of the pleasant challenges of the increased participation of women in sport is the need to upgrade particularly changing rooms and similar facilities at many sporting venues throughout the country. Croydon Hills Community Men's Shed received funding for the construction of a clean eating area. The Coptic Orthodox church in Bulleen received funding to upgrade their outdoor area. The Australian Air League's Doncaster Squadron used a funding grant to upgrade educational equipment-something very important for young people in the Australian Air League. The Friends of Warrandyte State Park installed a watering system with the grant that they received through this program. One thing that pleased me greatly was the purchase by Doncare of two vehicles to assist with donation collection and to transport special needs patients. They are two vehicles that are very much in use every day by Doncare, the major voluntary welfare organisation in my electorate. The Schramms Sports Club in Doncaster upgraded their kitchen facilities. The Veneto Club in Bulleen, like Quambee, have upgraded their female changing rooms. I was delighted to visit the Veneto Club just recently to look at the changes that have been made there. Hundreds, if not thousands, of young women are now playing sport at the club. The Manningham Men's Shed in Doncaster East upgraded a walkway and heating and cooling facilities. The Bulleen Templestowe Amateur Football Club restored lighting facilities at the Ted Ajani Reserve and purchased and an electronic scoreboard. Doncaster RSL Sub Branch did some restoration and repairs to their club rooms. The Templestowe Junior Football Club installed lighting with their grant. The Doncaster Cricket Club provided storage facilities and equipment to provide for those playing cricket. Finally, in the last round's grants, St Mark's Anglican Church in Templestowe Lower constructed a community garden and meeting place. They are all very worthy projects. Patsikatheodorou, Mr John",170
201,Ms VAMVAKINOU,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," I would like to honour my friend of 40 years and local constituent John Patsikatheodorou, otherwise known as Patsi, who left us suddenly, aged 66, on 4 June 2018. A community activist and pioneer of many multicultural services, John was born on 10 May 1952 in Livadi, Ellasona, in Greece. He often boasted that he came from the land of the gods, Mount Olympus, and that 'theodorou' in his surname meant he was God's gift-here on this earth for a higher purpose. His is a migrant story. He arrived in Australia in 1963 where, nine years later, he completed his higher school certificate at Melbourne boys' high. He had a passion for maths and science and enrolled in biological sciences at La Trobe University, where he became active in student and multicultural issues. He found his calling, however, when Cyclone Tracy struck during Christmas of 1974. He was employed as a bilingual welfare worker with the Department of Social Security, assisting with the resettlement of Greeks from Darwin in 1975 and 1976. John was so impacted by this work that he felt that resettling the displaced Greek community was more important than going to university. And so it was that this would be his  passion and life's work, touching and impacting on thousands of migrants' welfare and settlement needs. Between 1985 and 2003, John served as director of two migrant resource centres, Broadmeadows Migrant Resource Centre and the Inner Western Region Migrant Resource Centre in Footscray, and in 1991 he was appointed a justice of the peace for Victoria. He helped form a number of community organisations and served on various boards, including Western Healthcare, Western English Language Centre, the Broadmeadows employment project, 98.9 North West FM, the Settlement Services Advisory Council, the Broadmeadows Multicultural Early Learning Centre, the Greek Orthodox Community of Broadmeadows and Districts, and Brite Services. Even this extensive list is not exhaustive of his involvement in the community. John was a dedicated activist but also a happy man who was renowned for his cheeky sense of humour and his passion for Greek music and dancing. When his wife, Helen, became the mayor of the Hume City Council on two occasions, he was happy to be referred to as 'lady mayoress' and gladly attended all events with her. He also called himself 'the bag man', as he carried Helen's handbag while she performed her official duties. John is survived by the love of his life and his soulmate, Helen; three sons whom he deeply loved and admired and was proud of, Dimitri, Stratos and Nikolas; and his soon-to-be daughter-in-law, Dimitra. John was a wonderful man, the best comrade and a friend of 40 years. He was inexhaustibly active in our community, and the work that he did for the Calwell electorate was monumental and will be sorely missed. Many local battles were fought, and he relished the challenge of advocacy and took pride in getting results. The world is a sadder place with the loss of this wonderful person. Our local community has lost a stalwart, and we in the Labor family have lost a cherished comrade. Child Care",171
202,Ms BANKS,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," I know first hand that juggling raising young children with working outside the home means life can get intensely busy. However, this is a call to all those in Chisholm and across Australia, if you know someone who may be eligible to benefit from our childcare reforms by making the switch before 2 July, to visit education.gov.au/childcare and follow the prompts to make the transition. Chisholm parents wanting to take advantage of these reforms need to opt in. I urge parents and carers to sign up now to the new system, and I remind them that there's only one more week to sign up. I know from speaking to the many parents with young children across Chisholm, whether they work part time or full time in business or retail, as teachers, nurses or otherwise, that the logistics and cost of child care are things that need to be factored into their daily lives and budgets. The Turnbull government understands that families are the backbone of our society and that, every day, parents are making choices in the best interests of their family. Our childcare package helps families by giving them the opportunities to get ahead. For some, access to child care can mean the difference between working and not working. Unlike before, there is more affordable access to child care, and this puts the opportunity of work within reach for so many families. We are targeting support to people working the most and earning the least, and it's estimated our reforms will provide more choice for around 5,000 families in Chisholm, which can save local families up to $1,300 per child.  Our reforms truly provide for all Australian families by including a childcare safety net to support children from disadvantaged backgrounds or with additional needs such as disability, and to ensure that families who do not meet the activity test or are below the threshold can have access to 24 hours of subsidised care per fortnight and can look for employment or more work, and that their children have access to early learning opportunities. Having been a working mum since my kids were little, I know first hand how busy life can get, as I said at the outset, and how important affordable and accessible child care is to families who are balancing work and family commitments. Of course, I encourage mums and dads and carers in Chisholm who may need assistance in transitioning to the new program to contact my office, and I or my lovely staff members will be more than happy to be of assistance. Centrelink",172
203,Ms RISHWORTH,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," Everyone in the House would know the diverse range of inquiries and questions we as members of parliament get at our electorate offices. But, during the last two years, some of the biggest complaints to my electorate office have been in two particular areas, unfortunately. The first is problems with the NBN. I will go into that another time. The second is complaints about the dwindling customer service from Centrelink. We know that, while the government has been focused on corporate tax cuts to the big banks and other multinational companies, they've chipped away at Australia's safety net for those on income support, those on pensions, those who deserve support from government. One of the biggest complaints that I get in my electorate is that they cannot even get through to Centrelink. They need to ring my electorate office to try and cut through and get through to Centrelink. That is simply not good enough. We know that experienced front-line Centrelink staff are getting the chop, with their positions being outsourced to labour hire companies. This is having an impact on desperate people who need support and need an answer. There are many people that spend hours upon hours on the phone, waiting to get through, and months and months waiting for their applications and claims to be processed. One of these individuals is Adrian of Hackham, who contacted my office about his Newstart and parenting payment application. He said, 'I have called twice and been on hold for just over an hour both times. The last time. I called I was informed that they were waiting for someone who was able to look at both applications at the same time, and these people were few and far between.' Stories like Adrian's are not unique. This is happening right across my electorate and right across Australia. The many Australians that rely on Centrelink services every day are just not able to get through. Last year, the government took an axe to the Department of Human Services, and we saw that 55 million times people called Centrelink for help or advice and did not receive it. People are telling me it's taking months for their applications to be processed. The cynic in me would think that maybe it's this government, the government of robo-debt calls, the government of drug testing vulnerable people. The cynical person in me would suggest that maybe they just don't want pensioners to get assistance. Maybe they just don't want people to be able to access the payments that they need. It's time the government properly resourced Centrelink and ensured that people get the support they need.  Medical Workforce",173
204,Mr BROAD,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," My part of the world is a great place to live, but one of the things we're trying to do is attract more doctors to come and live there. The township of Kerang, which I've been working very closely with, have been working very hard. They've done a great YouTube video, set to a Queen song. Instead of 'We want to break free', it's 'We want a GP'. I encourage people to watch that. It is actually really, really funny. Communities are looking at whatever way they possibly can to get more people to come and live and work in our communities. The people in my patch don't ask for much. They want to be able to drive on a decent road. They want to be able to make a mobile phone call. They want to know there are good educational opportunities for their kids. In our patch there are 128 primary schools, and each one of them is better off with the government's reforms. But one of the things we're having difficulty doing is attracting general practitioners. The federal government has done a lot in this space. We had Minister Hunt come to visit. We had the Minister for Rural Health, Senator Bridget MCKenzie, come and visit. We have worked with RWAV. We have community groups working together, and we have educational opportunities where we're going to have an end-to-end medical school where a person can train in regional Australia and have employment. We also have a district workforce shortage status-that's been a good thing. But, even with all that, we're having difficulty attracting general practitioners. I want to highlight the lifestyle you can have. You can afford a very nice house for not a lot of money. You can go down to the Murray River and hop on a boat and ski. You have a community with great sporting facilities. You have flights direct to Melbourne. You have good opportunities for public transport, with rail to Melbourne from Kerang. It still worries me that we can't attract those people that we need. I don't think it's unreasonable that people who live in regional areas should have access to good health. It's a reasonable thing to say that, if you live in a regional area, you should be able to go to see a doctor. You might have specialist services somewhere else, but you certainly should have access to a general practitioner. So I want to use this chamber just to put the word out to GPs that the Wimmera and the Mallee are beautiful places to live. We want your skills. We want you to go and live there. We want doctors in our patch. You will have a community that will support you. You will have a community that will let you have your time off. You will have a community that will really value what you do. If you're a doctor out there and you're thinking about a great place to go and live, consider the Wimmera and Mallee. We'd love to have you.",174

207,Ms MARINO,BILLS," I'm proud to be an Australian farmer and I'm equally proud of all our Australian farmers, who work so hard, day in, day out, in this country. We often farm in harsher and more challenging farming and market conditions than any other producers in the world. Just consider the drought conditions being experienced right across Australia and in my electorate in the south-western part of Western Australia. From what we've heard in this debate, it's obviously easy for some members to make the decision to shut down an industry when it doesn't materially affect their farmers or their state. It's obviously easy for some members to strip away a third or a half of farmers' incomes when it doesn't materially affect their farmers, their small businesses, their small regional towns and communities or their state. But it is going to materially affect my state, my family farmers, my small communities and the hundreds of small businesses that service the industry in Western Australia, where 85 per cent of the live export sheep come from. It's an industry that's worth $250 million in Western Australia. A report shows that the cost of shutting it down will be between $80 million and $150 million at least. What is certain is that closure of the industry will give farmers only one option: to sell to a meat processor. They will become, effectively, a captive supplier of a product for a meat processor. Make no mistake about it; farmers will have no option but to take the price they're given. It doesn't matter what that price is. A division having been called in the House of Representatives",175

209,Ms MARINO,BILLS,"Make no mistake; farmers will have no option but to take the price they're given or get out of production. Just consider those who would be affected. Let's look at the human cost of shutting down the industry and the effect that cutting off the millions of dollars from the industry will have on individual small businesses and small regional communities, primarily our farmers but also farming contractors; shearers; livestock transporters; feedlots, those who grow, supply and process feed for the live shippers; pellet manufacturers and staff; those loading the livestock on the wharves; tyre dealers; mechanics; welders; fuel distributors; fencing contractors; and the countless other small businesses and their workers in rural towns and communities that rely on local farming incomes coming into their businesses. We know that we are already seeing lower prices, with the state Labor agriculture minister's determination to shut the industry down. Unlike the members supporting this legislation, I did not come into this parliament to put farmers out of business. I did not come into this parliament to put countless small businesses that rely on those farmers out of business or out of work either. I certainly didn't come into this parliament to rip millions of dollars out of small rural and regional communities and towns. Talk of transition and new chilled-meat markets is just a cop-out. It's an easy throwaway line, like throwing fish to a seal. The practical effect will be entirely different. As the Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources was told during a visit to the Gulf States, if these states are forced to look elsewhere for live animals, they'll look elsewhere for chilled meat also. So the practical impact will be that, if we phase out live trade, the chilled trade will likely shrink, and Australian farmers would lose both markets. It's a lose-lose situation. And these countries  will continue to import live sheep, but they will just come from other countries, countries that don't have the animal welfare standards or ESCAS regulations that we have. I have no doubt that, in spite of some of the comments we've heard, this puts an absolute risk back into live cattle exports. The risk is real. We know that Labor will shut our industry down. The shadow minister for agriculture has said so. I find it extraordinary that a shadow minister for agriculture is actively working to put sheep farmers out of business. It is just extraordinary. I've lived through the deregulation of the dairy industry and I've seen what happens in a small community-to the farmers, the businesses, the small towns-when you take multimillions of dollars out of an industry and out of farmers' pockets. It is direct, it is real and we lose really good people. There is a human cost to what is being proposed here, an absolute human cost that is being ignored by those who are supporting this. As I said earlier, I am proud to be an Australian farmer. I might be a dairy farmer but I am very proud to be an Australian farmer and I am exceptionally proud of the work our farmers do in providing some of the most amazing food and product, for markets not just here in Australia but right around the world. I will stand up for our farmers every single day of the week.",175
210,Ms BIRD,BILLS," I'm very pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this private member's bill brought forward by the member for Farrer, the Live Sheep Long Haul Export Prohibition Bill 2018, and to acknowledge that this is not a partisan debate. In fact, there are people from both sides of the House who support this bill. I understand why. In my area, I have had over 1,600 individual constituents email me with their great distress and concern about what is happening in this industry. I'm sure many of my colleagues around the chamber have had similar levels of contact. In fact, I've never seen that level of engagement on any issue during the time that I've been here. In total, I have had over 4,800 emails on this subject, so some people have emailed me on more than one occasion, generally speaking first when they've seen a round of reports in the media, and images that have caused them distress, and then again when they see that repeated. I think that's what's taken its toll on people's patience with this particular aspect of the industry. I want to acknowledge each and every one of those individuals, many of whom took the time to write quite extensive personal comments in their emails about why they felt that this live sheep long-haul export trade, particularly in the summer months in the Northern Hemisphere, has to stop. I don't know that anybody could have seen the vision that was reported, including, I know, many in the farming industry, without feeling it was a completely unacceptable reflection of what we as a modern nation should see as an acceptable part of the industry sector. I'm sure the member for Farrer thought long and hard about bringing this. She's a countrybased member herself, and I acknowledge that. I have no doubt that it wasn't lightly that she brought this private member's bill before this parliament. It certainly has my support, as it has Labor's support. It would be good if we could actually bring this bill to a vote, in keeping with the expressed clear wishes of our community-certainly my community. I think it would be the view of all of those people-over 1,600 of them who emailed me from my electoratethat we actually have a vote on this and address the issue. But, of course, we require an absolute majority to bring the vote forward and we would require government members to cross the floor to enable that process to happen. To date, there hasn't been an indication that  that would be supported, but I do think it is the will of many communities, and most certainly mine, that we get on with voting on these issues. A particular round of the emails that I got came in after the MCCarthy review was completed and reported. There's a lot of frustration in what people feel is the science that was laid out in that and the recommendations that were made. The Prime Minister did say he wanted to take a science-based approach to this very difficult issue, but he's actually ignored the advice of the Australian Veterinary Association and the RSPCA, and we haven't seen the response that the community expects to the MCCarthy review. That's certainly the feedback I've had very, very strongly. It is Labor's view that we need to have a plan in place to transition the industry, not just to stop the transport of the sheep in these conditions, but also to support and transition the industry into a more viable method of production. That includes our strategic red meat industry plan to help farmers make that transition to sustained profitability and viability, but to recognise that this industry has lost the support of the Australian community. They do not see the component of that that involves sheep being treated in the way that we've seen as being in any way acceptable. They have my support.",176
211,Mr RAMSEY,BILLS," I support the live sheep export industry, but not on any terms, not in any case and not if sheep are going to die like flies on the journey. I support it on the premise that this trade can be undertaken safely, because it has been before. It can be done. As the member for Grey, I represent the farming region in Australia that would be most impacted after Western Australia. Through the last couple of months I, like all members in the place, have had a large number of emails and contacts. However, while some growers have contacted me seeking a cessation of the trade, the predominant sentiment from them by far is a sense of disappointment and concern that this crisis has occurred, no patience for those who have transgressed, but also an underlying commitment to the trade and the importance to the farms and associated industries. Current estimates are that the trade is running at $20 to $40 a head premium to the market, but the unknown and unsettling factor is what that extra stock would do if it came onto the market in a short space of time. If we learned anything from the knee-jerk reactions when the trade was banned in 2011, it was that the effect of the ban went far further and deeper and lasted far longer than anyone had imagined. It left animals on properties longer than they should have been. They grew too large and were prohibited from the trade after the ban was lifted. We offended our trading partners and they radically reduced their quotas. The designated livestock was pushed onto domestic markets and depressed the domestic markets, and all producers suffered. It was a rolled gold rolling disaster. We should not underestimate the knock-on effect to associated industries in country towns. Take Johnson's, for instance. Johnson's is a stock feed manufacturer at Kapunda and has recently installed $18 million worth of pelleting equipment primarily for the trade. Denis Johnson said: Johnsons purchase over 100,000 tonnes of grain, green screenings, hay, straw and damaged hay from farmers throughout the Mid North, Barossa, Yorke Peninsula, Eyre Peninsula, Murraylands and South East of the state providing an important source of income to farming operations. This income flows back into local communities. Farmers buy machinery from local dealerships, have their trucks repaired by the local mechanic, purchase on-farm supplies from their local rural merchandiser. They use the local doctor, hairdresser,  supermarkets, kindergartens, schools and hospitals-the list goes on to include all business and services with whom farming families have dealings. Without this money spent in rural towns, these services are lost. As someone who spent the best part of the last 35 years raising and caring for livestock, I am, like the member for Forrest, a proud farmer. I am one of the first to condemn mishandling of stock and one of the first to say that whenever our livestock are heading off farm, they simply must be treated with humanity, care and concern. But there are two underlying premises in the Live Sheep Long Haul Export Prohibition Bill 2018 that is before us. One is the premise that the industry can be slowly turned off, rather than ceasing immediately and, thus, saleyard impacts avoided. This simply flies in the face of reality. Livestock transporters are required to invest in their ships and infrastructure, and that requirement is ramping up quickly as a result of the latest regulations, and rightly so. But who would invest millions of dollars in their business if they were given a closure date at the same time? There is a very strong case that, unless the operators are given a long-term future, they will not invest and they will withdraw, with the fall-out that would cause. The second premise is that Australian sales will not suffer because our markets will switch product-to chilled and frozen product-rather than switch suppliers. The member for O'Connor provided some figures on this matter only a few weeks ago in this place, and they bear reiteration. Australia provides less than 10 per cent of the world's live sheep trade-1.6 to 1.8 million tonnes per annum out of a total trade of 10 million tonnes. The trade is growing, and global food services company GIRA is forecasting 2½ per cent growth over the next four years. The member for O'Connor reminded us that Saudi Arabia used to be a major customer and took the bulk of our live sheep from Australia. They have chosen not to comply with ESCAS-that is their choice-and have not converted to other product. They have simply found other suppliers. When our trade with Bahrain became unprofitable and ceased, the beneficiaries were certainly not our chilled and frozen meat suppliers. In fact, the crash in our chilled meat supplies to the market underlines the value and impact of trade relations across the board. Our chilled meat trade with Bahrain has shrunk from 12,000 tonnes per annum to 7,500 tonnes. That's because we're out of the game. All kinds of figures abound that support this premise, and I urge a commitment to continuing the trade.",177
212,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS," The time allotted for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS Economy Mr TIM WILSON (Goldstein) (17:13): I move: That this House: (1) recognises the positive effect of the Government's measures to ensure that it lives within its means, in particular by: (a) legislating tough measures against multinational tax avoidance; (b) delivering disciplined financial management, including through a tax-to-GDP cap of 23.9 per cent and the lowest rate of spending growth of any government in more than 50 years; and  (c) maintaining the integrity of the welfare system so that support goes to those who need it most; and (2) notes with deep concern that the Opposition: (a) opposed our multinational anti-avoidance legislation in Parliament; (b) refuses to commit to spending restraint or a tax cap so that the economy is not burdened with higher taxes; and (c) has no plan to support Australians to get off welfare and into work. Today I rise to move a motion that talks about what the government is getting right, but I do so with sadness. Frankly, it disappoints me that this motion needs to be moved in this parliament. The Turnbull coalition government is not just meeting the expectations and challenges of the Australian people; it is seeking to lead the nation in dealing with the economic challenges and headwinds that are before us. This Turnbull coalition government understands acutely the challenges Australia faces economically and, critically, understands what needs to be done to help us manage the change that is occurring in our economy. The government is addressing the international factors that drive and influence matters like tax and tax contributions but is also making sure that we're a competitive nation in the international marketplace, by making sure there is a limit to how much of a tax burden the government places on the nation and, critically, in the process, making sure we get people into positions of employment so that they can stand on their own two feet and support themselves, their families and their communities, so that they are not dependent on other taxpayers. The reason I said I moved this motion with sadness, despite the incredible record of this government, is that at every point that agenda has been obstructed by the opposition. At every point, they claim and hark about the idea that they want to crack down on the top end of town, but in practice they vote against multinational tax avoidance. It's the most absurd situation anybody could put before this parliament to claim you're against the top end of town and you want to demonise businesses that are successful in employing Australians and contributing to our nation. But where there's avoidance and where there are multinationals who are not contributing their fair share, the appropriate thing to do according to Bill Shorten-the Leader of the Opposition, I should say more correctly-and the opposition is to oppose the government's agenda to crack down on tax avoidance. But that isn't the only thing that they've voted against. They've opposed the government's sensible tax cap limiting the amount of money that is taken out of the hip pockets of average Australians to contribute to the overall welfare of the nation, to say and understand that their money is theirs first. Yes, everybody has a responsibility to carry and contribute to the balance sheet of this nation-everyone. But a critical part of that is that there has to be a limit so that people have an ambition, an interest in being able to earn more money and that they're able to go on and make choices and decisions for their lives. In this federal budget we put in a tax cap of 23.9 per cent of tax to GDP. That is a simple and measured response in order to make sure that government does not become bloated any more than is necessary and also that we are not hitting people's hip pockets any more than is necessary. But, most critically, we are focusing on what we need to do to get people from welfare into work. Everybody in the place, I would hope, understands the pride and dignity that come with people standing on their own two feet, the pride and dignity that come with having a job, the  pride and dignity that come with being able to support not just yourself but your family and to be able to help others who are less well off. The record of this government is quite clear. Since it was elected there are 140,000 fewer people on welfare. That is a huge reversal from the legacy of the previous government, which led to a growth of nearly a quarter of a million Australians living on some sort of welfare. But, most critically, when we take people off welfare-when we take 140,000 people off-it isn't just that they stand on their own two feet. They cease to be consumers of the tax system and become contributors to it. I've always said that one of the critical things for any person to do is take care of themselves, not out of selfishness but because when you are not taking care of yourself you are dependent on somebody else, and, more critically, it denies your capacity to help others. If we want a civil society, if we want a society that's just and fair, then people who can stand on their own two feet must have the chance to do so. But, more critically, we should look at the policy of the opposition, at the fact that they voted against the efforts of this government to crack down on tax avoidance. Since this government has been elected and since the tax avoidance task force and the Australian taxation commission have been introduced we have raised over $5.2 billion income tax liabilities against large public groups and multinationals, and the ATO has collected a further $3 billion in cash, with $2.4 billion coming from multinational enterprises. This government, at every point, is making sure that everyone pays their fair share but also is able to stand on their own two feet.",178
213,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, Is the motion seconded?,180
214,Mr Wallace,BILLS,I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,180
215,Dr LEIGH,BILLS," This is a motion based on a lie. Labor never voted against the Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law. Let me say that again for the benefit of the member for Goldstein, who moved the motion. This is a motion based on a lie, a falsehood. The member is misleading the House. Labor never voted against the Multinational AntiAvoidance Law. I know thisMr Tim Wilson: Did you support it?",180
216,Dr LEIGH,BILLS,"Yes, Labor did support it, remember? I will take that interjection from the member for Goldstein. I refer the member to the Senate Hansard, 9 November 2015. Senator Dastyari said: Labor's position is that we support this bill. Mr Tim Wilson: What about the House?",180

221,Dr LEIGH,BILLS,"and he's heard the talking point from the Treasurer and the minister for revenue, that somehow it's okay to continue to mislead the House. But the fact is, as I've said, on 9 November 2015 in the Senate, Senator Dastyari said:  Labor's position is that we support this bill. The motion was then amendedMr Tim Wilson interjecting",180
222,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS,The member for Goldstein is warned.,181
223,Dr LEIGH,BILLS,"and it was amended in such a way as to improve tax transparency. The amendments for tax transparency were agreed to by the Senate on 11 November 2015. Labor then, in the House, on 12 November 2015, voted to keep those Senate amendments to improve tax transparency. Then, back in the Senate, on 3 December 2015, we saw Labor voting against the watered-down Greens-Liberal deal, which saw less tax transparency; two-thirds of private firms were moved out of the tax transparency net. Senator Conroy, referring to an agreement made by Senator Di Natale, said it was 'the filthy deal he did with the government'. The amended bill was agreed to on the voices. Back in the House, the amendments to improve tax transparency were considered, with the House voting against both amendments, and in both cases Labor stood again for tax transparency. At no moment did Labor vote against the Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law. To say that we did is purely and simply a lie. This is a critical issue today, because we have just seen in the House the government shut down debate over tax transparency. You don't get much more ironic than that. Right now in the House, moments ago, we had members opposite voting to shut down the debate over tax transparency-and not just any debate. A bill was coming back from the Senate that would have brought the disclosure threshold for tax payable down from $200 million for private firms and $100 million for public firms to $50 million for all firms. The shadow Attorney General was on his feet attempting to that have considered immediately and he was shut down. The fact is that Labor in 2013 put in place laws to improve tax transparency-measures that the Australian Taxation Office said at the time would 'discourage large corporate entities from engaging in aggressive tax avoidance practices'. But, after coming to office, the coalition waged a guerrilla war against transparency. The member for Kooyong told the coalition party room there was a real concern that wealthy businesspeople would be kidnapped as a result of tax transparency, something that University of New South Wales accounting lecturer Jeffrey Knapp called 'the stupidest excuse for nondisclosure I've ever heard'. When we asked whether the government had evidence, some security advice to verify a kidnap risk, it turned out no advice had been provided by the Australian Federal Police, the Attorney-General's Department or the tax office. No representations were made in favour of a wind-back in tax transparency. In the Senate, only a single submission was received in favour of winding back tax transparency, from an organisation called the Family Office Institute Australia, which purports to be representative but was in fact an 'astroturfing' organisation. Labor stood in favour of tax transparency. In the case of the Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law, we wanted to amend it to strengthen tax transparency. We never voted against it. We voted for tax transparency, and the government right now, moments ago in the House, has again voted against tax transparency. ",181
224,Mr WALLACE,BILLS," Effectively managing Australia's economy can seem complicated for some people. It has clearly always been beyond the understanding of the Leader of the Opposition, for example. The shadow Treasurer obviously struggles with the idea daily. And the Deputy Leader of the Opposition finds even aspiration mystifying, so I fear she is a long way off. Only one side of the House understands how to effectively manage the economy, because only one side of the House understands and appreciates business. Managing a prosperous economy is a lot like running a successful business. Unlike those members opposite, most Australians living in the real world recognise the common sense principles you need to follow if you want to do either. In business, just like a household budget, if you spend more than you earn then you're going to come unstuck. One of the first and hardest lessons in life for most Australians is: if you can't afford it, don't buy it. It's a lesson that business owners and working Australians remember every day, but sadly it is a lesson this Labor Party forgot long ago. The Turnbull government has applied that principle rigorously, recording the lowest rate of spending growth of any government in more than 50 years and delivering a tax-to-GDP cap of 23.9 per cent. It's why, for six successive forecast updates, we've been able to project that the budget's underlying cash balance will reach a surplus in 2020-21. It's also why we can already say that the Turnbull government is the first government in a decade that is not borrowing to pay for everyday expenses. If we can't afford it, we're not buying it. The Labor Party, in stark contrast, are irredeemably and genetically addicted to spending money they don't have. They refuse to commit to any spending restraint because they don't intend to show any. At the last election they promised higher taxes on housing and income, and yet they still would have created a deficit of $16.5 billion-that's billion with a 'b'higher than us. They're spending that same money again, and then some. Their track record is clear. Under the last federal Labor government, spending was rising by four per cent in real terms, above inflation, on average, while debt was rising by a staggering 30 per cent every year. This is after being handed $50 billion in credit by the Howard government. Our hard working constituents also know that, if you charge your customers so much for the services you provide that they can no longer afford to pay for them, your business will fail. If you charge them so much they can't pay their bills and they have nothing left over to grow their prosperity, then your income will soon disappear. The Turnbull government wants to see all Australians prosper, get ahead and keep more of their own money. We don't want to charge Australians any more for their government than we absolutely have to. That's why we've delivered historic tax relief for every working Australian, and ensured that 94 per cent of working Australians will never have to pay a marginal tax rate above 32½c in the dollar. It's also why we have reduced the company tax rate for all businesses with a turnover of $50 million and are working to expand that tax relief. We know that prosperous businesses deliver more jobs, stronger growth and more sustainable tax revenue to pay for the services that Australians rely on. The price the Labor Party charge taxpayers for their government can never be high enough. No amount of tax is too much for the Labor Party. They fought to stop our tax cuts for working Australians, voting to take $70 billion more out of Australians' pockets. They proposed more than $200 billion in other additional taxes, including extra taxes on housing,  electricity, small business, investment income and even pensions-yes, even pensions. In total, they want to take $8,000 more away from every single Australian through higher taxes. Labor cannot be trusted with our nation's economy. They can't help themselves. Labor always want to spend money they don't have and, when the time comes, it's always Australians that have to pick up the bill. Mr CRAIG KELLY (Hughes) (17:28): I'm pleased to rise to support the motion from my good friend the member for-'Goldsteen' or 'Goldstine'? I'm sure it has changed a lot. Mr Tim Wilson: No, it has not. Mr CRAIG KELLY: I'll start by picking up on a few points made by the member for Fenner. He said, 'If you repeat a lie often enough, it becomes the truth.' Talk about pot-kettleblack. Here we have a member of the opposition that ran the 'Mediscare' line, the greatest deception in an election in Australia's history. That lie was repeated over and over again, so much so that it will go down in folklore. In fact, thankfully, this parliament has passed legislation, agreed to by the opposition, such that, should they engage in such deceptive conduct again-impersonating a federal government agency-it would be illegal. We wait with bated breath on this side of the House to see what campaign our opponents will come up with at the next election, what story they will tell, and repeat over and over and over againan untruth to try to again con the Australian public. But I think this time the Australian public will be awake. When it comes to the issue of corporate tax, one of the most stunning revelations this week was when one of the members of the opposition asked a question in question time about the reduction in the corporate tax rate and asked, 'Where will the money come from?' This is a question we often ask on this side of the House when Labor have their big spending plans. But this was in relation to a reduction in the corporate tax rate. It shows the fundamental difference between the ideologies on this side of the House and on that side of the House. On this side of the chamber, we understand that the size of the economic pie of our nation, the wealth that we have, is not fixed. The wealth that we have can shrink or it can grow, depending on the incentives that we put in the system. It depends on the hard work of those Australians who vote for us. How big that economic pie grows depends on their risk-taking and their entrepreneurial efforts. The opposition think that the size of that economic pie is fixed and it's just a matter of cutting it up. They don't understand that the very reason that we are reducing the corporate rate of tax in this nation is to grow the size of the economic pie. This is not just a theory. This has happened every single time in our nation's history when we have reduced that corporate rate of tax. When Peter Costello was the Treasurer, he reduced the corporate rate of tax from 36 per cent to 30 per cent. According to the opposition's ideology, or what they say now, that should have cost the Treasury money. But exactly the opposite happened. The reduction in the corporate tax rate actually resulted in the Treasury getting more revenue in, not only in gross terms but as a percentage of GDP. So we grew the pie and we even made the corporate tax slice of that pie bigger, at a smaller rate. It wasn't only under Peter Costello. Exactly the same thing happened when Paul Keating was the Treasurer. Again, Paul Keating understood. He reduced the corporate rate of tax in this nation and-surprise, surprise!-what happened? The actual number of dollars flowing to the Treasury increased, the economy grew and job creation grew.  This is what we understand on this side of the House. It amazes me that we have members of the opposition wanting to simply run class warfare rhetoric to try to argue against corporate tax cuts. Almost every OECD nation this century has understood this and has lowered the corporate rate of tax, with a few exceptions, including Australia. Even though we have had a magnificent performance from this coalition government, with more than a million new jobs created, we face a future, going forward, where we must get that rate of corporate tax down to be internationally competitive. (Time expired) Debate adjourned. Prevention of Violence Against Women Consideration resumed of the motion: That this House: (1) notes that the rape and murder of Eurydice Dixon is the 30th instance of a woman being killed by men's violence against women in 2018; (2) recognises the importance of providing strong leadership in changing men's behaviour towards women to prevent such behaviour by men; (3) understands that: (a) at least one women a week in Australia is killed at the hands of a man, usually a current or former partner; (b) one in three Australian women has experienced physical violence since the age of 15; and (c) one in five women has experienced sexual violence; (4) acknowledges the social and economic impact that violence against women has on our communities; and (5) encourages all Australians to not wait until International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women (White Ribbon Day) in November to be active, engage on this issue and take action. Ms O'TOOLE (Herbert) (17:34): I'd like to start by offering my sincere sympathy to Eurydice Dixon's family, both immediate and extended, and to all of her friends and supporters. I never met Eurydice Dixon or her family. I did not know who she was or the attributes that drew people to her as a friend or supporter. I was never fortunate enough to witness one of her comedy shows or witness her true passion for life. What happened to Eurydice Dixon was an absolute tragedy-a tragedy that, sadly, is becoming far too familiar for many women around the nation. This tragic loss of life was, unfortunately, the 30th instance of a woman losing her life to violence by a male this year. The nation once again is mourning the loss of a woman's life far too early. We mourn together for Eurydice and for all the women whose lives have ended as a result of violence. What made Eurydice's death even more horrific was the fact that she was doing normal, everyday activities. She'd finished her comedy performance, had walked to pick up some food and was walking home through the park, metres from her home. In this instance, what was perceived to be an ordinary activity resulted in a tragic death. Last Monday evening on ABC's Q&A, a woman in the audience spoke about how she carries her car keys in a particular way when walking to her car in the evening. This is her way of protecting herself. Eurydice's death has again sparked conversation throughout the nation. Women are sharing their stories and speaking out about their experiences of violence. Intense conversation about violence against women in Australia is continual and cannot be ignored. Women cannot live  in constant fear of being violently attacked when doing ordinary, everyday activities, like walking home-regardless of the hour. We in this House must take this issue seriously and work to ensure that we, as a parliament, address violence against women, because, if we fail to do so, we fail the Australian people. Implementing actions that focus on women's safety creates a sense of hope that change is happening and that we, as elected representatives, are delivering strong leadership against any form of violence against women. Over the last few days, the conversation has turned to talk about the culture and structural causes of violence. Walking home should not mean that you are risking your life. Catching a taxi or public transport should not be a dangerous activity. Women have the human right to move freely around the nation without the need for better security cameras or lighting in specified areas; although, these interventions are helpful. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare's report Family, domestic and sexual violence in Australia, 2018 reported that one in six, or 1.5 million, women and one in nine, or 922,000, men are physically and/or sexually abused before the age of 15. The report also highlighted that one in five, or 1.7 million, women and one in 20, or 428,000, men have been sexually assaulted or threatened since the age of 15. These are extremely alarming statistics, especially when we know that children who are victims of or witnesses to family violence or abuse have a heightened chance of experiencing further violence later in life. We are all aware of the social and economic impacts that violence against women, and family and domestic violence has on our society and community. I'm proud to stand with the Labor team that has announced, under a Shorten Labor government, that we will introduce 10 days paid family violence leave for all workers who need it, as this will boost productivity, improve retention and decrease absenteeism. Labor is demonstrating strong leadership because we want to ensure that those who experience violence are supported. This will contribute to real change in the culture of violence. However, there is much more to do. Eliminating violence against women is everybody's business. We must adopt the principle: 'if you see it, report it'. I think the words of retired Chief of Army Lieutenant-General David Morrison-'The standard you walk past is the standard you accept'-are incredibly relevant in this context. As a nation, we must not walk past violence against women or domestic and family violence when we witness it. We must stand united. We must take action to ensure that violence against women stops, and that it stops now. We must ensure that our sons and daughters have a good role model and that they are educated from the cradle about acceptable and respectful behaviour. I want the best future for my children and grandchildren, and that is a future that does not include violence against women or domestic and family violence. We, as a nation, need to stand united and say that violence against women stops now. We need to take the appropriate action to ensure our words are enacted, because words without action are not useful at all. Ms O'NEIL (Hotham) (17:39): I want to thank the member for Lindsay for providing an opportunity for us to discuss this incredibly important issue in our parliament. Something I've really noticed after five years of being in the chamber is that the conversations that happen in our parliament, that happen up here in Canberra, can feel very remote to the people we represent in our electorates. But the issue that's being discussed tonight about violence against women, about the right of Australian women to be safe on our streets and in our homes, is  core to the daily lived experience of half our population. It's really important that we talk about it. I was incredibly shocked and saddened by the death of Eurydice Dixon. I want to offer my heartfelt condolences to her family and friends, to everyone who knew and loved her. No doubt there are so many people whose lives she touched who are missing her incredibly right now. As I experience these things now at this stage of my life, I feel I experience them more as a parent than as a participant, and when I heard about the way that this crime was committed and the innocence of that act that was being conducted by this woman-simply walking through a park on her way home; it wasn't even that late at night-I think of her parents. To lose a child under those circumstances is something you would never want for any Australian, so I really want to give my condolences to her family. Eurydice was a really inspiring young woman, by all reports. She made people laugh. What an amazing thing to do in a world that doesn't always feel so positive. I read a lovely article in which her friend Kieran Butler described her as brave, courageous, loyal and trustworthy. He said, 'She could genuinely empathise with and understand a point of view or action she vehemently disagreed with. That is rare in someone so young.' Indeed, it is rare in any person, and it's a quality that all of us in this building should aspire to. What happened to her has left us all shaken. It was brutal, cruel and incredibly hard to understand. It's also a painful, burning reminder of the failure of our parliament, legal system and society to end violence against women. Only four days before the death of Eurydice, another woman, Qi Yu, was murdered, allegedly by her male housemate. She was a 28-yearold Chinese woman living here in Australia-another woman dying at the hands of a man right here in our suburbs. I note that this incredibly sad death of Eurydice Dixon has brought to mind and brought to the fore of the political debate and the debate that we are having around our kitchen tables the fact that 30 women have been killed by men's violence against women this year. We think about the mountains that are moved when we see incidents of a different kind that kill that many people, yet when it's violence against women, for some reason there's a lot of talk and a lot of discussion, but I don't see the action to back it up. Something I have noted in the public discussion that's taken place around the death of Eurydice Dixon has been a good conversation where I think there are men in this country who are really trying to listen. I had a conversation with my own partner where it became obvious to me that there are a lot of very well-meaning men in this country, men that I respect, who don't know the experience that Australian women live every day: the fact that if you're alone and walking down a dark street you carry your keys in your hand in case you need them as a weapon; you have 000 dialled on your mobile phone in case you feel in danger; you feel fretful and fearful if you hear footsteps behind you. I say that, not to complain, but only because we grow in humanity when we share our experiences with one another. This is the lived experience of Australian women. That's not right and it's not good enough. When I say that, I know that as a white woman living in a city I'm safer than many Australian women are. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women are 32 times more likely to be hospitalised because of family-violence-related assault than non-Indigenous women. We're living in a country where these things are going on in suburbs and households every day. It's not good enough. I'm glad for the opportunity for the parliament to debate it, but the time for debate has to end at some point. We need to do more. ",182
225,Dr ALY,BILLS," I would also like to start by offering my condolences to the family and friends of Eurydice Dixon, to those who loved her and who knew her. She appears, by all accounts, to have been a remarkable woman and certainly did not deserve the brutal death that she encountered. I offer my condolences to all women who have experienced violence and to their families, friends and loved ones. I'm five foot nothing significant in heels. I consider myself to be fit and healthy. After all, I did do two years of boxing, two years of Bikram yoga and I go to the gym as often as I can. But, if I were confronted by someone double my size and double my strength, all that would not be enough. I can carry my phone in my hand and my keys in my other hand. I can text my husband and my friends as to where I'm going, when I get there and when I expect to be there. I can walk along well-lit paths. But that still wouldn't be enough. It's part of human nature to take on protective and avoidance behaviours in the face of clear and present threats. We as women are told to take account of our own safety, and we do that. Most people do-again, in the face of clear and present threats. But not all violence against women presents as a clear and present threat. In fact, most violence against women is perpetrated by somebody known to them. Also, something as simple and as everyday as getting into a taxi or onto an empty bus, or walking down the path on your normal way home of an evening can lead to a devastating, brutal and violent situation. It's also not enough to offer well-meaning, though ineffective, platitudes about respect for women. More needs to be done, and that doesn't mean curtailing women's rights to freedom of movement. As I mentioned, we all take on protective and avoidance behaviours when we sense a threat. In that case, all that is left for women is to stay home-perhaps barefoot and pregnant, in the kitchen? But even home isn't always safe. We need more. We need more to be done to protect women. The Australian Human Rights Commission provided a submission in 2017 to the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, and I quote from their submission: Australia has a disturbingly high rate of violence against women. In recent times, policy and public discussions on violence against women in Australia have had a strong focus on family and domestic violence, in particular intimate partner violence. However, consultations conducted by the Commission indicate that violence against women can take many forms, including family and domestic violence, sexual assault, sexual harassment, violence in residential settings and online violence and harassment. In fact, the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare estimates that one woman a week and one man a month were killed by a current or former partner in the two years from 2012-13 to 2013-14. There are a number of initiatives out there that focus on violence against women, but these rates are still extraordinarily high, and extraordinarily high for Australia. They demonstrate that we do, in fact, need more to be done. We need education programs on building respectful relationships from birth, through school, to adulthood, at schools, at universities and at higher education institutions. We need workplace programs focused not just on the workplace but on public spaces too. We need to have, above all, a discussion about violence against women that does not disintegrate into a binary one of women versus men, where some men want to silence the debate because they feel victimised, or where some women want to victimise other women by somehow making violence their responsibility. We need an approach that tackles the context in which violence against women has been allowed to spread and to grow, and that also looks at the trend  towards high trait aggression and the normalisation of all kinds of violence in our society. Until then, we can offer condolences and we can make speeches about respect for women, but, for each woman who dies as a result of violence, we remain culpable. Debate adjourned. Taxation Mr VAN MANEN (Forde-Government Whip) (17:49): I move: That this House: (1) recognises: (a) the positive effect of the Government's measures to assist more hard working Australians to earn more through the tax system, in particular by introducing to Parliament legislation to provide tax relief that encourages and rewards working Australians; and (b) the Government's measures to deliver a stronger economy through tax relief for businesses so that they have the opportunity to invest more, hire more people and pay higher wages; and (2) notes with deep concern that the Opposition: (a) sought to reverse $70 billion in tax relief for working Australians; (b) refuses to rule out reversing the tax relief already legislated for small and medium businesses with up to $50 million tur nover; and (c) plans to tax Australians and the economy with more than $290 billion of higher taxes. I'm very pleased to rise in this chamber today to speak about the government's tax relief package which passed parliament last week. This income tax package and the relief that it provides will better support hard working and aspirational Australian families. Going forward, Australians will now be paying less tax and their efforts for working hard and getting ahead will be better rewarded now and into the future as we take less from their pockets each week. I've assured my constituents that, while this budget includes tax relief measures so working Australians can keep more of their hard-earned money in their pockets, importantly, this tax relief is budgeted for and costed. In my electorate of Forde in South-East Queensland, which has a diverse range of small businesses, service industries and hard working families, some 74,000 taxpayers will stand to benefit from the lowand middle-income tax relief in the upcoming 2018-19 financial year. This government's tax relief plan is about encouraging and rewarding working Australians by making income tax lower, fairer and simpler. Whilst we see those opposite continually call it a cash handout, most people, including many in my electorate of Forde, are looking beyond those political games and seeing it for what it is-a measure to ensure working Australians keep more of their hard-earned income. Why should anyone be punished for taking on extra shifts, earning overtime or being promoted? Why should the end result of that push them into a higher tax bracket? We don't want to see people lose more of their hard-earned income if they aspire to work harder and build their wealth for their families. Some of those opposite can't seem to comprehend what aspiration even means, but to the rest of the country these measures make sense. It will put to an end bracket creep so that working Australians keep more of their money to help pay their bills and save for their future-and, importantly, many people will spend these extra funds in our local communities. The coalition's tax plan is affordable and it will provide tax relief to lower and middle-income earners, and over time will provide a simpler and fairer tax system for all taxpayers. Why is  this important? It's important because we need a system that keeps taxes under control so that we remain internationally competitive. We don't want a system that puts a greater burden on hard working Australians. The more the tax burden hurts individuals and businesses, the more it hurts our economy and job creation opportunities. On that note, I would like to commend the government for the efforts we've made to help small businesses reach their aspirations to grow and expand beyond being just small-tomedium businesses, through the tax cuts that we have provided. Small-to-medium business tax cuts are benefitting three million businesses that employ over half of all working Australians. In my electorate of Forde, these tax cuts are helping some 15,500 local businesses. Sadly, we have seen the spectre today of what those opposite will do to many of those medium-size businesses in my electorate by reversing the tax cuts this government has instituted. They seem to forget that small-to-medium business is a major employer in this country and generates the wealth necessary to employ people. It's through the generation of that wealth and employing people that those individuals can build wealth and a future for their families. But it's typical of those opposite. It's just an agenda of ever higher taxes. I think the count is over $300 billion in higher taxes after today's announcement. The damage that those opposite would do if they had the opportunity in the Treasury benches again is not worth considering. The opportunities for Australians to build wealth, to grow their businesses and invest and aspire for the future rest with the coalition government, and that is why we'll be taking the tax measures that were announced and passed last week.",187
226,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, Is the motion seconded?,189
227,Mr Wallace,BILLS,I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,189
228,Ms OWENS,BILLS," Labor believes in a fairer Australia. We have a plan to build a brighter future for all Australians. We have a plan to bring the fair go back to the heart of our nation, a plan to properly fund health and education, a plan to boost wages and a plan for real tax cuts to help the families that need them most. We can afford to do these things because our plan doesn't give an $80 billion handout to big business and multinationals and it doesn't give the biggest tax cuts to the highest income earners. Our plan doesn't give the big four banks a $17 billion handout. Last week, Malcolm Turnbull gave himself a tax cut of $7,000 a year and battlers a tax cut of 10 bucks a week. That shows just how wrong his priorities are and how wrong the priorities of the Liberals are. But we in Labor have our priorities right. A Shorten Labor government will deliver permanent tax relief for the Australians who need it most, ensuring tax relief goes back into the pockets of 10 million middle-income and working Australians. Australian families with flat wages growth and facing massive hikes in electricity, education and health bills need relief, but Malcolm Turnbull wants someone on $200,000 to pay the same tax rate as someone on $40,000. Under the coalition's tax plan, 10 million working Australians will get around $10 a week. You can't even get a cup of coffee every day for that amount. The government has its priorities wrong. It clearly has with its personal income tax skewed to upper income earners, and it clearly has with its $80 billion tax cut for big business. Under Labor's bigger, fairer tax cuts, everybody earning up to $125,000 will receive a bigger tax cut compared to under the Liberal Party's plan. Many people will get almost double  the tax cut that they will get under the Liberals, because we believe in directing the biggest tax cuts to those who need them most, the people at the lowand middle-income levels, to assist them to make ends meet. Under our plan more than four million people will be better off, compared to under the Liberals' plan, by nearly $400 a year. We have a plan to properly fund hospitals, schools and the safety net. We will ensure every Australian gets the life-changing opportunity of a properly funded, quality education. The government has cut $17 billion from schools across the country, $28 million from Parramatta schools, yet it has a spare $17 billion to give in tax cuts to the big banks. A $17 billion cut to schools and $17 billion to the big banks-that's not exactly the right priority that our families need at this point in time. Labor will put back every dollar the Liberals have cut from schools. The government has cut $2.2 billion from universities, $98 million from Western Sydney University alone. It is denying the door to university to 200,000 extra students, and the Liberal freeze on university funding means 10,000 fewer places will be available next year. Labor will uncap university places and will ensure 200,000 more Australians will be able to get a university education. We'll ensure proper funding for TAFE. This last budget saw another $270 million in cuts to TAFE. The government has cut 120,000 apprentices out of the system. Since September 2013 Parramatta has lost 1,123 trainees and apprentices. That's 46 per cent gone since 2013. We will invest $100 million in a rebuilding TAFE fund to renovate campuses and workshops, and will waive up-front fees for 100,000 TAFE course places. Under the government's childcare package, 279,000 families around Australia will be worse off. The families who stand to be worse off are families in the lowest income cohortthat is, families who have a family income of less than $65,000. In Parramatta this means 2,600 families will be worse off. The government has cut $750 million from our hospitals. It has locked in a further cut of $2.1 billion to hospitals across the whole nation. In Parramatta, funding to Westmead Hospital has been cut by $12 million. The average waiting time for elective surgery is the longest on record. But this nation can properly fund and fix our hospitals if we get our priorities right and if we don't give $80 billion in tax cuts to big business and skew the personal income tax cuts to the highest earners in the country. Labor will reverse the Prime Minister's cuts to hospitals and create a $2.8 billion better hospitals fund. Labor can afford to do more to help 10 million Australians because we're not giving $80 billion to big business and the big four banks. We have our priorities right. That's why we can fund our schools, TAFEs and universities, fix our hospitals and look after the health of the nation. That's the reason why Labor can create a better and fairer future for all Australians.",189
229,Mr WALLACE,BILLS," Those opposite do not seem capable of understanding the difference between a taxation rate and the amount paid in tax. They just don't get it. I don't know whether they just don't get it or whether they're being deceitful, as they often have been. Let's just look at the situation in relation to the Turnbull government's tax. Those opposite talk about taxpayers on $40,000 paying the same rate of tax as someone who is earning $200,000. Someone who's earning $200,000 pays 13 times more tax than someone on $40,000. I can't be any clearer than that. Someone earning $200,000, under the Turnbull government's tax plan, which has been approved and passed by the parliament, is paying $60,007 in tax. Someone who is earning $40,000 pays $4,492. How can that be regarded as the same amount of tax? It's  not. It's calculated on the same rate, but someone who earns $200,000 is paying 13 times the amount of tax. This is just another example of the Labor Party being dishonest in their messaging. They think that the politics of envy will win them the next election. They are trying to scare the average Australian into thinking that we are doing wrong by the average Australian, that we're charging them the same amount of tax. That is fundamentally wrong. It's time they get called out, just as we call them out in relation to their allegations of cuts to hospitals. That is fundamentally false. It is a lie. In Queensland, for example, people are walking around and driving caravans and signs around in the electorate just south of mine suggesting that the federal government is making cuts to the Caboolture Hospital. That is a lie. That is not happening. We will call out every single time that Labor make up these fabrications. It's a falsehood. It's misinformation. It's a lie, because it's not happening. We're funding hospitals in the north coast region of Brisbane at record levels, while the state Labor government are making cuts. Yet those opposite never talk about those, because they want to peddle misinformation. Shame on them. It's an absolute disgrace. But we will continue to call it out for what it is. If you want any further truth, don't look at what they say, but look at what they have done. Mediscare is a classic example. They absolutely lied through their back teeth, and we'll continue to call them out. The tax cuts that we introduced just last week and passed through the parliament are absolutely historic. No bigger tax cuts have passed through the parliament than what was announced and passed through the parliament last week. I am just one of the members of parliament who were extremely proud to be on the government benches to see those cuts. They will have a great impact in my electorate of Fisher. We call upon the crossbenchers and we call upon those opposite similarly to pass these corporate tax cuts, because we believe that the best form of welfare that you can get is a job and, by passing these corporate tax cuts, you will get more jobs, you will see more growth, and that is what we need for Australia. (Time expired)",190
230,Ms CLAYDON,BILLS," Let's be clear. No matter what this motion pretends, this Turnbull government has never been and never will be a friend of Australian workers. It has slashed penalty rates, sacked thousands of public servants, conveniently attacked workers' pay and conditions in a consistent manner, waged war against the unions, ignored wage stagnation and argued against an increase to the minimum wage. But recently we've seen a conga line of government members lining up in this place to earnestly claim that their tax cuts will miraculously help working Australians. I'd like to get one thing straight now. Under Labor's plan, every single Australian earning less than $125,000 will get a bigger tax cut. That's right: under Labor, every single Australian earning less than $125,000 gets a bigger tax cut than they are going to get under this Turnbull government package. This isn't an argument, a suggestion or a proposal; it's the incontestable, indisputable and undeniable truth. Under Labor's plan, people in my electorate of Newcastle-64,000 Novocastrians, in fact-will be up to $928 a year better off than they are now. Unlike the government, Labor will deliver bigger tax cuts to the vast majority of workers, and we won't be taking the axe to health, education or public services, and we intend to be paying off debt. We'll pay off more debt than the government is proposing to. We can afford  to do all of this because Labor has a very carefully targeted tax plan that costs far less than the government's plan. Labor will largely help the lowand middle-income earners in Australia. Sixty per cent of the benefits of the government's plan go to the high-income earners in this country. Under Mr Turnbull's plan, a retail worker earning $30,000 a year will get a tax cut of just $200, while a lawyer on $200,000 gets to save a staggering $7,225. This is because the government is undertaking a radical overhaul of our tax system. If this government really cared about the plight of working Australians, it would have voted for Labor's plan, but it didn't. In fact, this government held tax cuts for lowand middle-income workers hostage, refusing to have them voted on separately, even though it knew very well Labor would have waved those through. It held them to ransom until the parliament agreed to tax cuts for people earning up to $200,000 a year. That's despite those cuts not kicking in until 2024-25. This demonstrates the core character of the Turnbull government. No matter the policy area, no matter the issue, they will always act in the interests of the top end of town. Whether it's their $140 billion worth of tax cuts that largely go to high-income earners, their $80 billion worth of cuts for big business, multinationals and the banks or their squeals of hostility at the mere suggestion of reining in exorbitant tax breaks for the wealthy, this government can always be counted on to back in power and privilege. But, make no mistake, this reckless and damaging plan will blast a $140 billion hole in the budget, in addition to the $80 billion that the Liberals are already ripping out for the big-business tax cuts. These breathtaking acts of economic vandalism confirm what we already knew-that the Liberals don't give a rat's about debt or deficit except, of course, when they need an excuse for vicious cuts. And that's exactly what we will see if they get their way. They'll starve the budget of revenue. Then they'll tell us that the only way forward is savage cuts to health, education and vital public services. This is nothing short of a national heist, especially given that our debt recently crashed through half a trillion under those opposite. Let's call this out; let's call it for what it is. This is a cruel hoax on the Australian people. (Time expired) Mr CRAIG KELLY (Hughes) (18:10): Where does one start after that performance? 'The Liberals don't care about debt and deficit.' Let's go through a quick history lesson, and let's start back in 1996. The coalition government, just by coincidence, inherited from the Labor Party a deficit, and a debt of $96 billion. And do you know what happened? Every single year, the coalition did the hard yards and paid that back. Not only did they pay back that $96 billion debt that the Labor Party ran up; they also paid back $54 billion in interest along the way. After they paid back the debt and the $54 billion in interest, they then put $20 billion in the Future Fund for a rainy day. And they also had the budget another $20 billion in surplus. That is because we on this side care about debt and deficit. Then, of course, we had the brilliant economic management of Kevin Rudd and Wayne Swan. What economic management we had! So good were they, they had to get rid of Kevin Rudd and replace him with Julia Gillard. She gave them a greater mess and greater devastation, and they put Kevin Rudd back in. By the time the mist and the ashes and the smoke had cleared, there was debt and deficit as far as the eye could see. This mob have not actually struck it for one single budget in surplus since-when was it? The 1980s? Is that the last time they cracked it? We on this side are doing the hard work. We are doing the same hard work that's been done before. We are doing the hard work that falls upon coalition  governments when we inherit the debt and deficit mess that is left by Labor governments. We do the hard work and we get budgets back into surplus. And that's where we're headed. And, every time we do it, do you know who stands in the way of every hard decision we make? That mob over there. They stand in the way and block us every single time, but we'll continue because we know what's right for this nation. Today, we have seen the remarkable comment by the Labor Party that they are actually going to go to the next election with a promise to increase taxes for small business. They want to increase taxes for businesses with a turnover between $10 million and $50 million-and they may be able to give us some insight here into whether they'll also increase taxes for small businesses with a turnover between $2 million and $10 million. Have we had any updates that they may inform us of? This is where we see the complete economic misunderstanding of those on that side of the chamber. They simply can't comprehend the difference between profit and turnover. Companies with a turnover of $2 million may have a very slim margin of profit. It depends on the types of goods that they're selling and on the profit margin on those goods. Companies that are selling new cars, boats or caravans may have a very slim profit margin. Companies that work on commission or as agencies might only have a five or 10 per cent margin, or even less, on what they sell their products for. Therefore, companies with a turnover of $2 million might only have a gross profit of $100,000, and then they have all their expenses, yet the Labor Party thinks that they are big businesses, and Labor wants to take away the tax cut and increase their taxes. We on this side of the house are going to stand up for small businesses in this nation. We're going to stand up and back them on those tax cuts. We're going to oppose Labor and expose them every single day between now and the next election as wanting to increase taxes on small business. That's Labor's policy, and every single small business in the nation needs to know what Labor's plans for them are, should Labor ever get its hands on power again.",191
231,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS," It being 6.15 pm, the debate is interrupted and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. NA Consideration resumed of the motion: That grievances be noted. Centrelink",193
232,Ms BURNEY,GRIEVANCE DEBATE," The Turnbull government's relentless drive to reduce the size of the Public Service is adversely impacting on Centrelink service and therefore Centrelink customers. Government statistics show that older Australians, carers and students are waiting longer to have their payments approved by Centrelink. The median processing time for the age pension payment has dramatically increased from 36 days last year to 49 days in March this year. That is a 40 per cent increase in waiting times. This means that Australians who have worked all their lives are being made to wait for two months on average just to have their age pension approved. Median average times don't take into account instances where Centrelink requests further information and then stops the clock on the process, further delaying the approval. We've heard horror stories about how Centrelink, under-resourced and understaffed, is requiring older Australians to wait many months for their payments, all the while living on the  edge of their bank accounts. The Turnbull government will tell you that, if someone's application is successful, their pension payment is backdated to the time they lodged their application. Let me share with this place two case studies that have been submitted to my office. A Tasmanian grandmother, Helen Willis-Smith, was forced to dig into her superannuation and increase her daughter's credit card limit to find the money she needed to live and pay her bills while she waited four months for her age pension to be processed. Also in Tasmania, another person waited for up to 12 months to receive their carer payment-12 months for their carer payment and allowance! And Centrelink needed to backdate the owed payment by as much as $23,000, and that was for a carer. It's absolutely shameful. How precarious and stressful it must be to live just on your savings while you wait for Centrelink to tell you if your application is successful, never knowing if or when the first payment will come. And, of course, many people don't have savings. They have to borrow from family, borrow from banks or do whatever they can to survive. The Turnbull government is telling Australians to use myGov to apply for Centrelink services online if they want to fast-track their applications. But we know that using this online interface is not easy, and that is discouraging its use. In April this year, iTnews reported that for more than a week Australians were again wrestling with accessing government services using myGov. Many are finding Centrelink's online platform incredibly difficult to navigate. We know that older Australians are struggling with this online interface, because the number of busy signals on the age pension phone line is projected to increase from 800,000 to 1.2 million-up by 50 per cent. Average call wait times have blown out for most Centrelink customers, but for older Australians they've jumped by 20 per cent. For older Australians, average call wait times have increased from 18 minutes and 59 seconds to 23 minutes and one second. For students, average call wait times have increased from 31 minutes and 15 seconds to 35 minutes. For Australians phoning the family-and-parenting line-incredibly important at the momentaverage call wait times have increased from 16 minutes and 19 seconds to 21 minutes and 12 seconds. But this is just the average. The reality is we've heard stories of people waiting hours to speak to a Centrelink officer-absolutely hours. In May this year, the ABC reported that some Launceston residents were waiting almost three hours to get assistance. Sensibly, older Australians are attempting to circumvent the phone lines by attending Centrelink in person. But, of course, this isn't working because instead of assistance they are finding an under-resourced Centrelink office and staff directing them to online and call-up facilities. This lack of service is matched by an increase in average wait times in service centres by almost 15 minutes. No wonder older Australians are not getting the assistance they need. It's a vicious cycle of vulnerable Australians being forced to the edge of their bank accounts while they wait for the payments-or simply don't receive them at all. Labor welcomes the transition to service online, so long as it remains accessible for vulnerable Australians. But it shouldn't mean that we neglect in-person and phone services. We should also provide vulnerable Australians with the support necessary to learn to navigate the online system. Yesterday, the ABC reported the story of Michelle Piefke. Michelle was given a number of documents after visiting a Centrelink office in Boronia in Melbourne. The documents contained highly sensitive information: bank details, residential addresses and signatures-for  somebody else. It is equally concerning that the Centrelink client whose form was misplaced may not have received their payment. As I've just outlined, it can be difficult speaking to someone or seeing someone at Centrelink to resolve issues, especially issues such as this, and it can take months for someone to receive their payment, if they are lucky. So it begs the question, what happens to this person's payment? Have they received their payment? How long has their payment been delayed? This, of course, is the person I referred to earlier. And how prevalent are leaks of this kind? I think we have to say to the minister, 'You have a responsibility to come and explain how many mistakes like this are made, and how they are dealt with.' The fact is that Centrelink is in crisis under the Turnbull government. Centrelink is under-resourced and understaffed, and these stories tell of that underresourcing and understaffing. And there is not one single member of this place that can dispute what I've said, because you have all had these people in your offices, and through you, Mr Deputy Speaker, you have heard these stories yourself. It's also why it is so important that Centrelink has permanent full-time staff who are supported, familiar and skilled to manage the often complex issues facing Australians who rely on income support. What's the Turnbull government going to do to fix deteriorating Centrelink services and reduce stress and anxiety in the community? Last year, the Turnbull government cut over 1,100 jobs from Centrelink and, in this year's budget, the Turnbull government reduced Centrelink funding by $300 million and cut another 1,280 staff. This is a total reduction of 2,500 permanent full-time staff over the past two budgets, and how can that be when there is such a crisis of confidence in this place. In their place, the Turnbull government has outsourced 1,250 positions to labour hire companies. Call centre workers are on contracts with insecure work. They are privatising the public sector by stealth. No wonder the morale at Centrelink is at an all-time low. What we are witnessing is a steady sell-off of Centrelink jobs and the growing casualisation of its workforce. This is privatisation by stealth. Everyone knows that this government isn't genuinely interested in strengthening the integrity and the sustainability of our nation's social safety net, and it needs protecting. This government is more interested in placing the burden of balancing its budget on income support recipients. While this government is so preoccupied with its $80 billion tax cut for big business, and this includes $17 billion to the big four banks, it is actively making Centrelink so difficult, so confusing and so frightening for people that they might just give up. Every member of this House knows that I am speaking the truth, because they are getting these constituents into their offices-I know they are-giving them a sense of comfort. Please, take up their issues. It should not matter the side of the House you sit. I've had people say to me, 'I've gone to my local member and he or she won't do anything about that.' That is completely unacceptable. These people deserve our support. They are older Australians, they are people who cannot find work, they are people caring for unwell relatives, and they are students. Every single category I'm speaking about needs the support of everyone in this place, and it is incumbent on us-it's our responsibility, as members of parliament-to take up their issues, to pursue their issues and to help them get it sorted out.  Australian Labor Party Australian Greens Mr CRAIG KELLY (Hughes) (18:26): If you wanted to undermine Australia, what would you do? I suggest you would start by making an attack on our nation's competitive advantages, the advantages that have made us one of the richest and most prosperous countries on the face of the planet. If you wanted to undermine Australia, the first place you would start would be coal. You would attack that magnificent rich black coal seam that runs down our eastern seaboard. It is a coal seam that has been a source of our competitive advantage and wealth creation for decades. You would demonise it. You would teach children in schools that using coal-fired power to generate electricity would create bad weather. You would show children pictures of coal-fired power stations with steam coming out of them, and you would tell them that it is carbon pollution. If you wanted to undermine Australia, you would put in a series of policies that undermined the viability of our coal-fired power stations and gave commercial advantage to their competitors by subsidising them. And you would add the cost of those subsidies onto the price of that electricity. That's what you would do to undermine Australia. You would stand there with a straight face and you would say that coal is not economically viable as a source of electricity generation. While, at the very same time, across more than 50 countries, hundreds of new coal-fired power stations are under construction that will pay a premium for Australian coal. You would also, if you wanted to undermine Australia, attack those that say that low-cost energy is important; you would attack them and you would vilify them. You would ridicule them as dinosaurs, and you would call them deniers, equating them to deniers of the Holocaust. You would also then say that it is cheaper to generate electricity from solar panels made in China, knowing that when you're talking price you're not comparing like-for-like products, because you cannot compare intermittent electricity generation with the price of dispatchable or baseload generation. If you wanted to undermine Australia, once you had fixed our competitive advantage in energy generation, you would then go on and try and close down our coal exports. You would seek to block all new coal mines. You would tie those mines up with red and green tape, and tie them up for years and years in the courts so that those new coal mines wouldn't go on. And, at the very same time, you would bank and you would spend the billions of dollars in royalties that our existing coal mines own. If you wanted to undermine Australia, after you had finished with coal you would move on to uranium. Australia has the world's largest known reserves of uranium. You would ban nuclear power in this country. You would abandon its development, even though that would make us a stand-out nation, as one of the 25 largest nations in the world. In the 25 largest and most powerful economies you would make our nation a stand-out as the only nation that bans nuclear power and doesn't use nuclear power for baseload power. If you wanted to undermine Australia, you would demonise free markets and entrepreneurship. You would seek to divide Australians. You would run a phoney class war every day in question time, pitting one Australian against another. If you wanted to undermine  Australia and divide Australians, you would also engage in identity politics, saying that everyone belongs to a special-interest group, and you would promote groupthink. If you wanted to undermine Australia, you would peddle the myth and the lie that workers are worse off than they were 40 years ago. You wouldn't let people know that 40 years ago life expectancy in this country was almost 10 years less. Someone born today as opposed to 40 years ago has a different life expectancy of almost 10 years. You wouldn't let people know that someone living in Australia today has much greater opportunities to travel, both domestically and internationally. Someone in their 20s today, as compared to someone in their 20s 40 years ago, will have far greater opportunities to see so many more countries of the world. You wouldn't let people know that over that 40 years there have been enormous improvements in communications. The facilities that I have on the iPhone that we take for granted today would have cost me upwards of $1 million 40 years ago. You would also not let people know about the enormous advances over the last 40 years in photography. I live in a bushfire-prone area. People tell me that one of the first things they do when a bushfire is approaching is to grab the family photos, because those photos are so valuable. Today, as compared to 40 years ago, someone will have hundreds, if not thousands, more photographs of themselves. They'll have them in colour, they'll be high quality and they'll cost a fraction of what they did 40 years ago. They won't let you know that the cars that we drive today are not only cheaper but safer. To take an example of a new Toyota Camry: in 1995 it was $24,000; last year it was exactly the same price. But it was safer, more fuel efficient and more luxurious-yet it was the same price. If you compare that to average wages, 20 years ago that car cost 37 weeks wages for the average worker. Now it costs 16 weeks. If you wanted to undermine Australia, you would idolise the likes of Marx, Lenin and Mao in our schools and universities. You would see that it was trendy to put their images on Tshirts, and you would never explain to our youth that their socialist ideology resulted in 100 million deaths last century, the greatest catastrophe in human history. If you wanted to undermine Australia, you would ensure that Western civilisation is not taught in our schools. You would demonise our past, our proud Australian history. You would make out that our forefathers were genocidal, misogynist racists. But, sadly, that's what we see. Those things that I went through, every single one of them-the things you would do if you wanted to undermine Australia-are the policies of the Labor Party and the Greens today. We need to go back and we need to teach our children about our proud history and our past. We need to teach them about Western civilisation. We need to teach them about how the free market has lifted more people out of poverty than anything else that has been known in human history. We need to teach them that the wealth that we have in our nation today is not fixed. It did not come by fluke or by chance; it came through hard work and it came through the competitive advantages that our nation has. The competitive advantages that that we have as a nation we must guard with everything that we have. We have surrendered them on energy. We have a Labor Party over there that wants to impose a 45 per cent emissions reduction target-completely absurd. We heard today from the business councils that that policy would be economically devastating. It would be a jobs killer. But that is what we face. We also face a Labor Party that wants to leave this  nation with an uncompetitive rate of corporate tax. Whether you think the corporate tax rate should be higher or lower, we cannot go forward over the next decade with an uncompetitive rate of corporate tax. These are the things that we fight for on this side of the House. These are the things that I'm proud to stand in here as part of the coalition parties and fight for. (Time expired) Hehir, Mr Louie Petition: Organ and Tissue Donation Geelong and District Peace Memorial Collins Persse, Mr Michael Dudley de Burgh, MVO, OAM",193
233,Mr MARLES,GRIEVANCE DEBATE," This evening I want to raise four issues in relation to my community in Geelong. It's nice to be able to do that this evening with the other representative from Geelong, the member for Corangamite, here in the chamber. I want to start by talking about a young constituent of mine called Louie Hehir. Louie is the recipient of a double kidney transplant. Louie spent his 10th birthday on a dialysis machine, having suffered double renal failure. He spent four years on that dialysis machine before he received a kidney transplant. That was, as Louie described it, a very dark time. He describes it in terms of being in a bad place. He talked about being bullied at school for being different during that time, being fussy about germs, unable to drink water, in constant pain. To hear Louie's story-Louie is now 16-is to hear the story of an incredibly brave young man who has overcome an appalling set of odds presented to him at the start of his life. I got to know Louie as a work experience student in my office. Indeed, Louie wrote a speech for me, which I delivered in this place a few weeks ago, about the question of establishing an optout policy for organ donation. Tonight I'd like to present a petition that Louie has collected in respect of this. The petition that he has collected asks for the introduction of a bill on an optout policy in respect of organ donation. Louie collected 441 signatures in pursuit of that petition. The petition read as followsSpent my 10th birthday hooked to a dialysis machine. I'd lost both kidneys to renal failure doctors said I desperately needed a donor to survive. But it was 4 years before they found one. My wait was so painful, but unfortunately not uncommon. Australia's organ donation rates are disastrous, and costing lives. 9 people pasted way waiting for a transplant in 2014. That's why I'm worried about a little mate of mine who's 8 and really sick. We met at kidney health camp, and I'm sort of helping him through his journey - I'm now 16. I don't want him to go through the same nightmare I did waiting for an organ. I was bullied for being ""different"" - fussy about germs, unable to drink water, in constant pain. And while some tried to understand, they don't know what it's like - to be hooked up to a machine as a young kid because your body failed you. It's hardI was in a bad place. We desperately need more organ donors in Australia. Sign my petition calling on the Australian Government to priorities organ donation in our hospitals, and improve the medical processes which will result in more transplants. If the House would act by introducing a bill on the Opt-out Policy for Organ Donation. from 441 citizens (Petition No. EN0591) Petition received. ",198
234,Mr MARLES,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Labor proudly recalls the establishment of the Commonwealth Organ and Tissue Authority, which occurred under the Rudd government. Since its institution, the authority has seen a 40 per cent increase in the number of people who have put themselves down for organ donation. But it is the case that, at any point in time in our country today, there are 1,600 people in need of an organ donation. The single most important factor in meeting that need is people having the conversation about what happens if their loved ones are in a circumstance where they meet their passing but there is an opportunity, through organ donation, to save the lives of others. In addition to campaigning for opt-out organ donation, it is really important that we encourage Australians to participate in the Australian Organ Donor Register and to have that conversation. People can do that by going to www.donatelife.gov.au/decide, and there they can register on the Australian Organ Donor Register. But tonight I would really like to acknowledge Louie Hehir, his bravery and his commitment to raising this issue. The second issue I would like to raise tonight is in respect of the Geelong and District Peace Memorial in Johnstone Park, which, the member for Corangamite will attest, is very much a spiritual home for those of us who live in Geelong. It is a beautiful war memorial. It was commissioned in 1922, and the original foundation stone was laid by Alderman Howard Hitchcock, who is a very famous Geelong name. It was opened in 1926 by the Governor of Victoria at the time, Lord Somers. The cost of the building was 15,000 pounds, which was raised by the Geelong community. It has been brought to my attention that the Geelong peace memorial needs to be brought up to date in terms of its commemoration of conflicts since World War II. It was originally constructed as a commemoration in relation to World War I. It now has 3½ thousand names inscribed on it, which are by and large from the two world wars. Andrew Hanns-again, a person familiar to the member for Corangamite-the President of Geelong RSL and a former ADF member who was deployed in East Timor, has written to me. I would like to read his letter into the record. Andrew writes: The Geelong RSL Sub Branch has a responsibility to the people of Geelong in conjunction with the City of Greater Geelong to carry on the customs and traditions of providing commemorative services in the heart of Geelong, being in the peace Memorial which is located in Johnstone Park. As we know the memorial was built in the early 1920's for those who served in the Great War, the memorial is designed for those veterans and their families and the people of Geelong for a time of reflection and also commemoration. It has served well, to the point that it had another addition of those whom served in 1939-45 being WWII. The memorial was designed in a way that it overlooks Johnstone Park, the park itself is peace full and is well utilised by the community and those visiting. On ANZAC Day each year veterans and their organisations much the streets of Geelong, past the Peace memorial where the general public in their thousands gather outside the memorial for the main service. Over the past 10 years, a number of organisations have asked for the update of conflicts inside the Peace Memorial, we need to remember those whom served post 1945, Korea, Malaya Borneo, Vietnam, East Timor, Iraq, Afghanistan and Peace Keeping operations. We have one of the three fully enclosed memorials, Australian War Memorial, Shrine in Melbourne and the Geelong Peace Memorial. Geelong is the only one that does not acknowledge those conflicts that have been mentioned post 1945. Let's update Geelong's memorial so veterans and their families of Geelong can continue customs and traditions each year on ANZAC Day, Remembrance Day and other events for the public and school to  attend, which educates along with reflection and commemoration for local community and those visiting the Geelong area leaving an experience. The Peace Memorial is in the repairs to maintain this iconic memorial, that way today's veterans can carry the baton of the past veterans and continue their work in the veteran community. Geelong has the one and only Peace Memorials, this year we commemorate the centenary of Armice or the centenary of peace, thousands of veterans, veterans families and the community will attend this service. The community need to recognition of those other conflicts in the memorial to reflect, commemorate and educate the children of today and tomorrow. Regards Andrew Hanns I would like to inform the House that I have written to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Darren Chester, to pursue the requests that Andrew has made in his letter. The third issue I would like to raise is the very sad passing yesterday of Michael Collins Persse. Michael was 86 years old and died after a long battle with myeloid leukaemia. He was a history and English teacher and the school archivist at Geelong Grammar in my electorate. What sets Michael apart from any other teacher I have ever heard of is that his connection with that school lasted for 63 years. It is far and away the longest connection that any teacher would have had in a school in my electorate and, I daresay, in the country. His attention to the detail of the students lives at that school was prodigious. Kids attest to the fact that whilst at school on their birthday-we're talking about hundreds of kids-they would receive a card from Michael wishing them a happy birthday. Indeed, those cards kept coming years after they left school. There were literally thousands of people in Michael's memory that he was writing to all the time. That means every single day he attended to that. He was, when Prince Charles was at Geelong Grammar, his personal tutor, and it began a friendship that he maintained with Prince Charles throughout his life. Indeed, in a foreword to one of the books that Michael wrote, Prince Charles said: As his writings show, he has become the guardian of so much wisdom and collective memory that by now he must surely qualify as a National Treasure. Michael was made a Member of the Royal Victorian Order by the Queen. He was also awarded the Order of Australia Medal. I should say that he was a teacher of mine. My father was the deputy principal of Geelong Grammar, and we lived at that school for a very long time. As my father said, Michael was more than just a teacher; he was a family friend. But he was a teacher of mine in my younger years. I know that I speak on behalf of so many constituents of mine and indeed people around Australia who yesterday would have been deeply saddened by the message that emanated from the school about Michael's passing, albeit that Michael lived a long and very fruitful and productive life. Unfortunately, I'll need to leave my fourth topic for another occasion. Vale, Michael Collins Persse. Taxation",199
235,Ms HENDERSON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE," I would like to join with the member for Corio in giving him support on the issues he has raised in this grievance debate. The opt-out option for those who are waiting on the transplant list I think is a very good initiative. I fully support the efforts to fundraise for the Geelong peacekeeping memorial. I also salute Michael Collins Persse, who is a real legend in Geelong but also, I think, more broadly in education in this  country. Certainly it's a very sad day for the Geelong Grammar and broader Geelong community. Regrettably for the member for Corio, who is still in the chamber, I have to end the congratulations there, because I want to turn to the announcement that Labor made today that it is going to reverse our company tax cuts for any company with a turnover of $10 million or more. That's fundamentally very disappointing. As we know, it was only a few years ago that Labor supported company tax cuts. The Leader of the Opposition, no less, is on the record very strongly supporting company tax cuts. In March 2012, he said: Any student of Australian business and economic history since the mid-80s, knows part of Australia's success was derived through the reduction in the company tax rate. He also said: Cutting the company income tax rate increases domestic productivity and domestic investment. More capital means higher productivity and economic growth and leads to more jobs and higher wages. That was in August 2011. As we know, the shadow Treasurer has written a book about this very topic, advocating in 2013 that cutting company taxes was 'a Labor thing'. Well, what a shame that we have seen this unprincipled reversal of Labor's position. If Labor were ever to be elected-and let's all keep our fingers and toes crossed that that never happens, for the sake of this nation-we know that that would drive more jobs offshore and drive our nation backwards. The member for Corio is a very close friend of the Leader of the Opposition; they work hand in hand in the same faction. It's very disappointing that the member for Corio did not counsel the Leader of the Opposition on this very regressive policy. I believe he's failed in his fundamental duty to put Geelong businesses and workers first. Not only has Labor committed to ripping the Turnbull government's personal income tax cuts away from nine million Australians; Labor has now made a commitment to hit 20,000 businesses, employing 1.5 million Australians, with a tax sledgehammer. This is really going to hurt many businesses in my region that I proudly represent-businesses like Cotton On, Viva Energy, Air Radiators and many others-who turn over more than $10 million. What I think Labor has failed to appreciate is that a turnover of $10 million does not represent a profit of $10 million. A company with a turnover of $10 million may be making a profit of just a few hundred thousand dollars. So, fundamentally, Labor has really missed the mark. Just half an hour ago, I was talking about Labor's plan to some businesspeople in my electorate who work in the surf industry in Torquay. Universally, they said: 'This is crazy stuff. This is absolutely crazy. Doesn't the Labor Party understand that cutting company tax puts us on a better footing to employ more people to grow our business and to grow the local economy?' Last year, of course, the Leader of the Opposition said, at a Business Council of Australia function, that he was going to declare war on business. That's a shocking proposition, and that's why the member for Grayndler has hit out so strongly against that principle. The Leader of the Opposition has declared war on business. It's got even worse today. It's very disappointing that the member for Corio has joined with the Leader of the Opposition in declaring war on so many successful Geelong and Corangamite businesses which employ hundreds and hundreds of people. I do condemn the member for Corio for the stance that he has taken, which is incredibly regrettable.  We are really, really proud of our policy to drive down the company tax rate for all companies across this nation to 25 per cent. If we don't do this, we won't be competitive on the global market. As the Treasurer has said and the Prime Minister has said today",200
236,Unknown,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Honourable members interjecting,202
237,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE," Order! The member is entitled to be heard in silence, so please show due professional respect and courtesy.",202
238,Ms HENDERSON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"We're incredibly proud of our focus on driving down company tax for all companies across this nation. Yes, there are certainly some issues with many companies. We know some companies, including the banks, have done the wrong thing. We have a very strong regime of laws of enforcement and penalties-criminal laws, in some cases-to hold to account any company in this nation which does the wrong thing, but we should not be using tax policy to do that. As the Treasurer said in question time today, already we have imposed a levy on the banks which is raising a couple of billion dollars a year, and that's important reform, along with the many other reforms that we have made in the banking and financial services sector. The member opposite referred to penalty rates. I think it's important to put on the record that the Labor Party, again, in a very unprincipled move, is now trying to unwind the Fair Work Commission-the very industrial relations system it put into place. We have seen the Leader of the Opposition, in another unprincipled move, reverse a position that he previously held very strongly. Perhaps the most alarming decision that has been made in relation to penalty rates is the infamous Cleanevent deal agreed to by the Leader of the Opposition in 2006, when workers were stripped of their penalty rates in a very grubby deal that the Leader of the Opposition didAn opposition member: It's called enterprise bargaining.",202
239,Ms HENDERSON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"oh, there's justification for it?-driving down the hourly rate for Cleanevent workers, without their knowledge, from $50 an hour to $18 an hour. The interjection from opposite was, 'That's enterprise bargaining.' No, that's not enterprise bargaining; that's wage theft. We've seen many other sleazy deals that unions have entered into, particularly the shoppies union. For instance, at MCDonald's, young people working weekends for three years would be $15,000 worse off compared to the award rate; at Big W, they would be some $13,400 worse off-both deals done by the SDA. At Woolworths they would be over $9,600 worse off, and at KC they would be over $13,000 worse off compared to the award. These are some of the sleazy deals that were done between the unions, endorsed by Labor. But, of course, as we know, the worse possible deal was done by the Leader of the Opposition himself, hitting some of the most vulnerable workers in our community, who, as I've made very clear, were not informed about what happened to their hourly rate of pay. I want to place on the record very strongly my pride in our government, which is standing up for workers, driving investment across the economy and driving down company tax. There was previous bipartisan agreement on this very important policy for our nation, and Labor has deserted this, like they've deserted their own industrial relations system that they set up. We now know that with the announcement today another 20,000 businesses, employing 1.5 million Australians, will be hit. I condemn Labor and again I reiterate my very strong support  and pride in our government for driving jobs growth and investment and the growth of this economy. Workplace Relations Veterans' Employment",202
240,Ms RISHWORTH,GRIEVANCE DEBATE," Before I get into the substance of this debate, I'm pleased to know and to hear from the members that in the Liberal Party they are now up for centralised wage fixing. Forget enterprise bargaining, forget anything but centralised, industry-wide wage fixing! I'm pleased to hear that the Liberal Party no longer has WorkChoices as an article of faith. The member for Corangamite may not have been here, but I was here when we were unpicking WorkChoices. The Liberal Party left us with zero industrial relations architecture. It was dog eat dog, and get what you can from your employer. We know that there are members of the IPA in the Liberal Party that say that there should be no minimum wage whatsoever. You should get for your labour what the company will actually assign to you. Quite frankly, these are crocodile tears coming from the member for Corangamite, when we know that it is an article of faith for the Liberal Party that they want to rip up centralised wage fixing and enterprise bargaining and have each employee go and beg for their wage-beg individually for what they can get and hope that it puts bread on the table. The Labor Party, as an article of faith, has believed in a minimum wage that is just, a wage that will put bread on the table for families. So it galls me significantly when I hear the Liberal Party, which ripped up the award system and the minimum wage-actually had the minimum wage set by not allowing unions, workers' representatives, to have their say, with a central panel that had to look only at the economy and not at workers. So, quite frankly, I will not accept a lecture from the Liberal Party on where workers are better off. Workers will always be better off under Labor, and big business will always be better off under the Liberal Party. Nothing they can say, no crocodile tears, will make us forget that their IPA friends and all the other conservative think tanks in the country don't want even to see a minimum wage. They just want to let the market rip when it comes to the labour market and be done with it. We are the force within Australian politics that will not let that happen. Back to the issues I would like to talk about. I rise to talk about an issue that is having significant impact on our veterans community and their loved ones. It is veterans' unemployment. Best estimates, and this may be news to the House, are that the total unemployment rate for our veterans five years after discharge is approximately 30 per cent. Those who did not medically discharge face a jobless rate that is still double the national average, at 11.3 per cent. This means that, of approximately 5,500 individuals who transition from Defence each year, one in three fail to find or maintain employment. And those who do find employment experience an average drop in their income of about 30 per cent; and 19 per cent are underemployed, in jobs beneath their capabilities. Our veterans are highly skilled potential employees with very desirable qualities and qualifications. Any workplace would be lucky to have such individuals. However, these statistics clearly demonstrate that their skills and abilities are not being acknowledged by civilian society. The skills and experience that they have are lost in translation. If we want veterans to know we value the sacrifice that they made in service to our country, we must do  better. We must ensure that veterans are best placed to move into employment post service and that businesses understand the many benefits of employing a veteran. The government has looked at this problem and developed the Prime Minister's Veterans' Employment Program. It's a program that established the Industry Advisory Committee on Veterans' Employment and the Prime Minister's Veterans' Employment Awards. We have welcomed that, but I must place on the record here that it didn't set any targets for employment or key performance indicators for success, and, according to the Department of Veterans' Affairs, there is no information on how many veterans have been placed or employed as a result of this program. In this year's budget, the government has committed another $4 million towards this program to continue the awards and to enable the advisory committee to establish a framework for business to publicly support the employment of veterans. However, I don't think that this is a full program that can properly tackle this very important issue. As I said, Labor continues to offer support for this program but does not believe it goes far enough. Roadblocks that see veterans' skills being lost in the translation from military life to civilian life, roadblocks that see veterans discounted before they get to the interview stage because they don't meet the tick-and-flick processes in HR departments and roadblocks that ultimately fail to recognise the many skills that ex-ADF members have and prevent businesses from benefiting from hiring a veteran are all roadblocks we must address. It's for this reason Labor have announced that, if elected, we will implement a $121 million veterans' employment program-a program that will ensure veterans' skills are not lost in translation and encourage businesses to employ veterans. Our policy has four elements. The first element targets businesses by providing training grants of up to $5,000 to address specific short-term skill gaps which may act as a barrier to employing otherwise suitable veterans. I've heard from veterans who've applied for hundreds of jobs and, in many cases, haven't got to the interview stage. This process is demoralising and doesn't value their skills. While there could be many reasons for this, I want to ensure that, if this is because a veteran might be one unit shy of a qualification or fails to meet, for example, the two years previous civilian experience-meaning they won't get through the process-they aren't immediately discounted. These grants are designed to overcome this barrier and get veterans a foot in the door. In addition, we will provide the industry advisory committee with funding to develop a national campaign which will highlight to employers the many skills that many former ADF members have. Second, we are going to establish an employment and transition service for transitioning members which will provide greater individualised and tailored support for veterans over a longer period. Staffed by qualified transition advisors who understand the unique skills of our ex-ADF personnel and how best to translate these skills for civilian employers, this service will work with individual veterans to identify career goals, audit the skills they've acquired over the course of their ADF career and ensure those skills obtain appropriate civilian recognition. They will also work with veterans to identify potential barriers to employment, such as housing, health and community support services. From speaking with veterans, I know that many leave the ADF with clear goals in mind, but they don't always work out. As such, this service will remain available for veterans to return to over a five-year period in case extra advice or support is needed.  Third, our plan will reduce the length of service required to access additional support through the career training and assistance scheme. Our plan brings a qualifying period for extra educational training assistance down from the current 12 years service to five years, and the top level of assistance down from 18 years to 15 years. Given our understanding that members serve on average 7½ years, this change will mean that the majority of those who leave the ADF will be able to access assistance. In addition, we plan to increase the amount of funding available to individuals to allow greater flexibility in the way transitioning members can use their funding, such as obtaining multiple qualifications. This is something that would have assisted Luke, a veteran I met in South Australia last year. Luke was eligible for the top tier of assistance through this program due to the fact that he'd been medically discharged. However, Defence would only pay for an entry level certificate, which was a certificate II in security operations. But for Luke to be competitive in this field, he needed both certificate II and certificate III. Under our changes, he would be able to obtain the higher certificate, ensuring he was best placed to gain employment. Finally, for the last part of our plan we want to work with states and territories and peak industry bodies to identify opportunities for greater automatic skill recognition. This plan we have put forward is a comprehensive plan that has been developed by listening to veterans around this country and hearing them, hearing their barriers and their struggles, and we want to ensure that they have the best opportunity. A job and employment, meaningful employment for our veterans, isn't just about a wage; it is about meaning and purpose and value. This is something they feel very strongly as part of the ADF and want to feel after discharge in civilian society. We hope the coalition will support our plan and, if elected, we will implement it.

241,Mr HOWARTH,GRIEVANCE DEBATE," Everyone in this House has a reason to be here, something that made us stand up to want to represent our local region and the people that live within it. Many people who have stood in this chamber, past and present, came here to make a difference. We might not all agree on the changes we each want to make, but it's the fact that we want to make change for the betterment of our community, which binds us together. I rise today to express my disappointment at the political, self-serving behaviour of Queensland health minister and member for Murrumba, Steven Miles. The state electorate of Murrumba encompasses a small pocket of my electorate, including Mango Hill. Last year during the state election, the member for Murrumba promised funding for a much-needed new high school in Mango Hill. This area is one of the fastest growing regions, and our local high schools are filling up quickly, with North Lakes State College, the high school, bursting at the seams. We've got Bounty Boulevard State School, with 1,400 children-the biggest state school in Queensland and North Lakes-and Mango Hill State School now has over 1,000 children. Parents need a solution as to where they can send their children to high school. If this school isn't built, the number of students at North Lakes State College would be unmanageable. That is why a high school at Mango Hill is essential. Our local families need access to high-quality education close to home. I was pleased that the state government did actually put some funding into this year's state budget towards the school. But locals received letters from the member for Murrumba inviting them to an information session to hear about the new school. I wasn't invited to  attend, but, as the federal member for the area, with the federal government obviously giving a lot of money to the state government for education, I thought I would go so I could also listen in and hear what was happening. I was interested to hear about the plans for this new high school. However, I was incredibly disappointed with the information session because it was a fact-free zone. It was very political, with Labor corflutes put out the front and all the way through the school before the parents came in, and not one new piece of information was given to the parents who gave up a couple of hours of their weekend on Saturday to attend. The state Labor government has committed to opening this school by 2020. But the problem is they still don't even have a site locked in. They presented a plan for model high schools around Queensland, telling parents what typically goes into a high school, but gave no definitive information about what classrooms or facility the Mango Hill high school would have. They didn't tell parents what the catchment would be, they didn't tell parents what the school values would be and they didn't tell parents what the transport options to the high school would be. Labor didn't tell parents anything, including the location. When a member of parliament sends out a letter to parents inviting them to come along and learn about a new school, it makes sense to expect to hear some information-something concrete about the plans or catchment, or even just the location. But the member for Murrumba followed the party line. He did what Labor often does: he overpromised and underdelivered. The information session wasn't anything of the sort. It was a political stunt, thought up as a way to try and win more votes. The member is playing politics with the education of local children and he has left local parents in limbo. Parents won't know if they'll be in the catchment area and won't know until a principal is appointed next year. We don't know if they'll take students just for year 7 or if they'll take them for years 8, 9 and 10, up to year 12. Will they be accepted? Mango Hill parents want answers, and the member for Murumba can't even tell them where the school that is due to open in 18 months time is even going to be located. So here's the thing: the government does have a preferred location, and it's the worse-kept secret in Mango Hill. Parents were raising the fact that the old goat farm in Mango Hill was a preferred location. We know the landholders are in legal communications about the location at the moment. Why not just be open and honest with those parents as to where the school is going and let them know? The school needs to be in the best place for locals and for their children. It needs to make sense for traffic flow and transport options, and the school needs facilities that locals need, not what the member for Murrumba thinks it needs. During the information session, it was made clear that no decisions would be made until a principal is supported. I was incredibly disappointed to hear that there were no definite plans for sporting facilities in the school design. They talked about possibilities, but nothing was confirmed. How can you know what you're building when you don't know the space you're working with? The one thing that was confirmed was that there would definitely be no swimming pool built, and our local area needs a swimming facility for our swim clubs and for students at this new high school. People overwhelmingly support the idea of a brand-new school, with a master plan being properly planned out. The state government has given authority to local councils to do with planning, to make sure where units are and to make sure there are places of worship, places for communities to  meet. In Griffin, North Lakes and Mango Hill, there are very few of those areas. We've already seen student numbers at the schools I mentioned before, like Mango Hill State School, Griffin State School, Bounty Boulevard State School and North Lakes State College, explode really quickly. When Griffin State School opened just a couple of years ago, it had 200 students. It's now up around 700 or 800. Student numbers at this high school, when it's opened, will explode quickly. This is a core state government responsibility. We need to make sure that it is properly planned, not just rushed out in 18 months with inadequate buildings and no school hall-a decent school hall that will hold at least a thousand students. If they build something smaller and rushed, we know that it won't be adequate for the future needs of the school. We need a proper master plan, with a large school hall, with proper STEM facilities for classrooms, with a swimming pool so the local Mango Hill swimming club can get established, and with a hall where local community groups can meet, and nothing less will be accepted. I say to the state member for Murrumba: stop thinking about yourself, stop thinking about how you can win more votes and start actually thinking about the children and parents of Mango Hill and the people relying on this school. It's so very important. The member for Murrumba has shown again and again that he's not listening to locals, with the federal government contributing $120 million for the on-ramps and off-ramps at Griffin; these are desperately needed. I've never seen a community so engaged with an issue. And what does the member for Murrumba come up with when we ask for a small contribution? A study. We don't need no study; we need the thing built. I've worked with a number of members for Murrumba. By far, this is the worse member for Murrumba that I've ever worked with. I've got five Labor state members in my area who I can work with, but not this guy. I say to the member for Murrumba: stop playing politics and start listening to your community. That's that best way to represent the area.",205
