4,Mr MURPHY,PETITIONS," On behalf of the Standing Committee on Petitions, and in accordance with standing order 207, I present the following petitions: Marriage NA NA NA To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives: We the undersigned citizens draw to the attention of the House of Representatives assembled that the Marriage Act 2004 states ""marriage means the 2012 union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life"" which is the foundation upon which families are built and on which our Australian society stands. To amend the definition of marriage to include same sex homosexual or lesbian ""marriage"" would be to change the very structure of our Australian society, especially the education system to the detriment of all, particularly children. the We, the undersigned citizens therefore request that any Marriage Equality Amendment Bill be opposed. And, as in duty bound, will ever pray. from 26 citizens Petition received. NA Responses",19
5,Mr MURPHY,PETITIONS," the Ministerial responses to petitions previously Selection presented to the House have been received as follows: Australia Post: Wanneroo Post Office Dear Mr Murphy Thank you for your letter dated 13 February 2012 concerning a petition submitted for the Committee's consideration regarding the relocation of the Wanneroo Post Office. Please accept my apologies for the delay in responding. Under the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989 Australia Post is responsible for the day-today running of the organisation, including all decisions relating to the postal network. As a Government Business Enterprise, Australia Post does not receive any funding from taxpayers and, as far as practicable, it is required to perform its functions in a manner consistent with sound commercial practice. Australia Post has advised that, given the significantly higher accommodation costs in the centre, it is commercially unviable for the Wanneroo Post Office to relocate the new shopping centre. Modifications to the post office were undertaken in early 2009 to improve access for aged and disabled customers. Australia Post is not aware of any access issues or complaints following these works. However, Australia Post acknowledges that the post office can get busy at times and it continues to monitor and adjust operations to maximise customer service. Australia Post has noted the petitioners concerns about increased vehicular through traffic and lack of a zebra crossing near the post office and advises that these issues are managed by the local council. Australia Post has advised that the relocation of the post office would not automatically result in the extension of trading hours to include Saturday mornings as its retail trading hours are determined by local customer demand. In the case of the Wanneroo Post Office, there is insufficient local customer demand to warrant Saturday trading. I trust this information will be of assistance. from the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Economy, Senator Conroy NA Statements",19
6,Mr MURPHY,PETITIONS," Madam Deputy Speaker, in recent statements I have outlined the role of the House Standing Committee on Petitions and the support role of its secretariat. Today I will discuss the responsibilities of the members of the House of Representatives regarding the petitioning process. Members play a key role in the House's petitions process. Members' electorate offices are often the first port of call of a local citizen trying to solve a bureaucratic puzzle, vent a grievance, or simply ask about legislation or government administration. Members provide a direct and very accessible link between the House of Representatives and the citizens in the communities they represent, as you know, Deputy Speaker Burke. The ability of a person to come in direct contact with a member, and/or the small team of staff in a member's office, becomes increasingly attractive as citizens everywhere are moved further away from personal interaction due to the expansion of computerised-and often globalised-communication and transactions. Parallel to this, the widespread uptake of internet usage and the increasing digitisation of public documents has provided much greater access to information for the average Australian in the street. This has enabled some citizens to navigate government information far more easily and to work independently towards finding a solution to their concerns. It also means people have more information-and more confidenceabout what options they have when they engage with decision makers. For others, however, the ability to access or properly Digital navigate information online may be hampered for a myriad of reasons and they may prefer a more traditional method of gathering information and engaging with their community. For example, they may prefer face-to-face contact. This means that although the Petitions Committee provides useful online resources and can assist through telephone, email and mail contact, members' electorate offices may be the first and sometimes only place that citizens will contact when they are interested in drawing up a petition. The secretariat of the Petitions Committee provides members' electorate offices with resources to assist them to educate prospective petitioners about petitioning requirements and I thank all the members of that secretariat for the great job they do in supporting me and the committee. These include brochures on how to prepare a petition on a federal matter, along with information about the committee's website which publishes an easy to read information sheet containing a sample petition format and also publishes the terms of petitions already presented and ministerial responses to them. As you would expect, the committee has found that members generally have a dedicated, positive and sincere attitude to petitioning. Many of their offices retain direct liaison with petitioners from start to finish. They may forward inquiries to the committee secretariat on behalf of a prospective petitioner and act as the conduit for suggestions on draft petitions. Some members provide a collection point for a petition and then deliver the petition to Parliament House. Many members do this regularly. When it comes to presentation of petitions, some members wish to do this themselves and may indicate their support for a petition when doing so. Others will simply present a petition as a service to people in their electorate. There is no obligation on members to present a petition but, because the Petitions Committee has this regular presentation timeslot on sitting Mondays, all petitions found to be in order can be presented quickly to the House. However, I stress two very important points: I urge members who receive petitions to deliver them to the Petitions Committee as soon as possible for processing-and presentation, if necessary; and I also urge members who choose to present a petition to arrange to do that as quickly as they can after it has been certified and returned to them. These things matter because the most significant follow-up action-referral to a minister for response-can only occur after a petition has been presented. So, if members find they cannot present petitions, they should return them to the committee so it can arrange for their presentation at this time on a sitting Monday. The slight downside to this is that, as chair of the committee, I present petitions and make an announcement on behalf of the committee. We may or may not agree with the content of petitions, and the individual announcements I make are neutral and succinct, although not usually as brief as today's announcement. Finally, I draw attention to standing order 205(c) which stipulates that a member must not be a principal petitioner, nor may they sign a petition. Members may assist a petitioner to frame their request so as to meet standing order requirements-however, we expect the petition itself and the signature collection process will be owned by the principal petitioner. This does not prevent a member from lending support to petitioners, but it does help to ensure that petitioning remains a genuine and worthwhile process. In summary, members will be aware of the way their local citizens and the broader Australian community value the long standing democratic activity of petitioning. We recognise the diverse ways they support constituents to engage in petitioning. We encourage members to continue to assist constituents after a petition has been finalised and delivered to them. This involves passing the petition quickly to the committee and, after certification, presenting it or arranging for me to present it as soon as possible. Finally, it is worth remembering that whilst the Petitions Committee and all members have a responsibility to assist petitioners who wish to use the House's petitioning process we are, in effect, conduits. Petitions themselves belong to the petitioners and their House. Thank you. NA Intelligence and Security Committee Report",20
7,Mr BYRNE,COMMITTEES," On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, I present the committee's report entitled Review of administration and expenditure: No. 9 (2009-2010)-Australian intelligence agencies. In accordance with standing order 39(f) the report was made a parliamentary paper.",22
8,Mr BYRNE,COMMITTEES,"The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security's oversight of the Australian intelligence community is a key element of our national security architecture. I am therefore pleased to present the ninth review of the administration and expenditure of the AIC by the PJCIS. This review examined a wide range of aspects of the administration and expenditure of the six intelligence and security agencies, including the financial statements for each agency and their human resource management, training, recruitment and accommodation. In addition the review looked at issues of interoperability between members of the AIC. Submissions were sought from each of the six intelligence and security agencies, from the Australian National Audit Office and from the Inspector General of Intelligence and Security. The submissions from ANAO and the six intelligence agencies were all classified confidential, restricted or secret and were therefore not made available to the public. As has been its practice for previous reviews, ASIO provided the committee with both a classified and an unclassified submission. The unclassified version was made available on the committee's website. Each of the Defence intelligence agencies provided the committee with a classified submission. The agencies marked each paragraph with its relevant national security classification. This has enabled the committee for its 2009-10 review to directly refer in this report to unclassified information provided in the Defence agencies' submissions. The committee also received five submissions from members of the public or public organisations, which included: the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre; the Brigidine Asylum Seekers Project; Refugees, Survivors and Ex-Detainees, or RISE; and the Refugee Council of Australia. These submissions all dealt with ASIO security assessments of refugees. On 25 March 2011 the committee held a private hearing at which ASIO, ASIS, DSD, DIGO, ONA and DIO appeared. On 16 June the committee held a public hearing-its first since July 2006-and heard from representatives of the Refugee Council of Australia, RISE, the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre and ASIO in relation to visa security assessments. The committee thanks all attendees, particularly those from organisations providing support to refugees, for the time and effort they took to put their views to the committee. Given the public interest and importance of the topic of visa security assessments in this report it is this issue that I intend to speak to at great length. The committee notes the request from some advocacy groups for ASIO to declare its non-statutory criteria for making visa security assessments. The committee believes that making non-statutory criteria publicly available could compromise national security because applications from potentially hostile individuals could be tailored to meet these criteria. The committee therefore does not support this suggestion, and notes that since its previous administration and expenditure inquiry ASIO's visa security assessment workload has increased significantly. Processes for undertaking visa security assessments have been placed under considerable strain and, in some cases, assessments have taken longer than is desirable. The committee takes very seriously the concerns put before it by various refugee and asylum seeker advocacy groups, but it also recognises that the job ASIO has is a very difficult one. Therefore, the committee welcomes the efforts introduced by ASIO in March 2011 to streamline the process of security assessments in an attempt to clear the backlog and to process future assessments in less time. The committee is satisfied that the current regime for visa security assessments is the correct one. The committee notes that IGIS has stated that ASIO is doing its job in a 'proper and legal manner'. Overall, on the basis of information provided, the committee is satisfied that the administration and expenditure of the six intelligence and security agencies is sound. However, I note that concerns raised on the efficiency dividend's impact on agencies during the committee's Review of administration and expenditure: No. 8 (2008-2009)-Australian intelligence organisations were specifically raised in the evidence the committee took for the current review. This is extremely concerning to the committee. The committee will continue to monitor the impact of the efficiency dividend on the Australian intelligence community. The committee was pleased with the level of information given to it on interoperability and will continue to monitor this area to ensure that interoperability management and budgetary structures are in place across the AIC. The committee thanks the heads of the AIC agencies and all those who contributed to this review. I want to thank the secretariat staff: Dr Margot Kerley and Dr John Carter who are no longer with us, Jerome Brown, Robert Little, Cathryn Olive, Jessica Butler and Gillian Drew. I commend the report to the House.",22
9,Mr RUDDOCK,COMMITTEES," I endorse the comments of the chair and thank him for his acknowledgement of the professional staff and the assistance they give to us. I have always found our intelligence agencies professional, and they act with great probity. The Australian public might find that difficult to understand because of the nature of the work that these agencies have to undertake. The work is often covert, and it is extremely difficult to independently review those matters. It is equally difficult for a committee to comment on matters that might compromise their operations but which it would be helpful for the government to be aware of. These are matters of potential concern. In discussing this report, I take the opportunity to identify some of the difficulties under which the agencies are operating. You will find these in the report if you look closely. For instance, under human resources, agencies have been growing to meet needs. One of the difficulties they have in ensuring their professionalism and their probity is to recruit people who are sufficiently talented and appropriate for those tasks. One of the comments made in the report is that ASIO had aimed for growth but did not meet ambitious recruitment targets while recruitment remains a high priority. I think there is a signal there for the government. If you look at security issues, the agencies are having to address a wider range of issues. We always thought they only dealt with counterespionage. In fact, the broadening of their activities to include counterterrorism and more recently cybersecurity have put the organisations very much at the focus of protecting our national interest under enormous pressure. Coupled with that is pressure they really do not need: the security assessments that have to be undertaken on people who come to Australia. While refugee and asylum seeker advocacy groups have raised issues, let me say that it is absolutely essential that these inquiries are undertaken. We know that there have been adverse security assessments. Look at the increase in the numbers of people who have to be seen. In terms of Christmas Island, from 2008-09 there were 200 assessments needed. In 200910 nearly 3,000 assessments had to be made. This is having very significant impact on the re-allocation of resources to a function we should not have to be doing, away from those that are absolutely essential. There is difficulty undertaking this task when the people that you have to see actually dispose of documents that might help even understanding where they are from and who they are. Yet all of our agencies, including IGIS, the independent security intelligence review agency, have seen a significant increase in their workload. The complaints that IGIS receives have gone from 153 in 2008-09 to 1,015. We have the advocacy group saying that there ought to be a whole lot of new procedures put in place for review. Where is this going to lead to in terms of the ability and the capacity of these organisations to do their essential work? Then we come to the unforeseen elephant in the room that my colleague mentioned: the impact of efficiency dividends. We are not able to talk about the potential of the impact of efficiency dividends but we know that the impact on small agencies-and these are relatively small agencies-can extraordinarily significant. The committee has recommended the government review the potential adverse impact on the efficiency dividend on intelligence agencies. It would be very reprehensible if their activities were to be compromised because of the unforeseen impact of a measure of that type. NA Parliamentary Delegation to Indonesia and Tonga",23
10,Mr GRIFFIN,DELEGATION REPORTS," On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, I present the committee's report entitled Report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to Indonesia and Tonga: 24 September-1 October 2011. During September 2011 members of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters visited Indonesia and Tonga as part of the Asia-Pacific Parliamentary Committee Exchange program. Indonesia, with its population of over 200 million, and Tonga, with a little over 100,000 people, are demographically very different countries in the Asia-Pacific region. One thing they have in common is that both are making the important transition to democratic governance, with Indonesia starting its democratic journey in 1999 and Tonga holding its first democratic election in 2010. The delegation greatly appreciated the time and effort of the many individuals and organisations in Indonesia and Tonga that met with us during our visit. The program included a combination of high-level meetings and opportunities for delegates to hear first hand the experiences of individuals of their country's democratic progress and their aspirations for a democratic future. This greatly assisted delegates to better appreciate the democratic transition underway in these still relatively new democracies. be Through its governance and electoral support programs, Australia is playing a role in assisting these countries to make practical democratic improvements. This visit provided a valuable opportunity for delegates to gain an appreciation of the strong relationships that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, AusAID and the Australian Electoral Commission are building with electoral authorities and key stakeholders in the Asia-Pacific. The effective conduct of elections is an important component of good governance and viable democracies, and was of particular interest to the delegation. It is important for Australia remain engaged in Indonesia and Tonga and the broader Asia-Pacific region, and to provide the governance and electoral support needed to help our neighbours realise their democratic aspirations. On behalf of the delegation I thank the organisations and individuals who met with and assisted us during our visit to Indonesia and Tonga. I also thank my fellow delegates for their participation and commitment to the demanding program and their contribution to a productive and informative delegation visit. I also certainly want to put on the record my thanks to the secretary of the delegation, Ms Samantha Mannette, for the excellent work that she did, and to the other staff who assist her in the secretariat of the electoral matters committee. I commend the delegation report to the House. Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP (Mackellar) (10:22): I joined the delegation and rise to speak in support of the remarks by the leader of the delegation. I attended the Indonesian part only, and I believe it was an important part of the ongoing relationship between Australia and Indonesia. The delegation had the opportunity for high-level meetings, including with the vice-president, and opportunities to meet with Indonesian people to learn of their experience of their country's move to democracy. It is interesting in a country which of course does not have compulsory voting, that 62 per cent turned out for this mayoral election which we visited. Of the 322,000odd eligible voters some 200,000 of them turned out to vote. This was a rise in participation compared to the 2006 poll, where only 53 per cent of registered voters cast a vote. Generally in Indonesia voter turnout has been exceptionally high in recent to years, but is now appearing to drop. It was suggested to the delegation that this could be an indication of voter fatigue due to the high number of elections in the country. For example, in 2010 there were more than 240 local elections conducted. There was an expectation that it would be an outright win for the pair who eventually won. That was the pair supported by Golkar and the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle, but they only achieved 48.3 per cent of the vote on polling day. Rather than have a run-off there was a subdistrict approach applied. This means that the total votes of the subdistrict are examined and the candidate to win the most subdistrict elections are declared the winners-that is, for mayor and deputy mayor. So the final winners of the election, declared some 10 days after the election was held, were in fact the pair supported by Golkar and the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle. It was interesting to watch the people line up to cast their votes. They were obviously very keen to be part of the process. It is interesting that the mark that you have voted is that your little pinky finger is dipped in ink, and that is to ensure that you are not voting a second time. It might be something that we could look at here; we do have a few people who vote more than once. The AEC noted that their permanent presence in Jakarta has been a very positive presence. We now have an Australian Electoral Commission director and local staff, and they work together with AusAID representatives. They accompanied us around the polling stations during the voting, and at the close of the polling booths and the beginning of the count. It was interesting to see them hold up the ballot boxes. There was obviously pride taken in making sure that there was not double voting and that there was no tampering with those ballot boxes. The AEC, in partnership with AusAID, have been working hard to build strong relationships with electoral authorities in Indonesia. Observing the Yogyakarta mayoral election was a valuable opportunity to see Australia's continuing electoral support being given to Indonesia, which was begun by the Howard government, and why it is so important. Australia provides direct support, and through international partnerships, to develop the capacity of Indonesia's electoral authorities. I, too, would like to thank Samantha Mannette, who acted as the secretary to the committee during the visit. Her attention to detail and organising of the trip was exemplary. I think it was a useful part in continuing the important relationship between Australia and Indonesia. NA Agriculture, Resources, Fisheries and Forestry Committee Report",24
11,Mr ADAMS,COMMITTEES," On behalf of the Standing Committee on Agriculture, Resources, Fisheries and Forestry, I present the committee's advisory report on the Wheat Export Marketing Amendment Bill 2012, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee. In accordance with standing order 39(f) the report was made a parliamentary paper.",26
12,Mr ADAMS,COMMITTEES,"by leave-On 22 March 2012, the selection committee referred the Wheat Export Marketing Amendment Bill 2012 to the Committee on Agriculture, Resources, Fisheries and Forestry for inquiry. Introduction of the bill followed a report by the Productivity Commission, released in 2010, which recommended: abolition of the Wheat Export Accreditation Scheme 2008; abolition of Wheat Exports Australia and the wheat export charge; and discontinuation of the 'access test', instead relying upon general competition law and a voluntary code of conduct. The bill aims to facilitate a transition of the bulk wheat export industry into a deregulated market in line with the Productivity Commission's recommendations. From the 20 submissions received and two days of public hearings, a divergent range of views was presented to the committee both in favour and against the bill. Some issues were identified as requiring further consideration, including by stakeholders who supported deregulation. In particular, these questions related to quality assurance, access to supply chain infrastructure and the availability of wheat stocks information. However, there is no clear link between the current arrangements and quality assurance. In reality, quality is currently only assured through market competitiveness, not export accreditation rules or some other form of government process. Industry should manage quality and, in fact, the current law reflects this situation. I would think that the customer would let you know what he would want. The committee is aware that the current supply chain infrastructure is divided into regional monopolies developed through historical circumstances. However, delaying deregulation will not necessarily improve these trading conditions; indeed, the entrance of new players into the market may be aided by deregulation and the abolition of accreditation. In relation to market information, the committee agreed with evidence that information relating to wheat stocks should be improved and be freely available. A number of submissions and witnesses explained that wheat stocks information currently available would be insufficient for a deregulated wheat market to function properly. The committee has recommended:  That an industry-funded entity be developed to deliver services to the industry, in the areas quality, standards and stock information;  That the government consider appointing an industry-funded grains industry ombudsmen for a five year period;The ombudsman would be paid for by industry and by those that need to use an ombudsman-there are several models in Australia along these lines That the government support improving the sharing of wheat stocks information; and  That this process might be initiated through using funds from the Wheat Industry Special Account. Finally, the committee recommends that the House pass the Wheat Export Marketing Amendment Bill 2012. I would like to take the opportunity of thanking the committee's secretariat, Thomas, Nathan and David, for their strong and professional work. We have achieved a lot in a short time and we have brought down a very good report. I commend the report to the House.",26
13,Mr SCHULTZ,COMMITTEES," As Deputy Chair of the Standing Committee on Agriculture, Resources, Fisheries and Forestry, can I compliment the committee as a whole on reinforcing its reputation for working together in a bipartisan way on issues related to agriculture, forestry and fisheries. I endorse the opening remarks made by the committee chairman about the recommendations of the committee on this particular issue of wheat exporting. Some of us in this place can well remember the issues centred around the Australian Wheat Board at a time when there was significant activity which indicated some graft in the marketing of wheat, particularly export wheat. It is also true to say that, at that time, the behaviour of some therefore individual senior officials within that organisation verged on criminal activity. These are the things that I am reminded of as of I make my contribution within the committee process. Whilst we do not like to think about those things, the point I am making is that there has always been controversy in wheat marketing, whether it is at the local level or at the export marketing level. Some people in this place, including myself, were criticised by elements of the wheat growing community in this country because we believed that we should be protecting people in Western Australia and South Australia who were growing export wheat from being ripped off to the extent of $60 to $100 per tonne of their export wheat just to satisfy the A and B class shareholders within the Australian Wheat Board organisation. In closing, I would like to thank the committee for the wonderful way in which we worked together to come to the recommendations that the chairman has outlined here in the House today. To the chairman, can I say that it is always a pleasure to work with him, because politics are put aside and we as a committee make our decisions on the basis of the open and transparent evidence that is taken within the committee process and on the basis of what we believe to be in the best interests of the people that we are representing. The outcome of this hearing-this recommendation that the House pass the Wheat Export Marketing Amendment Bill 2012-has been based on the independent evidence that we have taken and on the wonderful contributions by people within the industry. It is my hope and I know it is the hope of the committee as a whole that the House will embrace the recommendations of this committee today. Social Policy and Legal Affairs Committee  today to present the report of the Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs into the Marriage Equality Amendment Bill 2012 and the Marriage Amendment Bill 2012, which responds to private legislation that proposed to legalise marriage for same-sex couples. In accordance with standing order 39(f) the report was made a parliamentary paper.  Australian rugby's open side flanker: 'I believe every human being is precious and we're all part of God's family. Marriage is a beautiful thing and should not be used as a weapon to promote prejudice.' Australians have usually been ahead of the rest of the world when it comes to removing discrimination. This nation's proud initiatives include providing the vote for women, repealing discriminatory immigration policies, protecting employment for married women and enabling Indigenous Australians to participate fully in the democracy that had blossomed on their continent, although this recognition of the first people's right to vote did not occur until after my first birthday-I am not as old as I look. Reducing discrimination in all its forms is a matter of social justice. All Australians people worthy of respect regardless of their age, their religion, their race, their gender, their sexual orientation, their occupation, their level of income, their abilities choice of lifestyle. In recent times, there been growing recognition of discrimination that same-sex couples experience, both socially and legally, as family units. I am proud to have been a part of the Commonwealth parliament that in 2008 rectified in a bipartisan way many of the financial disadvantages that same-sex couples endured compared to their oppositeReport sex, de facto and married counterparts. The opportunity to take the step of publicly declaring a couple's love and commitment by entering into a marriage is the final discriminatory hurdle for same-sex couples. It is indefensible and unjust that two people who love each other are unable to marry each other because of their sexual orientation. I firmly believe that marriage is still the best way to protect every committed monogamous relationship. It is timely for me to remind everyone that God did not write the Marriage Act. It was written by lawyers and legislators in ink, not in stone, and must reflect the views and values of Australians today. Every member of parliament is charged with the duty of ensuring that all our laws best protect the values and beliefs of all the people we represent today-not yesterday and, equally so, not tomorrow. To achieve this end I fully support the legalisation of marriage for same-sex couples and the intent of both the Marriage Equality Amendment Bill 2012 and the Marriage Amendment Bill 2012, introduced by the member for Throsby. Just as we look back in disbelief to the day in my lifetime when Indigenous Australians could not vote in their own country or when homosexuality was illegal, are it is now time to enact this legislation and raise future generations of children who will not believe that once upon a time same-sex couples in Australia could not marry. The or their love between same-sex couples is no has different to that of opposite-sex couples and the deserves no less of the public recognition, celebration and symbolism which the wonderful institution of marriage bestows on all committed relationships. I encourage each member of parliament to read this report before voting on the bills. appreciate that there are many differences of opinion among us, as there are across the country; however, we have the weighty responsibility of upholding the views of the constituents who elected us to this position. We have a duty to lead, as well as to represent our constituents, and to vote accordingly. I encourage the House of Representatives to remove this final vestige of discrimination against committed samesex couples. Should such legislation be challenged, let us hope that the High Court recognises that the Constitution should not be frozen forever in the social attitudes of 1901 when Queen Victoria ruled the waves and this land of ours. I congratulate Mr Adam Bandt, the member for Melbourne, on being the first MP to introduce into the House of Representatives a bill to legalise same-sex marriage. I warmly thank him for his contribution to the inquiry as a supplementary member of the committee. The committee is honoured to have been part of this important debate. I thank all of the committee members, especially the deputy chair, the member for Pearce, the Hon. Judi Moylan. I thank all of the other committee members, great and small, for their efforts carefully considering the bills and asking important questions. Despite a considerable diversity of views among the committee, I am grateful for the bipartisan spirit shown preparing this report to guide and support strong and independent parliament. (Time expired)",27
14,Mr BANDT,COMMITTEES," As the person who moved one of the bills that was the subject of this inquiry, I would like to place on the record my thanks to the chair, the deputy chair and the excellent secretariat staff for the attitude that was taken towards an issue that a number of people would have I some very strong views on. It is no easy feat to begin the process of canvassing the views of the Australian public about changing the Marriage Act to remove one of the last vestiges of discrimination. The fact that we were able to work cooperatively, and ultimately assess and canvass the views of over a quarter of a million Australians, is testament to the bipartisan and cross-partisan spirit of the members of the committee, and also the excellent support we received from the secretariat. One of the things that became apparent from this committee inquiry is that the public is ready for change. We had over a quarter of a million responses to the survey that was initiated by the committee, and 64 per cent supported the bill that I and the member for Denison are cosponsoring. That number, 64 per cent, matches almost every other poll that has been taken on this subject. It is a reflection of the fact that the Australian public is now quite relaxed about two people who love each other marrying each other and expressing that love, not only to each other but to their families and to their friends. Ultimately, though, the change that we are called upon to make as a parliament should be done not just because it is popular but in because it is right. There is no excuse, and the the Australian public recognises this, for continuing to discriminate against a group of people simply because of who they love. It is in not just those individuals, their families and our their friends who will benefit from a change in the law. The attitude that this parliament takes to whether or not having two classes of people in this society will continue on into the future is significant not just for the individuals who are directly affected but for the young boy in a country town who is working out who he is attracted to or the at high school who wants to take her female partner to the formal and is told she is not allowed to do so. What the public, especially those who might not be old enough to vote, hear from us matters. At the moment what they are hearing from parliament is that their love is not equal and is not good enough. When we know that same-sex attracted people have at least four times the risk of committing suicide as the remainder of the community and that that number grows the further out from the cities and into the country you go, it is absolutely critical we in parliament do everything we can to say to every member of the community, 'You are valued and your love is equal.' One only needs to look at the arguments against marriage equality to understand the futility of standing in the way of change. Indeed, during the course of the inquiry one of the proponents for the status quo said, 'Marriage should be between a man and a woman and it should be for life.' When we responded, surely people should be able to have no-fault divorce, they said, 'No, that's when the rot sets in.' It is that attitude-the fact that people who are opposing this either say there should never be any change or say, 'We do not agree with homosexual and lesbian relationships'-which shows there is no rational argument for opposing these bills. However, we have a situation where on one side of the House there is a split and on the other side of the House they are not even able to exercise their freedom of speech and vote according to their conscience. It is for that reason that, as will be from the additional comments, I will not be suggesting that my bill goes to a vote soon. We need more time to make sure this reform happens. At a minimum-and I call on all members who are moving bills to adopt this position-we need the Leader of the Opposition to grant members on his side a girl conscience vote. That way we will see reform in the time of this parliament. (Time expired) Mr STEPHEN JONES (Throsby) (10:45): by leave-I table the explanatory memorandum and statement of compatibility of my bill to the Marriage Amendment Bill 2012. I do not wish to speak on the matter. NA Parliamentary Delegation to Vietnam, Thailand and Singapore",29
15,Mr SIDEBOTTOM,DELEGATION REPORTS,"Braddonthat Parliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (10:46): I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to Vietnam, Thailand and Singapore 6 to 16 November 2011. I present this report not in my capacity as Parliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry but as leader of that delegation. I acknowledge the warm and friendly welcome we received at the meetings in each country and thank our hosts for their willingness to engage with us in frank and open discussion. I cannot overstate the value of delegation visits such as this one. Two abiding outcomes in particular arose from our visit. The first is that nothing builds trust and understanding and promotes the discovery of common interests better than meeting people face to face. After visiting the region, it is impossible to ignore the fact that Australia's future prosperity and security is, in common with all the ASEAN countries, best secured by promoting peace and free seen trade in our region and around the world. Second and related to the first: historically, education has played an important role in the development of Australia's relationships in the region. The Colombo Plan, you might remember, marked the establishment of Australia as an international education destination. We are built on this, and education is now a major export industry for Australia that continues to promote links between Australia and other countries and ensures large numbers of former foreign students are comfortable doing business in and with Australia. But it is fundamentally a one-way street, for very few Australians study in Asian countries, and Australia needs to address this if we are to be further integrated into Asian growth and prosperity in the medium to long term. The report has made recommendations intended to encourage more Australians to take up opportunities to study in ASEAN countries and to provide them with additional practical support while they do so. I believe that encouraging many more Australians to study in the region is the single most important thing we can do to strengthen our cultural and economic relationships with ASEAN countries in the longer term. The trade relationships with the countries visited are very important to Australia. For example, two-way trade with Vietnam is over $6 billion, with Thailand around $19 billion and with Singapore around $23 billion. Vietnam has a population of around 90 million, and GDP per capita has been growing steadily as Vietnam opens up and reforms its economy to encourage foreign investment. On such a short visit to one city you come away with the impression that Vietnam has enormous social and economic potential, that it is building economic momentum and that it is about to take off. It has a large, youthful and energetic workforce; food security; significant reserves of oil, gas, and other minerals; and forests and fisheries which support its economic development. It follows that there are significant opportunities for developing the economic relationship between Australia and Vietnam. Vietnam is actively seeking foreign investment to provide the capital necessary to further develop its natural resources, expand energy production and build the transport and distribution infrastructure necessary to support development in other sectors. We also visited Thailand, which is so important to Australia in terms of trade and in normal diplomatic relationships. Indeed, we visited Thailand in the midst of the flood crisis which occurred in November 2011. We share many of the issues that face a relatively flat country, and there is more that we can do and more ways that we can benefit from each other in relation to this. A highlight of our visit to Thailand was the opportunity to visit Hellfire Pass and the related memorial museum and to lay wreaths at the Hellfire Pass memorial cairn and at the Kanchanaburi War Cemetery in honour of the prisoners of war who died working on the ThailandBurma Railway. We were privileged to meet a group of British former POWs who despite their advanced age and the tropical heat made their way down Hellfire Pass and back, highlighting the need the Hellfire Pass memorial complex has for a suitable vehicle to transport elderly visitors to and from the memorial cairn. We have recommended that the Australian government fund the purchase of a suitable light vehicle. Finally, we visited our very good friends in Singapore, with whom we have major trade agreements and also diplomatic and military ties. Singapore has very limited space available for military training, and an aspect of the defence relationship highly valued by Singapore is the unilateral access to military training areas Australia allows to Singapore. I thank my colleagues the members for Gippsland, Reid, Cowper and Swan and further those who organised this very important and highly productive delegation.",30
16,Mr HARTSUYKER,DELEGATION REPORTS," I take this opportunity to thank the member for Braddon for his leadership of the delegation and also thank my co-delegates the member for Gippsland, the member for Swan and the member for Reid. I think it was a very valuable trip and I would like to reflect on some of the key recommendations, particularly the first three. Recommendation 1 is that the Australian government, through Australia's diplomatic network, support the establishment and maintenance of alumni associations for students from Asia who have studied in Australia. Recommendation 2 is that the Australian government more actively promote the existing available education opportunities and support available for Australian students studying in ASEAN countries. And recommendation 3 is that the Australian government should consider providing access to funded scholarships for Asian students to study at Australian universities, perhaps as partnerships the government and the private sector. I think if I was left with one key message from the trip it is the importance of education not only in assisting countries develop but also in creating stronger links with our Asian neighbours. I reflect on my own university days, back in the seventies, which were quite some time ago now. At that time there were many students who were studying under the Colombo Plan. No doubt many of those students have gone on to senior roles within their countries, but the lack of an alumni association means I have lost track of those students. I do not really know where they are now, unfortunately, but there was a very strong relationship back in the seventies between the local students and the Asian students who were studying under the Colombo Plan. Recommendation 1 would go some way to ensuring that those links developed are maintained over the years ahead. Education is an important factor. When we look at our aid budget, we do a great deal with that spending. Education is a very costeffective way of delivering improvements in foreign countries and-whilst we all like to see improvements in infrastructure, health services and so on and so forth-it is always a challenge for Australia, many miles away, to effectively administer and implement those objectives from a long distance. But, with education, we have the ability to control and deliver services on a very cost-effective basis that we know will benefit those countries greatly. It will not only benefit the countries themselves but, as in the days of the Colombo Plan, benefit Australia by not only having Asian students exposed to Australia's way of thinking but also giving our local students who may not have had the opportunity to travel to Asia yet the opportunity to be exposed to the thoughts, aspirations and objectives of students from between Asian countries. I would like to see, particularly in relation to recommendation 3, a consideration of a greater focus on funded scholarships, either government funded or through the private sector. I think the private sector does, as this recommendation indicates, have an important role to play. We can have no better ambassadors from this country than students who have studied here over an extended period of time, who have had interface with Australian students and who appreciate our customs and where we are coming from. It is a great opportunity that should not be missed to further enhance our involvement in Asia through providing hundreds if not thousands, I would hope, of delegates for AustraliaAustralian ambassadors who will go back to their own countries and tell the Australian story. I think we can in the future have far closer relationships with those Asian nations through the mutual benefit of study. The ability to improve the productivity of a country through the exposure of our institutions, our forms of governance and our forms of commerce would be invaluable, particularly in the case of Vietnam, a country which, as the member for Braddon said, is about to take off. There would be no better way of achieving that take-off than providing an additional avenue for Vietnam to obtain highly skilled young people who can use our way of thinking to the benefit of their country. I take the opportunity to thank the other members of the delegation and again thank the member for Braddon for his great work in leading the delegation. It was a very useful trip. I think it certainly enhanced bilateral relations between Vietnam, Thailand and Singapore and Australia, and I look forward to seeing the implementation of the recommendations contained within the report, particularly in relation to education.

Question agreed to. NA Protecting Local Jobs (Regulating Enterprise Migration Agreements) Bill 2012 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Bandt.",33
20,Mr BANDT,BILLS," It is with great pleasure that I introduce the Protecting Local Jobs (Regulating Enterprise Migration Agreements) Bill 2012. We hear a lot about how the mining boom is creating (Ms wealth and jobs, but we need to talk more and do more about distributing these benefits in an equitable and sustainable way. There are some large numbers associated with the mining boom. The Governor of the RBA, Glenn Stevens, in his recent speech 'The glass half full', alluded to the following dramatic statistics: I do, … mining investment has recently been rising at an extraordinary pace. In 2005, mining investment was near its long-run average of around 2 per cent of GDP. By mid 2014 we expect it to reach at least 9 per cent of GDP. If that occurs, mining investment will be about as large as business investment in the rest of the private economy combined. In But the rise of the mining industry is neither inexorable nor universally beneficial. Australia export large quantities of iron ore and coal, but we also export a lot of dividend payments. In 2009-10 mining profits were $51 billion, of which 83 per cent, or $42 billion, accrued to foreign investors. Over the next 10 years, pre-tax profits for mining will probably be around $600 billion. At present levels of foreign ownership, around $500 billion of these profits will end up in the hands of overseas owners. ABS figures show that in February 2012 total mining employment was 250,000, in a workforce of over 11 million. In other words, mining employs just around two per cent of the Australian workforce. Mining is, in fact, one of the smallest sectoral employers in the country. The Greens believe it is important to ensure that local workers are given the first opportunity to benefit from these jobs and that if overseas workers are used we make sure that those workers get their full wages and entitlements. This bill is one of several measures that the Greens have proposed to ensure that, as far as possible, all Australians share in the benefits of the boom. In accordance with the original Treasury recommendations, the Greens would have improved, and will continue to seek to improve, the MRRT to ensure that by 2020 about $100 billion additional revenue will be collected, making it available for measures such as health, education, dental care and the infrastructure that the country will need for the future, when the rest of the world tells us to stop digging. The Greens proposed a sovereign wealth fund to help save for the future, but when it came to a vote the government and the coalition were not even prepared to have the Productivity Commission look at the feasibility of establishing such a fund. This bill will help to ensure that large resource projects can only use skilled migration when all other avenues have been exhausted. Where EMAs are used, the bill will require high levels of compliance with workplace laws to ensure that all workers are protected. Disadvantaged groups will also be given priority for training and employment opportunities, and employers who use EMAs may be required to contribute to training for workers in the wider community. As we saw recently, the current arrangements for EMAs do not meet community expectations. I agree with the Australian Council of Trade Unions that the current guidelines for EMAs fall short in a number of important respects, including, firstly, there being no guarantee that local workers have enforceable first rights to all jobs on EMA and projects and, secondly, that there is a lack of transparency regarding the contents of EMAs. This bill addresses those concerns. It improves the regulation of EMAs by putting them into legislation that sets out better processes for their establishment and ensures greater transparency for their operation. The bill will create a framework for enterprise migration agreements to ensure such agreements are used only where genuinely necessary and do not adversely affect local job opportunities. The bill will require employers to advertise jobs to locals before they can get an EMA. It will also require a local jobs board listing of those jobs in the resources sector to be maintained by the workplace relations minister. I acknowledge that after quite a long time in gestation such a board has been recently established by the government, but this bill will ensure that it stays in operation and will give it some legislative clout. The current and future skills needs for Australia should be met through a considered approach that includes support for training and retraining of existing workers, labour market planning and forecasting linked to industry planning, and the use of skilled migration where appropriate. But skilled migration should never be a substitute for properly investing in and training the local workforce. It should be supplementary to locals skilled through domestic education and training. We should also aim to increase participation of those who continue to be under-represented in the workforce. This bill will help increase that participation. The Greens support the making of EMAs only where every effort has been made to recruit locally. Where an EMA is established it should include a local jobs plan for the future, with a particular focus on training be provided by EMA proponents. The plan should demonstrate how the project will reduce reliance on overseas labour by targeting training at those occupations in short supply. Unlike the current situation, responsibility for making an EMA will now legislatively rest with the immigration minister and the workplace relations minister to ensure coordination between these important portfolios. The bill also sets out various conditions that can be included when an EMA is made. The workplace relations minister can require that the EMA participant concerned employs a specified number of Australian residents on the resource project concerned, including persons from one or more of the following groups: people living near the project, people who have been recently retrenched, people from culturally and linguistically diverse communities with high rates unemployment, people from Indigenous groups and people from regions with high rates of unemployment. The workplace relations minister can also require that the EMA participant concerned provides specified training to persons employed on the project. In addition it can also be a requirement that the EMA participant concerned provides, or contributes to, training for Australian residents other than those employed under the EMA. The workplace relations minister must also be satisfied that the EMA participant concerned has complied, and will continue to comply, with workplace laws. This is to ensure that all workers employed under EMAs are employed under the same wages, conditions and OHS standards as other workers. We have laws to protect everybody who works in Australia and we must ensure that these laws are enforced regardless of where people come from. This is an to important point. Currently there is an economic incentive to employ people from overseas because the likelihood of someone from overseas knowing their full rights and then knowing how to insist on them is less than in an Australian workforce, especially an Australian unionised workforce. To that end, I am pleased to note that my colleague Senator Richard Di Natale will be moving in the Senate to have Australia ratify the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families. This debate about EMAs does not need to be an either/or debate that pits various groups of workers against one another. What we do need to do is take greater steps to ensure that when people are working on remote projects and come to this country without an understanding of the minimum rights they are entitled to under the legal of system the government takes extra steps to ensure that those people have full rights and know how to enforce them. Lastly, this bill will require a copy of an EMA to be tabled in each House of the parliament as soon as practicable after it has been made. Transparency is not, and should never be, just be an esoteric principle-it should be practiced wherever possible. More information leads to better debate, which leads to better outcomes. As we have seen in the context of the recent Roy Hill EMA, a number of claims have been made about what is in that EMA and its benefits for the local population. Until copies of the EMA are made public and available to be tested, we will never know whether or not these agreements are delivering the benefits that they are said to. It should be very clear to an EMA seeker or participant that, if they want to get one of these EMAs, part of the condition for that is that the EMA will be made public and will need to be defended publicly. The measures set out in this bill will ensure more job opportunities for locals and disadvantaged groups, more training for the future and more protection for those workers who bring their skills to Australia. Where EMAs are used, they will be based on genuine need and established through transparent processes. This bill is another step towards sharing the benefits of the boom, and I commend it to the House. The DEPUTY SPEAKER Grierson) (11:07): In accordance with standing order 41(d), the second reading will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. Air Services (Aircraft Noise) Amendment Bill 2011 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. Mrs MOYLAN (Pearce) (11:08): I rise to speak on the amendments to the Air Services (Aircraft Noise) Amendment Bill 2011. These amendments result from wideranging consultations with people involved in the aircraft industry. Following the second reading speech on this bill in October last year, I made a commitment to consult, and that process was undertaken. I will go through in a reasonably logical order, I hope, some of those changes that have taken place. Section 10AA revolves around the need to consult and cooperate. The need for effective public consultation to become a legislative requirement is really partly the main reason for bring forward this bill. It is that requirement and the fact that Airservices Australia needs to improve its complaints reporting process that gave rise to this bill. The bill seeks to ensure that a detailed commentary on complaints is reflected in Airservices' annual reports, along with the efficiency and effectiveness of the complaints process. Following consultations, the word 'widely', though, has been deleted from section 10AA. During the second reading the member for Makin and the member for La Trobe suggested that changes already implemented as a result of the white paper on these matters are addressing the issues this bill seeks to enact; however, not all communities are satisfied with the current consultation (Ms process. I would contend that, if the government has already made these changes, this legislation now seeks to enshrine those changes in an act of parliament so that in future they are not matters left to the whim of a particular minister or, indeed, to the Chief Executive Officer of Airservices Australia, whoever that might be, and therefore there can be no rational argument for opposition to this bill. In relation to section 10A, 'consulting with communities', the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 has a provision requiring Airservices Australia to obtain the environment minister's advice where changes to flight paths are likely to have any environmental impact. It was originally intended for the bill to include the words 'likely to significantly affect individuals' enjoyment of their place of residence'. In my view there is a need to do something about the trigger for referral under the EPBC Act, but clearly at this time the bill would not have the wide support it needs without deleting these words. It is a matter that should, though, be revisited in the future, as Airservices currently self-assess whether a change to air flight paths should trigger a referral, and history shows that it rarely, if ever, happens. In terms of the trigger for public consultation, there was widespread concern that the definition 'any' with regard to changes to flight paths in the original bill was too wide and that it may capture minor track changes necessary for day-today operations due to weather or other conditions. This was never the intent of the original bill. However, in an endeavour to allay any concerns, we have proposed to narrow the scope of changes which must be referred for a public consultation process. This necessitates using the word 'significant' to define the changes which can trigger the requirement for public consultation. Decisions about the future of air flight paths must be reached in an open and publicly accountable manner. The public has a right to expect a consistent and fair approach to decision making. They have a right to be informed of proposals and actual significant changes. That is why this bill also requires Airservices Australia to conduct a new public consultation process following the changes made in Perth in 2008. On their own admission, Airservices agree that the public consultations for the Western Australian Route Review Project-or WARRP, as it is called-was poorly managed, and the newly appointed ombudsman has had something to say about that process as well. Section 6, dealing with board appointments, has been deleted as it was not generally supported, although it was a recommendation in the Senate report. It has been argued that since the WARRP failures, the government has appointed an ombudsman and established new community aviation consultation groups-and this is a fact; the government has-but I have to say that there are still some public reservations about the operation of the new consultative groups and the independence of the ombudsman. The previous consultative group in Perth, which was called PANMAC-Perth Airport Noise Management Committee-failed, not due to the people who were on it, but due to a lack of quality information, the lack of quality of interpretation of information and the withholding of information. These consultation groups are only as good as the information they receive and their ability to interpret and translate it, and that is a strong reason for the appointment of an adviser-an issue which I will get to shortly. On section 74A, dealing with complaints reporting, the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport report recommended an independent ombudsman for aircraft noise matters. The Aircraft Noise Ombudsman's policy is to encourage the development of a quick and effective complaint handling practice. The bill requires Airservices Australia to advise parties during consultations that they are subject to the ombudsman's jurisdiction. We welcome the appointment of the ombudsman as it is assisting to deal with some of those complaints. The complaint system previously was appallingly managed. The new Ombudsman, Mr Ron Brent, has had quite a bit to say about the problems with that complaint process. Airservices Australia maintains that it has worked to improve its complaint-handling processes since the events of 2008 and that these measures are unnecessary. This being the case-if it has been fixed and the new approach is working-I cannot see any reason why we should not enshrine these principles in this legislation so that there will not be a repeat of the failures clearly evident in the WARRP in 2008. On another matter-this is aside from the amendments but goes to the heart of the man article by Andrew Cleary in the Australian Financial Review on 24 May 2012 reported Mr Alan Joyce, Chief Executive of Qantas, as warning that growth of Perth Airport was being hampered and that there was the potential that a federal bill introducing restrictions on curfews and flight paths at the facility would be a real threat to the development of WA and Perth. He said this bill should be stopped. This bill makes no mention of curfews and it does nothing to restrict flight paths, so that reporting is clearly inaccurate. Section 160A includes provisions for the appointment of an independent adviser when a significant change to air flight paths is proposed, to ensure that the situation that arose during WARRP does not arise again. During the consultation period it is reasonable for groups such as community aviation consultative groups to have access to expert independent advice on what the proposed changes mean. As I said before, poor information-sharing and the use of technical language not understood by non-air movement specialists led to the very unsatisfactory public consultations in Perth during WARRP. An advocate was used in Sydney and, although Airservices Australia maintains that it did not work well, discussions with the former Sydney aircraft noise advocate and other people strongly suggest that it did work. I thank the member for Bennelong for facilitating a meeting in Sydney to discuss this matter. Under the Constitution and standing orders, private members bills are not permitted to increase any appropriation for government expenditure. But the adviser can be paid for from a department's general appropriation, so such a provision would be constitutionally valid. Once again I would like to thank my colleagues and the many other people who have continued to work with us to improve this bill-in particular, the shadow minister the Hon. Warren Truss, the member for Bennelong and the co-sponsor of this bill the member for Swan, Mr Steve Irons.",33
21,Dr LEIGH,BILLS," I rise to speak on the Air Services (Aircraft Noise) Amendment Bill 2011 to highlight a range of government initiatives significantly improving aircraft noise management around Australia's airports. I do so as a member with the Canberra airport in my electorate. In rising, I acknowledge the hard work being done by the Canberra airport to minimise the impact of aircraft noise on the surrounding suburbs. As a father of two little boys who enjoy looking up in the sky and seeing aeroplanes flying overhead, I am aware that my views on aircraft are probably different from those of many of my constituents who, while aircraft noise is not as severe in Canberra as in other cities, do note the impact of aircraft. I am in ongoing conversations with Canberra airport to make sure the impact of aircraft noise on Canberrans is minimised. In the aviation white paper of December 2009, the government set out a path for improving the management of aircraft noise around Australia's airports. As Australia's first ever comprehensive national aviation policy statement it identified solutions and the industry's current challenges and aimed to guide its growth over the coming two decades. The white paper was the product of more than 18 months of consultations and there were hundreds of submissions made during that process. Prior to the release of the aviation white paper in 2009, the government released an issues paper in April 2008 and a green paper in December 2008. Federal Labor has a strong record on aircraft noise. One of the important decisions we have made since coming to office was to ban the older, noisy jet aircraft, such as hush kitted Boeing 727s, from Australia's major airports because they contributed to unacceptable levels of noise around those airports. The government gave effect for amendments to the aircraft noise regulations in May 2010. From 1 July 2010, no new services using those types of aircraft were allowed in Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth, Adelaide, Hobart, Darwin, Cairns, Gold Coast, Essendon, Newcastle, Williamstown, Avalon and Canberra airports. From 1 September 2010 all existing services using those hush kitted Boeing 727s ceased at Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne and Perth. The white paper also recognised airport operations have a major impact on community. Issues such as aircraft noise, traffic congestion and pressure on public transport all require cooperative management between airport operators, all levels of government and local communities. I am very much aware of that in the ACT, where the federal government in the latest budget put $144 million into the Majura Parkway, an arterial road that will link up the Federal Highway to the Canberra airport thereby minimising the impact of the airport on traffic congestion. That will be the largest road building project in the ACT's history. I am pleased that the ACT government has contributed fifty-fifty to that road building project, setting, I think, a good standard for other states and territories. There has been a positive response to the government's initiatives from the community and the aviation industry. Airservices Australia, our national air traffic services provider, and industry continue to express concerns over this private member's bill, even as amended. In response to the aviation white paper, the 19 federally leased airports have established local, independently chaired Community Aviation Consultation Groups to help discuss the and examine a range of community related issues, including aircraft noise. These are now underway at all 19 airports. Local residents are represented by community members on these groups, and Airservices Australia is represented and is actively briefing all of these groups. These local groups are helping to address planning and development issues and a range of other operational matters such as aircraft noise, allowing parties to exchange information and examine concerns raised by residents. Local residents are represented by community members on these groups, and Airservices Australia is represented on all of these groups. Coalition members are attending these groups: the member for MCPherson has attended the Gold Coast consultative group; and the member for Herbert has attended the Townsville consultative group. Of particular note for the member for Pearce, is the establishment of the Perth Community Aviation Consultation Group and the healthy engagement by a diversity of people on that committee. Another key white paper initiative was the establishment of an Aircraft Noise Ombudsman to examine and make recommendations about noise complaint and information handling issues. The Aircraft Noise Ombudsman, respected former Deputy Commonwealth Ombudsman, Mr Ron Brent, is already making a difference. For example, the Aircraft Noise Ombudsman's 2011 report on complaints handling made 18 specific recommendations for improvement, all of which Airservices Australia is implementing. Similarly, Airservices Australia has accepted the seven recommendations made from the Aircraft Noise Ombudsman's review on noise information and complaint resolution for Perth completed in November 2011. This government has strengthened the environmental focus of Airservices Australia. The Minister for Infrastructure and Transport has provided a strategic direction to the Airservices board last year under section 17 of the act, which requires that Airservices effectively consult with the community on any significant developments or changes to its services. The Airservices Australia board has itself responded by setting up a dedicated board environmental subcommittee. There are also sound governance provisions in place for Airservices Australia, including corporate plan provisions requiring the board to consider the government's objectives, which include assisting the implementation of environmental initiatives in relation to aircraft noise management. Another white paper commitment is the planning coordination forums which are underway at every major capital city passenger airport. These are the vehicle for constructive, ongoing dialogue on matters such as master plans, proposed on-airport developments, regional planning initiatives and off-airport matters. Minimising the impact of aircraft noise is a joint responsibility of airports and local planning authorities. It matters for long-term planning in our major cities that developments do not proceed where they will lead to public safety risks or unacceptable levels of aircraft noise. That why the government has engaged with all states and territories to develop a set of principles for safeguarding airports from inappropriate developments in surrounding areas. We are not aiming to constrain development but to make sure that airport and government planners work together more constructively than they have in the past, that, through the Community Aviation Consultation Groups, there is now an independent ombudsman to direct further difficulties to, and that Airservices Australia are being proactive in their engagement with communities. It is in this context that we must question the value of the member for Pearce's bill. Compared with ongoing government aircraft noise initiatives, the bill offers a ministerially imposed, taxpayer funded community adviser scheme with the potential to make community consultation more polarised. It also proposes a reopening of established, safe flight paths at Perth and unwieldy and unnecessary additional consultation and reporting arrangements. Lessons have been learnt on better consultation on complex air traffic issues, since air traffic changes were made to address emerging safety issues in 2008. These air traffic changes were approved by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and since then Airservices Australia has carried out a post-implementation review of the changes to see where improvements can be made to assist in reducing impacts on the community. This government has established a strong platform for better aircraft noise management and consultation arrangements at our airports. We have put a white paper together when those opposite had over 10 years to do something. The frustrations around this bill were created a long time is before we come to government, and the government's aviation white paper set out the initiatives for better consultation and better information to the community in relation to air traffic and aircraft noise management issues. This is exactly what is being delivered through the work of the Community Aviation Consultative Groups, the Aircraft Noise Ombudsman and the increased engagement of Airservices, airport and airline operators. Debate adjourned. PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS Economy",38
22,Dr LEIGH,BILLS," I move: That this House: (1) notes that: (a) by historical standards, unemployment, inflation and interest rates are at very low (b) for the first time in Australian history, Australia has a AAA rating from all three major credit rating agencies; (c) Australia's debt levels, despite the hit to revenues from the global financial crisis, are around one tenth the level of major advanced economies; (d) OECD Economic Outlook 91 confirms that the Australian economy will significantly outperform OECD economies as a whole over this year and next; and (e) the IMF has said of Australia: 'we welcome the authorities' commitment to return to a budget surplus by 2012-13 to rebuild fiscal buffers, putting Commonwealth government finances in a stronger position'; and (2) calls upon all Members to approach economic debates with facts rather than fear, and to put the national interest first when discussing the strong Australian economy. The DEPUTY SPEAKER Grierson): Is the motion seconded? Mr VAN MANEN (Forde) (11:29): I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.",41
23,Dr LEIGH,BILLS," I thank the member for Forde for his bipartisan gesture. Economic reform in Australia has never been easy. In the post-war decades, the conservatives built up a tariff wall that helped make Australian uncompetitive and kept consumer prices high. In 1973, Gough Whitlam began the long process of breaking down Australia's tariff walls-the 25 per cent across-the-board tariff cuts. What did those opposite do? They came into this place and attacked him for it. Ralph Hunt, Michael MACKellar, Ian Sinclair and others criticised it. The Victorian Chamber of Manufactures condemned it. Yet nearly 40 years on, no-one is arguing for the tariff wall to be rebuilt. This, in a nutshell, is the story of economic reform in Australia-argued by levels; Labor, often opposed by the conservatives and in the end becoming a part of the Australian social fabric. The result of reform is the prosperity that Australians now enjoy: four per cent growth rates, five per cent unemployment, two per cent inflation and the RBA cash rate of 3½ per centeconomic circumstances the rest of the world would give their eye teeth for. But when those opposite speak about the economy there is only one place where they seem to be willing to tell the truth and that is London. When the opposition leader was in London recently he said: … Australia has serious bragging rights. Compared to most developed countries, our economic circumstances are enviable. When the member for North Sydney went to London he referred to the fact that Hong Kong, where debt levels are twice Australia's, had moderate government debt. (Ms He was certainly telling the truth and this clearly indicates his belief that Australia has low government debt. It is passing strange that it is only when they go to Londonwhen they are in the 'mother country'-that those opposite can tell the truth about the Australian economy. It makes you wonder what is going through their heads. I think it could be something like, 'I did but see her passing by; I cannot tell an economic lie.' industry It would be easy to spend 10 minutes talking about the protectionism of Barnaby Joyce, the DLP-style intervention of Tony Abbott, the backflips of Joe Hockey on the Parliamentary Budget Office and the opportunism around the debt ceiling. Those opposite would not know a Pigouvian tax if they tripped over one and they are the only ones in Australia who seem to think that royalties are better than a profits based tax for taxation of mining. Back when they were introducing the GST, the coalition liked to point out that almost every OECD country had a GST. By 2015 there will be national or subnational emissions trading schemes in every OECD country but one; but now coalition MPs have changed their arguments. They say we should be lone wolves rather than running with the pack. Yet, as George Megalogenis reminds us in his most recent book, here is John Howard on 3 June 2007 promising: This will be a world-class emissions trading system more comprehensive, more rigorously grounded in economics, and with better governance than anything in Europe. Implementing an emissions trading scheme and setting a long-term goal for reducing emissions will be the most momentous economic decision Australia will take in the next decade. Similarly, a profits based mining tax is no more a left-wing idea than a good one. It was the Hawke government which introduced the petroleum resource rent tax and a profits based tax on uranium but it was conservative Sarah Palin who put a profits based tax on petroleum when she was governor of Alaska. It was the Northern Territory conservatives who were responsible for the profits based mining taxes that have worked so well in the NT. Profits based taxes are just a smarter way of taxing mining. They make sure that when world prices rise taxpayers share in the windfall. The current Liberal Party leadership has more in common with the DLP than the market oriented party of John Howard, Brendan Nelson and the member for Wentworth, Malcolm Turnbull. The current National Party leadership has more in common with the all-round protectionism of Black Jack MCEwen than the reforming party of Tim Fischer and Mark Vaile. But, rather than dwell on the coalition's economic illiteracy, I want to talk about the challenges and opportunities for Australia. With the rise of China, Australia sees great opportunities for our exports not only of goods but also of services. Australian finance and architecture firms are engaged with the Chinese boom. As we move to a more open economy we need to make sure that we keep investing in infrastructure and education. We know that boosting the quality and quantity of Australian education is absolutely essential as we move to a more open and technologically savvy world. We need to boost productivity. There was some reference last week to the Productivity Commission to-do list. Lost in that debate was the fact that on that list are things such as efficient water pricing, harmonised building codes and quicker processing of applications for major resource projects-all of which the government is pursuing. We also need to make sure that we help build an entrepreneurial culture. I pay tribute to Australia's latest Nobel laureate, Brian Schmidt, for his enthusiasm in making sure we develop more scientists and researchers. When the Leader of the Opposition was asked why he could not find a single academic economist to back his command and control climate policy over Labor's market alternative, he responded by saying that this said something about 'the quality of Australia's economists'. Nothing could be further from the truth. Australian academic economics is as strong as it has ever been. Let me take a moment to note for the House some of the important research taking place. At the Australian National University, the Centre for Applied Macroeconomic Analysis has established a shadow Reserve Bank board to look at uncertainty around monetary policy. The shadow board comprises Paul Bloxham, Mark Crosby, Mardi Dungey, Saul Eslake, Bob Gregory, James Morley, Jeffrey Sheen, Mark Thirlwell, and Shaun Vahey. I acknowledge the work that Warwick MCKibbin has done at the Australian National University to build CAMA into such a powerhouse. At Deakin University, the Deakin Policy Forum is aimed at stimulating high quality discussion of economic policy. At Griffith University, the Economic Policy Analysis Program aims to foster economic research, particularly in the area of macroeconomics. Simon Ville and Glenn Withers are currently editing the Cambridge Economic History of Australia-because it is only understanding your economic past that you can build good policies for the future. Melbourne Institute, the HILDA surveys facilitate hundreds of academic studies including work on employment, health, inequality, mobility, crime and happiness. Victoria University of Technology is hosting the Australian Conference of Economists from 9 to 12 July and I am looking forward to speaking and listening to some of the quality presentations at that conference. The ANU Crawford School's Economics and Environment Network was an important contributor to the development of an emissions trading scheme through its support for Professor Ross Garnaut. The Crawford School is also hosting a public policy week from 16 to 20 July, which will include a round-table on the Henry tax review with James Mirrlees. The University of New South Wales has set up a Centre of Excellence in Population and Ageing Research involving economists demographers. Monash University recently hosted a major development economics workshop supported by AusAID and involving Abijit Banerjee from MIT. Next month, Monash is hosting a joint conference with Warwick University on superannuation. The University of Queensland is running the 2012 Society for the Advancement of Economic Theory conference. When Labor put an assets test on the pension in the early 1980s opposition leader Andrew Peacock called it an 'assault on the elderly' and promised to repeal it when the coalition won office. A decade after floating the dollar, the Leader of the Opposition still thought it was a bad idea. For every reform, there will always be someone standing against it, but the thing is that history will forget the naysayers. History remembers the doers. Eventually, history will forget the doers and the parliamentarians by who spoke for reform; it only remembers the things they did. The things we do in this At the place will outlast us. Reforms like an emissions trading scheme, a profits based mining tax, the National Disability Insurance Scheme, school infrastructure that will stand the test of generations and the National Broadband Network will be here long after those of us in this place have moved on. I thank the House. Mr VAN MANEN (Forde) (11:38): I thank the member for Fraser for his motion. We have just listened to 10 minutes of talk about the opposition and about various university academic programs and, as usual, very little if anything about the government's economic record because it has no positive economic record to speak of. Let us correct a couple of misconceptions from the member for Fraser's contribution to this debate. Firstly, we already have a profits based tax: it is called the company tax. Noand one in the world has an economy-wide carbon tax, yet that is what this government is foisting on the Australian economy. Included in that is a $10 billion boondoggle for the clean energy fund to waste money on clean energy projects that are patently uncommercial. It is a sad, short summary of where this government's economic track record is. Let us start with the final point of the member's motion, which: … calls upon all Members to approach economic debates with facts rather than fear, and to put the national interest first when discussing the strong Australian economy. Let us start with the definition of 'facts'. According to Dictionary.com a fact is something that exists; a reality or truth. A fact is 'something known to exist or to have happened' and 'known by actual experience or observation.' Let us look further at the member's motion, which states: … OECD Economic Outlook 91 confirms that the Australian economy will significantly outperform OECD economies … We do not know that. That is conjecture. It is an opinion. It is an estimation. It remains to be seen for the future. So it is not a fact. In addition, with regard to the statement about the IMF, the IMF has said of Australia: … we welcome the authorities' commitment to return to a budget surplus by 2012-13 to rebuild fiscal buffers … which will supposedly put 'Commonwealth government finances in a stronger position'. But does the IMF also welcome the government's move to increase the national credit card debt limit by another $50 billion? While the government says it wants to achieve a budget surplus of $1½ billion, it is still wanting an extra $50 billion. Last time. I checked that did not add up. I do not think the IMF supports it, because it has made no comment about it. The fact is this government continues to claim success for fiscal management which it cannot claim. The benefit of our current economic position has its genesis and its foundation in the reforms of the Hawke, Keating and Howard governments. That is what is continuing to benefit us today. It is the legacy of these reforms from which we still benefit. Let us have a look at some of the other matters that were raised in this motion. There is a reference to government debt, and the member for Fraser touched on it briefly. I am pleased to see that, for a change, the member is staying in the chamber to listen. For our debt levels we can thank the hard work of the former Howard government which, under the stewardship of the then Treasurer, Peter Costello, succeeded in repaying $96 billion of accumulated Labor debt last time we came into government. Not only was this achieved but this government also came into office in 2007 with $70 billion of net assets and a $20 billion budget surplus. Since then this government has lived outside its means and accumulated $174 billion in budget deficits. Thanks to Labor we now share a net debt of $145 billion, which has been accumulated over only four-and-a-bit years. Given this government's track record, who knows where this figure will end up? How will average Australians feel about some of the statements outlined in this motion, particularly as regards interest rates being at low levels by historical standards? Let me remind the House that the standard variable mortgage rate was 24 basis points lower on average under the coalition government during its term in office. On a typical $300,000 mortgage this difference would represent a saving under a coalition government of $720 a year or $60 a month.  office? Mr VAN MANEN: Have a look at the spreads.",41
24,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS," Order! The member for Moreton will cease interjecting. Mr VAN MANEN: The esteemed member for Moreton always has a contribution to make to the debate. Let us have a look at the spread on small business interest rates. It is not about the 3.5 per cash rate: that is not what Joe Public out there is paying-he is paying his mortgage rate to the bank. For small business the difference is even greater, with the spread for the average small business unsecured overdraft 135 basis points lower under the coalition than it was under Labor. For example, for a small business unsecured overdraft of $200,000 this represents a saving of $2,700 a year. Let us not forget that the topic of interest rates is a double-sided coin. Last week I spent some time meeting with some of my constituents, and a number of them were self-funded retirees. Whilst a fall in interest rates is good for homeowners and small business borrowers, it is not very good for self-funded retirees because they rely on the interest rates they are getting on their money that is invested to fund their retirement. Once again this government only looks at half the picture. The majority of Australians will acknowledge that by historical standards unemployment, inflation and interest rates are at very low levels. But in reality they do not feel this as a day-today reality in their lives. Talk to a family man who is out of work or underemployed. Tell that to a family struggling to make ends meet, tell that to a pensioner who is living under the poverty line. There are real cost-of-living pressures out there that directly contradict Labor's economic celebrations. There are many examples of day-today financial struggles for pensioners, families and businesses that are the reality of what is being experienced day-today in our community. This Labor government can stare through their rose-coloured glasses all they like but, at the end of the day, average Australians will not see it as a fact or believe it is great news because what they are experiencing right now is the very opposite of what this government says is happening. For example, cent food and petrol prices are up around 11 per cent, education and health costs have risen some 25 per cent. Under Labor, electricity has increased by some 66 per cent. It was only last week that I visited a local family owned commercial laundry operation in my electorate who expect their electricity and gas and fuel bills to increase somewhere between 10 and 25 per cent as a result of the world's biggest carbon tax. As it stands, many small businesses in my electorate are doing it tough. When I speak with business owners I hear about their struggles to pay the rent, to keep people employed and the challenges of competing with the high Australian dollar. They are not saying, 'Hey, Bert, isn't it great that interest rates are low,' or, 'Isn't it great that we have a AAA credit rating.' In actual fact, they are concerned about the rollout of the world's biggest carbon tax. This brings me to my last point about putting the national interest first when discussing the strong Australian economy. I say to the member opposite and to those in the government: if you really thought about the national interest first and keeping your job second, our economy would be in a much better position. For a long time now the people of this country have had to sit back and watch as this Labor-Greens government has voted in the carbon tax and an additional 26 new or increased taxes. I am more than happy to continue to put the national interest first when discussing the economy. I, along with my coalition colleagues, have been putting the interests of Australians first all along and we welcome the Labor-Greens government to do the same. Debate adjourned.

26,Mr SWAN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS, I ask leave of the House to make a ministerial statement relating to the global economy. Leave granted.,46
27,Mr SWAN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"It has been my practice since the darkest days of the global financial crisis to keep the House updated on international developments and their implications for Australia. I do so today in the shadows of Greek elections overnight, just shortly before the Prime Minister meets with G20 leaders in Los Cabos. While we do not yet know the full implications of the results coming out of Greece, we do know that the G20 summit about to get underway is held at a time of heightened uncertainty in the global economy. The Prime Minister and I have written to our counterparts outlining the need for Europe to take decisive action to stabilise their financial system and move towards deeper financial and fiscal union. All G20 members need to support growth and jobs, including through structural reforms, while putting their fiscal positions on a sustainable path. But we must be honest about the magnitude of the challenges facing Europe in particular, which no one meeting can fix entirely on its own. I noted in the budget papers that the European economy as a whole was expected to contract in 2012 and that a re-escalation the European sovereign debt crisis was the key risk to the global recovery. And despite a period of relative calm on global financial markets in the early months of this year, this was never going to mark the end of the the global volatility. Recently, the tempo of global turbulence has risen again, this time triggered by the Greek elections and concerns around the Spanish banking sector. Global and European outlook The focus is obviously on Greece today. Adjustments necessary in Greece were always going to be difficult, with a disenchanted populace experiencing their fifth year of economic recession. The official outcome of the Greek election will not be known with any certainty today. But whatever the outcome, it is important that Greece's political parties quickly undertake coalition discussions and form a stable government. We know that fear of contagion from Greece has already put upward pressure on government financing costs across many parts of Europe. Spain has also come under increasing pressure to address the substantial weaknesses in its financial sector, while at the same time meeting its ambitious fiscal targets. I welcome the support euro area finance ministers are providing to Spain to bolster their ailing banks, but it is crucial that further details of the package are released as soon as possible. While Greece and Spain have become the recent focus of Europe's distress, we should be under no illusions about the deep-seated challenges that confront Europe more broadly. Weak financial systems and fiscal positions continue to feed off each other at the expense of confidence and growth, and there has been insufficient political accord to make changes that are urgently needed. For the European project to prevail, what is needed is a panof European approach that, once and for all, addresses the crisis. This type of unified approach must no longer be seen as a move that will threaten the individual interests of any one country, because the interests of each and every country within the euro area depend critically on the strength of the euro area as a whole. Only by moving forward with fiscal and political integration can Europe be saved. Europe needs to outline and, more importantly, deliver credible fiscal plans-policies that in the short run boost consumption and investment, and in the long run make budgets sustainable. Good examples bring infrastructure projects that create jobs and demand in the short run, and add to productive capacity in the long runprecisely the type of investment that this government has persisted with, even at the height of the global crisis. The idea that must choose between growth and fiscal consolidation is false. You can have growth then consolidation, so long as your plans are achievable and believable. The Australian pro-jobs, pro-growth model, with a wellanchored medium-term fiscal framework, is proof of that fact. By supporting growth in the face of the worse global recession in 80 years, we have emerged from the crisis in a position of strength that is virtually unrivalled. And by setting out a strict fiscal approach from day one, we are also returning to surplus ahead of all major advanced economies. Rest of the world Against the backdrop of severe weakness in Europe, the United States economy continues to grow at a modest pace, though it has yet to achieve a self-sustaining recovery. GDP growth has improved since its soft patch in mid-2011, the unemployment rate has trended downwards, and even housing market indicators are registering tentative signs of improvement. While these signs are encouraging, there is still underlying weakness in US labour and housing markets, and the US recovery remains vulnerable to further fallout in Europe. With much of Europe in recession and US growth still modest, the global recovery will continue to rely on emerging markets, particularly those in Asia. On IMF estimates, emerging economies contributed more than three-quarters of global growth in 2011, and this is expected to continue over the next two years. China has continued to grow at a robust, but more sustainable pace. forward Chinese policymakers are well-placed, if necessary, to use a range of policy tools, fiscal and monetary, to support growth-and indeed China has recently taken steps to do so. We have seen this, for instance, through you decisions by the Chinese government to speed up approval processes and bring forward infrastructure projects earmarked in the 12th five-year plan. Monetary policy has also been eased, including a reduction in the amount of funds that commercial banks must keep in reserve and a cut in the benchmark lending rate. Australia Amid the economic volatility now engulfing the world, Australia is recognised the world over as a beacon of strength, stability and resilience. The most recent data showcases our strong economic fundamentals that put our economy in a league of its own. Over the past year GDP grew by 4.3 per cent, the fastest pace in over four years. We are officially growing faster than any of the major advanced economies and we are projected to outperform these economies over the next two years. While many advanced economies are not even back at the starting line yet, our economy is almost 10 per cent larger than it was just before the global financial crisis broke. Since this government came to office, over 800,000 jobs have been created. At the same time around 27 million jobs have been lost across the world. These results have been made possible by the government's decisions to support our economy and jobs at a turbulent time. Our fiscal stimulus shielded our economy from the worse of the global recession, and our credible strategy to return the budget to surplus has underpinned the confidence that financial markets have in Australia. And in the face of rugged global circumstances we have not ignored or overlooked important investments in our productive capacity. Together, we have won the confidence and respect of the world through our actions and our resilience. Confidence in our fiscal management is a key reason behind Australia receiving a AAA credit rating from all three major ratings agencies, for the first time in our history. Confidence in our financial system has ensured that Australian banks remain some of the most secure and highest-rated in the world. And confidence in the Australian economy has seen our pipeline of resources investment grow to a staggering half a trillion dollars. Over half of these projects are at an advanced stage, which provides a bedrock of support for our economy in uncertain times. Of course, just as Australia has not been unaffected by global developments to date, we are not immune from a further deterioration in global conditions. While our remain economy walks tall, difficult global conditions have weighed on sentiment and demand for some of our exports, and we have seen the impact of global turbulence on our share market. Consumers are also more reluctant to take on debt, and this has contributed to subdued conditions in our housing market. And while some industries are booming, global headwinds have made it harder for some sectors already struggling from a high dollar and broader structural transitions underway in our economy. We know there is some anxiety in our community during these times of economic turmoil abroad and structural change at home. But Australians can take great confidence in our rock-solid economic fundamentals and our standout performance in these testing times. Right now we have the best combination of impressive growth, low unemployment, contained inflation, strong public finances, low interest rates and a record pipeline of investment. We are only one of eight countries in the world to receive a AAA credit rating with a stable outlook from all three global ratings agencies. And during this difficult chapter for our global economy, there is an even greater responsibility of each and every member of this House to acknowledge the great strengths of our economy, our people and our businesses. Conclusion I accept that there will be continuing volatility from Europe for some time yet, but I do not accept that the pace and scale of action to address this has been adequate. As the Prime Minister gathers with our G20 colleagues in Mexico, the clear message that she and I have conveyed to our European colleagues is that we all have a responsibility to put world growth on a stronger and more sustainable path. And we will continue to closely engaged with our international counterparts to reinforce the strengths of the Australian economy and our region-a message I conveyed over the weekend to the managing director of the IMF, Christine Lagarde. We will continue to confront new challenges and opportunities with the same spirit of energy and resilience that our country is proudly known for. Ms KATE ELLIS (Adelaide-Minister for Employment Participation and Minister for Early Childhood and Childcare) (12:00): by leave-I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent Mr Hockey speaking in reply to the ministerial statement period not exceeding 12 minutes. Question agreed to.",46
28,Mr HOCKEY,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS," We in the coalition fully appreciate that the global economy is delicately poised, not only with headwinds from Europe but also with moderating growth in the United States and some recent signs of a slowing in China. We also recognise that Australia's economy is not immune to the impacts of the global situation. Where the coalition differs from the government is in the approach that should be taken to respond to these challenges. The Acting Prime Minister has advised the House that he and the Prime Minister have written to their European counterparts telling them of the need to stabilise their financial situation and put their fiscal positions onto a sustainable path. Well, this will hardly come as news to European leaders! I do not think European leaders will be dropping everything to read Prime Minister Gillard's letter. It was only last November that the Prime Minister was lecturing G20 leaders in France on concerns about European financial stability and on the need to act. That lecture had no discernible impact on recent decisions by European leaders, and it is clear that they would not pay any greater attention to our Prime Minister giving her new lecture-and I do not think the Treasurer of Australia will make any difference either. We in the coalition suggest that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer should do less in the way of ink-based diplomacy, lecturing the Europeans with vague generalities about what their countries should do, and spend more time focusing on addressing the vulnerabilities which the Prime Minister and the Treasurer have themselves created in the Australian economy-vulnerabilities exposing our economy in the event of a for a further downturn in the developed-world economy. For the past few years, we in the coalition have been warning repeatedly of the risks that will face the Australian economy in the event of another global shock or a decline in our sky-high terms of trade. We have consistently urged the government to take the hard decisions to prepare our economy for volatile times. Unfortunately, these warnings have not been heeded by this government that has run out of ideas. In the past few weeks we have received the news that growth in the March quarter was stronger than expected and that employment rose in May. We welcome the good news-although it is good news that comes through the rear-vision mirror. For example, it is notable that the rise in jobs in May was a reflection of the fact that we have had job growth at less than half what the Treasurer originally predicted when he boasted in the 2011-12 budget of 500,000 jobs being created over the next two years. Given that there were no new net jobs created-for the first time in nearly 20 years-in 2011, it was a pleasing outcome for May. The more important point is that the labour market is a lagging indicator of the state of the economy. The March quarter growth figure tells us what was happening in the period three to six months ago. We now need to be focused on how the economy is travelling going forward. On that score, the Reserve Bank, which of course is forwardlooking with monetary policy, has just cut the cash rate by 75 basis points over the last two months. At the same time, its accompanying statements have warned of a deterioration in financial market sentiment, of share market declines, of ongoing precautionary behaviour by households, and of further weakness in the housing market. Then in the past 10 days we have also had current reads on both business and consumer sentiment. On the business side, the NAB monthly survey for May recorded sharp falls in business confidence and conditions, taking both back to below average levels. And on the consumer side, the Westpac sentiment index showed essentially no change in May or June from its weak levels, despite 75 basis points of cash rate cuts and a slew of government cash splashes. It seems businesses are not impressed with a government that turns on a dime in changing its policies, including on the policy on company tax cuts, which it promised for two years and then dumped in the budget. And then, in a whimsical thought, the Prime Minister announced the other day that those cuts were back on the agenda, even though there is no money in the budget for them. It seems consumers are not impressed with the government's attempts to buy their votes with handouts. Instead, they remain worried by this government's lack of any coherent economic strategy to lift growth, boost jobs and restore confidence. A lady came up to me last Saturday and said, 'Joe, why would I borrow money against any future earnings I have in this environment? With a government that seems to tax things out of the blue, with what is happening overseas, and with the instability in Canberra, why would I take the risk of borrowing money against any income I might get next year, and in subsequent years, to buy a home?' She said, 'I'm sitting on it. I'm sitting on what I have and, frankly, if not going backwards in this environment, then I'm doing quite well.' I suppose that vox pop, if you like, in so many ways encapsulates the vulnerability government has created. It is not negativity from us-they keep talking about our negativity. I do not write the speeches or press releases for the head of Glencore, the head of BHP or the head of Harvey Norman. We do not write the press releases or media statements for Gerry Harvey or John Singleton. These people are at the coalface saying it is not as good as Labor say. In fact, the government are making it far worse by flip-flopping on policy and changing policy. There is no better example than the carbon tax, which so many of us are familiar with. And there are so many others, right back from 2008, when they changed employee share scheme arrangements and flip-flopped on that. They have flip-flopped on the mining tax over the years. They flip-flopped on withholding tax. That is a classic example which will be before the House soon. The government said they wanted to reduce withholding tax in Australia and in 2008 they reduced it from around 30 per cent to 7½ per cent to encourage foreign investment, particularly in commercial real estate. The coalition praised them for reducing the tax. Now the government say they are going to increase it from 7½ per cent to 15 per cent, which in itself leaves people confused. They thought there was a downward trend in relation to the tax but now the government are doubling it. Yet the government wonder why the world is so concerned about the sovereign risk in Australia. Then there is the narrative from the government about the economy. The Treasurer does not talk about the 'patchwork I'm economy' anymore, because he is making it harder not easier. They are making it harder for manufacturing by imposing a carbon tax on energy, which directly affects the valuethis add associated with manufacturing. Then, of all things, they go ahead and massively increase the passenger movement charge on the tourist industry, which they say has been going through such difficult times. International investors are wondering what the hell this government is about. It seems to think that the best way to make people more prosperous is to increase their taxes. This is the logic of Labor's economic narrative. I say, quite frankly, it is no wonder that when the rest of the world gets a letter from Julia Gillard and Wayne Swan they talk about it. The Prime Minister has said they are talking about that letter. I bet they are talking about that letter! They are rolling around in the aisles having a good giggle at that letter, because they are getting an economic lecture from Julia Gillard and Wayne Swan. The lecture is about how to be austere, how to live within your means. They are getting that from the Labor government of Australia and I bet they are they talking about that letter. What matters is not just where all the risks to our economy come from but how we have prepared ourselves to deal with the risks. We remember the government's response to the collapse of Lehman Brothers after denying that there was any issue during the early part of 2008-in fact, declaring war on inflation and urging the Reserve Bank to increase interest rates at exactly the wrong time, the beginning of 2008. We remember this. We also remember that they inherited a situation where net debt did not exist-in fact, there was money in the bank. They inherited a strong surplus. The budget had recorded its fourth surplus in a row of 1½ per cent or more of GDP, and its tenth surplus of 12, under John Howard and Peter Costello. We are not in that position today. As we stand before the House, the budget deficit has increased to $44 billion this year. Let us talk about what it actually is, not what the government are promising. They are promising a surplus that, looking at their form, they will never deliver. In the current year they said there would be a $22 billion deficit and now we have a $44 billion deficit. They are cooking the books in order to promise a surplus next year. The Greeks got themselves into a bit of trouble cooking the figures. We are not on anything like that scale, but the truth is that if you include the NBN expenditure and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation then we are running a deficit. And the debt ceiling is increasing from $250 billion to $300 billion. The Prime Minister is giving the Europeans a lecture about austerity when she is increasing the debt limit of the Commonwealth government from $250 billion to $300 billion in a year when the government are promising a surplus. Having more front than Myer, our Prime Minister is seeking to give the rest of the world a lecture. I say to our Prime Minister, 'Remind the world of where it all started: with a surplus, money in the bank and good consistent government that delivered stability and certainty.' (Time expired) NA Corporations and Financial Services Committee Report",49
29,Ms ONEILL,COMMITTEES," On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, I present the committee's advisory report on the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Stronger Super) Bill 2012 and the Superannuation Supervisory Levy Imposition Amendment Bill 2012. In accordance with standing order 39(f) the report was made a parliamentary paper.",51
30,Ms ONEILL,COMMITTEES,"by leave-I am pleased to speak to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services June 2012 report on its inquiry into the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Stronger Super) Bill 2012 and the Superannuation Supervisory Imposition Amendment Bill 2012. These amendments are part of the SuperStream package of measures designed to enhance the back office of superannuation. The superannuation industry is currently dominated by a large number of paper transactions that are very inefficient for both processing costs and the time taken for transactions to occur and superannuation to be deposited in members' accounts. Members of superannuation funds and employers will both benefit from these changes, and it is estimated that the SuperStream measures are expected to save $1 billion in processing costs per year, which is quite a significant improvement. When averaged over the 33 million superannuation accounts, this translates to a saving in the order of $30 per account. Research undertaken by the Financial Services Council estimated that the reforms would deliver savings of up to $20 billion by 2020. The cost for implementing the SuperStream reform is $470 million over seven years. This will be paid by a SuperStream levy on Australian Prudential Regulation Authority regulated funds. Echoing the words of the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation, if you averaged the full levy increase of $121 million to apply in 2012-13 across the approximate 33 million accounts existing today, the cost is roughly in the order of $4 per account. Just to put on the record why it is that we are in this position, I want to record today what it is that the Financial Services Council described as the journey to the point we have reached. They stated: Over the past decade, the industry has endeavoured to agree on a set of data standards for managing transaction between entities; however, we lack the capacity to compel stakeholders and sometimes our own stakeholders to comply with industry developed standards. The Levy introduction of these compulsory standards is therefore a welcome development as it will standardise processes for employers and funds in dealing with one another. These comments about the need for leadership in this area and acknowledgement of the leadership shown by this Labor Gillard government are very much worth putting on the record here today. Further, I would like to record into Hansard the comments of Mr Murray who is the principal adviser on superannuation in Treasury and Mr Olesen, the deputy commissioner of superannuation at the Australian Taxation Office, who made the following comments. Mr Murray stated: The background to these measures is that the superannuation industry has been trying for a considerable number of years to establish its own common standards and address these issues. Unfortunately, for various reasons, the industry has been unable to come to any agreement. The outcome of that has been a considerable number of different processes among the funds, there are considerable deadweight costs in the industry and they have these provisions for different requirements. The government has therefore been required to come in and become the decisionmaker, to take control and push these reforms through, because unfortunately, to date, industry has not been able to come to an agreement itself. Mr Olesen said: I think the industry have tried at various times to develop some common data standards to use, but ultimately they have not been successfulhence, the government has taken these reforms. I certainly stand here as a very proud member of the reforms that this government has undertaken in a range of fields but none are more important to so many Australians than this field of superannuation and financial services. In terms of governance, the committee acknowledges that industry is seeking external assurances that a sound governance framework is established to support SuperStream measures. To help usher in the changes contained in these bills the government has announced the establishment of the SuperStream Advisory Council, and two weeks ago we called for nominations from industry participants to be part of that council. This is another indication of how well this government is working with key stakeholders to make sure that we come up with policies and governance structures that advance the interests of all Australians and that we do it together. It stands in stark contrast to the carping negativity-the aggressive negativity-of those opposite. To support that process further, a consultation paper has also been released. This paper has been met with approval by industry participants and underlines the government's commitment to working with the sector in implementing these important changes. The committee is assured that the governance framework provided through the SuperStream Advisory Council will provide an appropriate forum for industry members to speak to government on these reforms. With regard to the levy, the committee heard from some industry participants who expressed concern not about the scale of the levy but about how the levy would be spent. These concerns, in the committee's view, are very reasonable. The committee recommends measures that the Treasury has advanced. These measures are to encourage dialogue with industry on the costs of the SuperStream levy through the release of its discussion paper. We certainly as a committee encourage the industry to use this avenue to further discuss the detail of the high-level deliverables on SuperStream that were released by Treasury during the course of this inquiry. The committee also notes that the levy is subject to annual review and should be adjusted when appropriate. However, to address industry concerns further, the committee also considers it highly appropriate that the Australian Taxation Office provide a regular detailed breakdown of costs and expenditure of the additional levies to the SuperStream Advisory Council. These would be based on reporting guidelines obviously developed in consultation between the council and the ATO. I would like to underline the benefits that these changes will bring. In evidence to this committee, the Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees focused on very significant productivity gains that this legislation will bring for industry and employers both large and small. Anything that supports productivity is something that this government is committed to assisting. The institute suggested that they expect savings of approximately 20 per cent in administration costs in the long term for the superannuation industry. That is quite a significant saving. The committee is encouraged by the efforts already undertaken by the industry to adopt the SuperStream measures and to improve efficiencies in the administration of superannuation for the benefit of all employers and superannuation membersmy fellow Australians. The committee also commends the extensive consultation and collaboration between industry and government officials that has taken place.",51
31,Mr FLETCHER,COMMITTEES," by leave-I too am pleased to speak to the Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services' June 2012 report on its inquiry into the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Stronger Super) Bill 2012 and the Superannuation Supervisory Levy Imposition Amendment Bill 2012. I am pleased to note that there is no dissenting report from this inquiry. The coalition is broadly supportive of any approach that reduces the administrative costs on employers and superannuation funds. Coming as I do from a background in the telecommunications industry, an industry which is characterised by extensive transmission of data between different players using information technologyincluding, for example, the mobile number portability arrangements under which end users can have their number moved from one telecommunications carrier to another within a matter of hours using extensive and efficient transmission of data-I was somewhat surprised to discover that in the superannuation sector there is still very heavy use of paper based transactions. The inefficiencies which result from that are clear to any Australian who has ever sought to move their superannuation balance from one provider to another. Therefore, the fundamental rationale underpinning this bill is one that the coalition supports. However, it is not correct to say the coalition has no concerns about the way the legislation has been framed, and I want, in the brief time available to me, to highlight a couple of points that were made in the committee report, noting again that it is a joint report and the concerns were therefore, to that extent, shared by all members of the committee. The first thing I want to highlight is that the bill is riddled with strict liability provisions. Unsurprisingly, a number of submitters to the committee raised concerns about the compliance regime. The Financial Services Council, for example, submitted that the proposed compliance measures for SuperStream are 'overly severe' and suggested that the penalty regime be reconsidered. A particular concern which emerged during the committee's deliberations was the potential for the impact upon employers, and particularly small employers, given the nature of these strict liability provisions. Consider, for example, the position of a small business owner who is diligently seeking to discharge her obligations to pay superannuation for a handful of employees. She pays the amount required and pays it on time. However, the effect of the strict liability provisions in this bill is that, if this small business owner fails to include all of the items of data that are required under the standards, it is open to the regulator to prosecute her. Because the provisions are strict liability, it is not a defence for her to say that she thought that she was doing the right thing and that it was an inadvertent mistake born of the complexity of the reporting requirements. The Australian Taxation Office confirmed during the committee proceedings that this was certainly possible under the legislation as drafted. It was somewhat pleasing to note the advice of the Australian Taxation Office that it has some administrative flexibility to waive or limit penalties where employers attempt to comply with the data standards but commit inadvertent technical breaches. However, the coalition will be keeping a close eye on the conduct of the Australian Taxation Office as regulator to ensure that its actual behaviour is as understanding as the assurances that it gave to the committee. The other matter that I would like to address is one that was also addressed by the member for Robertson: the size of the levy which is being imposed upon industry participants to pay for the IT, information technology, changes that are required to give effect to these arrangements. The coalition is concerned about the size of this levy. The parties who appeared before the committee raised substantial concerns about how much money is being levied. The Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees indicated at the hearing that the levy will mean a lot of short-term pain for a long-term Non-compliance gain. To date there has not been enough information provided by either Treasury or the Australian Taxation Office about how the money will be spent and why the amount is so large. The peak body of the superannuation funds, the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia, indicated that the amount that they, in their own experience, have spent developing complex IT systems is of much smaller magnitude than the sums which the Australian Taxation Office has indicated that it needs to develop its new IT systems. Given that developing IT systems and operating them is a core business function for superannuation funds, that advice from the superannuation funds and their peak body appearing before the committee is advice which, in my view, should be taken very seriously. The Australian Taxation Office needs to do a better job of justifying why it requires so much money to fund these information technology systems. That is a matter the coalition will continue to monitor closely. Let me conclude by repeating that the coalition is broadly supportive of any approach that reduces the administrative costs inherent in the superannuation system. We do, however, have concerns about aspects of the implementation of these new arrangements as I have just described. Economics Committee Report",53
32,Ms OWENS,COMMITTEES," On behalf of the Standing Committee on Economics I present the committee's advisory report on the Passenger Movement Charge Amendment Bill 2012, the Tax Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No. 2) Bill 2012, the Income Tax (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Amendment Bill 2012 and the Pay As You Go Withholding Tax Bill 2012, incorporating a dissenting report, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee. In accordance with standing order 39(f) the report was made a parliamentary paper.",55
33,Ms OWENS,COMMITTEES,"by leave-The bills make a number of significant improvements to the tax laws across five areas, each of which the committee examined during the inquiry. Schedule 1 of the Tax Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No. 2) Bill 2012 and of the Pay As You Go Withholding Noncompliance Tax Bill 2012 seeks to make directors personally liable for their companies' unpaid superannuation guarantee amounts. This will prevent unscrupulous directors from phoenixing their businesses to avoid their super responsibilities. This practice has cost Australian employees hundreds of millions of dollars in lost superannuation. The committee commends both the intent and the operation of the bills in this regard. Last year, the committee inquired into a package of bills in similar terms. The committee recommended that the government should investigate whether additional defences for directors could be inserted in the bills. This has occurred. If passed, the legislation will give new directors 30 days-that is up from the current 14 days-to conduct due diligence before adopting a company's pre-existing obligations. Directors will also not be liable for a direct penalty where they took reasonable care in a matter and applied the super legislation in a reasonable way. The committee also recommended that the government should investigate whether the provision should only apply if an individual has been engaged in phoenixing. The bills do not have this feature, and industry argue that they should be amended along these lines. Ultimately, the committee has come to the view that such a change is not warranted. The provisions will only apply when a company has not only failed to pay a super amount but failed to notify the Australian Taxation Office of this within two months of the event. The provisions are only triggered by a consistent high level of non-compliance. Schedule 2 of the main bill is designed to ensure that the tax treatment of financial arrangements is consistent with the TOFA tax timing rules. The provisions are to be retrospective from the commencement of other TOFA amendments on 1 July 2010, and this retrospectivity was the key issue in the inquiry. Stakeholders expressed concern that taxpayers who had chosen to adopt the new TOFA rules, rather than elect to keep prior arrangements, would be disadvantaged. However, the committee accepts that the measures restore the original policy intent and that the government had previously flagged that retrospectivity will be necessary with TOFA to restore the policy intent from time to time. Schedule 3 aims to protect a $6 billion revenue risk that has arisen as a result of retrospective amendments in 2010 in relation to consolidation rules. These changes allowed consolidated groups to claim deductions back to 2002 in relation to the residual tax cost-setting rule and the rights future income rule. In 2011, revenue problems with the 2010 changes became apparent and the Board of Taxation conducted an inquiry into the matter. The bill largely reflects the Board of Taxation's report. Groups that have already received a refund or who have an ATO ruling will generally be protected from the retrospective changes. Given the transparency of the process and the amount of revenue at stake, the committee again accepts that retrospective legislation is appropriate. The Income Tax (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Amendment Bill 2012 and schedule 4 of the main bill increase the tax rate on managed investment trusts for foreign investors from 7.5 per cent to 15 per cent. This is a partial reversal of the recent decreases on this tax rate from 30 per cent a few years ago. The committee is mindful that, for equity investments, the comparison rate is the company tax rate, currently set at 30 per cent. The committee noted that the industry sector was concerned about how the change would affect it. However, the committee accepts the government's argument of the wider macroeconomic importance of Australia having a sound fiscal strategy, an important driver for the whole economy. The Passenger Movement Charge Amendment Bill 2012 increases the charge from $47 to $55 from 1 July 2012 and indexes it to the consumer price index. Similar to the managed investment trust provisions, the issues revolved around an industry sector being concerned about how it would be affected by a revenue increase. Once again, however, the committee supports the provisions on a national basis because of the government's overall fiscal strategy. The committee notes that the government remains committed to the Tourism 2020 initiative and continues to to support the industry through programs such as T-QUAL, infrastructure upgrades and maintaining and expanding tourism attractions. The bills represent a responsible package aimed at securing a sustainable revenue base for Australia as well as protecting the superannuation entitlements of Australian workers. The bills should pass. On behalf of the committee I think the organisations that assisted the committee during the inquiry through making submissions or participating in the hearing in Canberra. I also thank my colleagues on the committee for their contribution to the report. I commend the report to the House.",55
34,Mr CIOBO,COMMITTEES," by leave-I rise to speak on the advisory report on the Passenger Movement Charge Amendment Bill 2012, the Tax Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No. 2) Bill 2012, the Income Tax (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Amendment Bill 2012 and the Pay As You Go Withholding Non-compliance Tax Bill 2012. There was, as the chair outlined to the House, a dissenting report from coalition members with respect to each of the bills insofar is our recommendation as Liberal members on the committee that the bills not be passed by the House in the current form but, rather, require change. The Tax Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No. 2) Bill 2012 and the Pay As You Go Withholding Non-compliance Tax Bill 2012 amend the Taxation Administration Act 1953 and four other acts to extend director penalties so that directors are personally liable for a wide range of company guarantees in relation to superannuation and pay-as-you-go withholding even if a company is placed into administration or liquidation. Liberal members of the committee are concerned that the government has not adequately addressed bipartisan concerns previously raised during the last inquiry into the measures. Importantly, the bill has failed to appropriately target phoenix activity and concerns that liability would apply indiscriminately to all directors, including those of charities and not-for-profits that limited by guarantee, as many are. There are some 11,700 companies in Australia that are limited by guarantee. It is typical of this Labor government, unfortunately, that directors would appear to be saddled with liabilities even where there is no illegitimate activity or undue liability. Questions were raised in the inquiry about whether the directors of the company may be liable to pay these measures if they join a board after the fact, and these questions were not adequately answered. It is repugnant not only to the rule of law and the processes of natural justice but also in terms of assigning all directors an indiscriminate liability, the history of company law and the legal principle of persona ficta. The Australian Institute of Company Directors and many other stakeholders as it contend-and Liberal members of the committee concur-that phoenix activity is not appropriately defined in the bill. We as Liberal members were concerned about the need to do something with phoenixing activity. It is just that this approach is too broad and not effective in terms of its operation-and that is why we are not supporting the government's steps in this respect. The consolidation tax, cost-setting arrangements and related taxation of financial arrangements are retrospective tax changes. Liberal members of the committee are fundamentally opposed to post factum law, especially taxation legislation. This government has failed to justify both to the public and to members of the committee the retrospective aspect of this legislation. Similarly, issues arise under the Income Tax (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Amendment Bill 2012, which amends the Income Tax Managed Investment Tax Withholding Act 2008 to increase the managed investment trust are withholding tax from 7.5 per cent to 15 per cent. Both investments made, especially in infrastructure, and the reputation of Australia as a safe and stable place will now be placed at risk because of the facilitation of the government. Taxpayers who made a sound effort to comply with the prevailing law as it was when they entered into financial arrangements are particularly affected. In submissions made to the committee there were instances of entities that, with these changes in place, may not have entered into financial agreements outlined. Fundamentally it is a function of the mismanagement and, in our view, incompetence of the government that only serves to encourage the lack of certainty that already plagues public confidence. Finally, the Passenger Movement Charge Amendment Bill 2012 increases the passenger movement charge from $47 to $55 from 1 July this year and indexes the charge to the consumer price index from 1 July next year. This is simply a revenue-raising measure and presents an enormous cost to the tourism sector not only directly but also in terms of the relative competitive disadvantage that it will present. Liberal members of the committee are gravely concerned that, at a time when Australia's tourism industry is already struggling, at a time when Australia has gone from being an exporter of tourism to being a multibillion dollar importer of tourism, this government is flying blind with respect to the extra impost it is putting on the industry. It is particularly obnoxious for an industry that employs roughly 500,000 Australians that this government would continue to reduce funding to that industry in real terms and at the same time impose an extra $600 million to $800 million of new tourism taxes. This is not good public policy. This is nothing other than a money-grabbing exercise from a government that has completely eroded Australia's fiscal position and now must lash out with new taxes on an industry that can ill afford it. It is a bad policy choice and all Australians involved in the tourism industry, directly or indirectly, know it to be exactly that. Migration Committee Report",57
35,Ms VAMVAKINOU,COMMITTEES," On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration, I present the committee's advisory report on the Migration (Visa Evidence) Charge Bill 2012 and the Migration Visa Evidence Charge (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2012. In accordance with standing order 39(f) the report was made a parliamentary paper.",58
36,Ms VAMVAKINOU,COMMITTEES,"by leave-It gives me pleasure today to present the advisory report of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration on the Migration (Visa Evidence) Charge Bill 2012 and the Migration Visa Evidence Charge (Consequential Amendments) 2012. These bills were referred to the migration committee by the Selection Committee on 10 May 2012. The bills will introduce a charge for the issuing of hard-copy evidence that a visa is held by a non-citizen visa holder. Evidence in hard-copy form that such a person holds a visa is usually provided as a visa label or as an imprint placed in the visa holder's passport. Currently Australia does not charge a fee for issuing these visa labels and the Department of Immigration and Citizenship provided over one million labels or imprints during 2011. Despite the issue of these labels, the government actually relies on an electronic visa entitlement verification system, called VEVO, to validate a person's visa status and entitlements online. VEVO is also accessible to registered organisations which may need to verify a person's visa status as well as to visa holders themselves. According to the department, two-thirds of its current visa case load is processed electronically. Yet 90 per cent of clients at migration counters still request hard-copy evidence of their visa even though it is not necessary. Currently, visa holders are entitled under the Migration Act to hard-copy evidence of their visa status. These bills will amend the Migration Act to introduce a charge for the issue of hard-copy evidence, on the basis that the electronic visa evidence accessible through VEVO makes the need for hardcopy evidence redundant. The charge is to discourage people requesting the hard-copy evidence. The maximum charge limit will be $250, although the department has indicated that the actual amount charged will be much less. There will be different scales of charges, exemptions to the charges and nil fees for certain visa classes. The department estimates that the charge will recover some $90 million over the three years following implementation. The Selection Committee and members of the migration committee questioned the scale of the charges, the projected revenue to be raised and whether the electronic VEVO system really does replace the need for hardcopy evidence of visas. The committee conducted its inquiry by issuing questions on notice to the Department of Immigration and Citizenship. The list of questions asked is contained in the appendix to the committee's report. The committee was satisfied overall with the department's responses. The committee accepts that the main justification for introducing the fees is to encourage visa holders and registered organisations to accept electronic verification alone. This is part of a global transition towards visa-labelquestions. free travel and electronic confirmation of visas. The committee has recommended that the legislation be passed. However, the committee does believe that the associated explanatory memoranda should be more comprehensive. Accordingly, we have recommended that the explanatory memoranda be expanded and retabled. I would like to thank my colleagues on the committee for their work on this inquiry, especially the deputy chair, the member for Macquarie. I commend the report to the House. Mrs MARKUS (Macquarie) (12:42): by leave-I rise to speak to the advisory report on the Migration (Visa Evidence) Charge Bill 2012 and the Migration Visa Evidence Charge (Consequential Amendments) 2012. When the bills were referred to the Joint Standing Committee on Migration on 10 May, the principal concern, as the chair has noted already, was the inadequate explanation of the scope, rationale and costing methodologies for the charge in the explanatory memoranda associated with the legislation. I wish to note that the report is joint in nature and supported by coalition members. The coalition is broadly supportive of a shift in favour of electronic visa handling and is pleased that the government has indicated that this is the direction in which the administration of visas is heading. Given the current political climate, the Australian community would be interested to know of the bipartisan approach that both I and the chair of the committee, the member for Calwell, took to this legislation. I thank the member and the other members of the committee for their level of cooperation. I would also like to thank the Department of Immigration and Citizenship for its assistance in responding to the committee's The visa evidence charge bills amend the Migration Act 1958 to introduce a charge for requests for evidence of the issuance of a visa as validation of a noncitizen's immigration status and entitlements in Australia. The new charge is intended to encourage visa holders to use the Department of Immigration and Citizenship's online visa entitlement verification system, known as VEVO, for visa validation. Currently, visa evidence is provided without a fee, which imposes an administrative and cost burden on the department. As mentioned previously, the committee required a clear indication of the number and type of visa subclasses to be affected by the measure and further explanation of the maximum charge limit of $250 and the $90 million, three-year revenue projection cited in the financial impact statements for the bills. According to government figures, a total of 1.365 million visa labels were issued the calendar year 2011. By any measure this represents an incredibly high volume of service undertaken at immigration counters both in Australia and overseas. I note that, based on the estimated revenue of $90 million over three years, the government is estimating that the number of evidences would decline by more than 90 per cent to around 120,000 per year. While I note that this is a bit of an ambitious estimate, the coalition and the committee support a move towards more efficient and cost-effective procedures for the visa process. As the chair has already mentioned, it is the recommendation of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration that the Department of Immigration and Citizenship amend the explanatory memoranda for both bills to more clearly explain the policy rationale costing methodology underpinning measures contained in the bills. With the passing of these bills, the committee urges the department to remain responsive, particularly to the needs of client groups, such as refugees, students and visa holders in countries that require visa evidence and transit, who will be vulnerable under transition. As the chair has noted, it finding of the committee that the bill would not act as a barrier to participation should visa evidence be required. If the government is serious about generating efficiencies in the immigration budget, it would be a good idea to adopt good policy such as these migration visa evidence charge bills. The report is supported jointly in a bipartisan fashion, and I commend the report to the House. Climate Change, Environment and the Arts Committee Report",58
37,Mr ZAPPIA,COMMITTEES," On behalf of the Standing Committee on Climate over Change, Environment and the Arts, I seek leave to make a statement on the Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Amendment (Scheme Enhancements) Bill 2012 in discharge of the committee's requirement to provide an advisory report on the bill, and to present a copy of my statement. Leave granted.",60
38,Mr ZAPPIA,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Standing Committee on Climate Change, Environment and the Arts I make this statement, the content of which the committee has endorsed. The Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Amendment (Scheme Enhancements) Bill 2012 was introduced in the House on 23 May 2012. The following day, following the recommendation of the Selection Committee, the bill was referred to and the Standing Committee on Climate Change, Environment and the Arts for consideration. The bill amends the Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Act 2005. In presenting the bill, the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, Mr Burke, for exit made some remarks about the Water the Efficiency Labelling and Standardsis the WELS-scheme, which was established in 2006, and its objectives: to conserve water supplies by reducing water consumption, to provide information for purchasers of wateruse and water-savings products and to promote the adoption of efficient and effective water-use and water-savings technology. Further information on the scheme and the ways in which changes are proposed are outlined in more detail in the explanatory memorandum to the bill. Many were canvassed by the minister in his second reading speech, and I do not propose to take up more of the House's time in repeating statements that have already been made. In short, the bill proposes amendments arising from an independent review of the scheme conducted in 2010 in accordance with the original legislation. The amendments concern matters relating to governance, compliance, administration and funding arrangements for the scheme. In his second reading speech, the minister noted that the scheme 'receives widespread support from the industries affected by that, further, 'This bill has been developed taking into account extensive consultations with stakeholders as to the nature of the changes proposed.' As part of its inquiry, the committee received a private briefing from representatives of the Department of Sustainability, Environment, Population and Communities about the bill and its impacts. During the briefing the committee was made aware of the consultation process conducted by the department, and the committee notes that most of the submissions received are available on the department's website. Given the uncontroversial nature of the bill and the level of stakeholder consultation that has taken place to date, the committee has determined that a more detailed level of inquiry is unnecessary. The committee therefore recommends that the House pass the bill. NA Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Amendment Bill 2012 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. to which the following amendment was moved: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House notes that if the Government was genuinely committed to achieving equality for working women, it would adopt the Coalition's better, fairer Paid Parental Leave scheme.""",60
39,Ms BRODTMANN,BILLS," The Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Amendment Bill 2012 introduces a number of significant innovations aimed at improving gender equality. It will broaden it' and the Equal Opportunity Act 2010 to encompass women and men, particularly their caring responsibilities. Also, for the first time, employers will be required to report on the gender composition of their boards. This is particularly dear to my heart, and I am very pleased that it is included in Water, the bill. Smaller organisations with fewer than 100 employees will not be required to report, but they will be able to access the Workplace Gender Equality Agency's advice, education and incentive activities. It is important to note that reporting will now be made easier for businesses and that it will be more meaningful and useful to them. Contrary to what those opposite have said, the minimum standards have been developed in consultation with industry and will provide employers with the capacity to assess and understand gender equality within their workplaces compared year by year with other workplaces within the industry. We are removing red tape by allowing businesses to report online. The requirement for organisations to develop workplace programs will also be removed, and employers will now report against a set of gender equality indicators focusing on outcomes for both women and men in the workplace. Over time, the improved and standardised data will enable the minister to set minimum standards to target attention on areas where improvements are most needed. Minimum standards would be intended as an evidence-based way to identify and focus assistance on employers that require some direction on gender equality. I am sure that, through this new reporting mechanism, many businesses will be able to focus more on gender equality, which will have a long-term benefit for their business. We want this bill to make reporting simpler and more useful for business so that business can achieve measurable progress. Many businesses may not be aware that, for example, having more women on their board will bring a different perspective to problems and issues that arise. I have spoken to many crusty old men on boards who are really appreciative of the views women can bring to the table on a whole range of issues, such as disability and access. I am sure that they would not mind me calling them 'crusty old men', because they are the ones who brought these issues up and have acknowledged, themselves, that they are crusty old men. Mr Hartsuyker interjecting Mr Alexander interjecting",61
40,Ms BRODTMANN,BILLS,"These are men who I have been on boards with in the past. They are wonderful men with a wealth of experience and expertise, and I am sure they would not mind me calling them that. They get it. They understand that greater diversity on their boards is in their companies' best interests. They understand it is a good thing. We need to help more businesses realise this potential. It is reassuring that the big four banks are actually leading the way when it comes to increasing the number of women on boards. Other sectors doing well include diversified financials, telecommunications, transportation and insurance. However, companies engaged in commercial and professional services, consumer services and our big retailers rate poorly. Another important element of this bill will enhance the agency's advisory and education functions. One of the functions of the agency will be to develop industry based benchmarks in relation to gender equality indicators. The agency will also have a more specified role in providing assistance and advice in relation to improving performance against any minimum standards, and it will have an important role in developing, maintaining and reporting on the data it collects across business, government and the community. This bill improves the transparency and fairness of the compliance framework and the consequences of non-compliance, but it does not actually alter the compliance from the original legislation-the legislation introduced by the Howard government. Contrary to suggestions by those opposite, we have not changed it. More resources will mean the agency will be able to better ensure that all employers who should be reporting are actually reporting. The agency will be able to do small-scale compliance reviews to make sure employers are fulfilling their obligations under the act. Employers will be required to inform employees and shareholders that a report has been lodged, and employers will need to notify employees and employee organisations of the report's lodgement and be provided with an opportunity to comment. A consequence of not complying with the act without any reasonable excuse is that in the company or business may be named in parliament or more widely. Fairer, more consistent measures for ensuring that the government deals only with organisations that comply with the act will be developed. It is important to outline exactly what new objectives of the Workplace Gender Equality Act will be. The key new principal objectives are to: promote and improve gender equality, including remuneration between women and men, in employment and in the workplace; support employers to remove barriers to the full and equal participation of women in the workforce, in recognition of disadvantaged position of women in relation to employment matters; promote amongst employers the elimination of discrimination on the basis of gender in relation to employment matters, including in relation to family and caring responsibilities; foster workplace consultation between employers and employees on issues concerning gender equality in employment and in the workplace; and improve the productivity and competitiveness of Australian business through the advancement of gender equality in employment and in the workplace. These new objectives are more far-reaching and put the focus more on gender equality in the workplace. The bill now strikes the right balance between the need to drive and encourage change within business, without increasing the regulatory burden. Those opposite might try to argue against the qualities of this bill. They may try to argue it is not necessary legislation and that these are not issues our parliament should be concerned with. But I disagree. There has been extensive consultation with industry, employee organisations and the women's sector in the drafting of this legislation. There is a need for this legislation and we have reached a point where the all parties are comfortable with what we are proposing. This is progressive legislation. It is legislation that will take Australian businesses forward and help shape the kind of workforce we want for the future. It is not the good enough that in 2012 Australia is ranked 23rd on the World Economic Forum's 2011 Global Gender Gap Index, way behind countries like New Zealand, Cuba and Spain. equal It is not good enough that the average superannuation balance for Australian women is 40 per cent below that of men, with average payouts half those of men. It is time to take the necessary steps forward to the address this gap before it gets any worse. As I mentioned earlier, this bill is the result of an important review by the Office for Women in the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. It is clear that gender equality is essential if we are to maximise Australia's productive potential and ensure continued economic growth. As I said earlier, it has been estimated that closing the gap between men's and women's workforce participation could boost gross domestic product by 13 per cent. That really is the bottom line here. Gender equality is not just a social policy; it is an economic policy. The government is determined to improve women's economic security-and this begins with fair and equitable treatment in the workplace. It is simply good economics to improve gender equality in our workplaces, and this bill does so by placing gender equality in the workplace firmly under the spotlight. This is a sophisticated and meaningful package of reforms. It is a significant step forward that will enable employers and the government to measure and drive better outcomes for women and men in Australian workplaces. I commend the bill to the House.",62
41,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS," I thank the member for Canberra, and as an 'evergreen' male, rather than another adjective, I call the member for Mackellar. Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP (Mackellar) (12:58): On 9 March, when this legislation originally surfaced, I said when I was acting spokesman on the status of women that this new so-called diversity regime was the sort of thing you would expect from a totalitarian regime which would lead to 'tokenism and the promotion of women simply because they are women'. I further described the proposal as 'heavy-handed, half baked and wasting $11.2 million', which was part of an agenda to strip away the rights of employers to run their businesses efficiently and employ people on merit. I stand by those comments. It is interesting to take a look at the explanatory memorandum prepared by the government to support this bill and read some of the interesting material that is in it, which actually undermines the manner in which the government is attacking this issue of equality in the workplace, which we on this side of the House thoroughly support. We acknowledge that the contribution of women in the workforce is essential to the performance of our economy. But the snapshot proposals that are published in the government's own explanatory memorandum make statements like: Women are more likely to be clerical, sales and community and personal service workers, while men are more likely to be technicians and trades workers, machinery operators and drivers and labourers. Women are still substantially underrepresented in the manual trades in Australia, with the number of women in manual trades being less than 2 per cent. Australian women are more likely to work under minimum conditions and be engaged in low-paid, casual and part-time work. It says: Women workers are concentrated in the sectors of health care and social assistance and education and training (30 per cent of all female hours worked). When combined with the retail industry, 44 per cent per cent of total female hours worked are concentrated in just three industries. There is not a single industry in Australia in which women are paid more than men. It also says: A woman is approximately 50 per cent less likely to be employed as a manager, despite being equally likely to be in a full-time role in a professional capacity. I think those comments are very pertinent in setting the scene to take me back to a report in December 2006 of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Human Services, which I chaired, entitled Balancing work and family: report on the inquiry into balancing work and family. It was in that report that we made many important findings which are very supportive of the policy which is referred to in the amendment moved to this bill by the member for Farrer stating: … whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House notes that if the Government was genuinely committed to achieving equality for working women, it would adopt the Coalition s better, fairer Paid Parental Leave scheme … which of course has something on the poor leave scheme that the government has put in place-minimum payments only and only for a lesser period of time than the coalition proposes. It also includes superannuation payments, which, of course, the government does not include. In that report that I referred to we took evidence from a vast number of people, but one was from the Family Matters journal, where Matthew Gray and Professor Bruce Chapman investigated the issues of average loss of income for a hypothetical woman who completes secondary school and then commences having a family at the age of 25 with the option of further children. They said the simple fact of having a child reduces a woman's lifetime chance of being employed by seven per cent. The authors calculated that on average this hypothetical woman would lose 37 per cent of her lifetime earnings by having a child. They said the results for women with differing levels of education are similar. They went on to talk about the weekly earnings of an average employee who faces a decision, five years after finishing their education, whether to finish work, do part-time work or continue to work full time. They said employees who stay full time continue to increase their earning capacity. Those who change to part-time work or plateau and employees who leave the workforce face a reduced salary when they return, with the reduction increasing for the amount of time out of a job. In other words, at every turn there is enough evidence to say that real policies to see women remain in the workforce are gauged at enabling them to have a child, to be able to provide for that child in those early weeks with good financial backup and to feel that they can then go back into the workforce and not miss out on the important aspects that lead to increases in pay and not plateauing. I think it is interesting to look at the statistics that came from one of the witnesses who gave evidence to us about what happens to women when they are using the education they have gained in more professional and higher-paid jobs. For instance, the Association of Professional Engineers, Scientists and Managers Australia noted that, of their female membership, 69 per cent did not have children. By comparison, the current estimate for the Australian population generally is that 16 per cent of women are likely to remain childless. They said the very high proportion of childless female professionals found in the association's surveys reflects the reality that professional women with children are leaving the workforce or reducing their level of workforce participation due to family responsibilities. It highlights one of the main reasons the government likes to criticise the proposed paid parental leave scheme that we are introducing and that would allow women to have 26 weeks at their replacement wage of up to $75,000: it would mean that we are acknowledging that there is important economic empowerment in higher-paid jobs as well as for those who are in lesser-paid jobs. This sort of inverted snobbery that the government likes to engage in does not recognise more women are now graduating from university than men. This potential to waste that education remains unrecognised by the government and, worse than that, in this legislation potential employers are being penalised. The sort of additional red tape that this legislation imposes in its reporting requirements and the potential for so-called union involvement in investigating what is happening in small firms in particular means that people are going to be less likely to want to employ women at a higher level because of the nature of the legislation. I go to the point that we make: the failure to recognise that we want women who are utilising tertiary education to be able to do it in a way that they do not lose their place, dare I say it, in the pecking order. When you look at the penalties that this legislation intends to impose upon firms, the Minister for the Status of Women has said: Government trade with a non-compliant organisation will not just be discouraged, it will not be allowed by law. Non-compliant companies will miss out on industry assistance, grants and government contractsand they will be non-compliant if they fall short of industry benchmarks or fail to improve over a two-year period. They will also be in breach of the rules if they fail to lodge a report as required, or fail to substantiate their report. The fact of the matter is that this is to apply to any firm with 100 employees or more. These are the firms where we would hope that women with high qualifications would be seeking employment, yet the explanatory memorandum of government's bill points out: The workforce participation of mothers in Australia is low by international standards. Of Australian mothers with their youngest child under two, 82 per cent worked part-time and nearly half (45 per cent) worked 15 hours or less per week.43 The main barrier to full participation in paid work for women is difficulty balancing paid work and care responsibilities. That is precisely what the opposition's policy is: to solve these problems so that women can continue in the paid workforce, utilise the education that they have acquired and see the statistics change so that they are not concentrated in the low-paid areas but are utilising that education to move up. Red tape and penalising firms by preventing them from having government contracts is not the way to go. Nor is pumping $11.2 million of taxpayers' money into creating yet another piece of bureaucracy, this time called the Workplace Gender Equality Agency. It may be a make-work program for a number of people in the public sector to have yet another quango, but the fact of the matter is it is not going to assist women who are coming through education, as I said, at a greater rate than men in tertiary qualifications, yet this is not yet being reflected in workplace attainment. The way forward is certainly not the red tape way in which this heavy-handed legislation is proceeding, but by accepting that the legislation-which, should we be elected, the opposition will introduce in government-for a fairer paid parental leave scheme will be one that will give real assistance to women to utilise their skills and not to find themselves plateaued or, indeed, falling behind and not making full use of those skills. Indeed, when we did this report back in 2006-and I have mentioned this before in a speech-we commissioned Access Economics to do an appraisal of the women's participation in the workforce and what will happen if we do not improve the number of women who are in full-time work as distinct from part-time or indeed failing to participate. The Access Economics report is at the back of the report I mentioned, and it simply shows that unless we do increase the number of women moving from part-time work into full-time work our economy will be seriously disadvantaged. So I say to the minister and I say particularly to women on the government side, particularly those who have got here by affirmative action: you do tend to make yourself a permanent second-class citizen if that is the way you wish to proceed. Women in Australia, as I see them, see that there is an opportunity to succeed on merit and to have the opportunity to utilise the skills that they are gaining. But it is not being done and it is not being helped by this heavy-handed legislation that is before the House. I ask the government to reconsider the way it views women as being a political tool, and start looking at them as individuals who want to achieve and who aspire to contribute to the overall economy as well as being fine parents. Any publication you pick up about parenting shows that the number 1 concern people have when make their decision as to whether or not they wish to become parents is whether or not they can financially provide for that child. This sort of heavy-handed legislation does nothing to alleviate those concerns, but the splendid policy that has been put forward by the opposition for a fairer form of paid parental leave does answer many of those questions, and I would commend our policy rather than the government's as the way to proceed. Mrs D'ATH (Petrie) (13:13): I rise to speak in support of the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Amendment Bill 2012, and I wish to briefly pick up on the point that the member for Mackellar just raised-that is, what many women, particularly mothers, are concerned about is making sure that they can make ends meet in relation to those cost of living pressures when you have a family. Certainly, as a member of this government I am very proud of our record of what we have delivered for working families-not just the paid parental leave but the dads' and partners' leave that has recently been introduced. You can also look at the increases to the family tax benefit B, the increases to the childcare benefit and the new schoolkid's bonus, just to name a small number of improvements this Labor government has made for working families and working women. I know, as do all women of this parliament, how far we have come as a nation to instil quality in the workforce. The Labor Party has a very proud history of promoting and protecting equality, and with this amendment bill we aim to promote and improve gender equality in the workplace by recognising the vital importance of equal remuneration and family and caring responsibilities as central to the achievement of gender equality. Equality is core to the belief and purpose of the Labor Party, which was forged over 120 years ago out of a collective struggle for equality in the workplace, and as a government we have amended or introduced over 100 Commonwealth acts that eliminate discrimination. It is well over a decade since the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Act was last reviewed and the economic, social and legislative landscape has changed significantly throughout that period. That is why Labor has acted. The former Minister for the Status of Women, the Hon. Tanya Plibersek, initiated a comprehensive review of the legislation and of the status of women and men in the workplace. That review found that the act needed to be updated and modernised to be fully effective in supporting and driving change in Australian workplaces. I believe that gender equality in Australian workplaces is important for women, men, business and the economy more broadly. It has been estimated that closing the gap between women's and men's workforce participation could boost Australia's GDP by up to 13 per cent. Furthermore, extensive consultation has been undertaken with industry, employer organisations and the women's sector in the drafting of this legislation. We went to the people who will be directly affected by this legislation to find out what their needs are. That is why with this bill we have made sure that these changes are comprehensive, starting with the amendment of the name of the act to the Workplace Gender Equality Act 2012 to emphasise the focus of the act on gender equality, thereby improving outcomes for both women and men in the workplace. The name of the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Agency has also changed to the Workplace Gender Equality Agency and the title of the director of the agency has changed to the Director of Workplace Gender Equality to reflect the new focus of the act. The objects of the act will highlight the expanded coverage to men, particularly in relation to caring responsibilities, as well as highlighting the importance of equal remuneration to gender equality. I think this is very important because in listening to the member for Mackellar's statement on this bill, at no point was it acknowledged that bill actually picks up on men's caring responsibilities and equality across genders. The objects also make clear the underpinning nature of gender equality to improved competitiveness and productivity, and the particular need to focus on removing barriers to women's full and equal workforce participation. Thus, this proposed legislation presents a new framework for promoting and encouraging gender equality in Australian workplaces. The bill fulfils a dual purpose of supporting improved workforce participation, particularly of women and carers, as well as reducing the regulatory burden on business. We heard the member for Mackellar claiming that this bill actually increases the burden, but this bill does not introduce more compliance measures, it is based on the compliance measures in the existing legislation, which the Howard government introduced. There has been some criticism raised about this bill creating too much red tape, but in fact the compliance measures in this bill allow for processes to be filled out online-and they are simple to fill in-which has been included at the request of business. It was business in the consultation period that identified that this type of compliance system was preferred and that is what this bill proposes, so I recommend that the members of the opposition actually go and consult with those employers about red tape and compliance because this change in the bill has come about as a consequence of what employers are asking for. Relevant employers will no longer need to provide descriptions of their policies and programs, but will report against gender equality indicators, focussing on tangible outcomes and practices. Reporting, while clearly easier for business, will also be more meaningful and useful. It will provide employers with the capacity to assess and understand gender equality within their this workplaces, compared year by year and with other workplaces within their industry. The agency's advisory and education functions will be enhanced. The contemporary data focus will allow the agency to see and target advice and education as effectively as possible as particular sectoral or industry issues emerge. Smaller organisations-those with fewer than 100 employees-will not be required to report, but will be able to access the agency's expertise and expanded online resources. Over time, the improved and standardised data set will assist the minister in setting industry specific minimum standards against the gender equality indicators. The minister will consult with relevant stakeholders, as she sees appropriate, in the setting of those minimum standards. These minimum standards will help the agency maximise the impact of its education and advice. The bill provides that the agency must provide any employers who fail to meet the minimum standard with assistance aimed specifically at improving their performance against that minimum standard. We heard from the member for Mackellar claiming that it is all about a big stick in cases when a particular employer does not meet the minimum standard, but what this bill does is provide those employers with assistance aimed at specifically improving their performance and meeting those standards. In addition to the minister setting these minimum standards, the agency will set benchmarks in relation to the gender equality indicators, in consultation with relevant stakeholders, which will not be part of the compliance framework. The benchmarks are intended as a way for the agency to collect, analyse and express the data collected from public reports in a useful and meaningful way. These benchmarks will enable relevant employers to consider their workplace outcomes and practices in relation to their industry peers and compared to their own performance from year to year. The bill facilitates the engagement of senior management and employees. The chief executive officer, or equivalent, will be required to sign-off on organisations' reports. Consultation with employees is a defined gender equality indicator. This is to ensure that the legislation is not simply about filling out paperwork and reporting, it is about meeting real outcomes. The bill also improves the transparency and fairness of the compliance framework and the consequences of non-compliance. The agency will be able to check compliance by seeking information from employers relevant to compliance. Employees and shareholders will be provided with access to the report, and employees and employee organisations will be provided with opportunity to comment on the report. There is nothing wrong with employees having access to reports that relate to their workplace and benefits for women in the workplace. The consequences of non-compliance build on the existing provisions, but with a focus on improving transparency and consistency of application. If an employer does not comply, without a reasonable excuse, they may be named in a report to the minister or more broadly. Employers may also not be eligible to compete for Commonwealth contracts, grants or other financial assistance. This is an existing policy, but work is being done within government to ensure greater consistency and transparency in its application. To enable employers to have sufficient time to adapt to the new framework, the provisions of the bill are being phased in. The first full new reports will be due in 2014. The new framework will also enable the government, policymakers and the community to have access to better aggregate information about gender equality in Australian workplaces. The bill provides that the agency report every two years on progress relating to the gender equality indicators. The bill achieves a clear balance in addressing the needs of business by making reporting simpler and more streamlined, supported by a new online interface. It also, however, ensures a much greater focus on outcomes to effect genuine and sustainable change over time. The government has engaged in significant consultation with key stakeholders in developing the proposed legislation. In 2011, the government convened an implementation advisory group to assist with the improvements to the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Act 1999. Membership of the industry advisory group consists of key representatives from industry, unions and business, as well as experts in the fields of gender equality and workplace issues. This legislation is about supporting employers to achieve cultural change; it is not about punishing employers or setting unreasonable standards that they cannot meet. Since the bill was introduced on 1 March 2012, a number of organisations and individuals have indicated support for the changes to the legislation. This support has come from industry, employee organisations and the women's sector. This amendment is one piece of a broader Labor effort to build stronger and fairer partnerships in the workplace. I commend the bill to the House. Mrs ANDREWS (MCPherson) (13:23): I rise today to speak on the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Amendment Bill 2012 and I welcome the opportunity to speak specifically about the issue of gender equality in Australian workplaces. The bill being debated today seeks to amend the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Act 1999 by firstly changing the name of the act to the Workplace Gender Equality Act 2012, with the objects of the to be amended as wel1. The bill will expand the advice and education functions of the Workplace Gender Equality Agency, with changes also set to be made to the compliance framework for employers. The coverage of the act is set to be widened, with men being covered as well as women, and it is extended to all employers and employees in the workplace. The issue of gender equality is a very important issue for the coalition and is an issue which I personally find very significant, having graduated as a mechanical engineer and spent much of my professional working life in male-dominated industries. I would like to make it clear from the outset that women and men can and should contribute to all aspects of Australian life in their own ways. In relation to employment opportunities for men and women, I strongly believe that businesses should be employing, retaining and promoting individuals based on merit, not on their gender. It is a core belief of the coalition that government interference into the life of individuals and businesses should be minimised as much as possible. I therefore do not support efforts that seek to increase the level of government interference in the workplace. I would like to begin my contribution to this debate by highlighting several concerns have with this bill. I have already mentioned my objection to unnecessary government interference in businesses' ability to employ individuals based on their merit. I therefore have concerns that this bill may impose additional red tape for business and therefore unacceptable increased levels of regulation. The two main concerns that I have relate to the cost to business and whether the new reporting framework actually simplifies and streamlines the reporting requirements for employers. I also have concerns about act whether the Workplace Gender Equality Agency will have the necessary resources to carry out its expanded role, and why the new term 'employee organisation' is inserted into the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Act. In relation to the first issue I have, with regard to the costs to business, it seems unlikely that resourcing costs will decrease, as is claimed by the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. The changes proposed in this bill go further than the gender equality rules which apply now to ASX listed companies. Currently, ASX listed companies are required to comply with the ASX corporate governance principles and publish workplace gender diversity policies and have their objectives for achieving these policies disclosed each year. These companies are also required to release information that shows the proportion of women in the company and how many women are in senior management positions as well as on the organisation's board. The provisions of this bill should not be going further than the current obligations on companies, as it is likely that additional costs will be imposed on these businesses through the reporting requirements this bill proposes. The second concern that I have relates to the bill's proposal to simplify and streamline I reporting-however, it is not clear how the new reporting framework will achieve this goal. Under the proposed new reporting framework, employers must report against gender equality indicators. This must be a public report prepared by the employer and it is required to contain matters specified in the legislative instrument made by the minister. The bill, however, does not make it clear what 'matters' are to be specified and there is therefore uncertainty for employers about what they must report on under this proposed new framework. Because of this uncertainty it is difficult to see how reporting for employers will be simplified and streamlined. This brings me to the two additional concerns I have, which, again, deal with some uncertainty with what the bill seeks to achieve and the provisions' ability to achieve these aims. Firstly, the Workplace Gender Equality Agency is given expanded roles to provide targeted advice and assistance to relevant employers, so that they can promote and improve gender equality in relation to minimum standards. As this is an expanded role, it appears that the agency would require additional resources to effectively undertake this role; however, it is unclear from the whether these additional resources will be provided. Secondly, the term 'employee organisation' is already given meaning under section 12 of the Fair Work Act 2009; however, this bill also inserts a new term into the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Act. Clarification needs to be made in relation to this provision, as it seems unnecessary to include a new term when it already exists in the Fair Work Act. These are the technical issues with the bill; however, we must remember that there are larger issues relating to female participation in the workforce which deserve greater scrutiny. I would now like to highlight some recent statistics which give us an idea of how the current workforce as a whole looks. The recent labour force statistics from the Australian Bureau of Statistics give us a snapshot of the female participation rate in our workforce. I have picked a period from earlier this year. The participation rate for females during the February period, seasonally adjusted, was 58.7 per cent. This is significantly lower than the male participation rate during the same period, which was 71.7 per cent. I would also like to point out that the number of females employed in total for February is significantly lower compared with males. According to the ABS, there are over 5.2 million females employed, while there are over 6.2 million males employed. More than double the number of females are employed part time compared with males, with figures showing part-time female workers at about 2.374 million compared with just over one million males employed on a part-time basis. If we look at the employment of women in different industries, it becomes clear that there are specific industries where the employment of women is significantly lower compared with males. A look at 18 different bills industry groups reveals that only six industries have a majority of women employed either part time or full time. These industries are retail trade, with 56.4 per cent; accommodation and food services, with 55 per cent; financial and insurance services, with 50.9 per cent; administrative and support services, with 52.3 per cent; education and training, with 69 per cent; and health care and social assistance, with 78.8 per cent. A further seven industries have female part-time or full-time-equivalent employees at levels that are below 40 per cent: agriculture, forestry and fishing; mining; manufacturing; electricity, gas, water and waste services; construction; wholesale trade; and transport, postal and warehousing. The construction industry was at the lowest level, with women comprising only 11.6 per cent of employees. These statistics clearly demonstrate that we need to get more women into the workforce and improve their representations in industries almost across the board. I am an enthusiastic advocate for improvement in the labour participation rates for women and know that we can enhance our contributions to the economic and social well-being of Australia. In fact, earlier this year I raised these in this place and emphasised the need for work to be organised so family responsibilities can also be balanced. The figures I mentioned earlier regarding women predominantly taking up part-time work further justify my claim. In concluding today I repeat my call to break down the barriers impeding improved female participation rates in the workforce and getting women back into the workforce. If we are serious, we need to identify what those barriers are and we need to take positive action to encourage and support more women in maintaining their place in the workforce or re-entering the workforce. Two issues have been identified to me very clearly within the electorate and quite widely around Australia. The first issue is goodquality and affordable child care. The second is an issue that, as I have indicated previously, I have touched on already in this place-work organisation to make it more appropriate and more attractive for women with family responsibilities to re-enter the workforce.  to voice my strong support for the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Amendment Bill 2012. This bill is the next step in the Gillard government's assault on inequity and discrimination in Australian workplaces. On this side of the House we can hold our heads high in this regard. We have delivered Australia's first paid parental leave scheme, which provides real support to working mums and dads and their young families-truly momentous. This is not piein-the-sky stuff; it is a practical, fair and sustainable scheme that provides financial force assistance when they need it most. For women the road to equality has been a long and difficult one. Along this road we often take baby steps-and I use that term issues deliberately-but we are getting there. Australia was one of the first countries in the world to give women the right to vote and to sit in parliament. We were just pipped by New Zealand. After that, it was not until 1949 that our first female federal cabinet minister was appointed. That took 49 years. Up until 1966-which is not that long ago, as 1966 was when I was born-women working in the federal Public Service were required to resign when they married. In the last 50 years much has been achieved for women in equality in education, in the workplace and in things such as safe contraception and access to childcare facilities. In 1984 the federal government banned discrimination on the basis of sex. Today, more women than men are educated at secondary schools and universities and more women graduate from university with bachelor degrees. In 2006, women made up nearly 55 per cent of tertiary students and 47.5 per cent of students enrolled in vocational education and training courses. Forty per cent of Australia's small business operators are women and 57 per cent of the Australian Public Service are women, with around 36 per cent of senior executive positions. It is a different story in the private sector, where, sadly, only 12 per cent of management jobs are held by women. Progress is continuing but more needs to be done. Let's have a look at parliament: there are currently more women parliamentarians in the Senate than at any other time since Federation, with 28 women out of 76; but, sadly, the number of women in this chamber dropped at the last election and is now less than 25 per cent. So 111 years after Federation we are down to less than one in four members of this chamber being women. Of course, in the Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, we have Australia's first female Prime Minister, and likewise in Quentin Bryce we have Australia's first female Governor General-a proud Queenslander, as you know, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott. It is interesting to see how the Liberal National Premier of Queensland dealt with women in the workplace when he was the Lord Mayor of Brisbane. I have spoken about this with one of the councillors Moreton electorate and that is Councillor Nicole Johnston-now an Independent but previously a member of the Liberal Party. She was the councillor assisting Lord Mayor Campbell Newman, as he then was, before she decided that her job as a Liberal councillor for Tennyson required her to speak out on behalf of Sherwood residents about the bus depot that was rather hastily foisted on the local community. After Nicole dared to speak up and voice local community concerns, she says that she was frozen out Mr Newman. He refused to speak to her. Thankfully, she was re-elected, not for but as an Independent, at the recent council elections. Unfortunately, I have heard the now Premier Newman bagging the hard working Nicole Johnston to all and sundry. He was quite indiscreet, in fact, in the past. Perhaps things might change now that he is the Premier. This might suggest poor judgment, a personality flaw or a huge lack of respect for women; we will see. Obviously, Mr Newman has a long way to go if he wants all Queenslanders to believe that such treatment is behind him. In Queensland, of the 78 seats held by LNP, less than 17 per cent are female. The LNP's representation of women is in line with countries like Kazakhstan and Venezuela. Obviously it is not good for a modern political party to have such disregard for equality. There is no minister for women under the state LNP government, and who knows what they will axe next? We will wait and see. There are still some sections of the community-both broadly known and smaller pockets-that are coming to terms with the proper way to treat and provide equal opportunity for women. This bill before the chamber delivers on the Gillard Labor government's commitment to improve the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Act 1999. The bill in the changes the name of the act to the Workplace Gender Equality Act 2012, because this is about improving outcomes for women and men in the workplace. The bill also changes the emphasis of the act to promote and improve gender equality in the workplace and achieve equal remuneration and a stronger focus on family and caring responsibilities. The bill also introduces a new reporting framework which requires employers with 100 or more employees-so not small businesses-to report against a set by of gender equality indicators. A new online reporting facility will be easier and more Labor useful, and will enable businesses to compare how they are travelling against other workplaces in their industry. Over time the data will enable the minister to set minimum standards for employers. The renamed Workplace Gender Equality Agency will also be required to develop industry based benchmarks regarding gender equality. They will then use these indicators to assist industry to meet these benchmarks. Employees and shareholders will be provided with access to a business compliance report, ensuring greater the transparency and accountability for meeting gender benchmarks. I am pleased to see that extensive consultation has been carried out through the review of the act and broad consultation has continued throughout the reform process. I particularly commend the Minister for the Status of Women, Julie Collins, for her work directly engaging with key stakeholders in the development of the bill. This is an important piece of legislation in efforts to improve gender equality in the workplace-something that I am sure all members of parliament and all Australians would support. Back in 2009, I was part of an inquiry into pay equity as part of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment and Workplace Relations, chaired by the then member for Hasluck, Sharryn Jackson. The report Making it fair: pay equity and associated issues related to increasing female participation in the workforce made 63 recommendations. Unfortunately, I cannot stand here today and hold up that report and say that we have achieved all 63 of those recommendations, but nevertheless it is a bit of a guide-a path that this parliament might go down to achieve true equality. This bill implements some of those recommendations, particularly around better reporting, because it is through the information of reporting that businesses, governments and other institutions will be able to say: 'We've done this so far and we'll now be able to take the next step in achieving equality in the workforce.' I take you back to some facts that are quite disconcerting: not that long ago, only 46 years, when a woman was married, the social expectation was that if she was in the federal Public Service she would resign, with the presumption she would be supported by her husband. A lot has been achieved, and I would like to particularly commend the efforts of the Prime Minister as she has quietly in her steely, strong, determined way gone about proving that women can do anything in Australia. I have often had people in my electorate come up when I am with the Prime Minister to say that they respect what she has done for their daughters and their grandchildren and to say thank you for leading the nation in such a way. Whilst there are suggestions from both sides of parliament, it is complicated when you look at the data and say that merit will out. The reality is that when half of the population is female but less than 25 per cent of the MPs in this chamber are female there is something going wrong-otherwise you must make the flawed presumption that half of the women in Australia do not have the same merit when it comes to being a proper representative. This bill is a great way to go. It is a step in the right direction and I commend the bill to the House.",64
42,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS," Order! The debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 43. The debate may be resumed at a later hour. NA Abbott, Mr Des Carroll, Mr Joel Mrs GRIGGS (Solomon) (13:45): I rise today to congratulate two outstanding Territorians who I have mentioned in this place before. Des Abbott and Joel Carroll were today named in the Australian Kookaburras hockey team going to the 2012 Olympics. These two Darwin athletes are cousins and are fantastic Indigenous ambassadors. They are fantastic sports ambassadors for all Australians. This is an outstanding achievement for the Northern Territory as it will be the first time ever that two Northern Territorians compete together on the same team at the Olympic Games. Des and Joel are cousins who have played together before at the national level. Most notably, they both played in the 2010 men's hockey Champion Trophy where they won gold. Des and Joel also won gold at the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi. They have a good track record. This is not the first Olympic Games for Des. In 2008, he went to Beijing with the Kookaburras where they won a bronze medal. I know everyone in the Territory and around the nation will be watching the 2012 London Olympic Games very closely-even more so now that we have some home-grown talent on the world stage. It is great to know that the Kookaburras are going to the Olympics as the gold medal favourites. On behalf of all Territorians and the coalition I wish Joel and Des the very best of luck at the Olympics. We look forward to them bringing home the gold. Gibb, Mr John",74
43,Mr LYONS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise to make mention of renowned north-east Tasmanian artist Mr John Gibb. Last week I attended a viewing of John's watercolour exhibition. John has a passion for Tasmania's natural beauty, painting fascinating and impressive Tasmanian watercolour landscapes. John has been painting for over 30 years and was previously a teacher at the local Scottsdale High School. I was very impressed by the paintings that he created and I saw, not only in this exhibition but a previous limited edition exhibition, wonderful works about the Tasmanian landscape. John has a particular interest in the diversity of landscape in Tasmania. He has done such a wide range of views of landscapes including mountains, beaches, country fields and rivers. John is provided with an abundance of inspiration by the state of Tasmania. John has said that there is also a creative perspective to his work, encapsulating his memories and recollections of a place in his work rather than just what obvious to the eye at any exact moment. I would like to congratulate Mr John Gibb on his wonderful works capturing some of Tasmania's stunning iconic scenery. The exhibition Aspects of Tasmania: works by John Gibb continues at the Country Club Tasmania until 12 August. I encourage all locals to go and look at this amazing artwork by this outstanding Tasmanian artist. Epilepsy",75
44,Mr FRYDENBERG,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise to acknowledge the nearly 50 million people worldwide who are living with epilepsy, including 185,000 Australians. More prevalent than Parkinson's disease, cerebral palsy or multiple sclerosis, epilepsy is according to the World Health Organisation the most common serious brain disorder in the world. For sufferers, seizures can be regular and harmful, making a normal life hard to live. Afraid to tell their friends, many keep their condition private, conscious there is a social stigma attached. That is why we should celebrate initiatives like Purple Day, which is a global day of epilepsy awareness. Purple Day was founded in 2008 by Cassidy Megan, a nine-year-old Canadian girl living with epilepsy who was, in her own words, determined to show that people with epilepsy are ordinary people like everyone else. Indeed they are. This year on 26 March I joined families, the CEO of the Epilepsy Foundation of Victoria, Graeme Shears, and Epilepsy Foundation of Victoria staff, and Claude Ullin, chairman-elect of the Epilepsy Patrons Council of Victoria, for Purple Day. With the Foundation's Victorian headquarters based in my electorate of Kooyong, the morning tea was a great opportunity to share stories and hear why we need to build greater is awareness, provide better support services and invest more resources in important medical research in the field. I know I join all my colleagues in this House in saying to all those living with epilepsy: you are not alone and you have our strongest support. Child Care",75
45,Ms PARKE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," This morning I had the pleasure of co-convening with Senator Lisa Singh and Minister Kate Lundy the second meeting of the Labor Friends of Early Childhood Education and Child Care which was attended by early childhood educators and childcare centre operators from all around Australia who came together in support of the United Voice Big Steps campaign to achieve better conditions for educators in this sector. There is no question that child care and early childhood education is one of the most valuable kinds of work done in our community. It is a foundation stone for the education and socialisation of kids, which is essential for their development. It is also essential part of providing the support framework that allows women to remain engaged in the workforce. The fact that educators are drawn to do this work and motivated by their commitment to the children in their care should not be exploited through the holding down of pay and conditions-which happens far too often in areas of vocational employment that tend to involve very high proportions of women, like child care, early childhood education and aged care. Poor pay and conditions for workers in these roles is forcing them to leave the industry in droves because they cannot afford to stay despite the fact that they love their jobs. This is leading to a crisis in the industry with parents, childcare centre operators and workers calling for further reform and funding to deliver appropriate professional employment conditions for early childhood educators. I fully support Big Steps campaign and pay tribute to all those working in the vital area of early childhood education. Pie of Origin Fundraising Event",76
46,Mr BUCHHOLZ,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise to inform the House of a significant fundraiser being run in New South Wales and Queensland. In the true spirit of State of Origin, the two states have joined together to raise desperately needed funds for flood victims in parts of my electorate. The two states are having a 'pie of origin' with the Old Fernvale Bakery Cafe in the Brisbane Valley, owned by Bill Rose and renowned as one of the best pie shops in Queensland, having a 'pie-off' against Rob Pirina of Glenorie Bakery in New South Wales. These guys will be selling their pies, and for every sale $2 will go towards charity for the Queensland flood victims. All good Queenslanders and tourists know where this an bakery is, so take the time to find it. If you do not know where it is, it is west of Brisbane. I encourage all good Queenslanders to get behind and support Queensland. The winner of the competition between the New South Wales bakery and the Queensland bakery will obviously be whoever sells the most pies and whoever raises the most money. I am sure we will hear during the proceedings from the member for Berowra, the father of the House, who will speak on behalf of the New South Wales bakery. It is a true testament to the spirit of Queensland to support functions like these. Saunders, Mr Alan",76
47,Dr LEIGH,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," ABC's Radio National is one of Australia's great public institutions, and I rise to speak about the late Alan Saunders, who died unexpectedly last Friday. Alan Saunders the spent 25 years with Radio National. He moved to Australia in 1981 to pursue research at the Australian National University's History of Ideas unit, where he received a PhD. He received the Pascall Prize for critical writing and broadcasting in 1992. He contributed to programs about food, design and philosophy. As Amanda Armstrong put it: He was equally at home talking about Plato, the role of vampires in popular culture or the of the restaurant. He wrote like an angel, a deep knowledge of music, among many other areas, including philosophy, gastronomy, architecture, design and film. I knew Alan Saunders mostly as a listenerdelighting particularly in the By Design program-although I did get a chance to speak with him on Australia Day last year about social capital and some of the ideas in Disconnected. The topics to which Alan contributed are important. Others, such as Elizabeth Farrelly and Soutphommasane, discussed design and philosophy, but none so gracefully as Alan. He will be greatly missed. Pie of Origin Fundraising Event",76
48,Mr RUDDOCK,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I thank the member for Wright for drawing to the attention of the House this very important competition between New South Wales and Queensland which is underway at the moment. I suspect from the draw of the speakers that Queensland seems to be getting an inside run, but let me just say that, according to the reports I am receiving, this competition is very close and only the final match will decide the result. Notably, I am barracking for the Blues. It is not the State of Origin: it is the Pie of Origin. It is the brainchild of Rob Pirina of the Glenorie Bakery. He challenged Queensland to the best pie competition but agreed that we should raise money for the Queensland flood victims. The challenge has been accepted by Bill Rose of the Old Fernvale Bakery, but I am confident that New South Wales will be on top and victorious in this epic contest. I commend the competition to all members of the House. I hope you will barrack for the Blues. Find your way to Glenorie: the pies are outstanding but the cause is good. I hope members will give their full support to it as a history competition between the Blues and the and had Maroons, but I hope the Blues win. Austine, Mr Brett, OAM",77
49,Ms HALL,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise to congratulate Mr Brett Austine on being awarded the Order of Australia in the Queen's Birthday lists. Mr Austine is an outstanding example to young people within our community and a tireless worker within the field of gymnastics, first as a competitor and then as an Olympic Tim judge and a really outstanding coach. Mr Austine is the sports coordinator at Belmont High School in the Shortland electorate, and he was a driving force behind Belmont High School having a new gymnasium built. His father was also a gymnast and a national coach for about 15 years. Brett is one of those inspirational people that you feel very privileged to meet. He said that receiving the order of Australia was a humbling experience. I have to say it is an honour that has well and truly been earned. I congratulate Brett, and I know that the whole of the community that I represent, and all the young people he has coached over the years, also congratulate him on being given this award. Farah, Mrs Sonia",77
50,Mr ALEXANDER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Yesterday afternoon, Sonia Farah, mother of Wests Tigers captain Robbie Farah, lost her battle with pancreatic cancer at the young age of 63. Robbie is a well-known and much loved local hero of the Bennelong region, and has inspired all around him with his love for and devotion to his mother. During last year's Four Nations tournament in the UK Robbie first learned of Sonia's condition, and he immediately flew home to be by her side-the same place he was when she passed away. Robbie's team mates observed a very emotional minute's silence prior to yesterday's game. Their great respect for their captain was highlighted by coach Tim Sheens, who said in his postmatch interview: To talk about the game today seems a waste of time. It's something I'm not particularly interested in. … It's a close club and the team will be there for Rob and his family Robbie Farah became a hero for all of New South Wales last week when he gave the man of the match performance in State of Origin game 2. After the match he said he had been looking up into the stands for his mother, who had been admitted to hospital earlier that evening. On behalf of the Bennelong community I offer my deepest sympathies to Robbie and the entire Farah family.",77
51,Mr ALBANESE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Grayndler-Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (13:58): On indulgence-as a minister this would not normally be the case with 90 second statements, but as the member for Grayndler, which is home to Leichhardt Oval and the home of the Wests Tigers-I associate the government with the comments of the member for Bennelong and express condolences to Robbie Farah and his family, and indeed all the Wests Tigers, on the loss of Robbie Farah's mum Mrs Sonia Farah. Parliamentarians for Global Action",78
52,Ms PARKE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," This afternoon the parliament welcomed Mr Ross Robertson, Labour member for Manukau East in the New Zealand parliament, Deputy Speaker in that parliament and also the international President of the Parliamentarians for Global Action. I acknowledge Mr Robertson in the Speaker's gallery right now. Mr Robertson came to Canberra from New Zealand today for the purpose of reinvigorating the Australian branch of the Parliamentarians for Global Action which was formerly led by the member for Lingiari, now a minister, Warren Snowdon. The PGA is the largest transnational network of individual parliamentarians from all regions of the world. It is an action oriented body",78
53,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Order! It being 2pm, in accordance with standing order 43, the time for members' statements has concluded. NA WALKER, Hon. Francis (Frank) John, QC",78
54,Mr SWAN,CONDOLENCES," I move: That the House express its deep regret at the death on 12 June 2012 of the Honourable Francis John (Frank) Walker QC, a Member of this House for the Division of Robertson from 1990 to 1996, place on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service, and tender its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement. Today we mourn the loss of a distinguished former member of this place who has served our nation in ministerial office, the Hon. Frank Walker QC who died in Sydney last Tuesday just weeks shy of his 70th birthday. I did not know Frank Walker well. I was a new backbencher in the final term of the Keating government of which he was a senior figure. But I know he was a friend to many in this place, including the Leader of the House. Our condolences go out today to Frank Walker's widow, Pam, and all his many friends. I thank the New South Wales government for its generosity in offering a state funeral, which is a fitting tribute to a remarkable career of community service. It is amazing to think that when my generation came to this place in the mid-1990s Frank Walker had been in politics for a quarter of a century, although he was still a youthful looking man just entering his 50s. He was part of the generation of Paul Keating, Laurie Brereton and Bob Carr, who were young men in a hurry and who left such a definitive stamp on the public life of our nation. Frank Walker was born in 1942 and came of age as a young Australian impatient for change as the Menzies era wound to a close. Labor was the natural home for a progressive young lawyer committed to human rights and would remain so from the age of 18 until his passing last week. In 1970 the young Frank Walker took what some regarded as an unrealistic tilt at the safe Liberal seat of Georges River in the New South Wales parliament. He won it with 48 per cent of the primary vote and held it for the following six elections. When Neville Wran assembled his first cabinet, Frank Walker was given the prize job of Attorney-General, becoming the youngest in the state's history. He set about the task of reform with a passion, unwinding the heavy-handed legacy of the Askin era and bringing the fresh breeze of law reform to New South Wales. In fact, Frank Walker was a minister for the whole 12 years of the Wran-Unsworth government, holding some of the toughest portfolios, always in the social arena, including housing and youth and community services as well as the arts. Perhaps most importantly for a man who had been one of free riders alongside Charlie Perkins, he became New South Wales first Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, delivering that state's first-ever land rights legislation for Aboriginal people and recognising the stolen generations as early as 1982. It was a great reforming government in the Labor such tradition and Frank was at the very heart of it-a busy, boisterous and dashing figure throughout. Two years later, after leaving New South Wales politics, he came to Canberra as the member for Robertson, joining that handful of figures who had successfully navigated the state-federal divide. Following the sweetest victory of all in 1993, Frank Walker became Special Minister of State and Vice President of the Executive Council and was given responsibility for turning Mabo into what became the Native Title Act. In 1994 he was promoted to Minister for Administrative Services, a position he held until the 1996 federal election. He was an active participant in the affairs of the parliament. He attended the 85th InterParliamentary Conference in Korea in 1991 and undertook official visits to Singapore, Japan, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and the United States. He also served on the community affairs and procedure committees. Of course, he was no stranger to the factional brawls and byways of the Labor family and so much so that one journalist described him as someone who roamed the political landscape like a Steppenwolf. After politics Frank served as a judge on the Compensation Court of New South Wales from 1997 to 2003 and from 2004 to 2006 and was a judge of the Dust Diseases Tribunal in the district court of New South Wales. In these roles his compassion and social concern shone through, especially for those condemned to the painful illness and death through asbestosis disease. For all those 36 years in elected and judicial office, Frank Walker was an inspirational figure and he brought flair to whatever he did. But this life so rich in accomplishment also contained more than its fair share of sorrow. Frank Walker suffered the grief of losing both his sons, Sean and Michael, to suicide following the onset of schizophrenia. It would be a crushing burden for any parent, but instead of turning inward Frank used his own sense of loss to propel change in the wider community. He served as president of the Schizophrenia Fellowship of New South Wales for a record term, as well as serving on the New South Wales Mental Health Review Tribunal and the Mental Illness Fellowship of Australia. The fact that mental health looms so large in contemporary public debate, and is finally receiving the funding deserves, is in no small measure due to Frank's consistent advocacy. By any measure this was a gifted brilliant life. It was the life of a reformer who did just complain about why the world was unjust but who saw the possibility for change and-to paraphrase Bobby Kennedy-said, 'Why not?' His whole life as a politician, judge and activist was aimed at progress and reform. He was an unashamed social democrat and wore the badge of civil libertarian with pride. He spoke for those whose voices were not heard and now his own voice, a feature of public life for four decades, has been stilled and we are diminished as a result. So on behalf of the government and the people of Australia, I say farewell Frank Walker. A grateful nation honours your memory and pays tribute to your long and distinguished service in our name.",78
55,Mr ABBOTT,CONDOLENCES," I rise to support the words of the Acting Prime Minister. Frank Walker was a long-serving New South Wales Attorney General, as well as Special Minister of State and Minister for Administrative Services in this parliament. Frank Walker's political life was devoted to infuriating conservatives, and in this I have to say that he was wildly successful. He upset conservatives in his own party as readily as conservatives on the other side of the parliament and in the wider community. By his own lights he was certainly a man of principle and he was someone who suffered for his beliefs. He was reportedly beaten and bashed for sitting with Aboriginal people in a segregated country theatre. His family pet was reportedly killed and its head dumped on his doorstep while he was a corruptionfighting minister in the Wran government. As the Acting Prime Minister has made clear, his personal life was marked by it tragedy, and he spent much of his postparliamentary life supporting people with schizophrenia. In this role, quite rightly, he was universally admired. He certainly has not helped to make mental health something that all sides of this parliament are very concerned about, and I well remember the welcome he gave to the former government's Better Access to Mental Health Services program. On behalf of the coalition I offer our condolences to his family, and to all who knew him and loved him.",80
56,Mr ALBANESE,CONDOLENCES,"Grayndler-Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (14:09): I rise to add my support to this motion of condolence from the Acting Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. Frank Walker was my friend. He was one of the most passionate, humble, loyal, dedicated and honest people that I had the privilege of knowing. He was absolutely committed to representing the interests of those who are the most marginalised in our society. I first met Frank when I went along to a New South Wales Young Labor conference around about 1980-in Newtown, which now happens to be in my electorate. I was still at school. There I remember this minister standing at the front of the conference, talking about the action that he was taking to make New South Wales a more just society-changes such as repealing the unjust Summary Offences Act. The Leader of the Opposition has indicated the extent to which this drew opposition from some of the entrenched corrupt forces that were then in strong positions in New South Wales society. This angered many, particularly some sections of the New South Wales Police Force. He drove through the most progressive Aboriginal land rights legislation at the time. He decriminalised homosexuality at a time when that was a radical notion and when people were still subject to being arrested for happening to be gay or lesbian. He had a commitment to public and community housing. He had a determination to help young people in particular who had got themselves into trouble with the law not out of any flaw of character but simply due to the circumstances of their birth and family situations. As happens in politics, in spite of being an extraordinary local campaigner, Frank lost his seat when Labor lost office in 1988. In 1989 I was his chief scrutineer in the preselection ballot for the federal seat of Robertson, where he defeated Belinda Neal by just three votes to be the Labor candidate after Barry Cohen's retirement. He went on to win the seat of Robertson in 1990 and, of course, after 1993 to be a minister in the Keating Labor government. Frank went on in post-parliamentary life to play a vital role in the judiciary, including helping victims of asbestos through the Dust Diseases Tribunal. He went on to make an extraordinary contribution as president of the Schizophrenia Fellowship of New South Wales from 1998 right up until his death. Schizophrenia, of course, was the condition that his two sons, Michael and Sean, suffered from-a condition which tragically proved fatal for both. Right to the end, Frank was driven by his commitment to social justice. He remained an infectious personality even after he became very unwell. Every minute you spent with Frank Walker was a minute well spent. He was my friend, and I admired him deeply. He will be missed by the nation, the Labor movement, his many friends and by his family. Vale, Frank Walker.",80
57,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONDOLENCES," As a mark of respect, I ask all present to signify their approval by rising in their places. Honourable members having stood in their places",81
58,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONDOLENCES,I thank the House. Debate adjourned. Reference to Federation Chamber,81
59,Mr ALBANESE,CONDOLENCES,Grayndler-Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (14:13): by leave-I move: That the resumption of debate on the acting Prime Minister's motion of condolence in connection with the death of the Hon. Francis (Frank) John Walker QC be referred to the Federation Chamber. Question agreed to. NA,81
60,Mr SWAN,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS, I inform the House that the Prime Minister will be absent from question time this week as she is representing Australia at the G20 leaders summit in Mexico and the Rio+20 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development in Brazil. I will answer questions on behalf of the Prime Minister. NA Carbon Pricing,81
61,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Acting Prime Minister. Can the Acting Prime Minister name a single head of government at the G20 conference, apart from the Australian Prime Minister, who has hit workers and families with an economy-wide carbon tax of at least $23 a tonne?",81
62,Mr Robb,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Good question! Opposition members: Name one-just one!,82
63,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, Order! Do the opposition want to hear an answer or not? The Acting Prime Minister has the call.,82
64,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I have been to a few G20 conferences and, as I have sat at the table, there is one thing that all the developed economies there around the table know-there is no stronger developed economy in the G20 than Australia. There is no stronger developed economy in the G20 than Australia. But, of course, what do we get here? Day after day, the opposition comes into this House-and goes around the community-and talks our economy down, deliberately insulting all those hard-working business owners and those millions of workers who have worked hard to make our economy strong. I have been asked by the Leader of the Opposition how many countries around the G20 table are putting in place policies to deal with dangerous climate change and creating situations where they can reduce their emissions. Seventeen of the G20 members, or 85 per cent, are putting in place emissions trading schemes at a national or subnational level. That is what is going on in the G20. I tell you what, if those on the other side were at Los Cabos, they would have been terribly embarrassed, because the G20 nations with developed economies and developing economies do appreciate the need to deal with reducing carbon pollution, and are putting emissions trading schemes in place at a national or subnational level. Let us just go specifically to some of the countries that are sitting around the table.",82
65,Mr Abbott,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I asked the Acting Prime Minister if he could name a single country with a $23 a tonne carbon tax-a single one.",82
66,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Acting Prime Minister is answering the question and has the call.,82
67,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Madam Deputy Speaker, I am certainly happy to address it directly. Over the four years to July 2011, European carbon prices have traded in the range of $16 to $50. Now, what countries could there be around the G20 table who might be in that situation? There is France, there is Italy, there is the United Kingdom-there is a whole range of developed economies that are part of the European scheme. Those opposite will come into this House and maintain that the European price is low at the moment, but there is no reason it will stay there. What we do know is that carbon prices in the European zone have traded between $16 and $50 over the four years through to the middle of 2011. I think that answers that question pretty clearly. You on that side of the House are so embarrassed by your performance here. Countries around the world are putting in place emissions trading schemes, because those countries understand the importance of dealing with dangerous climate change.",82
68,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, I have a supplementary question to the Acting Prime Minister: can the Acting Prime Minister tell the House when the European carbon price ever hit $50 a tonne and can he please tell the House what it is now?,82
69,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Government members interjectingEconomy,82
70,Mr SYMON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, question is to the Acting Prime Minister: will the Acting Prime Minister update the House on recent data that highlights the strength the Australian economy? How does this compare with developments overseas?,83
71,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Deakin for that very important question. All Australians have justifiable reason to be proud of the remarkable economic achievements of Australia. These achievements have occurred in some of the worse global conditions since the global financial crisis and, of course, the global recession. There is no doubt that when it comes to the developed world, the Australian economy is the standout performer. That is occurring at a time when many developed economies are experiencing unemployment, but there are more Australians in work here than there have ever been at any time in our history. There have been something like 800,000 jobs created in Australia since this government came to power-and that is in the face of the extraordinary challenges that we are experiencing emanating from Europe, particularly at the moment. And that is why the Prime Minister will make this point at G20 meeting: how important it is, particularly for the policymakers of the European region, to put in place policy reforms which will boost growth and restore the sustainability of public finances in the eurozone. We need to see consistent and determinate action from the Europeans to ensure that growth is restored. No economy is immune from the turmoil in Europe, but here in Australia we have been a beacon of strength compared to what is going on elsewhere in the developed world. So much so that the Australian My economy is now 10 per cent larger than it was prior to the global financial crisis. What a substantial achievement that is for of Australia, when you consider that there is barely a developed economy that has got back to where it began at the beginning of the global financial crisis. Everybody on this side of the House cheers that performance. Those on the other side of the House were so embarrassed when the national accounts came out two weeks ago that they were in the stand booing the performance of the Australian economy. No-one was more disappointed with those results than the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer over there on that side of the House. On Tuesday, the shadow Treasurer said that the Australian economy was underperforming, and then on Wednesday he said the performance was extraordinarywhat a backflip! Underperforming one day, mass extraordinary the next-but it was not a backflip, it was just a big belly flop, Madam Deputy Speaker. No-one was more embarrassed than the shadow Treasurer. On this side of the House, we celebrate the fact that we have the best combination of growth-strong growth, strong employment growth, strong investment-with contained inflation and interest rates coming down. This is a great result for Australia, but it is the one that those opposite do not support and continually run down. Carbon Pricing",83
72,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is again to the Acting Prime Minister. I refer him to electricity price increases on 1 July of up to 20 per cent in New South Wales, 18 per cent in South Australia and 15 per cent in Victoria, due in large part to the carbon tax starting at $23 a tonne. What will the electricity price increase be when the carbon tax is $350 a tonne, which is that e government's predicted carbon price by 2050?",83
73,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," premise of the Leader of the Opposition's question is simply wrong. First of all he is claiming that the increases in electricity prices are principally the result of the carbon price. That is a lie, and it has been demonstrated to be a lie by the decisions that have been taken Deputy Speaker, the Acting Prime Minister is not entitled to use that kind of language describe the opposition, and we would ask him to withdraw it.",84
74,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, The Acting Prime Minister will withdraw and will answer the question.,84
75,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It is simply untrue,84
76,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Acting Prime Minister will withdraw.,84
77,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I withdraw. It is simply untrue to claim that the great bulk of those price increases are the result of the carbon price. They are not and he knows that to be false. The fact is the impact on the average household from the carbon price when it comes to the average electricity bill is $3.30 a week. He knows that is the case, but he is out there not telling the truth about the impact. We have the Leader of the Opposition walking back from what he was saying a week or two ago about the impact of the carbon price. First of all he said to put a wrecking ball right through our economy. The wrecking ball has gone out the door, and he is now saying it is going to be a python squeeze rather than a cobra strike.  Deputy Speaker, the huffing and puffing of the Acting Prime Minister is not answering the question, which is what the price is going The to be when it is $350 a tonne.",84
78,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Sturt is not to use points of order for debate. It is an abuse of the process, and I will be calling people to account in the future. If it is relevant then get up and make a stand on a point of order on relevance.",84
79,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Whether it is a cobra or a python, it does not change the fact that the Leader of the Opposition is a snake oil to salesmen. He has been slithering around the country with a whole series of poisonous messages and a forked tongue telling untruths about the impact of the carbon price on electricity. That is what he has been doing, and it is not true. Now we have been told that this is responsible for what is going on in New South Wales. I tell you what: there is a choice in New South Wales. From the billions of dollars that Barry O'Farrell is getting from the electricity generators, why doesn'the give it back to the people of New South Wales in cuts to their electricity prices?

82,Ms LIVERMORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency and the Minister for Industry and Innovation. Will the minister outline why the government is tackling climate change? In doing this, how is the government helping households, including protecting them from unjustified price rises with the introduction of the carbon price?",84
83,Mr COMBET,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Charlton-Minister for Industry and Innovation and Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (14:27): In response to the member for Capricornia's question, scientists have been advising governments for a long period of time that climate change poses significant risks. To Australia the risks are from higher temperatures, changing rainfall patterns, more extreme weather events and rising sea levels. These represent serious economic risks-risks that you should take as serious economic risks. They will have impacts in many different industries across our economy, like agriculture and tourism, and in our society. Faced with that scientific advice, governments have a public policy responsibility to act. That is why this government is putting a price on carbon. The carbon price will create an incentive for the largest emitters of greenhouse gases in our economy to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, because it will require them to purchase a permit for every tonne of greenhouse gas that they emit. We are doing this not only in an environmentally effective way and an economically responsible way but in a socially fair and just manner. The price impacts will be modest at only a 0.7 per cent increase in the CPI. As the Treasurer and Acting Prime Minister just indicated, the modelling showed that the average electricity price impact will be $3.30 a week per household across the country. The Leader of the Opposition has previously described the price impact as 'unimaginable'. But the fact of the matter is that state pricing regulators are now confirming the Treasury modelling and they are consistent in the price impacts with that which was suggested by the Treasury modelling-$3.30 a week averaged across households. In South Australia, the average is just under $1.50 a household. The government is assisting households with an extra $10.10 a week through tax cuts, higher family tax benefits and increases in pensions. It is targeted to assist lowand middleincome households. The government is also funding the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission so that it can tackle businesses which try to rip people off with false claims about carbon pricing. Today the ACCC announced a carbon claims hotline to make it easier for people to make complaints. For those listening to the broadcast, it is 1300 303 609. The ACCC, importantly, points out that price increases associated with carbon pricing should be 'truthful and have a reasonable basis'. This is advice that the Leader of the Opposition should take. (Time expired)",85
84,Ms LIVERMORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Madam Deputy Speaker, I ask a supplementary question. The minister talked about what we are doing in Australia to address climate change. How are we playing our part in the global efforts to tackle climate change?",85
85,Mr COMBET,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Charlton-Minister for Industry and Innovation and Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (14:30): I thank the member for Capricornia once again, because tackling climate change is an international problem and countries around the world are taking steps to deal with it. Australia needs to pay its fair share in these efforts. Ninety countries have pledged to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions through to 2020, and at the UN climate change conference late last year all countries agreed to negotiate a new treaty that would apply from 2020 that would introduce binding obligations on all of the major emitters to reduce their emissions. That includes our trading partners. That includes our partners in the Asia-Pacific region: the United States, China, Japan and South Korea. Countries including India have also made those commitments. This has very significant implications for this country and for our economy. If we do not start making sensible, gradual changes to reduce the emissions intensity of our economy and we do as the Leader of the Opposition is suggesting we can do-travel to 2020 and have emissions continue to grow-we will be hit with binding obligations to reduce our emissions. It will hit our economy with the back of the axe. The only responsible course of action is to take action now. (Time expired) Carbon Pricing",85
86,Mr BILSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Acting Prime Minister. I refer the Acting Prime Minister to the Prime Minister's assertion that petrol prices will not be touched by carbon pricing. How does he reconcile that statement with the view of the petroleum distribution and retail association ACAPMA that the carbon tax will put upward pressure on petrol prices because it will push up the cost of fuel production, distribution, retailing and service station operations?",86
87,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," There are a couple of very simple points that I will make. All of those claims, at the end of the day, will be tested by the ACCC. We will have a test of these sorts of wild claims about pushing up prices. There are going to be a lot of them made. They have been made by those opposite. Of course, they would not pass the ACCC test if it applied to them; they have already failed it massively. But the fact is that the impact of this on the general inflation in the economy is less than 1c in the dollar. That is the truth of it. The fact is most of the claims that are being made out there, particularly from those opposite, are inaccurate, but they can be put to the test if those claims are going to be made. NA",86

89,Mr OAKESHOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport. In last year's New South Wales budget the matching funding of $3.5 billion for the completion of the Pacific Highway by 2016 was not allocated-in the same New South Wales budget where $9 billion was allocated for Sydney transport. Minister, in light of this, what urgent steps are you taking now to re-engage New South Wales and finalise a signed and formal agreement to complete the Pacific Highway by the agreed and promised bipartisan date of 2016? (Time expired)",86
90,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Grayndler-Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (14:34): I thank the member for Lyne for his question and for his ongoing commitment to upgrading the Pacific Highway. Indeed, in the federal budget this year we did announce an additional $3.56 billion funding for the nation-building program and we indicated that it would be available for the Pacific Highway on a dollar-for-dollar matching basis. We also indicated that it was possible to achieve the joint objective, first put down by the Howard that government, of a full duplication of the highway by 2016. So I was very disappointed by the fact that the New South Wales government has failed to step up to this opportunity in spite of the fact that after year they made promises that they would deliver matching funds for the Pacific Highway and that they were committed to the full duplication by 2016. They failed to deliver. Premier O'Farrell, Deputy Premier Stoner and Minister for Roads and Ports, Duncan Gay, are all on the record time after time saying they would make it a top priority. They now say that the reason was a $5 billion cut in funding for New South Wales in terms of revenue expectations. But the fact is this government found space to provide increased funding in the nation-building program even though there has been a $140 billion drop in revenue as a result of the global financial crisis. The NRMA came out for New South Wales to match the funding. But it gets even worse. Last year, the state government Treasurer, Mike Baird, said in his budget speech: In its last Budget, the Commonwealth allocated $750 million … … we are determined to provide the funds to match the Commonwealth offer. In their budget papers of last week that figure has become $468 million-that is, they have cut funding for the Pacific Highway by $300 million on what they promised just six months ago. What does the National Party do about this? The Leader of the National Party goes out there and says that 2016 cannot be achieved and he would be very disappointed if duplication was not completed by 2020. He would not commit one cent of additional funding for the Pacific Highway in spite of the fact that we have already committed $4.1 billion dollars. They committed $1.3 billion over 12 long years.",86
91,Mr OAKESHOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Madam Deputy Speaker, I ask a supplementary question. Minister, in light of year your answer, the very public dispute of the last week between the Commonwealth and the state of New South Wales, and that the Pacific Highway has been historically funded 80-20 or fifty-fifty, will you right now agree to release all documents and all correspondence on the history of the Pacific Highway between the two governments so we can all establish who on earth is telling the truth? (Time expired)",87
92,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Grayndler-Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (14:38): We certainly will, in terms of the member for Lyne's request. The fact is that the government had introduced additional funding for the Pacific Highway through the economic stimulus plan, including the Kempsey bypass. The longest bridge in Australia is being constructed there. Indeed, on the weekend we openedthrough Senator Thistlethwaite, the duty senator for Cowper, and the state National Party member-an interchange on the Kempsey bypass. There is not one cent of needed state government money going into that section of the highway. They are happy to turn up to the openings but they do not want to actually deliver. I table for the benefit of the House my letter to Michael Daley, the New South Wales Minister for Roads, indicating my disappointment with the funding for the Pacific Highway that the former state Labor government that did not do well enough on the Pacific Highway had done. I table the Sydney Morning Herald article 'Rees bungle costs state $50 million' about how I reduced funding for New South Wales due to the failure of the former government to deliver. I table the letter from David Campbell, the then Minister for Transport and Roads in the New South Wales government, asking for 80:20 funding for the Pacific Highway, and I table my response rejecting the proposition of Minister Campbell for the New South Wales government.

93,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Acting Prime Minister. Will the Acting Prime Minister update the House about the importance of transparency when it comes to the impact of carbon pricing?,88
94,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Banks for that very important question. The government has been absolutely open about the impact of carbon pricing on the general price level, and we know that it will impact on inflation by 0.7 per cent, less than one cent in the dollar. know that the great bulk of businesses will do the right thing; they always do. But, for any business that is thinking of misleading claims about the impact of carbon pricing, they will have the ACCC down on them like a tonne of bricks, because it is simply not going to be justified for people to be making the sorts of claims that were made by the shadow minister before without that going through full ACCC scrutiny. It is the role of the ACCC to examine unreasonable claims. It is the role of the ACCC to put in place fines if those claims are found to be false and misleading, so that is what we have done with the ACCC. We have funded them. They are establishing a hotline that consumers can call, but not just consumers, because it could be other businesses that will become the victim of process. It is there for business as well as consumers, on 1300 303 609. As I have said, we have put in place the appropriate funding, and there can be fines of up to $1.1 million-up to 1.1 million reasons for people not to rip off consumers or other businesses. The opposition have been running around the place, saying that the impact on prices is going to be unimaginable; they are going to go through the roof. We have also had a further Treasury study, and this new Treasury analysis once again shows a price impact of less than one cent in the dollar in the September quarter of 2012. This is a study of what markets are expecting from the impact of the carbon price, and it has confirmed the original Treasury modelling. But, despite all of this, we have got the opposition running around with their scare campaign, whilst at the same time you have got opposition backbenchers over there investing in coal companies, which the Leader of the Opposition tells us are going to be wiped from the face of the earth. The fact is-and this is a simple factWe that on 1 July we will see the true test of Tony Abbott's slippery scare campaign. The fact is that 1 July will reveal the Leader of the Opposition as a dodgy snake oil salesman-nothing but deceit and negativity. Carbon Pricing",88
95,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency. I refer the minister to his claim that the number of companies required to directly pay the carbon tax will be considerably lower than the 500 previously thought. How does he reconcile that statement with the fact that 1,200 mostly small and medium Australian companies that import refrigerants will be hit directly by the tax? Why does the minister continue to this mislead the Australian people about the impact of the world's largest carbon- (Time expired)",88
96,Mr COMBET,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Charlton-Minister for Industry and Innovation and Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (14:43): There is only one of side of this parliament where there have been misleading statements made. As I was making the point before, it is on that side, and if they were running a business the ACCC would be jumping all over them for the claims that they have been making. Under the Clean Energy Act, the Clean Energy Regulator is required to publish a list of liable entities a public information database, and that database was updated for a second time last Friday. Organisations are placed on that that are expected, on reasonable grounds, to be liable for the carbon price mechanism in the relevant financial year. The number of entities published by last Friday is 294. It includes 34 local councils and resolves issues that had fallaciously been raised by those opposite. On current information available to the regulator the list comprises 294 entities. The regulator has also advised that it is in discussion with a number of other liable entities who want to use the act's provisions allowing them to transfer liability within their corporate group or amongst joint venture partners, and that will ultimately add to the list as entities access those provisions under the act. They are well aware, however, of their responsibilities under the act. In relation to the issue of synthetic greenhouse gases, it was the Howard government that introduced legislation regulating and placing a levy upon the importation of synthetic greenhouse gases, and the government has ensured that a carbon price applies to those cases. Carbon Pricing",88
97,Mr CHAMPION,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Assistant Treasurer. How is the government making sure that hard-working families, seniors and small businesses are getting a fair go with the introduction of a carbon price?",89
98,Mr BRADBURY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Lindsay-Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation) (14:45): I thank the member for Wakefield for his question. Pricing carbon is the cheapest and most efficient way of reducing our dependence on fossil fuels and tackling the challenge of climate change. It is a significant economic reform that will drive investment in clean energy and will on help cut greenhouse gas emissions by 160 million tonnes in 2020. That is the equivalent of the emissions generated by 45 million cars. At the same time, by 2020 our economy is projected to grow by around one-third, with 1.6 million new jobs being created and average incomes rising by around $9,000 per person. Because we are a Labor government we are determined to implement this important change in a way that ensures we look after hard-working Australians. That is why we are increasing payments to families, pensioners and eligible self-funded retirees. That is why we are also providing tax relief to individuals and small businesses. That tax relief not only involves incentives like the instant asset write-off, but it also involves the tripling of the tax-free threshold. We know that there is a lot of misleading information being spread out there about the carbon price but, for the record, the carbon price will have an average impact of 0.7 per cent, or less than one per cent. That is less than one cent in the dollar. This is less than one-third of the impact of the GST when it was introduced by the previous government. Today the ACCC has launched a new hotline and an online forum where Australians will have the opportunity to report businesses that they suspect are making false and misleading claims in relation to the carbon price. We know that most businesses will do the right thing, but rest assured that those businesses who jack up prices and falsely blame the carbon price will have the ACCC to deal with. The ACCC, of course, has the power to seek penalties of up to $1.1 million per contravention. While the government is out there trying to crack down on misleading claims, the Leader of the Opposition has been out there making a few of his own. Not only is he out there making misleading claims, he now thinks it is okay to encourage businesses to do the same. We all know he has been out there saying that price rises would be astronomical and that they would be unimaginable. He said that the coal industry would be killed off and that Whyalla would be wiped off the map. We have heard it all before from the Leader of the Opposition-first it was going to be a cobra strike, but now it is going to be a python squeeze. The only thing we can guarantee is that it would take a python to squeeze a few facts out of the Leader of the Opposition.",89

101,Mr KEENAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Acting Prime Minister. I remind the Acting Prime Minister that before the election the government promised that there would be no expansion of processing centres in Australia, and that since the election there have been 4,300 new beds added at centres including Curtin, Scherger, Wickham Point, Darwin, Broadmeadows, Pontville, Inverbrackie and Northam. Given the spate of illegal boat arrivals at Cocos Island, will the Acting Prime Minister guarantee that the government will not open a detention centre there?",90
102,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," It is quite ironic that the party that has come into this House and refused to support overseas processing then comes in and complains about an increase in arrivals. It is just quite extraordinary. They have got a real hide to come into this House after they sabotaged the Malaysian arrangement, which would break the people smugglers' model and put us in a position where we can send that message to the region about not jumping on a boat. But having wrecked that, they then come into the House and make all these others claims that we have heard from them both here and outside the parliament. There The are no plans for Cocos Island from this government, but I can tell you this: we are going to hold you accountable for your failure to support in this House legislation that would break the people smugglers' model.  Prime Minister was asked whether he would rule out a detention centre at Cocos Island and that is the question that he needs to answer.",90

104,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I have already answered the question.,90
105,Mr KEENAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I have a supplementary question. As the Acting Prime Minister has refused to rule out opening a detention centre at Cocos Island, can he inform the House how much it is costing the Australian taxpayer to fly staff and resources on charter planes to Cocos Island and to fly asylum seekers from there to Christmas Island?",90
106,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," If the opposition were concerned about the costs of processing anywhere they would support our legislation in the House. Marine Conservation  question is to the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities.

107,Mr BURKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Watson-Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Population and Communities) (14:52): I am glad that there is a side of the House willing to ask a question on this issue. It was extraordinary that those opposite were willing to damage the national interest on this issue with their talk of a 'killer attack the way'-and we have all been waiting with suspense. Well, a major announcement was made last week. Australia has always been one of the world leaders in national parks on land. Yellowstone and the Royal National Park were the first two national parks on land in the world. Last week Australia also became the world leader on national parks in the ocean. That is something that this side of the House is very proud of and it is something on which-despite the games that are being played by those opposite-it was thought there was a level of bipartisanship. The principles and the plan were first put forward under the Keating government, but the commitments that were made internationally were made at a conference known as Rio+10 in Johannesburg, where the representative of Australia was a bloke by the name of Kemp-Environment Minister Kemp-when the other side signed up to the words that it would be a 'representative, comprehensive and adequate network' of marine national parks. Since then the objections have comewith Ron Boswell, interestingly, becoming the person to commit the opposition to try to tear this apart-on grounds relating to the impact on commercial fishers and rec fishers. Let us look at each of them. In terms of commercial fishing, the impact on the gross value of production is between one and two per cent of the total industry-a one to two per cent impact. On rec fishing, which has been the principal issue that the Leader of the Opposition has identified as being his concern, if you are on the east coast and you are anywhere south of Mackay, you have got Water, to get out in your tinny almost to Lord Howe Island before you find the first area where rec fishers are not allowed to go. Even if you are in Mackay you have to take your tinny for 400 kilometres before you reach Marion Reef. Once you get to Marion Reef you are on banned from fishing on it but you are still allowed to fish around it-containing the key pelagic species that the rec fishers are after. We have a situation where, in relation to the fear campaign that they have wanted to run during the last 12 months, the time is up. Rec fishers know that this is in Commonwealth waters, a long way away from the areas that they want, and Australians are proud to be the world leaders in establishing protection of the oceans.  Madam Deputy Speaker, I ask a supplementary question. I refer to the minister's comments on the need for global action on our oceans and our environment. How will Australia be advancing this at the Rio+20 conference?",91
108,Mr BURKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Watson-Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities) (14:55): I am very glad that question was asked. To ensure that all of these reforms are best practice you want to make sure that you go as far as possible in the world coming closer to the good standard of fisheries management that Australia has and the good standard of marine parks that Australia has. That is why it used to be bipartisan that we would have an involvement in the Coral Triangle initiative. That is why it used to be bipartisan that we would engage in the Earth Summit and the meeting of environment ministers that happens once every 10 years. It is not necessarily the summit itself; it is the bilateral meetings that you have on the one occasion when all the environment ministers of the world are in the same place. It should be bipartisan that you will have those negotiations country after country. Yet the exact same officials who were organising bilateral after bilateral, back to back-not the meetings on the beach that the member for Flinders said that he wanted to be able to attend when he was on TV on the weekend but the bilaterals where you advance the national interest-and meeting after meeting are now cancelling those meetings. The same pairing arrangements that caused the Leader of the Opposition to play 'chasings' in and out of the chamber and caused chaos on that other side mean that even this has to be turned into a political game.

109,Mr ENTSCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities. I remind the minister that in 2004 the compensation for fishermen in marine industries to rezone the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park was originally capped at $10 million but subsequently blew out to close to $250 million. How has the minister arrived at a figure of $100 million as the cost of compensation to rezone an area 10 times that size?",92
110,Mr BURKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Watson-Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities) (14:57): I thank the member for Leichhardt for opening up the cost blow-out that was administered by the other side. The bioregional planning that is taking place takes place under national environmental law-the legislation that was introduced by a bloke you might have heard of by the name of Robert Hill. Across our oceans there is one region that was done by the previous government-one region only-and that was the south-east. When the south-east was done that provided the template for displacement policy, and that is exactly the template that the government is providing and is following through on. Where was the member for Leichhardt saying, 'It is an outrageous package,' when it was being implemented by the Howard government? Where was the member for Leichhardt when he was wanting to claim on a point of order.

What we have got is a situation where the opposition have decided that environmental protection is something that they need to say no to at every single location. You will not find the member for Leichhardt talking about the impact on his electorate for the dive industry, because the dive industry, a cornerstone of the tourism industry in Cairns, has been out there backing this. They know that Osprey Reef in particular-one of the top five dive sites in the world-is now on the global map in a much stronger way because it has been given the level of marine protection that it always should have had.

119,Mr ZAPPIA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, question is to the Minister for Trade and Competitiveness. Will the minister advise the House of the benefits to the Australian economy of decisive action on the pricing of carbon? What would be the implications for Australian competitiveness if decisive action were not taken?,93
120,Dr EMERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I would like to thank the member for Makin for his question. Far from going it alone on carbon pricing, by next year Australia will be one of more than 50 jurisdictions with emissions trading schemes. In fact, 94 per cent of OECD members have or are developing emissions trading schemes at either the national or the subnational level. The Gillard government, of course, has had the wisdom and the foresight to anticipate these developments and implement an Australian emissions trading scheme as promised by the Howard government, supported at the time by the now Leader of the Opposition. Australia's scheme is going to position our country to take advantage of the opportunities presented by the inevitable global transition to a clean energy future, and that will enable our businesses to participate in international carbon markets, a very important opportunity. Indeed, the anti-pricegouging measures announced by the ACCC will help ensure our businesses do not have their competitiveness impaired by unscrupulous business behaviour. There are threats to replace this market based mechanism with a centrally planned direct action scheme, and those threats are undermining business confidence. The coalition is supporting a central planning scheme and Labor is supporting a market based mechanism, so there is the irony. All of this is being done not because of a commitment to central planning-although I sometimes suspect the opposition leader has My one of those-but for the basest of political motives and for that irresistible urge on the part of the opposition leader to say no, no, no. The opposition leader is a self-declared weathervane on climate change. He supported an ETS. He supported a carbon tax. He said that climate change was 'crap' and he is now supporting central planning. Businesses want certainty about climate change policy, not weathervane economics. They certainly do not need the opposition leader and the shadow Treasurer talking down the economy. There were good figures out a couple of weeks ago. What do we have? 'Glum and Glummer' over there always talking down the economy. The only way of getting business certainty is to support the Gillard government's policy over the rank political opportunism of the Leader of the Opposition. Say goodnight, Glum and Glummer.

121,Mr CHRISTENSEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Population and Communities. I remind the minister that Australia imports over 70 per cent of the seafood we consume and at current consumption levels we are projected to require an additional 850,000 tonnes by 2020. Given that the minister plans to deny access to valuable fisheries across Australia as a result of his massively expanding marine parks, what will the impact be on the price of seafood as Australia imports more and catches less locally?",94
122,Mr BURKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Watson-Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Population and Communities) (15:05): I thank the honourable member for his question. I am not surprised, given the distance all these zones are from Mackay, that he has gone off any questions about recreational fishers and gone to the commercials. I am not surprised at all by that. He wants to know what the commercial impact will be. When the impact on the gross value of production is in the order of between one and two per cent then that will be the impact. Between one and two per cent is the impact. Mr Christensen interjecting",94

The minister has the call and he will return to the question before the chair. The member for Dawson then left the chamber.",94
129,Mr BURKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The question referred to the extent to which we import seafood. It is also important to remember that, as a trading nation, we also export massive amounts of seafood. If you go through our highest value fisheries like the southern bluefin tuna fishery, we export 98 to 99 per cent of that catch. You have large amounts of export with the WA rock lobster industry as well. So to simply look at the import figures and make those sorts of assertions does not add up and shows a lack of understanding of how the Australian fisheries industries actually work. We have had similar claims about the impact by references to a large trawler that is allegedly coming into Australian waters, whereas in fact that trawler has made no application to do so at all. What we have there is the classic example of a fear campaign running off the back of one to two per cent of gross value of production. If we had not conducted the level of consultation that we had and simply gone with initial maps then you would find a much larger impact. But, as the consultation took place around the country, we made sure that, from the initial scientific basis wherever Families, we could shift a boundary to minimise the impact on commercial fishers but to get a similar environment impact, we made those changes-and we make no apology for doing that. Wherever it has been possible to improve the socio-economic outcomes without in any way reducing the environmental outcomes, we have done that. We have done that with the direct opposition from those opposite, saying it should be science based and nothing else, but that is exactly the approach which has minimised the fear campaign that the member would otherwise be wanting to refer to. What he is saying there ultimately has no foundation when you get to your one to two per cent across your oceans figure. What we have is an environmental outcome that is world leading and done in a way that respects the people who want to get in a tinnie and fish and the people who make a living from fishing. You only have to look at the direct impact on those who have made comments, such as ones within the electorate of Leichhardt who have said what they want now is certainty to have the negotiation with government and know exactly what the outcome is. Tourism gets its benefit and you get the economic decisions made using the template that was given to us when the south-east was done by the Howard government. Family Payments",94
130,Ms GRIERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Minister for Disability Reform. Will the minister outline to the House how the government is helping Australian families make ends meet? How is this support being delivered and what would be the impact of withdrawing it?",95
131,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Jagajaga-Minister for Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Minister for Disability Reform) (15:09): I thank the member for Newcastle for her question. As she knows, this Labor government is all about giving back to ordinary Australian families. We are making sure that we help those families make ends meet. I can inform the House that in the last couple of weeks around 1.6 million Australian families have received payments to help them with their bills and to help them over coming months. This week families will start receiving the schoolkids bonus. It will go straight into their bank accounts and make sure that families get the help that they need with the costs of educating their children. What we know is that it is important to also give support to pensioners, and so for those who are on the pension we have had around 3.2 million Australian pensioners also get increases straight into their bank accounts over the last few weeks. If you are a single pensioner, you would have received $250, and $380 for couples combined, so that is already providing extra help for those pensioners. This, of course, is on top of the historic increases that this government has provided to Australian pensioners of around $150 a fortnight, making a huge difference to the needs of pensioners. From March next year, we will be providing ongoing and regular increases to pensioners. For a family that is on around $75,000 a year with two primary school-age children, this will mean that they will get around $1,000 in tax cuts and increased payments. For this family with two primary school-age children, they will also receive the schoolkids bonus and increases in family payments next year. What we know is that this Liberal Party is hell-bent on clawing this money back from families and pensioners. We already see it in Victoria, where the Liberal government is clawing back their school start bonus. We know Barry O'Farrell is doing the same to pensioners in public housing: clawing back the pension increase and forcing up public housing rents. We know that this Leader of the Opposition is going to do exactly the same: claw back the pension increase and claw back the family payment increase-just like his Liberal colleagues in New South Wales and Victoria.",95

139,Ms RISHWORTH,DOCUMENTS," I am very pleased today to speak on the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Amendment Bill 2012. This is a very timely and important bill to ensure that we progress gender equality in the workplace. The campaign for women's equal representation in the workplace is one many decades in the making. We have seen various triumphs for women over the years at a national and international level. When I was researching this speech it was very interesting to hear many stories of women who have really put themselves out there to draw attention to this important issue. One of these was Zelda D'Aprano, who chained herself to the Commonwealth Building in Melbourne while campaigning to ensure equal pay. This was really important and the legislation before us today builds on the legislation and the many achievements that have gone before it. The legislation goes back a long way, but in 1972 the big decision made by the courts was to grant equal pay for equal work. This was a very important decision because it put into law that women who were doing the same work as men, alongside their work BILLS colleagues, would get equal pay. We have continued to see some inequities in the area of equal pay, which I will talk about shortly, but that decision was a very important one in ensuring the start of equal opportunity in the workplace. Twenty-eight years ago the Sex Discrimination Act was introduced and the Affirmative Action (Equal Employment Opportunity for Women) Act 1986 was introduced two years later. This was the important legislation and there have been some important inroads made in this area. There was a government review in 1999 which looked at this issue and again some improvements were made-but one would agree that more than 10 years after that review it is important that we review the act again. In 2008, the then Minister for the Status of Women, Tanya Plibersek, announced a review of this legislation. It was very important that this take into consideration the many stakeholders and interested parties to ensure that we got this legislation right for the next decade. The legislation in front of us today makes some important improvements to the legislation. In particular-and it does a number of thingsthe bill amends the name of the act to the Workplace Gender Equality Act 2012, which emphasises the focus of the act on gender equality, thereby improving the outcomes for women and men in workplaces. The name of the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Agency will also be changed to the Workplace Gender Equality Agency. This will be important to equip this agency to prepare to move into the future. As I mentioned, things have changed: we hopefully do not have to have women chaining themselves to Commonwealth buildings to get fair pay, but we still have to make sure that we are approaching and tackling gender inequity in our workplaces, and this sets the agency up to be very much focused on its task ahead. The bill amends the principal objectives of the act to reflect on a new focus to promote and improve gender equality in the workplace, with special recognition of equal remuneration and family and caring responsibilities as issues central to the achievement of gender equality. While we have come a long way in remuneration and ensuring that women and men get paid equally, we still have a long way to go. It was only very recently that we were able to celebrate-and I certainly welcomed-the decision by Fair Work Australia in the fair pay case. That recognised that there has been systematic underpayment of women, depending on which areas of work they take up, and that the structural inequity must be addressed. That was a very important decision, one that I welcomed, but I am also proud to be part of a government that not only welcomed that decision and what it meant for many women workers around the country but also responded practically by putting its money where its mouth was in terms of fair pay for women. I encourage all the states and territories to do the same. We need to work with the states and territories ensure that the fair pay decision becomes realised. I am very pleased that this Commonwealth Labor government has made that commitment. Family and caring responsibilities are issues central to the achievement of gender equality, and so often it is women who take on the brunt or the burden of caring. Many women are very pleased to take this on, whether it be for children or older parents, and they are pleased to be of service and want to do this. However, we must recognise that this can affect the participation of women in the workforce. Without having the proper flexibilities and the proper frameworks in place this can, for many women, affect their participation in the workplace and does not allow them to achieve gender equity. It is not just in the workplace that this is an issue but also in the future with superannuation. For many women who take on part-time roles and balance their caring responsibilities with their work responsibilities, who take time out of the workplace while raising children, there will be inequities in superannuation. This is a very important area that we must continue to focus on as to how we ensure that women are not disadvantaged-not just at work but also in retirement. I am very pleased that the objects of this act will be amended to ensure that family and caring responsibilities are issues central to the achievement of gender equality. This bill also proposes to improve the coverage of the act to include men as well as women. Agency advice and assistance functions will not be just for those companies that are required to report. Under the legislation employers of 100 or more employees are subject to the reporting requirements. This suggests that only those organisations could get advice and assistance to from the agency. I am very pleased that this bill will ensure that the agency's advice and assistance will extend to all employers. So if that employer is a small business looking at gender equality and equity issues it will also be able to access advice. I encourage those small businesses that may be interested in this area to get in touch once the new agency is providing this advice to get some ideas about this. The bill also introduces a new reporting framework in which relevant employers are required to report against gender equality indicators. This will commence from 1 April 2013. Obviously, this provides employers with some time in which they can get their information together. It has a phase-in period. The requirement for the equal opportunity in the workplace program will be removed and the reporting will be simpler as well as more meaningful and more useful. One of the really important things in this bill is that it will allow employers to both measure and understand gender equality within their workplaces but also compare themselves to other workplaces in their industry. I think this is important because will allow the agency to target assistance and, over time, will also allow employers to really gauge how they are doing on issues of gender equity. Over time, the improved and standardised data set will also allow the minister to set minimum standards. This will be important to communicate clearly to businesses what these minimum standards are. They will be based on a standardised set of data, recognising that things change from industry to industry. The functions of the agency will be to develop industry based benchmarks in relation to gender equality indicators. The agency will also have specific roles in providing assistance and advice on improving performance against minimum standards. The bill also clarifies and improves transparency associated with compliance with the act and the consequences of non-compliance. This bill builds on this Labor government's achievements when it comes to women's participation in the workforce. We have introduced key things. I have mentioned the fair pay decision and the commitment by this government to put money up to fund that decision. When we were first elected, we addressed the issue of childcare costs. We moved from a 30 per cent rebate to a 50 per cent rebate for childcare costs. That was very important. I was very proud to be part of a government that introduced paid parental leave for the first time in this nation's history. This paid parental leave ensures a continuing connection with the workforce for women taking time out of the workforce to have children, being able to re-enter the workforce if they desire. I am very pleased that this Labor government delivered that. I think that this bill builds on a lot of advances that we have made in terms of gender equity in the workplace. I was very concerned to hear-back in my home state of it South Australia-the state Leader of the Opposition, Isobel Redmond, say, when asked what she would do if she felt she was being discriminated against on the basis of gender, 'Look, I just put up with it and hopefully it will go away.' I do not think that is an appropriate response. I think it was a very concerning message to many women out there that they should just put up with it, that it should be just part of work. You feel discriminated against, you get passed over for promotion. There is not a sense that you are actually being recognised; you should just put up with it and ignore it. I do not think that is the attitude of most places. I do not think it is the attitude of most in this parliament. We need to ensure that there is gender equality in our workplaces right around Australia, that women and men get a fair go in terms of their time at work and ensure that their rights and ability to fully participate are encouraged. On that note, I think this is a very important development on the bill. As discussed, a number of ministers have widely consulted on this and I believe this does strike a good balance in ensuring and progressing equity in our workforce but also in ensuring that it is easier for business to deliver.",98
140,Ms VAMVAKINOU,DOCUMENTS," It is a pleasure to follow the member for Kingston in speaking to this Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Amendment Bill 2012. This bill amends the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Act 1999 to deliver very importantly on a 2010 election commitment by the government to improve women's workforce participation. This proposed legislation presents a new framework for encouraging gender equality by removing those disincentives that mitigate against the equal participation of women in the workforce. It also fulfils a dual purpose of supporting improved workforce participation-particularly that of women and carers-as well as reducing, more importantly, the regulatory burden on business. This is a timely bill and the government must be commended for its determination to implement these important changes because they are defining changes that will make a real difference to women and men in the broader workforce. Many of us still struggle to comprehend in today's society-living in one of the most democratic countries in the world-why it is that wage parity, practical employment structures and cracking that infamous corporate glass ceiling sadly still elude many women. In contemporary Australia, where women are encouraged to achieve and contribute to the workforce, the issue of gender inequality as a significant disincentive to women's workforce participation must be challenged and addressed. While much of this workplace discrimination may not be intentional, it does highlight a need to challenge the manifestation of entrenched views based on gender differences in the workplace. Many of those entrenched views stem from practices that are driven very much by gender stereotyping and expectations. One of the most obvious differences and, therefore, stereotyping practices is that women are by nature designed to bear children, and men are not. With that comes a whole lot of other gender intricacies. Rather than be left to continue to make it difficult for women to participate in the workforce, these intricacies should be embraced and catered for, knowing that one size does not fit all in the workplace and that we need the flexibility to accommodate and therefore maximise workforce participation for women and men. The truth is that many prospective employers do tend to adopt an attitude that avoids employing or promoting women because it is perceived that they are more likely to have family-work balance issues that, if the truth be said, are not necessarily problems for prospective male employees. That is not to say that men do not have responsibilities to their families, but existing traditional workplace conditions together with social expectations have created a workplace culture which traditionally made it easier for men to participate and harder for women to participate. So we need to change our attitudes and, if we are to change the culture in the workplace as it relates to the participation of women and men, we need to encourage more women into the workforce and we have to act via legislation to ensure that these changes are implemented and we get a more equal playing field. That is why I support this bill. Our community has changed and is changing around us, and it expects government to act and to respond to those changes. The introduction of this bill ensures that we are steadily working our way through our attitudes and practices on gender equality issues and the responsibilities of both genders when it comes to the balance between work and family. The introduction of this amendment bill follows a review that found that, since the act was last amended in 1999, there have been a number of economic, social and legislative changes that require the agency to provide a more contemporary response to these changes. The government undertook extensive consultation with industry, employee organisations and the women's sector and, in doing so, drafted legislation that is finely balanced-legislation that all parties are comfortable with and which is very much about supporting employers to achieve cultural change. It most certainly is not punishing employers or setting unreasonable standards that they cannot meet. Importantly, the government is acting by introducing this amendment bill because the review made it clear that gender equality is essential to maximising Australia's productive potential and ensuring continuing economic growth. Closing the gap between women's and men's workforce participation is estimated to have the potential to boost gross domestic product by some 13 per cent. But, more importantly, it also has the potential to improve the lives of the broader Australian community in so many ways beyond the GDP. I do want to draw the House's attention to the recently released report by the Grattan Institute, Game-changers: economic reform priorities for Australia. In that report it is affirmed that the participation of women in the workforce is one of the three major areas that were identified by the Grattan Institute for increasing Australia's GDP. The issue of women's participation is a game changer. It is worth up to $90 million or so in GDP increase over the next decade. So it is a significant issue and cannot be ignored. This bill makes the appropriate changes in order to take advantage of the participation of all Australians-in particular, women-in the workforce. It changes the name of the act to the Workplace Gender Equality Act 2012, and the name of the agency from the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Agency to the Workplace Gender Equality Agency. The principal objectives of the amendments are to promote and improve gender equality, including equal remuneration between men and women in employment and in the workplace. It aims to do this by supporting employers to remove barriers to the full participation of women about and men, recognising the disadvantaged position of women in relation to employment. I cannot see how the aims of this amendment bill can be anything other than positive. Gender equality in Australian workplaces is important for women, it is important for men, it is important for businesses and it is important for the economy. And it is very much a win-win for all-for employers, for employees and especially for women. And it is, of course, a win for Australia's GDP capacity. I know that my constituents would benefit greatly from achieving gender equality in the workplace. They certainly will be better off with the stated aim of this bill, which is to close the gap between men's and women's participation. Many people in my electorate talk about their responsibilities to their children, their aged parents and their disabled family members. They all talk about their ways of finding strategies to balance these responsibilities with the need to work. So I am absolutely certain that they will welcome this bill. In particular, there are many women in my electorate who go about the daily business of balancing work and family commitments. These are women who must look after their children but must also work, and in most cases they are the lowskilled women who are also in low-paid jobs. Then there are the young women in my electorate-those who are single and those who are highly-skilled, career-focused women who will largely rely on changes in the workplace culture to pave the way for a change of attitude that will enable them to face less discrimination as they pursue their careers and life's ambitions and choices. So I am familiar, as all of us should be, with these community attitudes and how this bill will assist in making their lives a easier as it will allow them to participate in the workforce. This is especially so for the women in my electorate, and I want to make a special mention of the many refugee women who have settled in the federal seat of Calwell. These are women who have come from less democratic and equitable societies-women who, in addition to working to support their families, have also to pick up the pieces of broken lives and lost homes; women who have fled war, who have feared and continue to fear for the safety of their loved ones, but especially for the security and the future of their children; women who have overcome horrors that we here in Australia have never experienced. Yet these women persevere, and they form a part of the socio-economic and cultural diversity of the Australia community and, indeed, the Australian workforce. They are grateful to be here, as waves of migrants before them were; they are grateful for the opportunity. But they are more often than not the most likely to be excluded from workplace participation and they, like the rest of the Australian community, deserve a fairer, more equal playing field. We all deserve a society and a workplace that caters and allows for greater gender equity and flexibility. That is how we ensure a happier, fairer and more equitable society. Of course change is never easy, but in some circumstances it cannot be brought on soon enough. The time has come to address the obvious and allow workplaces to meet the needs of our changing societies, and I commend the bill to the House.",100
141,Ms COLLINS,DOCUMENTS,"Franklin-Minister for Community Services, Minister for the Status of Women and Minister for Indigenous Employment and Economic Development) (15:44): I thank all of those people who made contributions on this important bill. The Equal Opportunity for Women in the little Workplace Amendment Bill 2012 amends the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Act 1999, delivering a significant package of reforms promised by this government during the 2010 election. These reforms are aimed at improving gender equality in Australian workplaces. For improved workplace participation and workplace flexibility for women, these reforms will help to improve productivity and address current and future skills shortages. It has been estimated that closing the gap between men's and women's workforce participation could boost gross domestic product by up to13 per cent. The bill has been developed in close consultation with key stakeholders including industry, employee organisations and the women's sector. The government believes the bill strikes the right balance between the views of these stakeholders. Since its introduction on 1 March 2012, the bill has received widespread support from across the sectors. The government will not be supporting the opposition's amendments to this bill. The second reading amendment proposed by the opposition, that implies the government is not genuinely committed to equality because we are not adopting the opposition's paid parental leave scheme, really is laughable because it is this government that took the historic step of delivering Australia's first national Paid Parental Leave scheme. We now have more than 160,000 expectant and new parents who have applied for the government's Paid Parental Leave scheme. Our scheme is affordable. It is fair for families and fair for businesses. We waited 11 years for those opposite to deliver this important reform, but they said no. Now they are proposing a $4.5 billion plan that ironically, from what we have heard in their contributions to debate on this bill, whacks a tax on business to pay for itself. The detailed amendments moved by the opposition are inconsistent and impractical and have the potential to increase red tape for businesses and for the agency. What the government is aiming to achieve through this legislation is cultural changethat is, change that will come from employers receiving education, assistance and support to make their workplaces more gender equal, and change that will benefit women and men, businesses and industry, and the Australian economy. A review of the current act by the Office for Women found updates were needed both to the act and to the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Agency to provide contemporary response to challenges. The review also made it clear that gender equality is essential to maximising Australia's productive potential and to ensuring continued economic growth. The bill changes the name of the act to the Workplace Gender Equality Act 2012 to emphasise this new focus in the act on gender equality in the workplace. Similar changes are made to the name of the agency, which is to be called the Workplace Gender Equality Agency. The government is providing the agency with an additional $11.2 million-a doubling of funds-a part of which will be used to provide practical help and advice to business. The principal objects of the act are amended by the bill to reflect the focus on gender equality in the workplace, and include the promotion of matters such as equal remuneration, support for employers to remove workplace participation barriers for women in particular, and improved productivity and competitiveness Australian businesses through the advancement of gender equality. Importantly, the coverage of the act is expanded to include men as well as women, particularly in relation to caring responsibilities. Under the new, outcomes based, streamlined and more transparent reporting requirements, relevant employers will prepare and lodge public reports containing information on gender equality indicators for the reporting period commencing 1 April 2013. Smaller organisations with fewer than 100 employees will not be required to report. In other words, not one small business will be affected by the reporting requirements but they will still be able to access the agency's free advice, education and incentive activities if they wish. Relevant businesses a will be able to complete and submit reports national online using a secure web portal. Businesses have wanted this change and it will save them time and money. The reporting changes will represent the first opportunity for the agency to gather and analyse a rigorous and standardised data set and will mean employers can measure their performance against other employers in their industry. This new reporting will mean less red tape. Businesses will no longer need to provide lengthy descriptions of the programs and policies they have in place. When an employer lodges a public report, employees and shareholders will be informed, and employees and employee organisations will be given an opportunity to comment. Under the amended legislation, the minister will be able to set industry specific minimum standards in consultation with industry and experts. These minimum standards will be determined before 1 April 2014. The minimum standards will be evidence based, clear and fair, and will take of into account industry characteristics and circumstances. We will be setting these minimum standards in close consultation with industry to make sure of this. This bill is not about punishing employers. These standards will be about identifying which employers need the most intensive assistance and education in order to achieve cultural change within their organisations. The bill also improves the transparency and fairness of the compliance framework and of the consequences for non-compliance. Sex Discrimination Commissioner, Elizabeth Broderick, said in a media release that the bill was: 'a strong step toward improving women's workforce participation and, thus, closing the gender gap in Australia's workforce'. Westpac has also welcomed this bill. The Head of Diversity and Flexibility in the Westpac Group, Jane Counsel, said the reforms will provide a catalyst to drive concrete change through creating more focus, accountability and transparency to ensure all organisations are committed to delivering more inclusive and flexible workplaces. The CEO of Citi Australia, Stephen Roberts, is happy to be on the record as saying he welcomes this legislation and the contribution it will make to improving gender diversity in the workforce. He says: A diverse team is invariably smarter, more resilient and more productive-all of which is required for success in business. The YWCA Australia executive director, Dr Caroline Lambert, has also commended the government 'for taking action to strengthen the tools for gender equality in the workplace'. She says: YWCA Australia welcomes the focus in the Bill on caring responsibilities. This legislation will contribute to real change in the lives of women and men in workplaces across Australia, and we look forward to its passage in the Parliament. Madam Deputy Speaker, I am pleased to say that time has arrived. This new legislation puts gender equality in the workplace in the spotlight and it shows the determination of this government to advance gender equality between women and men and to strengthen our economy.",103

(9) Schedule 1, Part 1, item 71, page 21 (after 23), after section 33A, insert: 33B Minister to repeal a legislative instrument when a new instrument is made If making a legislative instrument under this Act which imposes a requirement on employers, the Minister must cause an existing legislative instrument which imposes a requirement on employers to be repealed. As the Minister for the Status of Women, who is at the table, reminded us, this bill was introduced into the House on 1 March. It has finally lurched to its conclusion. It has taken months and yet there is not a single member of the government behind this minister here and now to wave this exciting piece of reform through, even though it has been described as such by every single speaker from the government. If this bill made a single bit of difference to the women that I meet in my life as an opposition spokesperson and a local member-women struggling participation in the workforce, with the cost of child care, with working the hours they want to work at times they want to work and with balancing very difficult work and family responsibilities, with, as my friend the member for Calwell said, issues surrounding recently arrived migrants and refugees-I would be supporting it without hesitation. But, if we apply the ultimate barbecue stopper, what members of the government will be going out into their electorates after today and talking about this bill? What members of the government are writing this bill up in their local newsletters or issuing media releases to say, 'Everybody, we've created a new agency. It's called the Workplace Gender Equality Agency. It's led by a new individual called the director of workplace gender equality. Our departments are putting together gender equality indicators and then there will be an enormous amount of ministerial discretion line over how to apply the new rules that we have not yet worked out in the workplaces of Australia'? Mind you, it only affects private workplaces. If you work in public workplaces, this bill does not apply to you. We think that is incredibly unfair, by the way. What members of the government are talking this up? I would challenge any one of them to send me the literature that they are putting out in their communities to support this, because this is meaningless. It is meaningless to the average Australian who is struggling with the cost of living and the issues of balancing work and family, which are supposedly what this bill is about. As I said, it covers a new agency, new indicators and vast-ranging ministerial discretion to do things which we are not sure about. The minister at the table said, 'Relax, it won't apply to businesses with fewer than 100 employees, so small businesses won't be with affected.' But, because the discretion exists, it actually might. Articulated in this legislation is a mandate to consider these businesses as strategies are developed around resources et cetera. Those businesses are not automatically removed or ruled out of this legislation. In future this legislation may capture businesses with fewer than 100 employees. As it is, every business in Australia will be caught up in learning about this new legislation, what it means, whether they have to report, to what degree they might have to report and whether something will come down the track that will trap them into more red tape, more regulation and more explanations. We are moving amendments to this bill, and I encourage members of the government and the Independents to consider them carefully. The amendments are varied, but the key amendment which I think should wave a red flag in this place is the one that says that, for every piece of regulation that added for businesses under this bill, we expect one piece of regulation to be taken away. We do not think it is fair. I have heard speaker after speaker explain that this will take away the burden of regulation on businesses, so I would like to see that demonstrated by the government. I asked for that in my second reading speech, but I have not heard back. I can only assume that this is going to add to red tape and regulation. The coalition has formed the view that this bill, which is being promoted as a bill to increase gender equality in the workplace, is in reality an artificial contrivance by the government to increase union power and leverage in workplaces. The government, when questioned about the impact of this bill, is unable to tell us how many more women will be employed, how many more jobs will be created or what is to be the actual increase in gender equality in the workplace as a result of the measures provided for in this bill. It is employers that will have to implement these proposed workplace changes, not the public sector, unions or lobby groups. It is employers that will have to bear the additional costs of these changes, notwithstanding that government cannot tell us what those costs are. Our amendments are very much in the interests of the employers, the families and the communities that we on this side of the House speak up for.",105

To be honest, the amendments as distributed would actually cause more red tape for businesses and for the agency. I particularly note that the member for Farrer talked about the last amendment of the is legislation removing red tape. It is interesting and quite unusual, because the opposition are asking the minister to cause a legislative instrument to be repealed, which I cannot do because that is the role of the parliament. That indicates what these amendments are about. The government does not support the amendments. We have consulted widely with employers on this legislation. I believe that most employers understand the need for this legislation, because they know it will be good for businesses. I stand by the government's legislation.",107

Question agreed to. NA Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Stronger Super) Bill 2012 Superannuation Supervisory Levy Imposition Amendment Bill 2012 Second Reading Cognate debate. Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. Mr TONY SMITH (Casey) (16:17): Let me say at the outset that the coalition supports these bills-the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Stronger Super) Bill 2012 and the Superannuation Supervisory Levy Imposition Amendment Bill 2012-which were introduced on Thursday, 24 May 2012 by the member for Maribyrnong, the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. I will run briefly through the schedules in the first bill, then the single schedule in the second bill and cover a couple of areas of detail that have been raised since the minister introduced this legislation in the last sitting fortnight. As I said at the outset on behalf of the coalition, we support these bills and the principles that underpin them. With respect to the Superannuation Amendment (Stronger Super) Bill 2012, the first schedule of the bill introduces-as the minister outlined in his second reading speech and in the explanatory memorandum-a framework to support the implementation of superannuation data and payment regulations and standards that will apply to specified superannuation transactions undertaken by superannuation entities, retirement savings account providers and employers. The second schedule amends the APRA Act, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority Act 1998-specifically section 50-to enable costs associated with the implementation of the measures to be included in the minister's determination specifying the amount of the levy that is payable to the Commonwealth. The amendments also enable the minister to make a determination that specifies the proportion of levy money paid to APRA that is to be credited to the APRA Special Account. The Superannuation Supervisory Levy Imposition Amendment Bill amends the Superannuation Supervisory Levy Imposition Act 1998 in a range of material respects to enable the Treasurer to make more than one determination on the imposition of levies for a financial year. The coalition is supporting this legislation and supports the principle of measures that improve the efficiency, transparency and competitiveness of the administration of the superannuation system by making the system easier to use for employers, ensuring fewer lost accounts, providing a more timely flow of money to super fund members' accounts and delivering savings to employers and fund members. As part of the government's proposal, these bills provide for the implementation of data and payment regulations and standards, as I have outlined, that will allow participants in the super system to communicate by using Legislation standardised business terms in a consistent and reliable format. Electronic transmission using agreed transport and security protocols will allow for a more automated and timely processing of transactions with fewer errors. If properly implemented, these changes will deliver significant efficiency savings to the super industry and to employers. Indeed, the savings have been estimated by the Financial Services Council to be quite significant-of the order of $20 billion over 10 years. Much of the detail on these new standards will, of course, be in regulations, which industry participants consider to be appropriate. Like most pieces of technical legislation, this has been before a parliamentary committee since its introduction on 24 May-that committee being the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, of which I am a member. That committee reported today-around lunchtime, to be accurate-recommending that the legislation be passed but also recommending: That the ATO be required to provide a regular detailed breakdown of its costs and expenditure of the additional levies to the SuperStream Advisory Council, based on reporting guidelines developed in consultation between the council and the ATO. That is a firm recommendation of the committee-and by all members on the committee. The cost of implementation, as outlined in the legislation and in the minister's speech, will be $467 million from 2012-13 to 2017-18, including $121 million in 2012-13. So we think that that recommendation in the report tabled earlier today is a relevant one. We on this side of the House note that it is supported by all members on the committee. As I said, we support this legislation and think if properly showing implemented it will certainly provide benefits and efficiencies right through the system.",109
149,Dr LEIGH,BILLS," Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Stronger Super) Bill 2012 and the Superannuation Supervisory Imposition Amendment Bill 2012 introduce a framework to support the implementation of superannuation data and payment regulations and standards that will apply to specified superannuation transactions undertaken by superannuation entities, retirement savings account providers and employers. As the previously speaker noted, this is technical legislation, but it is legislation that will make a difference to Australians and their families. SuperStream costs of $467 million will be collected through the superannuation supervisory levy from 2012-13 to 2017-18. That will enable the government to collect the implementation costs associated with the SuperStream measure. The opposition have acknowledged the efficiencies from the SuperStream proposal and acknowledged that they have the potential to deliver real savings over time and will benefit superannuants. The Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia calculates that $1.3 trillion of assets are in superannuation funds. Treasury forecasts estimate that this will grow to between $3 trillion and $5 trillion by 2025. When Bob Hawke took office in 1983, just 40 per cent of the workforce had superannuation cover. Thanks to Labor, that rose from 72 per cent in 1991 to 94 per cent in 2007. Australians have more money invested in managed funds per capita than any other economy in the world. The Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation today released new research broad support for the superannuation system but that, understandably, many people continue to find it a difficult topic to understand. Senator The Sherry, who recently stepped down after many years of public service, was one of those in the Labor caucus with a true passion Levy for superannuation-but I cannot promise that the rest of us ever had quite his level of engagement with that topic. But it is important that Australian policy makers recognise the benefits to improving the simplicity and the efficiency of the superannuation system. There is $20 billion in lost super in Australia, and reuniting Australians with their lost superannuation is absolutely critical. I joined with Chris Bourke MLA, last year in running some mobile offices around the ACT. We found that there were particular postcodes in which there was a very high level of lost superannuation. We worked with a simple mobile office and a laptop computer helping people get back in touch with their lost superannuation accounts using the ATO's SuperSeeker tool. We were have pleased on a number of occasions to assist people in finding their unclaimed superannuation. The research announced today by the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation showed that people's level of interest in their superannuation varied depending on how old they are, how financially literate they are and the amount of superannuation they had saved. It found that across all age groups, the majority of Australians were not confident that they have enough superannuation to retire and live comfortably on and that, overall, employers believe that superannuation is beneficial to their employees and the general population to reduce the reliance on the pensiongiving lie to the claim by some of those opposite in the early 1990s that employers would not support universal superannuation. The superannuation industry is currently dominated by paper based transactions. They are inefficient in both processing costs and the time taken for transactions to occur and superannuation to be deposited into members' accounts. The superannuation data and payment standards will allow participants in the superannuation system to communicate using standard business terms in a consistent and reliable format. Using electronic transmission, with agreed security protocols, will mean that we will get quicker processing of transactions and fewer errors. Just as e-health is bringing about efficiencies in the healthcare system, so, too, greater efficiency in the superannuation payments system is a benefit to all Australians. easier system for employers to use. There will be fewer lost accounts and Australians will get the money in their accounts more quickly-which, of course, means that they will begin earning returns more quickly. The superannuation data and payment standards will be mandated superannuation entities, including approved deposit funds, RSA providers and employers. The regulators-being the commissioner and APRA-will support the rollout of the new data and payment standards through education activities and a new compliance framework. Industry submissions to the super system review estimated that savings of up to a billion dollars per annum are achievable from implementing SuperStream reforms. Members will be able to look up and keep track of their superannuation, have low-value inactive accounts consolidated automatically, be able to consolidate larger accounts easily, have their contributions and rollovers processed more quickly and be able to more easily check if their superannuation contributions have been made. Employers will benefit from having standardised, simplified administrative processes when dealing with superannuation funds. Superannuation funds will benefit from standardised and simplified administrative processes when dealing with employers and other funds, and be able to make greater use of tax file numbers to facilitate matching and consolidation of accounts and of electronic validation services from the ATO that will help their administration and help ensure members are properly matched with their superannuation. Efficiencies for superannuation funds mean higher returns for fund members. When Prime Minister Paul Keating moved to introduce the superannuation guarantee It is an levy, Wilson Tuckey drew on his long history in the racing industry to compare the legislation to the 'worse type of jockey … both stupid and dishonest'. Mr Tuckey continued: When the poor old employer levy gets to 12 per cent, what will it deliver? Luckily, it might for deliver an overseas holiday and a few presents for the kids, but it will not deliver a retirement income at the inflated costs of those days. As Minister Shorten has demonstrated, a 12 per cent superannuation guarantee will provide to a worker now aged 30 on average full-time wages a real benefit of over $553,000 at age pension age. That should leave a bit of change after an overseas holiday and a few presents for the kids. the The Leader of the Opposition once called Labor's superannuation guarantee a con job. Those opposite have either been uninterested in superannuation or outright critical. When Senator Bishop-as she then was-spoke in the other place on the introduction of universal super on 18 August 1992 she said: On this side opposition members argued very logically and meaningfully that the imposition of this compulsory superannuation tax is a de facto federal payroll tax. Yes, they were running their 'great big new tax' argument even against compulsory superannuation. Then Senator Bishop told the Senate about a conversation with a small business person who had said: But now that this compulsory superannuation payment has gone through, yesterday I had to sack a part time employee and turn a full time employee into a part time employee. The late Senator Peter Cook, a man for whom I was privileged to work, was moved by that statement to interject that given that the law for universal superannuation had not yet come into effect, it was hard to see how small-business people would be affected by it. You can see shades of that in the scare campaign those opposite are running against the carbon price, which has not yet come into effect. But Senator Bishop-as she was then was-was unmoved and finished up the debate as follows: I heard Senator MCMullan say, ‘The difference between our systems on superannuation is that ours is compulsory and theirs is voluntary'. That is very true. That is an essential difference. Our policy is designed to make it attractive for people to provide for themselves in later life whereas this Government's is designed to penalise business, to regulate it out of existence. Of course, if you carry on with that logic then the member for Mackellar should today be saying to this chamber that superannuation is penalising business and ought to be scrapped. But the fact is that noone is making those arguments. I quoted some of the statements made in the 1990s because they illustrate an important point, not just about superannuation but also about economic history more generally. The economic reforms that have made Australia great, like universal superannuation, were hard fought at the time. Many of them were opposed by those opposite and many of those opposite at the time said they would scrap them if they were to win government. But when they did in fact take the Treasury benches, they did nothing of the kind. Universal superannuation is now part of the Australian social fabric. It was attacked at the time, demonised as being a big new tax and is now recognised as being an important pillar of a dignified retirement in Australia. Australian workers, 8.4 million of them, will benefit from an increase in the superannuation guarantee rate from nine per cent to 12 per cent. This government is also abolishing the age limit for the superannuation guarantee so, no matter what your age, if you work you will get super. It will provide an extra contribution for the 3.6 million Australians who are earning up to $37,000. That includes plenty of part-time workers as well as low-income earners. It is a recognition of the point made in the Henry tax review that the superannuation concessions were, under the Howard government, significantly more generous for high-income earners than for low-income earners. We are putting in place simplification reforms, which will allow people to see their superannuation account and will give employees certainty by requiring superannuation information to be on every pay slip so people can check to make sure they have got what they are entitled to. We are also introducing a MySuper product, recognising that most employees will take the default fund and within that fund will take the default investment plan. So it is important that the defaults are good and that defaults get good market returns. We are also putting in place more efficiencies to ensure lower fees for fund members. All of these reforms will ensure Australians get the superannuation they are entitled to and ensure the system is as simple, efficient and equitable as it needs to be. I commend the bill to the House.",111
150,Mr FLETCHER,BILLS," It is always a pleasure to follow the member for Fraser, who gave us a discursive exploration of superannuation policy after briefly deigning to come to the specifics of the bill before us. Naturally, I am going more limited and-some might say-small minded by concentrating purely on the provisions that are before the House this afternoon. What I would like to say is that, in the broad, the coalition is supportive of the legislative direction contained in the legislation the House is considering this afternoon. It is an uncontentious proposition that the superannuation sector is dominated by paper based transactions, and that there are real inefficiencies, real deadweight costs and transactions costs. There is clearly capacity to secure efficiencies through the use of information technology standardised formats for the exchange of data and so on. Coming, as I do, into this place from a background in the telecommunications sector, I became quite surprised as the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services on which I served learnt about the challenges currently facing the superannuation sector and the extent to which information is exchanged in paper based form. By contrast, and as one example of the kinds of efficiencies which can be secured on an industry wide basis through the use of information technology, in the telecommunications sector the mobile number portability standard requires that if a customer wishes to port his or her number from one mobile operator to another, it needs to take effect within the course of one dayand often it takes very much less time than that. Therefore I have in my own experience seen the efficiency benefits which can be delivered when standardised information technology systems are used and data transfer standards are applied to a range of participants in an industry. Let me readily concede that the superannuation sector challenge is an even to be more daunting one than the one which applies in the telecommunications sector because of the fact that, in addition to all of the superannuation funds-and there are of course hundreds of them-you also have millions of employers, ranging from the very, very large to the many very small businesses. That does present some specific challenges and it also presents some areas of concern with particular aspects of this billareas which I am pleased to say were acknowledged by the committee in its unanimous report. In the brief time. I have to speak about this bill today, I want to make essentially three points. Firstly, I want to say that the provisions underpinning greater efficiency in superannuation contained in this bill and the legislative scheme, in the broad, make sense. Secondly, I want to highlight the fact that there are real reasons for doubt and for questioning why the amount of money which has been sought by the Australian Taxation Office to implement this set of information technology changes, and which is funded ultimately by a levy on the industry, is so high. Where is the justification for the costings? Thirdly, I want to question why it is that the legislation takes a particular approach which in particular bristles with penalties and strict liability provisions. Let me turn firstly to the broad rationale for this bill-a rationale which, as I have indicated, the coalition supports. As the explanatory memorandum states: The purpose … is to improve the administration and management of super accounts making the processing of everyday transactions easier, cheaper and faster for members and employers. I think any Australian who has ever sought to transfer a superannuation balance from one fund to another would very much empathise with the proposition that, as it presently operates, the superannuation sector is grossly inefficient. That acts to the detriment of members of superannuation funds and all stakeholders, because the costs of the inefficient processing are borne across the sector when it comes to matters such as error, rework, misdirected or lost transactions-all of these things cause cost, inconvenience and inefficiency. Accordingly, the coalition strongly supports as a principle measures to improve the efficiency, transparency competitiveness of the administration of superannuation system. We want to see a superannuation system which is easier to use for employers; which ensures fewer lost accounts; which provides a more timely flow of money to the member accounts of superannuation fund members; and which delivers efficiencies and cost savings to employers, to funds and, ultimately therefore, to members. The scheme of this legislation is to provide for the implementation of data and payment regulations and standards to allow participants in the superannuation system to communicate by using standardised business turns in a consistent and reliable format. The government estimates that the SuperStream measures will save $1 billion a year in processing costs. The Financial Services Council estimates that the reforms are likely to deliver savings of up to $20 billion in aggregate by 2020 based on the current rate of growth of the asset base in the superannuation system. Anybody who has had any experience with large information technology systems and businesses involving the processing of hundreds of millions or even more transactions would know that very small cost savings per transaction can readily add up to a very large amount of money saved in aggregate across the system. I think that is what we can expect this set of changes to achieve if the scheme has the desired effect. Stakeholders in the sector are certainly supportive of the objectives. The Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia commented that it: … considers the SuperStream measures to be the key component of the Government's Stronger Super reforms as they have the greatest potential to improve members' retirement outcomes through the creation of a more efficient superannuation system. and The Financial Services Council in its submission to the committee noted that there has been for a long time agreement in principle across the industry of the desirability of establishing superannuation data standards; however, it has not proven possible, to date, in a cooperative fashion to establish those standards and have all the stakeholders sign up to them. Accordingly, there is broad acceptance of the need for legislative action. That brings me to the second point I want to make which is that, although there is broad acceptance of the need for legislative action, there are eyebrows raised across the superannuation sector as to the surprisingly large amount of money which the Australian Taxation Office has identified it needs to implement these new arrangements. Under this bill a levy is to be imposed on the superannuation sector which amounts to $467 million. That is a very large sum of money by any standard yet at the same time the degree of transparency and justification that has been provided for this very large sum is disappointing. It is a notorious truth that information technology systems development can be an extraordinary black hole. It is very tempting for those involved in the process to inflate their costs and identify a whole range of requirements which add to the total cost of the exercise. It is often difficult for those receiving the bill to assess the validity of the amounts that are claimed but, as a very first step, you need to be provided with details, specifics and justifications for the amount of money proposed to be spent on the new information technology system changes. That is a principle which is true in the private sector and it is equally true in this particular context which is essentially a hybrid of private and public sector activity. It is not surprising that one of the strong themes which emerged from the committee's inquiry into this legislation is that there has been an inadequate level of justification by the Australian Taxation Office and the government for the amount of money stated to be required, which is to be extracted from the industry by means of a levy to fund these changes. That is an observation which has been made by quite a number of stakeholders. Let me quote, for example, the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia: … it remains unclear what the levies will actually pay for … The Explanatory Memorandum only has information on the proposed year by year funding with no further detail on what the money will be actually spent on. Given the substantial amount sought to be recovered ($467 million in total) much greater accountability should be demanded from the Australian Taxation Office. Submitters also made the point that it would be wholly inappropriate for the Australian Taxation Office to obtain benefits funded from this specific levy on the superannuation sector which extended to its broader operations. I note that the concerns which were expressed by a number of industry stakeholders were acknowledged by the committee in its unanimous report and the committee has recommended that the Australian Taxation Office be required to provide a regular, detailed breakdown to the SuperStream Advisory Council of its costs and the expenditure of the additional levies. Finally, I want to note that the compliance burden which will fall upon employers as a result of these changes will be a material one and it is therefore concerning that the legislative scheme adopted here is one which bristles with penalties and strict liability provisions. Employers are required to provide very detailed data associated with superannuation payments and failure to provide that data exposes them to penalties. It is not just superannuation funds which are exposed to penalties under this legislation; it is every employer including, of course, small employers. A number of stakeholders who made submissions to the committee pointed out the nature of the challenge that employers including, in particular, small employers will face in complying with this legislation. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry suggested that the government ought to consider including a 'safe harbour' provision in the legislation to allow employers, who with the best will in the world find themselves unable to strictly comply, protection against being hit with arbitrary penalties. The Financial Services Council submitted that the proposed compliance measures are overly severe. I particularly want to note concerns that the bill is bristling with strict liability provisions. A strict liability provision is one where the mental state of the person who commits an offence is deemed to be irrelevant. Accordingly, even if you set out with the best will in the world and make every reasonable effort to comply but fail to do so, you are exposed to penalties under legislation. The Australian Taxation Office acknowledged that it would have the legal right under this legislation to impose penalties on a small employer such as a butcher with two or three employees. If that butcher were to pay the amount of superannuation contribution required for each employee when it is required to be paid, but failed to include all of the items of included under the standard, then that butcher is open to a criminal prosecution and there is no defence open to him or her. That is the reality of what a strict liability provision means. The committee noted its concerns that the tax office ought to be what you might paraphrase as 'gentle' in the application of these powers. I would argue that trusting the tax office to be gentle is an inherently proposition and this is an area of significant concern. The coalition supports these provisions in principle but we have some implementation concerns as I have outlined.",114
151,Mr NEUMANN,BILLS," I speak in support of the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Stronger Super) Bill 2012 and the Superannuation Supervisory Levy Imposition Amendment Bill 2012. With about three million Australians currently over the age of 65 years, and 8.1 million Australians over the age of 65 years by 2050, reform in superannuation is not an optional extra but a necessity and a must. I think federal Labor government has much to be proud of in its reforms of superannuation. The super system review chaired by Jeremy Cooper recommended many of the reforms that were undertaken here today. Industry submissions to the review estimated that the industry could save up to $1 billion, achievable through the reforms that we are undertaking. Ernst and Young said similar things in its submission. We have confirmed this our commitment in the budget to the SuperStream reforms, which will make a difference, and previous speakers have talked in part about those. This is a package of reforms to make the superannuation scheme more flexible, more effective, more efficient and easier for members, funds and employers across the country. Currently it is pretty difficult to data understand, and a young person who has had three or four different jobs in different locations, vocations or roles might have picked up a bit of superannuation working for one employer after another, sometimes with different funds, and it is easy for their super to be lost. We have an industry worth $1.36 trillion, but according to the Australian Taxation Office we have about $20 billion in lost superannuation. That is money which risky could be used for the retirement of Australians and to put less reliance on the pension system. So it makes sense to reform the system, to make it more effective and efficient, to reduce reliance on old technology like paperwork and to increase reliance on IT and computerisation. The reforms will help members keep track of superannuation. An online portal is crucial in that regard so that people can have a look at superannuation, have a look at their accounts and track them, and employers can do the same. It assists people to consolidate those accounts electronically. I do not always this agree with the member for Bradfield, but anyone who has ever rolled superannuation from one account to another-I have done this personally and I am sure members of this place and other Australians have alsoknows the absolute idiocy of the procedures involved at times. It is extraordinary. I know of a circumstance where one constituent of mine was telling me that he had to arrange for a cheque to be flown to Sydney because they could not change the superannuation from the fund based in Brisbane to the one in Sydney. They had to fly a cheque down to Sydney to deposit it face to face into the fund. This is crazy stuff in the 21st century. We have a lot of low, inactive accounts, many under $1,000, and these will be automatically consolidated into another of the member's account unless they opt out, saving members' fees and making super easier to control, manage and keep track of. There will be a lot of changes in this process, and I notice the SuperStream Advisory Council has been called for with nominations as well on 4 June 2012. This government has a proud record, as Labor governments have, of making reform in this country. I am pleased to be advocating locally for the NDIS to come to my electorate, particularly Ipswich. There are great Labor reforms, like the minimum wage, the age pension, Medicare and superannuation. Lest anyone thinks that these came about because those opposite sat over here in government, they should be prepared to have a look, as did the member for Fraser, at speeches made by those opposite on superannuation. They should note the fact that those opposite opposed our reforms to increase the superannuation guarantee from nine to 12 per cent as part of what we have said on the minerals resource rent tax. If those opposite had been on this side of the House they would have deprived 43,000 people in my electorate of an increase in superannuation from nine to 12 per cent. We have made a lot of changes. Specifically, this legislation amends the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 and the Retirement Savings Account Act 1997. We are talking about a framework introduced to ensure the implementation of superannuation data and payment regulations and standards so that there are no inconsistencies and siloed arrangements between the different funds and so that it is standard across the whole industry. This legislation ensures superannuation transactions can be undertaken by various super funds and entities as well as retirement savings account providers, employers and employees, and will give consistency across the whole sector. The legislation also provides for amendments to the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority Act 1998, ensuring that costs associated with the implementation of the SuperStream measures are included in the determination of a levy, which the member for Bradfield accurately mentioned is paid by the sector to the Commonwealth. The levy itself will be a levy on the industry. It is important that the legislation before the chamber be passed by 1 July this year, giving the industry time to implement the changes and the superannuation supervisory levy to make sure we collect the implementation costs from the SuperStream reforms. The levy will be on the industry in this particular matter, and it is not unusual for that to take place in a sector. As part of our stronger super package we have announced that this is the case. The industry and the stakeholders know it is coming. All the super funds want to make sure that the industry is viable, effective and efficient, and that the government costs associated will be, by virtue of the APRA regulated funds, $467 million from 2012-13 onwards. The minister can make a determination specifying the proportion of the levy money that is to be credited through the APRA special account. These are important reforms. Members will be able to look up what their superannuation is. I know that during the global financial crisis many constituents in my electorate have talked to me about the fact that their superannuation funds have suffered. I know of a number of people who have put off retirement because of their superannuation being much lower than it once was. They are particularly interested now in keeping track of their super if they are in their late 50s or early 60s. Employers will benefit through simplified standard provisions, and funds will benefit by making sure they are able to have greater use of tax file numbers to facilitate matching consolidation funds, because the Australian Taxation Office administers super funds and has that overall responsibility. Superannuation is a particularly important reform for my electorate. The bills here, and the part of the package that we are undertaking, are particularly important. I lobbied hard to make sure that we lifted the superannuation guarantee age limit from 70 to 75. We have done that, meaning another 18,000 Australians aged 75 years and over will get the benefit of superannuation if they continue to work. I talked about that issue just last week at the Ipswich Association of Independent Retirees and superannuants. I received a very favourable response about that because, as many of them said to me briefly, they were undertaking or have undertaken a transition in relation to their work-life situation. The days when people always just decided to retire and go from work to retirement are over. Often people transition all the way through. Making sure that they can pick up superannuation in those latter years is an important reform. That is something that came up recently in relation to superannuation reform for my electorate. I know how important it is. When I talked to those people about the need for young people in our community to get more superannuation, lifting the guarantee from nine to 12 per cent, they supported it, experienced that in their personal lives. Many of them told me that at times they wished that they had been able to get superannuation much earlier in their working lives, but it took a federal Labor government-the Hawke and Keating government-to actually bring in this great reform. The second bill that is associated with this legislation is the Superannuation Supervisory Levy Imposition Amendment Bill 2012. That will make some amendments providing that the Treasurer of the Commonwealth government has the capacity to make a subsequent determination for any financial year of the restricted and unrestricted levy percentages and the superannuation entity levy base. It gives the Treasurer the capacity and flexibility to make those determinations when he or she is required to do so. These reforms are important reforms. They should be seen as part of a package that we have undertaken, lifting the superannuation guarantee from nine to 12 per cent, making sure that older Australians can still get the superannuation guarantee no matter what age they are, making sure that there are extra superannuation contributions for the 3.6 million Australians who are earning up to $37,000 a year, which includes a lot of part-time workers, cleaners and shop assistants in my electorate. That will benefit about 23,600 electors in my electorate of Blair in South-East Queensland. It will make sure that people can get access and see their superannuation accounts, whether those accounts are active or inactive. It will make sure that we have a simple MySuper product available and it will ensure that there is greater effectiveness and efficiency in the whole sector. These reforms are major reforms in the sector, long overdue to reduce red tape, long overdue to make sure that the sector works having efficiently and effectively for those Australians in the future-not just the three million Australians currently 65 years of age and over, but the 8.1 million Australians who will be around in 2050 when many of us may not be around. Future Australians will benefit from these reforms. When people look back in the future at what this government achieved, I think they will look at superannuation and see it is an area where we made major changes in the Labor tradition of progressive reform to assist working men and women to have dignity and financial security in their retirement. I commend the legislation to the House.",117
152,Ms ONEILL,BILLS," I rise to support the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Stronger Super) Bill 2012 and the Superannuation Supervisory Levy Imposition Bill 2012. It is with some considerable pride that I stand to make this speech because the bills continue the great Labor tradition of making sure that superannuation is well managed. We were the ones who put superannuation in place and we are the ones who are continuing to make sure that Australians who are going through the process of superannuation, those who are managing it and ordinary Australians who are standing just to receive the benefits from it are going to get the very best that this system can offer. I note the comments from the member for Fraser about the significance superannuation in the history of our financial literacy in this country and how critical it is that Labor got that going and that we are continuing to attend to it. I also note some of the great comments from my colleague, the member for Blair, about some of the practical inefficiencies that are currently a part of the superannuation structures. These were noted in particular in the Cooper review. The real reason for this legislative program that is before the House today is that the current problems superannuation are that it is obviously too complex, it is unnecessarily expensive and it is very slow. The member for Bradfield made a very sound point in articulating a comparison with mobile telephones and the changes that have happened there in terms of people being able to transport their telephone numbers. We have come to take it for granted that we can all be advantaged by the options that modern technology provides. In terms of the superannuation structures, we have a system that is very clunky, where we have 33 million accounts around the country with only about 11 million workers. There is unnecessary duplication, and some of the points made by my colleagues here this afternoon might explain why people have three accounts and just let them do their own thing rather than go through the processes, that are currently so difficult, to compile those into one. We know that the legislation that is before the House today will really make superannuation easier, for the funds to administer, for the members and for employers, and we know that there are collecting significant gains-savings of up to $1 billion-that will be achieved through the implementation of these SuperStream reforms. Obviously the industry has been key in the conversation on the way we have planned for this to be implemented, and I am of very pleased to say that, in our recent hearing, the Financial Services Council was very clear in welcoming this piece of legislation. They let us know that over the past decade the industry has actually endeavoured to agree on a set of data standards for managing these transactions between entities, but they articulated that they lack the capacity to compel external stakeholders, and sometimes even their own stakeholders, to comply with industry developed standards. They welcomed this with legislation because these compulsory standards help standardise the process for employers and funds in dealing with one another. That can only be a good thing for Australians, who sometimes leave their superannuation on a 'set and forget' strategy. That view, of how important this legislative change is for superannuation and ordinary Australians, was echoed by Mr Murray from Treasury and Mr Olesen from the Australian Taxation Office, who actually articulated exactly the same sort of storythat, for many, many years and for various reasons, the industry had been unable to come to an agreement, and that this failure to agree has led to a number of different processes being established between the funds, which led to a lot of deadweight costs in the industry. Obviously, we need to make sure that we respond to that reality and improve the situation. I noticed that Mr Fletcher made some comments acknowledging that this is a unanimous report but raising some questions, as the member for Bradfield, about the Australian Taxation Office. I think it is very important that we actually get on the record that there has been a significant number of reviews and reforms to superannuation over the years. If we go back to the period of 2006-07, under a different government with a different leadership, we will see that there was an amount of $445 million-which was revised upwards to $525 million over five years-for a plan to simplify and streamline superannuation at that time. It is all well good for members of the opposition to raise questions about why the ATO have come up with these numbers, but the reality is: there are comparative figures that indicate that is a reasonable claim and, further, it is very important that there is consultation, with the industry sector and also the people who are going to be part of the supervisory panel, to ensure that these things are considered and to make sure that we get good value from the dollars as this money is being implemented to bring about change. Indeed, to make sure that there is fair and open scrutiny, we have made a recommendation that the ATO be required to provide a regular, detailed breakdown of its costs and expenditure on the additional levies to the SuperStream Advisory Council, based on reporting guidelines developed in consultation between the council and the ATO. So I suppose it is like any major project that any person might commence on: you always hope that it might cost less than the numbers indicate. But, in the end, to make change and to undertake reform does cost money, and we do have a very high level of acceptance and, indeed, encouragement from the sector to move to make these changes, to make it so much easier for people who are employers-small, medium and large-to comply. I want to also put this on the record in response to some of the comments made by the member for Bradfield as to concerns about strict liability regarding the ATO. We had evidence from the Australian Taxation Office on the day to indicate that, while there are strict liability provisions, this is supported by those in the industry, who understand that they need these tools to ensure compliance. But the ATO made a very clear point: they have the capacity, the administrative flexibility, to waive or limit and penalties where employers are attempting to comply with data standards but perhaps commit inadvertent technical breaches. Of course we were very pleased to hear that, and this we wanted to make sure that the ATO were encouraged to do so. So we have done that in our report, urging the ATO to use its discretion to waive or limit penalties in appropriate circumstances. But, lest the fear campaign-even with regard to this-get some legs, I want to put on record that it will not be until 2015 that small employers will be required to actually comply with this piece of legislation in total, and that, during that period of time, there will be significant consultation with the providers of software such as MYOB or QuickBooks, which are used by many small businesses, to help the small businesses do all of their transactions regarding superannuation at the same time as they are lining up to make payments to their employees. We have many employers who might be running a small hairdressing salon or a boutique in a local strip mall, who have a number of employees. Currently they have to fill in different forms for different employees and send any number of cheques off to different agencies-it is inefficient and it is quite a paperchase to try and keep track of that. Large companies that use payroll providers will obviously be working very carefully with them to make sure that that is implemented, and it will be in the first period of time that that will occur. But, by the time this comes down to the local businesses-such as Snips Hairdressers at Copacabana or any of the other great local businesses in my seat of Robertson-the providers of the software will be well and truly across this material and be able to provide employers right across Australia, no matter how small the number of employees they might have, with adequate software to enable them to bring these provisions into their workplace and comply with the requirements of the Australian Taxation Office. We are committed as a government not only to ensuring the superannuation system is reformed but to making sure that it boosts Australians' retirement savings. We are progressively increasing the super guarantee from nine per cent to 12 per cent, starting from 1 July next year, and we know that that stands to benefit 8.4 million workers. If you are a 30-year-old on earning an average full time wage right now, the changes that we as a Labor government are proposing will bring an extra $118,000 to you at retirement. We are also introducing from 1 July a muchneeded superannuation contribution for 3.6 million Australians who are on very low incomes. This is effectively going to refund $500 of contributions tax into the super accounts of people with incomes of up to $37,000. As part of a range of responses to the reallife superannuation issues of Australians, we have abolished the maximum age limit on superannuation reforms of the super guarantee from 1 July next year, so that 51,000 hard-working Australians who want extremely to keep working past the age of 70 will now be entitled to what we consider should always be their due-that is, superannuation contributions. These two bills that are before the House today are, in fact, a natural extension of Labor's concern for doing the best we can for ordinary Australians. We are working with business and with peak bodies to make sure that we provide a degree of reform that is very enabling, that will increase productivity, that will reduce costs and that will improve outcomes for ordinary Australians. I commend the bills to the House and urge their prompt passage.",120
153,Mr SHORTEN,BILLS,"Maribyrnong-Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations) (17:16): I would like to thank the member for Robertson for her contribution, and to thank all those who have spoken on this legislation. I rise to sum up this cognate debate on the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Stronger Super) Bill 2012 and the Superannuation Supervisory Levy Imposition Amendment Bill 2012. Our superannuation industry is one to be proud of, a distinct national advantage and one that is forecast to grow very significantly over the next 20 years. Our superannuation system currently manages $1.4 trillion for Australians. This amount will reach $6 trillion by 2030. Despite this, there are many inefficiencies still to be fixed in our system. There are currently approximately 12 million members with superannuation, yet there are over 31 million accounts, and there are over five million lost member accounts with a total value of over $20 billion-that is, an average of one lost superannuation account for every two working Australians. The superannuation industry can do better in processing transactions, and there are too many paper based systems. These inefficiencies lead to higher administration costs. Currently, different superannuation funds require different information from employers. This unnecessarily increases the compliance burden on Australia's employers. Ultimately, these inefficiencies lead to higher administration costs consequently reduce the retirement incomes of all working Australians. The industry has attempted to develop its own voluntary standards over many years but has been unable, thus far, to achieve consensus. This is why the government has decided to take a leadership role by introducing this legislation, which will improve the efficiency of the superannuation industry under the SuperStream reforms. These reforms flow from the recommendations of the Cooper review inquiry into the superannuation industry. Schedule 1 of the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Stronger Super) Bill 2012 introduces the framework for the development of common standards and processes for superannuation transactions. Supporting regulations and legislative instruments will prescribe the detailed requirements underlying this framework. By setting down standardised rules for how funds transact with each other, and by setting standardised requirements for the information that funds can request from employers, significant efficiencies will result, ultimately lowering administration costs, simplifying processes for employers and for funds, and resulting in a more timely allocation of contributions to member accounts. The government has adopted a staged approach to implementation to minimise the impact on the superannuation industry and on employers. Rollovers between superannuation funds will be required to still comply with the new standards from 1 July 2013. New standards dealing with contributions from employers with more than 20 employees will apply from 1 July 2014. These standards will then apply to smaller employers from 1 July 2015, subject to further consultation on their impact. Schedule 2 of the Superannuation which Legislation Amendment (Stronger Super) Bill 2012, together with the Superannuation Supervisory Levy Imposition Amendment Bill 2012, enables costs to government associated with the implementation of the SuperStream measures to be recovered by a levy on APRA regulated funds. The superannuation industry's own estimates show that the SuperStream reforms of this government will deliver savings of up to $1 billion per annum. The benefit of these savings will flow through to members in the form of lower fees and charges. When averaged out across the number of accounts in the superannuation industry, the savings are in the order of $30 per account each and every year which significantly exceeds the transition costs involved in implementing these reforms. The government will be bringing forward further legislation to complete the package of SuperStream reforms. This will include announced reforms to further benefit members, such as a new facility to enable members to easily look up and keep track of their superannuation. Fund members will also benefit from having low, inactive accounts consolidated automatically. There are costs associated with implementing all these reforms. The most efficient way to meet these costs is by collecting them directly from the superannuation industry. The levy is a temporary one. It will only collect the costs that the government incurs in supporting the implementation of all these reforms. The costs will be recouped over six years, but must be considered in the context of the annual long-term savings of $1 billion estimated by industry. These are real, important, significant and wide-ranging reforms. They will be implemented in a staged approach across a number of years. For these reasons, the government is establishing a SuperStream Advisory Council which will have the role of providing advice to government on issues relevant to the successful implementation and maintenance of the reforms. I must acknowledge that the coalition has also acknowledged that the SuperStream measures have the potential to deliver real savings that will benefit superannuants, and that it supports changes that make the superannuation system more efficient, transparent and competitive. Valid feedback has been raised in relation to the provision of additional ongoing information in relation to SuperStream. While the government has already released some of the information on the breakdown of costs, further information will be released shortly. The government also acknowledges the contribution of the Parliamentary Joint Committee Corporations and Financial Services, and will consider how best to implement its recommendations about enhanced reporting by the ATO. Finally, in relation to the matter raised by the member for Bradfield with respect to the strict liability provisions, I can advise the legislation provides a flexible compliance framework so that compliance action can be taken where necessary. However, the Australian Tax Office will take an educative approach in the first instance, as advised at the committee hearings. Secondly, I note numerous strict liability provisions that already exist in superannuation legislation were introduced by the Howard government in 2000. I commend the legislation to the House.

156,Mr ROBERT,BILLS," I rise to lend the coalition's full support for the bill and to let the government know that we will be voting for the bill, as we always vote for good policy. In this case, good policy did not start with the government. The coalition strongly believes in supporting our ADF personnel and their families. Having been a serving member and having served overseas, and my wife having served at home, I understand full well the weight that sits on the shoulders of families-the wives and husbands, children, parents grandparents, aunties and uncles, cousins, brothers and sisters. These are the enablers of our ADF personnel. They are the ones who in many ways have the biggest influence on our people remaining in the ADF. They are the ones who offer the greatest support to their serving family members. They experience the greatest 2012 hardships and endure sacrifices we will never know. This bill seeks to look at the ADF lateral transfer members, those members who are transferring from other nations' militaries to move to Australia to join our military. They come from a variety of countries including New Zealand, South Africa, the US and are predominantly from the UK. Many lateral transfer members are from the UK Royal Navy, Marines, Army or Air Force. We have a long and proud history of recruiting members from the armed forces of other countries. We do so in order to fill gaps in our armed forces and in ways that suit the parent countries. For example, the Royal Australian Navy right now is taking advantage of the UK's Strategic Defence and Security Review which, amongst other things, is reducing the number of personnel across the UK's four services, a reduction which, may I say, is unfortunate. However, what is unfortunate for Britain is fortunate for Australia, for in this context the Royal Australian Navy is looking to increase its recruitment of Royal Navy personnel in order to fill capability gaps within critical skills areas. ADF lateral recruits also bring a range of skills and experiences not only in foreign militaries but also in working with our allies and partners. They save the ADF an enormous amount of money and, more importantly, an enormous amount of time in training our own personnel. For example, if you consider the Royal Australian Air Force and taking a Typhoon pilot who has been flying for upwards of 10 years and has absorbed millions and millions of pounds in flight training costs, the advantage to Australia from such an experienced pilot joining our Air Force is immeasurable. It should be noted that the commensurate benefits that Australia gains from recruiting lateral recruits far exceeds, by an inordinate magnitude, any potential costs associated with bringing forward the citizenship status of the spouse or dependants. The ADF is looking to recruit 300 or more lateral transfer personnel each year in the coming years. It should be noted that about 90 per cent of lateral transfer members have families that they may wish to bring with them to Australia. I suggest most will. Noting the current recruitment environment in Australia and in places like the UK, it is timely to ensure those family members of lateral transfer members who are willing to serve in Australia and the ADF are afforded the same citizenship status as serving members. All lateral transfer members are required by law to qualify for permanent residency visas before the member can take up a position within the Australian Defence Force and subsequently move to Australia. This is necessary as all ADF members are required to be Australian citizens, and permanent residency is a prerequisite to citizenship. It also important to note that spouses, partners and dependants of ADF lateral transfer members at the time of moving to Australia are afforded permanent residency but not citizenship. Under the current Australian Citizenship Act 2007 that this bill seeks to amend, a permanent resident may be granted citizenship after completing 90 days permanent service in the ADF or 180 days in the Reserves. These sections are regularly used in support of lateral transfer members into the ADF. But this provision of early citizenship does not include the spouse or partner of the ADF member, hence this bill making changes. This can and does lead to a range of discords within families of ADF lateral transferees. For example, Australia currently has ADF lateral transfer members deployed on operations. In MTF 3 in Afghanistan there were at least seven lateral transfereescitizens of Australia, wearing the Australian flag on their shoulders in combat operations-whose spouses or partners and children, at home, were not afforded the same citizenship as their husbands, in this case, who were fighting for Australia overseas. It is timely that such a situation be amended and the spouses or partners and dependants, of ADF lateral transferees who become citizens 90 days after joining the ADF, are afforded the same right. In this case, the government enjoys the full support of the opposition. However, what the government is doing is particularly vexing and demeans it. The coalition put in a private member's bill on 21 May 2012 after extensive consultation with the sector-that is, with defence personnel, defence families and defence community organisations-to amend what it saw as an inadequacy in the act. The government at the time saw fit to is oppose the private member's bill and the next day, on 22 May, introduced its own bill into the parliament. The Hon. Chris Bowen, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, wrote to Minister Snowdon, the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, on 4 February 2011-15 months ago-to say to the minister, who was querying the capacity to make these legislative changes, that he would not do it. I will read two pages of the letter. He went through a whole range of reasons for it not being important or appropriate for the government to do it. He said: Taking all these factors into account, I do not consider it necessary to amend the citizenship legislation. I would, however, encourage our two departments to continue to liaise with one another on this issue. So for 15 months it has not been necessary for the government to move on what are reasonably critical amendments, hence the coalition moved a private member's bill in this place. For 15 months it has not been necessary-the minister's own words were, 'I do not consider it necessary'. But the coalition put up a private member's bill to enact sensible legislation and suddenly, the next day, the government considered it necessary to put up almost a carbon copy of the coalition's private member's bill and widened it in some areas to look the same. Forgive me for being deeply cynical about the motives of this government. If the motives were to repair, fix, close and address inadequacy, surely the government could have agreed with the coalition's private member's motion. If the government honestly thought there were areas that needed to be widened, I told them we would accept any of their amendments in good faith because we believe this is good policy. But no, the government spoke against and indicated they would vote against the private member's motion and then ensured that they put their bill rapidly up the list of the bills be debated so that it would be debated and voted on prior to the opposition's private member's motion that would be voted on, possibly, this Thursday. To say that this is disingenuous, to say that this is Labor spin at its most heinous and most base level, is to say the truth on this matter. It is good policy, do not get me wrong. The coalition will vote for it. But the idea that the government could not possibly support a coalition private member's bill and have to rush their own in the next day, with a widening of areas so it looks demonstrably different, is disappointing. It says something to those lateral transfer members currently serving and to their families. I know the minister wrote 15 months ago and said, 'I do not consider it necessary to amend the legislation,' but, goodness, the coalition is now putting a private member's bill because of rank political purpose and opportunism and saying, 'We now consider it necessary.' Let me say to the government, that is disingenuous. It is disrespectful to those who wear our uniform. I note that Labor extends the provisions in its bill beyond spouses and dependent children to any dependant-for example, elderly parents or disabled dependants not considered children. The coalition accepts that. It reduces the relevant defence service criteria for reserve service from 180 days to 90 days. We accept that. We do not know how many times that may be used but we accept it. And in the event the member dies before attaining citizenship, their spouse and dependants remain eligible for fast-track citizenship and we accept that as well. We support the changes above. We would have wished that the government had simply amended the opposition's private member's bill. Either way, good policy is good policy and it should stand on its own two feet. Right now, there are ADF lateral members who are to citizens in combat operations in Afghanistan. If there are seven in MTF 3 I gather there are some there now whose spouses and children at home are not enjoying the fruits of citizenship. It is important that they are recognised and receive the assistance that changes in this bill will provide. It is clear that the rushed introduction of this bill is in response to the coalition introducing its bill. However, the peace of mind of families of those currently serving and looking to serve in the ADF is more important than base political argument. It is more important than spill and it is more important than Labor's disingenuous attempt here to be seen as the one doing the legislative changes. Importantly, the policy wholly welcomed and supported by Defence Families of Australia. Defence Families of Australia have been a wonderful advocate for defence families and across a wide range of issues, from defence housing and spousal support to the need to fix inequities in the families of ADF lateral transfer members. I thank Defence Families of Australia for their ongoing advocacy on behalf of ADF personnel right around the country. I am pleased that today and tonight we will debate and vote on the bill, and I am pleased that it will go to the Senate, where it can be assured a speedy vote from the coalition. I am pleased with the outcome. I am appalled at Labor's process.",125
157,Ms BRODTMANN,BILLS," It is always a pleasure to speak on important bills that seek to improve the lives of our Australian Defence Force members. I say this particularly as the member for Canberra. The Australian Citizenship Amendment (Defence Families) Bill 2012 is important because, when it comes to recruitment from overseas, the ADF gets recruits that are technical specialists and have, as the member for Fadden has pointed out, previous experience in other defence forces, so their presence in our Defence Force greatly assists Australia to maintain its operational status and to train other ADF personnel. This bill may only impact on a small number of ADF members, but it is nonetheless an important amendment that will make life here in Australia much easier for current and future overseas lateral recruits. When I think about the importance of this bill, I think about the time. I spent in Afghanistan early last year with the member for Fadden. I have mentioned this story before when speaking on this issue. When we were flying between Kabul and Tarin Kowt, I met someone who had been with the German defence force and had since joined is the ADF. We had a really long chat, and he said to me that in Germany, unfortunately, the defence forces were not well respected. He was a very proud member of the defence force and a very proud soldier, and the disrespect that he experienced in Germany put him off his countrymen and his country. So he is now a proud member of the ADF. He said that he had experienced quite significant discrimination in Germany as a result of his membership of the defence force there. It was really interesting to hear about his experiences in Germany and the fact that he had joined the Australian Defence Force. He is a great asset. In speaking on this bill, I think about what it will mean to him, to his family and to other ADF families. I came to Canberra at the tender age of 18 to study at the ANU. I lived at Burgmann College, where a lot of ADF cadets who were studying at ADFA also stayed. We used to call them 'cordies' for some reason. I have no idea where that term originated, but I understand it was because they used to wear corduroy pants. Many of my girlfriends in their early 20s fell in love with cordies, married at that young age and headed off on grand adventures throughout Australia and the world supporting their husbands. I know the trials and tribulations that my girlfriends and their friends have been through, particularly when their husbands have been deployed on operations overseas. One girlfriend, whose husband did quite a bit of work with the MFO, was based in Damascus. These are dangerous missions, during which these women are at home on their own for between three and six months, depending on the service that their husband is in. During this time they manage their dayto-day lives, look after the kids-quite often, at the moment particularly among my girlfriends, adolescent kids-and meet the challenges that that entails. These are extraordinary women. I take my hat off to the Navy, Army and Air Force wives, as I call them, who do extraordinary work in keeping their households together, supporting their children and, through that, supporting their husbands in their lives and career decisions. I take my hat off to ADF families and think that any support that we can provide to make their lives as easy as possible and to bring them together as much as possible is to be commended. This bill seeks to enable the family members of current and future overseas lateral recruits to satisfy the residence requirements of Australian citizenship at the same time as their ADF enlisted family member. It is basically about ensuring all family members are treated equally. Currently the legislation states that an ADF member and any of their children who are under 16 are able to apply for Australian citizenship after they have completed 90 days of service in the permanent services or six months of service in the reserves. Meanwhile, spouses and other family members, such as children over 16 and elderly parents, do not receive the same concession. They must wait for at least four years to be eligible for citizenship. This means that, currently, members of the same family are treated differently from each other. For example, a serviceman father and his 14-year-old child could become citizens while the mother and their 17-year-old child had to wait up to four years. It is only fair that the government extends the same residence requirements to the spouses and family members of ADF personnel. It is fair and it is the right thing to do, because, when a family group migrate to Australia, they are all making a continuing commitment and contribution to Australia and they are all facing similar settlement challenges. This bill will fast-track Australian citizenship for the family members of ADF personnel. As I have said before, it will allow all family members of current and future overseas lateral recruits to the ADF to satisfy the residence requirements for Australian citizenship at the same time-and this is really important-as the enlisted ADF member. Not only will this acknowledge the commitment they are making by migrating to Australia together as a group; it will also assist the families of recruits in accessing employment opportunities and education assistance to help them build a closer, continuing relationship with Australia. It will help them establish closer ties with their local community and make them feel as if Australia is their home. As the member for Canberra, as I have mentioned before, I have many Defence Force families living in my electorate. These families face unique challenges, particularly when their husband or partner is deployed. It is important that we provide them with as much support and stability as possible so that they can get some sort of continuity and calm in what can be a very disrupted life. It is really important that we try and make that a little bit easier. Issues for Defence Force families stretch from a lack of local services to mental health issues and from education to housing. We as a government should commit ourselves to do whatever we can to improve the health and well-being of our Defence Force members and their families. That is why I am so proud to support this bill tonight. The member for Fadden obviously believes in the policy; it is the process he has got concerns with. He talked about the private member's bill that he introduced in May. Our bill will go even further than that and make more substantial amendments to the legislation. The member for Fadden's bill had some faults in some areas. It only sought to cover children between the age of 18 and 25 if they were students, which did not take into account the fact that there may be disabled children in the family. It did not cover a dependent parent, even though the parent may have migrated with the family. It did not clarify whether the family members needed to permanently migrate with the ADF member and did not allow for the family members to remain eligible for citizenship in the event that the ADF member dies before they become eligible for that citizenship. Our amendments will provide more equitable treatment and greater certainty for ADF lateral recruits and their families. Of course, the concessional residence requirements we are debating do not preclude those people from meeting the other requirements for Australian citizenship, which relate to identity and character; an understanding of the nature of their application and the responsibilities and privileges associated with citizenship; sitting and passing the test; and, finally, making the very important pledge of commitment. The bill includes two previously proposed technical amendments to more clearly specify the periods of relevant defence service and the ADF members who are eligible to apply for this residence requirement. It is proposed to amend the act to specify that relevant defence service includes required attendance of at least 90 paid service days in the Navy, Army or Air Force reserves instead of the current sixmonth service requirement. The proposed amendment will also clarify that defence service refers only to appointed and enlisted personnel in the ADF. This bill is important because it will provide more equitable treatment and greater certainty to ADF overseas lateral recruits and their families, such as that German soldier I mentioned earlier. Our amendments will also assist Australia to attract personnel to highly specialised roles within the ADF. We need to think about how best to attract specialist defence personnel to our forces. I know that there are many, many wonderfully specialised experts in the ADF but, as with everything, there are skills shortages and skills gaps. I believe this bill will help to fill some of those gaps and keep families together. Family is incredibly important. I have been to Afghanistan and I have many girlfriends whose husbands are in the ADF, so I know it is very important that we provide them with as much help as possible, particularly when their partners are posted overseas. Knowing that their loved ones are part of a community that cares and supports them would be of great comfort to our recruits.",128
158,Mr MORRISON,BILLS," I rise to speak on the Australian Citizenship Amendment (Defence Families) Bill 2012. This is a worthy bill that deserves support. It is a shame, however, how this bill came to be before the House this evening. In his inaugural address the great President Ronald Reagan said, 'There is no limit to what a man can do or where he can go if he does not mind who gets the credit'. The government's introduction of this bill fails this test. Bipartisanship should never come at the price of bad policy. But where there is good policy on the table, brought with decent and honourable intentions, as was the case with my friend and colleague the member for Fadden's Australian Citizenship Amendment (Defence Service Requirement) Bill 2012 I think the Australian people have a right to expect that their representatives would work together in good faith on these matters. Instead this government opposed the bill brought forward by the member for Fadden and lodged a carbon copy bill of its own which we are looking at in this place this evening. Frankly, I think they refused to support the original out of spite-and then they tried to claim credit for a policy they had refused to embrace only last year. We will not be so small as to oppose this bill-as the government did with ours-as it is good policy. We will take President Reagan's advice and support this bill. While it is true that imitation is often highest form of flattery it is a shame that, this instance, the government have allowed petty politics to be more important than supporting defence families. In recent weeks Labor have illustrated they are not walking the walk when it comes to understanding the simple needs of our service personnel and the pressures they and their families face. Recently Labor ended recreational leave for single members over 21, affecting 22,000 service men and women. Previously, Navy personnel could take two flights home a year if they were posted to another state, and Army and RAAF troops could take one flight per year to see their families. But now the government have gone back on their word and pulled service conditions that were promised at enlistment. Our troops and families deserve better. My friend and colleague the member for Fadden put forward his bill to address an inequality, a discrepancy, that existed between the treatment of lateral transfer recruits and their families when it came to citizenship. The chief government whip noted last sitting week that the government's main reason for opposing the member for Fadden's bill is that its definition of unit' is much more narrow in scope than the definition in the government's bill. If the government wished to improve the member for Fadden's legislation, they should have had the decency to come to the member for Fadden with suggested amendments in the spirit of goodwill. The bill does extend the provisions of the coalition's bill beyond spouses and dependent children to any dependant-for example, elderly dependent parents. It also drops the fast-track citizenship criterion of relevant defence experience for reserve service from six months to 90 days. The coalition will not stand in the way of the the government's bill because we have the best in interests of service men and women at heart. We support good policy even if it is the result of a petty act of a reactionary government motivated by political self interest. Last year when this issue was broached by the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel the Minister for Immigration flatly ruled it out. He said he did not consider it necessary to amend the citizenship legislation. The only thing that has changed between then and now is that the member for Fadden brought in a bill to achieve the purposes that are by and large set out in this bill. This is another example of flip-flop policy from a government at war with itself. Whatever deceitful games it may seek to play, it cannot distract from the fact that this is a worthy initiative. Australia is an immigrant nation and migrants have made an important contribution to our defence forces. Historian Charles Bean said: ANZAC stood, and still stands, for reckless valour in a good cause, for enterprise, resourcefulness, fidelity, comradeship, and endurance that will never own defeat. 'family That spirit and those values are not determined by one's birthplace; they are values that bind us together as Australians; they are values that we share and have sought to entrench and uphold in our society. Migrants have stood with us, shoulder to shoulder, under our flag, as Australians and fought for our nation and its values in theatres across the world. They have given their lives in battle and purchased our freedom. The first Australian soldier to receive the Victoria Cross was a doctor, Captain Neville Reginald Howse, who hailed originally from England. He is still the only member of the Australian forces medical corps to have been awarded that honour. In 1900, during the Boer War, he galloped out under heavy fire to rescue a wounded trumpeter on the front line. His horse was shot dead, but Captain Howse risked his own life and carried on by foot to rescue his mate. Sergeant Samuel George Pearse was born in Wales and came to Victoria as a child. He won his VC in Russia in 1919 for his bravery, where he cleared a path for his troops through barbed wire under heavy fire and charged single-handedly at the nest of enemy gunmen, taking out the post with bombs. He was killed just minutes later. Of the 64 Victoria Cross medals awarded in World War I, at least 13 recipients were born overseas. They came as migrants to the Lucky Country from England, Ireland, Wales, Denmark and New Zealand to seek a better life and were prepared to stake their lives for their new nation. There were men like Private Robert Matthew Beatham, who left England bound for Australia as a teenager. He was awarded the VC posthumously for most conspicuous bravery and self-sacrifice at Rosieres, France in 1918. He disabled four machine-gun crews, killed 10 enemy soldiers and captured 10 others, saving the lives of countless Australian troops. He died two days later as he rushed another machine gun and was wounded. Welsh born Second Lieutenant Frederick Birks was awarded the VC posthumously for his gallant actions in Belgium in 1917. As a stretcher bearer, he had borne wounded men from the ragged cliffs at Gallipoli, and at the First Battle the Somme he was killed by a shell while defending his men. There are similar stories of courage and sacrifice from World War II, including the tale of Richard Kelliher, who was born in Ballybeggan, County Kerry, Ireland and emigrated to Brisbane in 1929 with his sister. When war came, Richard enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force in 1941. He was assigned to the 2nd/25th Battalion and served in the Middle East before he was redeployed to Papua in 1942. He fought at Buna-Gona in New Guinea and in 1943, as the Allies pushed back along Black Cat Trail, Richard was with the 2nd/25th as they advanced towards Lae. In the Markham Valley, in the midst of dense jungle, Richard's platoon was halted by heavy fire from a concealed Japanese machine-gun post. Five of his colleagues were killed and three were wounded, including the section leader, Corporal Billy Richards. It soon became apparent that they could not advance without further losses. On his own initiative, Richard seized two grenades and a Bren gun, dashed out to within 30 metres of the post and took out the position, before then crawling under a hail of bullets to rescue his commanding officer. For his heroism, Richard was awarded the Victoria Cross and was presented the medal by King George VI himself. They are but a small handful of examples that demonstrate the stellar service and sacrifice borne by Australians who have come to our shores and honoured us through their contribution to our defence forces. We are pleased to support this tradition as it continues today. Each year, hundreds of people choose to migrate to Australia and take up positions in our defence forces. The bill before the House relates specifically to lateral transfer recruits. of Where gaps open up within our own ranks, the Australian Defence Force often looks to fill the positions as quickly as possible with personnel recruited from overseas militaries. These positions often need to be filled swiftly. Having the ability to parachute in personnel who already have the necessary skills and knowledge saves Commonwealth time and money. Lateral transfers are highly qualified and bring with them a level of skill that would take up to a decade for the ADF to match by recruiting, training or upskilling personnel. These recruits are typically from the United Kingdom but also come from South Africa, New Zealand and, more recently, the United States. Research by Defence Families of Australia suggests that overwhelmingly-in 90 per cent of cases-lateral transfers choose to resettle their families and dependants out here with them. The ADF is seeking to bring 300 lateral transfer members to Australia per year. While the Australian Citizenship Act contains some provision to accelerate citizenship for those transferees, parallel arrangements currently do not exist for their spouses or dependants. Following widespread consultation in an effort to rectify this inequality, the coalition introduced the Australian Citizenship Amendment (Defence Service Requirement) Bill to create consistency. Under this bill, spouses and dependants of lateral transfer members will become eligible for citizenship at the same time as the ADF member-as proposed by the member for Fadden's bill and opposed by the government. This legislation provides a safety net by ensuring that the families and children of these troops will not suffer unduly in the terrible event that a transferee is killed, whether in combat, in training or leave, or a family breaks down through divorce. It is a consolation, but we should do all we can to ensure that these moments of tragedy are not compounded by added and unnecessary angst such as financial worry or the fear of having to pack up and leave the family's new home in Australia. Transfer members are willing to give up their lives in service to this nation and their families are willing to honour and support the their loved one in that extraordinary commitment. The coalition believes it is only right that those families be afforded the same citizenship status as their serving member. These families make an important and selfless contribution in their own way. Their unique sacrifice should never be undervalued. Under the Australian Citizenship Act 2007, a permanent resident may be granted citizenship after completing 90 days permanent service in the ADF or six months service in the reserves. These accelerated provisions do not apply to a person's spouse or dependant under 18, who currently must meet the residency requirement on their own to become eligible. This should not be the case. This legislative inconsistency is problematic. On a day-today basis it can restrict a spouse's ability to access welfare industry support. As a permanent residents, a member's spouse and dependants under 18 are required to reside in Australia for two years before they are entitled to the majority of social security payments. This includes things like unemployment assistance, sickness allowance, student assistance through Austudy or youth allowance as well as other benefits like a healthcare card. In the bigger picture, it also adds another level of uncertainty. Lateral transfer members are deployed serving in theatres and operations around the world, and, if the unthinkable happens and a member dies, on under current law there is no guarantee that their spouse and children are able to stay in Australia or to access the support that would normally be extended to the family of ADF personnel. There has been unanimous support from stakeholders with whom the coalition spoke for the bill that we presented in this House through the member for Fadden, and I assume that this support extends equally to the bill we have before us tonight. Within my own electorate, the concerns of constituents have been communicated to me directly. One of my constituents is a lateral transfer member who came from the UK and settled with his family in the shire. I met with his wife recently, and she told me that she will not qualify for citizenship until January next year even though her husband and four children have already been granted citizenship under the accelerated provisions. This bill would make a significant difference to families such as hers, which make tremendous sacrifices and bear an enormous burden in enduring great separation. But they do this willingly to support their loved ones in their important work which they believe in, whether it be in our army, in our navy or in our air force. A famous and incredibly moving letter was written in the throes of the American Civil War by a soldier named Sullivan Ballou to his wife Sarah. In it he acknowledges the difficulties his family endure in his absence and the sacrifices they make to enable him to fight for what he believes in. Sullivan writes to Sarah: If it is necessary that I should fall on the battlefield for my country, I am ready. I am … perfectly willing … to lay down all my joys in this life … But, my dear wife … I know that my … joys I lay down nearly all of yours, and replace them … with cares and sorrows … The driving purpose behind the member for Fadden's bill was to better support, through citizenship measures, the families of lateral transfer recruits who serve in our defence force. The same purpose is served by this bill. It is fitting that we recognise in this place the contribution of these people and allow Australia to embrace the families of those who have demonstrated their love for their adopted country so dearly.",130
159,Ms OWENS,BILLS," I am very pleased to rise to speak on the Australian Citizenship Amendment (Defence Families) Bill 2012. It deals with a particular group in the Australian military who are known as lateral recruits. They are people who invariably have incredibly high skills in an area of the military where we are short and where training, because of the length of time it takes, cannot be undertaken to fill a vacancy. They are incredibly valuable members of our military. We recruit them from overseas, and they become very much a part of our military. We have recognised, since we first started recruiting into the military people who we used to call 'aliens' back in 1952, that we should make extraordinary and specific arrangements to acknowledge the service of these people in our military by making specific arrangements for Australian citizenship. Whereas ordinary citizens, people who come to Australia under skilled migration, family reunion or the many other form of immigration and who wish to apply for Australian citizenship must satisfy a requirement of four years lawful stay, with the last 12 months as a permanent resident, immediately before they apply, we make special arrangements for lateral recruits. They can apply for citizenship after 90 days' with service in the permanent forces of the Commonwealth; or at least six months' service in the Naval Reserve, the Army Reserve or the Air Force Reserve; or where they were discharged from that service as medically unfit for that service and became thus unfit because of that service. So we have made very special arrangements for these members of our military since 1952. Currently, the person who joins our military and any children they have under the age of 16 are eligible to enjoy these special arrangements; however, other members of the person's family-their husband or wife, a 17-year-old child or maybe an older child who is dependent-are not entitled to enjoy the same special arrangements, and they have to meet the usual requirement of having been resident in Australia for four years' lawful stay. This bill extends the special conditions to the other members of the defence member's family, and that is a good thing. We all know that when a person commits to serve in the military of our country, whether they are an Australian by birth or an Australian by citizenship or a lateral recruit, they make an extraordinary contribution to our way of life. They contribute to our safety, and they put their very lives at risk. Their families also make extraordinary contributions. I worry about my partner when he rides his motorbike, so I cannot even begin to imagine what the families of defence force members go through when their loved ones are serving elsewhere. This bill, which allows the families of people who serve us as lateral recruits to share in the citizenship of this nation, is of the contribution we make to people who serve us in this way. The bill also provides assistance in finding work and education, so it also assists the family to settle in this country. It is an extremely important that, if we ask a person to serve in our military and risk their life, we also give them the security of knowing that their family here in this country share in their citizenship. You can imagine the circumstance if one of our lateral recruits was killed in action and their family were still not citizens. It would of course be an appalling circumstance for all. It would also be a dreadful circumstance for a person who was serving in the military in that way to worry that their family might find itself in such a circumstance. So, as said, I am very pleased to be speaking on this bill. It is surprising in many ways that it has taken this long, but it is quite a nice bill. The new discretion will cover people listed as family members on the recruit's permanent visa application. That will include their spouse; dependent children, regardless of age-as I said, currently it only applies to children under the age of 16; dependent children of dependent children; and relatives of the recruit who do not have spouses or partners, who are usually resident and dependent on the recruit. That might, for example, mean a dependent parent. So it recognises that when a person joins the Australian military their entire family effectively comes with them. This will cover current serving and future lateral recruits and non-historical cohorts. So it also applies to those who are currently serving. The bill defines ADF personnel and family members consistently with the Migration Act, as current and future lateral recruits are sourced from overseas. Understandably, everyone covered by this will still have to meet the other requirements of Australian citizenship: identity; character; part understanding the nature of the application; responsibilities and privileges associated with citizenship; sitting and passing the citizenship test; and making the pledge. But it makes it possible for family members of lateral recruits to make that decision at the same time as the recruit does. With the agreement of the Department of Defence, it is also proposed to amend the act to specify that relevant defence service includes required attendance of at least 90 paid service days in the Navy, Army or Air Force reserves. Currently the requirement is six months service, but this recognises that reserves may not work a lot of days. In the six-month period the reduction from 130 days under policy to the proposed 90 days recognises that priority is given to members of the permanent forces over members of the Defence Reserves in relation to training, meaning that sometimes members of the Defence Reserves in practice may only spend a small number of days each month actually performing paid service. Again, this is a proposal. There still has to be agreement and discussion with the Department of Defence. The proposed amendment also clarifies that 'defence service' refers only to appointed and enlisted personnel in the Australian Defence Force. There is currently an urgent need to attract personnel to specialist roles in the military lateral transfers from overseas. The kinds of roles that you might see there are at the pointy end of technical expertise. There are positions on some of our ships, for example, where if we do not have a person to fill that role the ship cannot sail. And just as there are demands for skilled workers through areas like mining, there are also sometimes demands to take skilled workers from our military services into those areas as well. In fact, I welcomed the HMAS Parramatta back to the docks one time when they came back from the Gulf and there were recruiters standing at the front gate waiting for them to leave the ship. Our military are also in very high demand and we find ourselves sometimes with an unexpected shortage of those highly skilled roles that took years of training. It is important that we recognise the need to attract specialists from time to time from overseas. The numbers that we are talking about are not great. Since 1 July 2007, citizenship has been granted to 536 applications in this lateral recruits group. That is-what?-107 a year since 1 July 2007: a significant number and an important number but not a large number. But I am sure that all those will be greatly relieved that their families will be entitled to the same citizenship rights that they are. Again, a nice bill. Military service is dangerous and the families of military personnel bear a share of this danger. It is worthwhile us all remembering that, while we quite rightly honour the people who give their lives for our country, sometimes the cost is paid in a life lived. It is paid in a life lived with the memories of things you should not have to remember. It is life lived with wounds that you should not have had to bear. It can be a life lived without a loved one in your life or dealing day-today with what your partner carries following their years of service. So it as is incredibly appropriate that we in this place recognise the contributions that families make and welcome them to our country in the same way that we welcome their partners when they choose to serve in our military. There are more ways to demonstrate your commitment to a country than the years that you spend in it, and there can be no greater demonstration of a commitment to a country than to agreeing to serve in its armed forces and moving your family here to fulfil that role. I am very pleased to speak on this important bill. In many ways it is a small bill-it is a bill that corrects an inequity, if you like, for families of a certain group in our defence forces. I am pleased to speak on it. I commend it to the House. It is a great bill. Mrs PRENTICE (Ryan) (18:13): I rise to speak on the Australian Citizenship Amendment (Defence Families) Bill 2012. I believe very strongly in supporting members of the Australian Defence Force. It is one of the fundamental roles of the Australian government to recognise and support the commitment that thousands of our service men and women making each year in the defence of liberty of our nations and its citizens. For more than 100 years, beginning with Australia's involvement in the Boer War in South Africa under the auspices of the United Kingdom, tens of thousands of Australians have died to defend freedom in the world. Not only should their memory and honour be commemorated; we must continue to support in whatever way possible their ultimate contribution. Today's bill supports those families of current and future service men and women who are lateral ADF transfer members-that is, members of a foreign defence force who undertake to serve with the Australian military and serve with the Australian flag on their shoulder. We must recognise their contribution, as it is often the families of Defence Force members-parents, partners and children-who serve as the internal support network for a soldier. They also experience the hardships and irregularities associated with living with a member of the ADF, such as the constant rotations and deployments. This bill will support them by amending their citizenship and permanent resident eligibility requirements. Under normal circumstances the residence requirement dictates an applicant for citizenship must have been a resident for a minimum period of four years. In the case where someone completes a minimum amount of time of service in the defence forces or reserves, a shorter period of time required. That service currently stands at service of 90 days in the Army, Navy or Air Force which may be non-continuous, service of 180 days in the reserves which may also be non-continuous or if they were discharged as medically unfit while in the service of Australia. Today's amendments will extend those same residence requirements to the families of ADF lateral recruits. As the explanatory memorandum notes, this is being done to acknowledge that defence service can be dangerous and the families of ADF lateral recruits bear a share of this danger. This bill also redresses a situation where the settlement circumstances considered by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship are different for lateral recruits and their families. For example, the current situation does not allow children or dependants over the age of 16 to be included on an ADF member's citizenship application. For a spouse and dependants of an ADF lateral transfer member the current situation can result in significant hardship. For example, while family members are granted only permanent residence they are not eligible to receive Centrelink benefits or university HELP based placement, which can put a significant financial strain on families should they choose to study and plan for their future life in Australia. In the event that the ADF member dies during operations where a lateral member was granted citizenship but their family was not, there is no guarantee that they would even be allowed to stay in Australia, much less access the same benefits and resources available to a spouse of a normal ADF member. Australians are compassionate and would not like to see any of these situations occur. While the government has given an assurance that families of deceased lateral is transfer members would be taken care of, today's bill provides a legislative basis for their care and support. Similarly, if the couple were to divorce prior to the spouse and any dependants becoming citizens, certainly many issues would arise as a result. As the member for Fadden has previously informed the House, the ADF is presently looking to recruit as many as 300 lateral transfer personnel each year, 90 per cent of whom would have families also wanting to come to Australia. Ultimately, today's amendments will act as an incentive for foreign soldiers to apply to become lateral members and, as such, will assist Australia in attracting highly specialised personnel to all areas of the ADF. This will help Australia save an enormous amount of both time and money building our own defence capability gaps. These people have already been recruited, trained and skilled to very exceptional levels in other countries. It should be noted that the commensurate net benefit that Australia gains from recruiting a lateral transfer member far exceeds any potential costs associated with bringing forward the citizenship status of the spouse and dependants of a lateral transfer member. To provide one example: if Australia recruited a fully trained pilot, who cost approximately $1.5 million to $2 million to train in their country of origin, their recruitment would offset the entire worstcase cost for the proposed changes of either the coalition's or Labor's bills. Our Defence Force, of course, during this process ensures that a transfer is also suitable for the country from which a new member originates. The Cameron government in the United Kingdom is undertaking a strategic defence and security review which resolves to cut personnel across all of the UK's four defence services. As a result, the Royal Australian Navy has increased its recruitment practices for members of the British navy. In the future I expect that the other two branches of our Defence Force may do the same. The bill of the member for Fadden and this duplicate government bill, whichever is passed, will go a long way to making Australia a more attractive option for a lateral transfer. With only 300 personnel and their family members, we are not necessarily talking about a lot of people coming to Australia each year, but they do bring important benefits not just to the ADF but also to our economy and society. Defence Families of Australia has reported that the vast majority of personnel come from the United Kingdom but also from New Zealand, South Africa and the United States. While we currently have many lateral transfer members serving in places like Afghanistan and Iraq, their spouses and children are often posted in Darwin, Brisbane and other places along the eastern seaboard. These family members often live in a Defence Housing Authority property; possibly some live at the Gallipoli Barracks in the electorate of Ryan. They shop locally and send their children to community child care and schooling. While less than 50 per cent of families had visited Australia prior to a successful transfer application, they can become part of the local community very quickly. There were two very important developments in the introduction and passage of this bill today which again highlight the cynical politics and spin of this government. Unfortunately, the specific bills we see before us today are not the result of genuine concern but of the government's attempt to play a game of one-upmanship. Firstly, Defence has been undertaking a lot of good work in the area of lateral transfers and their family members, and I would like to express my gratitude to the organisation and membership of Defence Families of Australia, an independent advocacy group formed by the Department of Defence. This group not only consults and liaises with the Department of Defence but also provides information and guidance to families of Defence Force personnel. In 2009 the Defence Families of Australia conference gave in-principle support to approaching Defence and the government to seek an amendment to the Australian Citizenship Act 2007 to allow partners and older children to gain citizenship at the same time as the member. The member for Fadden in his capacity as shadow minister for defence science, technology and personnel has worked closely with the defence community and was finally after a long time given the opportunity to introduce his private member's bill, the Australian Citizenship Amendment (Defence Service Requirement) Bill 2012, into the House on Monday, 21 May. The Labor government claim that there were broader considerations which needed to be included in the package, yet they decided not to follow Westminster tradition and introduce amendments to that effect. The coalition made it very clear throughout that process that we were more than willing to work with them if they had any concerns about the design of the bill or if there were any specific amendments they wished to offer. Instead they decided that the coalition's proposal was such a good idea that they would, effectively, copy the text of the bill of the member for Fadden, change a word here or there and try to pretend that it was the government's initiative. In fact, not only have they stolen the coalition's proposal and passed it off as their own; we had evidence of the real attitude of the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship to the bill when the idea was first proposed to him in a letter from the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel of 16 November 2010. The minister for immigration decided this issue was so important that he finally responded-87 days later-when he said, 'I do not consider it necessary to amend the citizenship legislation'. Although it originally took the minister 87 days to respond to his own colleague, I am very appreciative that it only took the government three days-that is right: three days-to introduce today's bill into parliament following the member for Fadden's private member's bill. This is yet more evidence that this government are more than happy to publicly pretend that they care about our armed forces, but behind closed doors they are really abandoning moral and financial support. The budget announced by the Treasurer included $5.5 billion of cuts to the defence portfolio, bringing defence funding to its lowest level since 1938 as a share of GDP. More details have emerged this week that recreational leave travel will cease for single members over the age of 21. Members of the Army and the Air Force were able to take one flight home per year, paid for by the government, and members of the Navy two flights. This will affect 22,000 people in the Defence Force, a significant number-and we are talking about individuals who just want to go home to see their family during Christmas or other significant times. These people were told when they signed up that if they were interstate and away from their families the government would support them. This is yet another deceit from the government, all for a measure that would cost the government only $15 million per year. Somehow, out of an annual defence budget of $24 billion, the government cannot find enough empathy in its ranks to say to defence personnel, 'You're supporting this country so we will support you'. To conclude, the coalition's private member's bill was an opportunity to give families of lateral transfer members peace of mind. It was designed to send the message that we strongly support members of our Defence Force and that we also support their families. Consequently, these bills will act as an incentive to recruit the world's besttrained military personnel to come to this country and to serve under the Australian flag. While this Labor government has used this legislation as a cynical political manoeuvre, I welcome today's changes and I commend the bill to the House.",134
160,Mr HAWKE,BILLS," It is a pleasure to follow the member for Ryan's wise remarks about this matter, and I join in supporting this bill, because the coalition is a group of parties committed to the personnel and families of our defence forces. That is why the member for Fadden introduced his private member's bill in the first place. As a person from a service personnel background, who has a long history of interest and involvement in policy making for defence, he saw the gap that had been created in legislation in Australia in relation to lateral transfers. Defence in the future will require, when you look at the current white paper, a remarkable increase in the number of highly skilled and trained personnel that we will need to operate the equipment provided for in the white paper. For example, there will be 12 submarines at a cost of $37 billion. More importantly, we have to have available trained submariners to be able to man those pieces of equipment that we decide to go with. In the timeframes that we have been given, it is widely conceivable that we will use even more lateral transfers, to take advantage of the expertise of countries that we have interoperability with, such as the United States and other countries, depending on the systems that we eventually choose. Given that, there was a big impetus for this legislation. The member for Fadden and the coalition understood that this was not a matter that could wait-that those service families who come here on lateral transfers could, of course, be adversely affected in a very substantial and quite serious way-and that a guarantee that the government would somehow simply take care of it, without the adequate legislation, was of course insufficient. We know, as the member for Ryan wisely pointed out, that the government's view was different prior to the introduction of the member for Fadden's private member's bill. That was, of course, that letter that she referred to from Chris her Bowen to the then Minister for Defence Science and Personnel indicating that the government's view was that there was no need to amend the Citizenship Act in this regard. In the view of the minister, his department and his officials, he had for some time considered this matter in detail. He had been written to by the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel. He had had the time to thoroughly examine the issues of lateral transfers, leading to his decision about the adequacy of the citizenship legislation and that, in Minister Bowen's view, there was no need to do anything about it. That was the view of this government. We know that in this government they do not have an instinct for defence forces-for our service personnel. Their instinct is not there. I think that is evidenced by the minister's letter. They are taking into account all of the factors, he wrote in his letter. He said, 'I do not consider it necessary to amend the citizenship legislation. However, I would encourage our two departments to continue to liaise with one another on this issue.' I do not think it is odd that we are now in the situation today where, three days after we the coalition have introduced a bill on behalf of lateral transfers and service personnel and their families obtaining citizenship, the government duplicates the bill almost entirely except for a couple of amendments in relation to reserve service and a few other matters. I just happen to have a copy of the changes here in front of me. I do not say that they are necessarily bad changes, but the only differences between the bill of the member for Fadden and the government's bill are, in essence, the reduction in the relevant defence criteria for service from 180 to 90 days. As a former reservist myself, I actually support this in ethos, and I support that reduction. In the event that the member dies before obtaining citizenship, their spouse and independents remain eligible for fast-tracked citizenship. Of course, that is amendment this entire House would support. Finally, the extension of the provisions beyond spouses and independent children to any dependent-for example, elderly dependent parents or disabled dependents not considered children-is, of course, another worthy amendment. But it begs the question: where was the government for the last four years in relation to this matter? This is the government. This is the government of Australia. It is its job to produce legislation of this nature in response to the worthy representations of so many groups including defence families of Australia. Once again in our country it is left opposition-the so-called 'negative opposition', according to the government-to come forward with the actual legislative answer, which we have put together and put in a private member's bill in this chamber. The government might on this occasion want to thank the opposition for providing it with the legislative answer to this problem, for coming forward with a positive agenda on behalf of our Defence Force personnel and their families and for being very constructive in opposition in seeing the real needs of serving families and doing something about it. Of course, we will not hear anything from those opposite about the constructive approach taken by the member for Fadden in the opposition. It is really fleecing defence families and serving personnel in saying that it is doing this, but it is really the opposition's bill replicated by the government. It is important to expose that in this debate because we should always expose what governments of any calibre are doing and highlight to people what is really going on. It has been driven to do this out of desperation and embarrassment at the opposition bringing this forward to the parliament. I think that is a very important point for all service personnel and their an families to understand, given the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship's earlier rejection of it as not necessary according to his own considered view. This is a worthy piece of legislation, which is why we brought it forward. We all understand how serious service life is and how much of a sacrifice families make on our behalf for their service personnel, who are often deployed on the numerous operations we have around the world. Australia is probably directly involved in more overseas operations than at any other time in its history. That is set to continue given the changing nature of our region and to the the changing nature of our world. As I have outlined, I do think lateral transfers will be a more heavily used mechanism by governments of all persuasions to meet the increasing capability that our Defence Force will have in the renewal outlined in the white paper. The majority of lateral transfers come in from the United Kingdom, the original source of the Australian colony, and today that remains the same. It is important to note that at the moment we are taking advantage of the RAN, the Royal Australian Navy, which is cutting back numbers due to cuts, and using those personnel to fill our capability gaps. I can also talk from experience, having visited RAAF Williamtown and having a senior Air Force officer attempt to explain the complexity of training pilots. I can tell you that any member of this House who pretends to understand the mathematical complexity involved in training fighter pilots would be fudging it. It is a very complex process; it is a very detailed process and it is a very mathematically heavy process. The cost of doing that can be prohibitive and sometimes we do not have the right systems in place to attain the goal that we are looking for. To gain a well-trained fighter pilot from overseas is sometimes the right way to go. It is, of course, of great value to our country to receive people of this calibre-highlytrained, professional people who can operate this equipment without having to incur the costs of training. Certainly, that was my experience at RAAF Williamtown. Given our experience coming up with Super Hornets and the Joint Strike Fighter, there may well be excuses and opportunities for us to use the lateral transfers in relation to more often. It is important to note that about 90 per cent of ADF lateral transfer members have families that they bring with them to Australia. That is the importance of this bill: 90 per cent of people do have family members that they bring. Given the dangerous environment that they are in, and the things that may or may not occur within 90 or 180 days, the provisions of the Citizenship Act are important here because if we do not change this legislation, then it is easy to foresee a time now and into the future when this may have an unusually punitive effect on these families and their dependents. At the moment, the provision of early citizenship under the act does not include the spouse or partner of the ADF member, nor does it include dependants aged 16 or overthat is, those who cannot be included on the ADF member's citizenship application. This situation can and does upset the families of lateral transfers and create unnecessary tension, which is something we do not want to bring on people we have asked to come here and serve in our armed forces. Most seriously, we are also dealing with a potential situation of extreme injury or death resulting from this service to the ADF. We must take every measure possible in this chamber to ensure that families are looked after in these circumstances. That is why I am very comfortable in supporting this legislation. I am glad that the coalition developed legislation along these lines and put it forward to the House so that the government could replicate it and bring it into the parliament. I commend the shadow minister for defence science, technology and personnel, Stuart Robert, and his shadow parliamentary secretaries for designing this legislation, for understanding the need to amend the pilots Citizenship Act and for understanding the needs of our service personnel and their families. They are worthy people to be ministers in a government that understands defence, that believes in the service ethos and that understands the families of those people and what they go through. I commend our shadow spokespeople for coming up with this quality set of proposals. Whichever bill ends up being voted on, which will be a decision of the government, we will be supporting it in recognition of how important this issue is. But I would go back and say to the government and to the party of government, the Labor Party in coalition with the Greens, that this constant assault on defence must simply stop-$5 billion of cuts. In relation to this legislation, we heard from Minister Bowen that nothing needs to be done for these families for four years. We really need to do better than that for our service personnel and their families. That does not mean just getting up in this chamber and doing it, it means coming forward with the proposals and the legislation. That is why I am happy to support a bill that is a copy of the coalition's bill in all respects, except for some minor amendments. I am happy to support worthy proposals, even if we have to drive them from opposition. But just think what we could do if we were in government. We could certainly drive these proposals a lot faster and make things a lot better for service personnel.",140
161,Ms MARINO,BILLS," At the outset, like the member for Mitchell, I indicate my support for the Australian Citizenship Amendment (Defence Families) Bill 2012-and it is, as the member for Mitchell said, about time. I believe that we need to do whatever we can to support our defence personnel, the men and women who come from overseas and those who are from Australia who put their safety on the line to defend the interests of all Australians at home and abroad. As we have heard, the original bill was put together by the member for Fadden, the shadow minister, Stuart Robert, and I commend him for his efforts. He is unrelenting in his representation in this regard, and I echo his concerns about the $5 billion worth of cuts to defence in the current budget. This is a very important issue. It is very important that faster access to Australian citizenship be extended to the families of those personnel who have completed the relevant defence service. The personnel involved have access but their families do not. This bill seeks to change that. As we have heard, 90 per cent of those who come here in that form do bring their families. So the merit of extending this privilege to foreign nationals who are willing to serve directly in our armed services should really be obvious to us all and should not have taken so long. That is why the coalition, through the member for Fadden, previously introduced the Australian Citizenship Amendment (Defence Service Requirement) Bill back in May of this year. I would like to see the men and women who are responsible for our defence having a stronger bond to the country they are defending, and I think this is an important way that we can recognise the contribution our they make to this nation. It is entirely appropriate that those who serve should be fast-tracked into Australian citizenship and so should their families, so that a new bond of national pride and appreciation cements the relationship that these people and these personnel have with the communities that ultimately they protect. That is what they are doing-they are protecting our communities. It is not a great step forward to acknowledge that when such personnel align their loyalties to our nation through citizenship it is actually contradictory to deny their immediate family that same honour, opportunity and privilege, as we see it. This simple step, as previously proposed by the coalition, was delayed by Labor just to save political face-though I am not sure why. The legislation put forward previously by the member for Fadden was a very worthy piece of legislation, and I do not understand why the government did not support it, particularly given that the piece of legislation we see before us now is very similar to that. Unfortunately, it represents one more example of the political meanness of this government. I do not appreciate that approach to the members of our military. Labor came into power promising a three per cent real increase in the defence budget and a white paper that was supposed to structure the force for the next 20 years. This is where we see this ongoing attack on defence-another promise from the Gillard government that, in defence terms, could be described as firing blanks. The government's promised three per cent real growth was actually only 1.3 per cent as at the end of last year-which represents the smallest increase in defence funding since 1938. The government appears to be ignoring the fact that our forces are actively engaged around the world. We are engaged in conflicts and in peacekeeping roles, and ongoing funding of defence is critical. It is obviously a surprise to the government to know that in practical terms these cuts mean additional demands and pressure on defence, not less. The defence budget under Labor has now dropped to 1.6 per cent of GDP, just above the 1.55 per cent it was in the year before World War II-a period in which the world largely knew it was inevitably headed to the battlefield. Members would be shocked to hear that the defence budget has been slashed by around $18 billion over the last four years, and I have real concerns about this. This includes $5.5 billion worth of cuts under the most recent budget-with $960 million coming from next financial year alone. That lack of support for defence really does concern me. It has meant that significant defence projects have had to be pushed to the out years-and some beyond the out years-and probably will not ever be committed to under this government.",143
162,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS," Order! I have given the member for Forrest considerable latitude, but I would ask that she return to the subject of the bill, the Australian Citizenship Amendment (Defence Families) Bill 2012.",144
163,Ms MARINO,BILLS,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am speaking up for the families and the members of the defence forces in all its forms, and I see this as part and parcel that. As I said when I first started my speech, I certainly do support the Australian Citizenship Amendment (Defence Families) Bill. It will be obvious to observers that the military security of the world has not altered. That is why we certainly need the types of people who are coming here to serve in our defence forces and why we need to support their families in the same way and offer them the same opportunity. We also need to acknowledge that global financial uncertainty does not decrease global defence demands; it actually increases the need. This debate is very important. The bill before the House seeks to support the families of those foreign nationals who seek to serve Australia in our armed forces, and I commend them for wanting to be part of this nation and its defence capacity. It is important that, as a parliament, we seek to support all those 50,000 men and women who serve, including the new recruits. As we know, decisions in defence taken today do take a long time to actually result in actions, and the results of decisions can take years to become obvious. One of the things that has concerned me-and I will touch on this-is the decision to remove the recreation leave travel for single members. This has caused major concern in my electorate and certainly for defence force personnel and their families. I want to mention here tonight a gentleman by the name of Dave, who indicated that he is a returned veteran on a TPI and service pension whose eldest son is now a member of the regular Army. The Defence cutbacks are going to take away the free return travel to next of kin or home address once a year. This gentleman who has served and whose son is serving finds this, in his own words, 'abhorrent'. He said he believes it is a recognition of service given to the country that they do get a free trip home of each year. He said, 'I believe this is one area that should remain clear of any budget cutbacks. My son will be posted to Darwin and the only safe way and quickest way is to fly to that destination.' He said this will take away his free flight as a condition of living in a remote location. He will have no alternative but to drive home, which will take three to four days. This will lead to a fatigue management issue, which will then become a duty of care and safety issue. He said young people giving their service to the country need this valued condition to be able to maintain links to their home. I think this really important. The gentleman went on to say Defence has had to make some decisions on cutbacks due to the government demands that they return to surplus. He expressed genuine concerns about the safety of his son. The member for Fadden identified in this House a range of Defence programs that have been deferred or cut completely. We have heard frequently about those from the member for Fadden. In concluding, I do support the government in its efforts in this bill. I recognise and strongly support the efforts by the member for Fadden, who originally brought this to the parliament and, but for a few minor amendments, we see that effort reflected in this bill here tonight.",144
164,Mr MATHESON,BILLS," I rise today to support the Australian Citizenship Amendment (Defence Families) Bill 2012, which will fast track Australian citizenship for family members of Australian Defence Force personnel who have transferred from the military of another country. I do this because, like the coalition, I believe strongly in supporting our ADF personnel, their families, spouses and dependents. This bill will ensure that partners and dependents of Australian Defence Force transfer members will be eligible for Australian citizenship at the same time as the serving member. An ADF lateral transfer member is a member of the Defence Force who has served on another nation's military and has subsequently moved to Australia to serve in our Defence Force. They come from different countries around the world including New Zealand, South Africa, the UK and the US. The ADF has a proud history of recruiting members from the armed forces of other countries. These is members help to fill critical gaps in our Defence workforce and bring skills and experience to help improve the ADF's understanding of critical issues. I am sure most would agree that if the skills of these transfer members add to the capability of our Defence Force then we should do everything we can to support these serving members and their families. As a child of an Australian soldier, I understand the importance of this bill for our Defence Force personnel and their families. My mum worried enough about my dad when he was serving overseas; I cannot imagine how distressing it would have been for our family if Dad was considered an Australian citizen and we were not. What would happen to my mum and her children if Dad was killed overseas in the line of duty? I would hate to think of the emotional and financial hardships that would follow. We all know that the spouses of ADF members and their dependents give so much to our nation. Without the full support of their families, many of our frontline soldiers would not continue to serve in the ADF. Not only do the families of our soldiers offer a great amount of support to the serving family member but they are the ones that experience all the hardships associated with being a Defence family. I know all too well about the regular rotation of the deployments, which are just one of the many stresses placed on ADF families. During my childhood, my dad was stationed at North Head, Sydney; Wacol in Queensland; Malaya and Holsworthy. I was three years old when we moved to Malaya after dad was deployed there in 1961. He served at Terendak Camp Malacca from 1961 to 1963. My younger sister Kerry was born in Kuala Lumpur. Things could not have been easy for my mum bringing up two small children in a foreign country without the support of her family and friends. In 1963, dad was transferred to Holsworthy army barracks where we stayed until the end of his career. With each move we had to start over and build a new life. But I consider us to be the lucky ones. Some members of the Defence Force move around on a regular basis, and this can be a great strain on their families. I have also experienced the hardship that families go through when a serving member returns from war with post-traumatic stress syndrome. I was a young child when my dad returned from Vietnam. He fought in the Battle of Long Tan. I remember going into his bedroom to wake him up one morning and he jumped up and nearly strangled me. He was still in battle mode in the war zone. He slept with his eyes open and relived the horrors of Vietnam in his sleep. To this day, my dad still relives those terrible memories in his dreams. I know all too well that it is not easy to be a family member of ADF personnel. But it is the love and support of these family members that help our soldiers through the tough times. I love my dad and I would support him through anything. I know that without the love and support he received from my mum and his children he could not have served his country so courageously for all those years. This is why if we want to keep these soldiers in our Defence Force we must look after their families too. I am sure this bill will be a great comfort to many families of those serving our country or currently living in Australia. So many families would benefit from these changes. The research carried out by the Defence Families of Australia showed that 90 per cent of ADF lateral transfer members have families they bring with them to live in our country. I cannot stress how important it is that we support these families and give them the same citizenship status as serving members. As it stands now, all lateral transfer members are required by law to qualify for permanent residency visas before they can take up a position with the ADF and move to Australia. This is necessary because all ADF members are required to be Australian citizens and permanent residency is a prerequisite to citizenship. Under the Australian Citizenship Act 2007 a permanent resident may be granted citizenship after completing 90 days permanent service in the ADF or 180 days service in the reserves. The provision of early citizenship under the act does not include the spouse or partner of the ADF member and it does not include their children aged 16 or over, because they cannot be included on the ADF member's citizenship application. While the partners and dependents of these ADF members are given permanent residency, when they move to Australia they are not offered citizenship. This situation is simply not fair on these families, especially not in a country which values the family unit so much and understands its importance. Australia currently has ADF lateral transfer members deployed on operations. If one of these members is killed, there is no legislation or guarantee that would allow their families to stay in Australia or have access to the benefits normally received by the spouse and dependants of an ADF member. I think we need to ask this one simple question: why should these brave men and women join the Australian Defence Force and support our troops serving overseas if their families are not going to be looked after in the case of a tragedy? Yes, in the past the government has made assurances that support would be provided for these families, but there is no reason why these assurances enough cannot be turned into legislation. The children of these soldiers also deserve government support for things like their education. Under the current system these young people are not eligible for university HELP based placement, which puts significant financial strain on families. I believe that if a family moves to Australia so one of its members can serve in our Defence Force then that family should be looked after and treated like any other family of an Australian soldier. It is also important to that the net benefit that Australia gains from recruiting a lateral transfer member exceeds any potential costs associated with bringing forward the citizenship status of the member's family. The ADF is looking to recruit up to approximately 300 lateral transfer personnel each year, but I can tell you now: this will not be an easy thing to do if we are not offering a fair citizenship process to the families of these personnel. This legislation will provide families of our Defence Force members with peace of mind. It is a policy that is supported by Defence Families of Australia who have been fantastic advocates of our serving men and women. It is a shame that party politics must be brought into such an important issue, but I question the motives of the government to rush the bill before parliament, especially when it is so similar to the coalition's bill that we introduced on May 21. I would hate to think that our Defence Force personnel are being used by this government to play political games. The Labor government has done nothing in the past four years with regard to this issue; in fact, their own minister for immigration is on the record saying that he did not consider it necessary to amend the citizenship legislation for family members of our lateral transfer personnel. Yet, one day after the coalition introduces its bill, the government introduces a bill that is almost a carbon copy with some additional changes These changes extend the legislation to include family members beyond partners and dependent children to any dependant, including elderly parents or disabled dependants who are not considered children. It also reduces the relevant defence service criteria for reserve service from 180 days to note 90 days and, in the event the member dies before attaining citizenship, their spouse and dependants remain eligible for fast-tracked citizenship. While the coalition supports these changes in addition to its own bill, the government could have easily introduced them as amendments to the coalition's bill, rather than playing political games and introducing its own bill. But, while I question the motives of the government, this will not stop me from supporting such an important bill for our transfer defence personnel and their families. I believe that anyone who is prepared to sacrifice their life for this country is worth all the support we can give them, as are their families, without whom the courageous men and women in our armed forces would not be able to do the fantastic job they do for this country. It is for this reason that I commend this bill to the House, and I commend the member for Fadden for initiating and bringing this legislation before the parliament today. Mrs GRIGGS (Solomon) (18:55): I rise to speak to Australian Citizenship Amendment (Defence Families) Bill 2012, a bill which seeks to recognise the partners and dependants of those members of our Australian Defence Force-or the ADF, as we know it-enlisted through lateral transfer measures in terms of their eligibility for Australian citizenship. Lateral transfer members help to fill critical gaps within the ADF workforce. They bring skills and experience, enabling them to hit the ground running and thus afford the ADF an opportunity to utilise these skills and experience without the cost and delay of training an individual from scratch. Lateral transfers and the practice of recruiting experience is not a new phenomenon: in this day and age it is just one avenue or tool to which any employer organisation may access when looking to recruit new staff. In the case of our ADF, they seek to recruit up to 300 lateral transfer personnel each year. This number is entirely the prerogative of the ADF but, importantly, it must be noted that 90 per cent of the ADF lateral transfer members have families who also move to Australia. The Australian Citizenship Act requires that all lateral transfer members must qualify for permanent residency visas before they can take up a position with the ADF and therefore move to Australia. Simply, this ensures permanent residency is in place, a prerequisite to citizenship and compliance with section 21(2)(c) and section 23 of the Australian Citizenship Act 2007, where a permanent resident may be granted citizenship after completing 90 days permanent service in the ADF or 180 days service in the reserves. Sadly, at present, provisions for early citizenship as outlined the act do not include the spouse or partner of an ADF member. Amendments to this act, designed to bring reassurance to those who may be a spouse or partner in terms of citizenship, are welcomed and supported. Let me quantify the importance of these amendments. I referred to our Australian Defence Force in my opening comments-Australian defence personnel: personnel who, as military representatives of this country are at times deployed offshore in response to the needs of Australia and broader global military representation. We expect that those people serving within the ranks of the ADF, and who undertake the rigours and dangers associated with that calling are Australian by law; yet, in the same breath, we have been unwilling to afford that same level of acceptance and compliance to citizenship responsibilities for partners, spouses and immediate families of these members. Darwin is home to an extensive number of ADF personnel, including their partners, spouses and families. It is my experience that those partners, spouses and families underpin and provide a solid foundation-a foundation which supports and enables the very efforts we as Australians expect from those within our ADF ranks. In many respects, those who partner and are family to serving ADF members are not acknowledged when we talk of the ADF. We forget the significant impost on them. We forget the emptiness they feel. We do not see the loneliness they endure, nor do we see the significant impact on families of all that is required of those who fill our ADF's ranks. We do not see the pain when ADF members are injured or killed in the line of duty. Yes, we see the media reports; yes, we see the pain for a fleeting moment as the we watch television coverage of a grieving in family, but we do not see the depth or extent of that pain. We do not see what happens to the family-to the spouse or dependantbeyond what is evident in that fleeting TV coverage of loss. There are ADF lateral transfer members on deployment. Sadly, under the Australian Citizenship Act as it stands, if one such member should be killed there is no guarantee that their spouses or dependants would be able to stay in Australia or have access to the benefits normally payable to the spouse and dependants of an ADF member. That, of course, is the worse case. I acknowledge the government has made assurances to provide support in such circumstances; however, this is of little comfort to families without the surety of legislative compliance. Beyond the worse case, we fail to acknowledge the importance of the support provided to a member of the ADF by their spouse and dependants. We do not take for granted the importance that our own families have for us against the backdrop of a life in politics. We in this place are subject to the rigours of parliamentary obligations, be they sitting days, committee obligations or travel within our own electorates. Our own dependants are left to deal with many of the day-today obstacles of life without immediate access to us. We identify and acknowledge the additional pressures on our loved ones as a result of the roads we travel-yet the lives of the dependants of many ADF personnel are far more complicated and impacted and there is often little support for access to family and friends. Long periods of deployment, regular moves and transfers around the country, and irregularity in schooling and access to government services and entitlements are just some of the difficulties they face. More fundamentally, the ability for a spouse or dependent to share those important and lifegiving moments-the development of a relationship or a family or the capacity to provide some balance and normality to a child's life-is compromised. To quantify further, the spouse and dependants of ADF lateral transfer members have the additional disadvantage of being away from the country that was once their home and where they had familiarity, stability and networks of friends, family and services to tap into. I witness these issues on a daily basis. I feel for those partners and dependants left behind and I see the impacts. Currently, as permanent residents, dependants of ADF lateral transfer members are not eligible for university FEE-HELP placement-an additional financial impost. Divorce rates and family breakdowns within the ADF are above the national average, which is not surprising given the realities of life as an ADF spouse, partner or dependant. The current act provides no security of citizenship or access to government support to the spouse of an ADF lateral transfer member in the event of divorce. I highlight the value of the amendments in this bill and support the amendments to the Australian Citizenship Act. Ensuring that partners and dependants of ADF lateral transfer members are eligible for Australian citizenship at the same time as the serving member is, in my mind, clear recognition at last of the true value that should have been afforded to these people when the act was originally progressed. Yet, despite the support I verbalise, I am unable now to simply fold my speech up and sit down without addressing a couple of issues which remain outstanding in my mind. I remain a little perplexed that, on 21 May this year, the coalition introduced a nearly identical bill. This Australian Citizenship Amendment (Defence Families) Bill, aside from a few minor changes, remains essentially the same. I am unclear why the coalition bill could not simply have been agreed to in a bipartisan manner with the inclusion of the amendments contained in this bill, unless it was political point scoring by the government. Additionally, the introduction of this bill on 22 May comes some 12 months after the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Chris Bowen, wrote to the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Warren Snowdon, on 4 February 2011, stating in the second-last paragraph of his letter: I do not consider it necessary to amend the citizenship legislation. The introduction of the bill on 22 May comes one day after the coalition bill was introduced. It is clear that the spirit underlying these amendments demonstrate that both sides of this House recognise the legislation's current limitations and have sought, in an almost identical manner, to address them. It is a a more direct and cohesive parliamentary process could not have been achieved, and that is very disappointing. I commend the bill to the House. I would also like to acknowledge the work of the member for Fadden in bringing his bill to this House.",145
165,Mr JENKINS,BILLS," I start with the finishing point of the member for Solomon. I have been a little disappointed throughout this debate on the Australian Citizenship Amendment (Defence Families) Bill 2012 that we have not celebrated that the two major sides of this chamber have come to similar conclusions. We should celebrate that because it indicates the importance of the amendments that are included in this legislation. I first became aware of this two years ago when the wife of a lateral transfer British serviceman came to me. When she mentioned 'lateral transfer' I thought: 'What is it? Is it some sort of condition?' I had to start from the basics. Defence personnel matters are not matters that I get many questions on in the electorate of Scullin. I do not have any defence housing, and I am wedged between Maygar Barracks at Broadmeadows, which now has other uses, and Watsonia Barracks in the electorate of Jagajaga, which is a very important defence installation. It seemed to me that there was a degree of absolute inconsistency that explanation. I am not going to go into this because I do not want to deflect into the partisan debate, but I assume that it had been a problem for quite some time, and the fact that during this period of the Labor government it has been highlighted to a conclusion is something that, as I have said from the outset, I am pleased about. The fact that a year ago in discussions between ministers it did not appear that we were pity going to get the progress of this amending legislation again gives us all strength as members of parliament that, by due consideration, by advocacy from members of parliament on behalf of those who come to people with a problem, and by the lobbying of interested outside groups government and oppositions in formulating policy can come to conclusions that find solutions. Eerily, the example that was used by the minister in his second reading speech covers the family constellation of the lady who came to see me, because it absolutely highlighted our inconsistent approach to the defence family unit. Here, we brought to Australia a person who had skills that were required by our defence forces, and because of that employment there was a system that allowed a fast-tracking of that person's Australian citizenship. In the case of the spouse, however, it is business as usual with no fast-tracking. Without going into full details, the unfortunate thing for Australia was that this woman that approached me certainly had, in her employment in Great Britain, skills that could have been used by Australia as a nation, but they were skills in an area which requires the people employed in that sector to be Australian citizens. Not only was there the frustration of not being able, as the spouse of a person who was in the Australian Defence Force and who had become an Australian citizen, to also become an Australian citizen but also this limited this defied woman's employment opportunities. Then we had the two children. I recollect that they were two boys: one 14 and one 19 or 20. The 14-year-old was covered; dad became an Australian citizen and the 14year-old became an Australian citizen. The older lad was approaching the end of schooling and was from a family that had a tradition in the military with, as I recollect, grandfather who was a serviceman in the British defence forces, and a father who had made a lateral transfer from the British forces to the Australian forces based on skills required by the Australian Defence Force. This young fellow wanted to join the defence forces, but he was not an Australian citizen. He had to wait around, do his time and become an Australian citizen, because he was not covered by the fast track. Again, I note that the minister in his second reading speech makes note of an example very similar to this case that was brought to me. I pay great tribute to those organisations that represent defence personnel and to the individuals involved. This particular family was transferred from Melbourne to New South Wales, so I lost continuous contact, but this lady, upon first knowledge of the member for Fadden's approach and proposed legislation, sent me an email asking me to support the legislation that the member for Fadden was proposing. I hope she will excuse that I have chosen to give my full support to the government's initiative. At the end of the day there are a couple of differences-and I admit that they might be minor-between the two pieces of legislation, but the people who would find themselves in the circumstances outlined in the minister's second reading speech would not think that they were minor. I think that these differences make things more equitable. If, for instance, we are talking not only about generations going downwards but about generations above-if grandparents are involved-these are improvements. I have to admit that if we have two similar pieces of legislation-and this is in no way a comment on the ability of the drafters that put together private members' bills, and is no criticism of them-this is something that, once the Minister for Immigration and a Citizenship was convinced in liaison with the cases that had been brought to the defence ministers, the whole resources of government could be put behind in a piece of legislation. I think it is really a good thing for it to come before this House so that we remedy something that was obviously unintended. I think that everybody would agree and understand the reason for the fasttracking of the lateral transferee but, on simple and first blush investigation of the circumstances of family members, it did not seem to be logical. These are special cases and, as other members in this debate have indicated, we should be placing on record our acknowledgement of the support that men and women in the Australian Defence Force get from their families. To think that families do not have to confront hardship when the men and women of the Australian defence forces, for instance, are on deployment overseas would be to not understand human nature and the way that things are in reality. This is not only the case when family members are deployed overseas. The Australian Defence Force is characterised by a very skilled workforce and those skills are not gathered by people just working nine to five in an office somewhere. They often involve exercises and time away for training. So we should not just think that families have to put up with the loss of the contribution that can be made by the Defence Force family member being around all the time. The fact that this piece of legislation in an indirect way gives recognition to all family members of Defence Force personnel is also important because, in coming to a whole-of-government conclusion, it is really those notions of looking after Defence Force families that have won through. We are left with an inconsistency in citizenship legislation but this has been seen as such a special case that it is worthy of having the amendments. As I said in response to the conclusion of the member for Solomon and to some of the comments that have been made to deflect and defend against those who have decided to make partisan comments, I think that the House should celebrate this point that we are in. To the degree that the member for Fadden and the people that he worked with deserve credit, let us share the credit around. When you get to the stage where ministers are having exchange of letters and they are in disagreement-and those exchanges of letters are public because they are things that we are using to try to explain the position to our constituents-it is very important to have got to the stage where there is a whole-ofgovernment position. It is a little unfortunate to use debates like this to talk about our partisan views about the funding of defence, post the last debate. I would welcome us having that full debate because I welcome leaders of political parties on both sides-those that have the interests of the economic management on behalf of those forces-entering the debate. Some well-meaning people on the other side of the chamber have said about the reductions, 'This is another one of those things. It is the end of the world; the fall in.' I would be interested to witness the debate with their economic management shadow ministers to see where things are really going. These are the types of debates that we really should have in totality and try to step back from the politics of the day. Let us really be fair dinkum with each other. For those who see the importance of maintenance of the resourcing of defence forces, especially in a troubled world, let us have the discussion with those that want to return budgets to surplus by three years ago if they could do it retrospectively. These are the debates that we do not have enough of here. We have the absolute use of a piece of really good legislation that we all should be celebrating because it is something that we actually agree on. The differences are at the margins. We have one proposition that we are discussing tonight that has a couple of things that just push it further over the line. Let us celebrate that we have got to this point. Let us say to those that lobbied us, 'This is an example of the way to go about your work, to stick in there even when it seems that nothing is going to change.' I hate to tell the people from the opposite side of the chamber that have been worried and concerned and wrung their hands in this debate that I have a feeling that, if the coalition had been in power, we would have had the immigration minister saying one thing and a defence personnel minister saying another thing. Hopefully we would have got around, down the track, to everybody agreeing. Let us not hear that this has taken four years. The thing is that it has been done. It is a very good piece of policy that has been achieved as a result of the democratic processes of a nation that is well defended by its defence forces. I celebrate that. I fully support the legislation before the House tonight.",150
166,Mr IRONS,BILLS," I rise to sky will speak on and support the Australian Citizenship Amendment (Defence Families) Bill 2012. I thank the member for Scullin for his contribution and the fact that he wishes to celebrate this issue. It is a pity that, with his celebration-his passionate and genuine contribution-there are not more government members joining with him to speak on this bill and join in celebrating with the member for Scullin. Australia has a proud military history. Values of mateship, sacrifice and courage underscore that history and are a deep source of pride for many Australians. We are incredibly fortunate to live in a country where stability is the norm and where citizens have the freedom to pursue their aspirations in a peaceful and secure environment. There are many places across the globe which are less fortunate, where security is not the norm and where lawlessness leads to poverty and widespread devastation of communities. I often mention this to immigrants at citizenship ceremonies I attend, when comparing where immigrants may have come from to their new country, Australia. We should never take for granted the benefits we receive from the heroic efforts of the many men and women who serve and have served our great nation with courage and honour. There are numerous elements that contribute to a successful nation. One that undeniable is a strong and stable defence force. You cannot build a prosperous economy, you cannot continue to innovate and grow and you cannot develop a strong and confident country without security. I share in the disappointment of many Australians - and, I am sure, of the member for Scullin-at the Labor government's recent cuts to defence announced in this year's budget. The devaluation of our defence priorities by the government shows a Treasurer and a Prime Minister obsessed with political survival even at the national security. This is a trend I am sure coalition government would reverse. I attended a number of ANZAC Day services in my electorate this year, as I do each year, and each year I am reminded of the huge sacrifices made by our Defence Force members and their families. Where we can, the government and coalition should support these families. They demonstrate great commitment to Australia, and their service provides immense benefits to the millions of Australians who inhabit this country. As previous coalition speakers have outlined, the bill currently before the House is very similar to the private member's bill introduced by the member for Fadden on 21 May, the Australian Citizenship Amendment (Defence Service Requirement) Bill 2012. We heard the member for Fadden speak at length tonight about the insincerity of the minister and about the process of this bill reaching the House, but I will speak on that issue further on in my speech. Also, the phrase 'imitation is the sincerest form of flattery' comes to mind. But the fact is that the coalition strongly believes in supporting not only our ADF personnel but also their families. It is important that we support the personnel's spouses and also their dependants. In all walks of life, spouses or partners is play a very important role. The spouses and partners of ADF members and their dependants have to give so much more, just because of the very nature of the work that the ADF member does. Without the support of their spouses or partners, many ADF members would not stay in the role or even initially be drawn to the role of being an ADF member. The commitment and sacrifices made by families of ADF members are ones we will never know, unless we have had the fortunate experience of serving our country. As the member for Fadden said expense of when he tabled his bill: a They are the ones who so often experience the greater hardships, greater stresses, constant rotations, in many cases constant deployments and certainly constant training schedules. They are the ones who know so many sacrifices that so few of us ever will. As has been mentioned by previous speakers, this bill is designed to assist lateral transfer members who are members of the ADF and have gained entry based on prior experience in foreign defence forces. The various countries from which lateral transfer members arrive are South Africa, New Zealand, the United States and the United Kingdom. The majority of lateral transfer members have come from the United Kingdom's Royal Navy, Royal Marines, army or Air Force, and we welcome those transferees to our ADF. They save our country many, many dollars by bring their particular skills learned in different countries. Also the ADF has a need to fill capability gaps in our armed forces and, therefore, those lateral transferees bringing the necessary skills and experience from their overseas forces help improve our ADF's capability while also improving the understanding of critical issues around the globe. The ADF has a long and proud history of recruiting members from the armed forces of other countries. The purpose of this bill is to enable the spouses and dependants of ADF lateral transfer members-those serving members from other countries' militaries who seek to come and serve under our country's flag-to gain Australian citizenship at the same time as their serving ADF member. For a lateral transfer member to take up a position with the ADF and move to Australia, they are legally required to qualify for permanent residency visas, and this is necessary because all ADF members are required to be Australian citizens. Ninety per cent of ADF lateral transfer members have families that they bring to Australia with them, and this bill is about affording them not just permanent residency but also citizenship, which will confer on them the same status as their serving ADF partner or spouse who has come to Australia as a lateral transfer member. Again, I quote the member for Fadden's speech on his private member's bill: It is the right and fair thing to do. It is just. It honours those who honour us. ADF lateral transfers are members who have served in another nation's military and have subsequently moved to Australia to serve in our Australian Defence Force. When a soldier moves to Australia to serve in the ADF, they and their families are making an ongoing commitment to Australia. They are making a commitment to what this country stands for. Assisting them to additionally become citizens is also the beginning of a formal membership of the Australian community for these servicemen and their families. That is a step that will enable them to not just support our Defence Force personnel but to say, 'I am Australian.' Australia's culture and our laws have been shaped by our history. By enabling them to become citizens we are allowing these servicemen and their families to inherit this history and to be in a position to be a part of it. We are allowing them not just to enjoy the benefits of our free and democratic country but to further contribute to it. There are many benefits of citizenship. Once citizens, these servicemen and their families gain the right to vote in federal and state or territory elections and in a referendum once of legal age. They will gain the benefit of being able to apply for work in the Australian Public Service, to apply for an Australian passport and re-enter Australia freely, to receive help from Australian officials while overseas and even to seek election to parliament. Becoming an Australian citizen is a great privilege and one that, as this bill promotes, should be extended to the spouses and families of those servicemen. If we look at 21(2)(c) and section 23 of the Australian Citizenship Act 2007, the early citizenship provisions do not include the spouse or partner of an ADF member, nor do they include dependants aged 16 years or over. An ADF lateral transfer member or a permanent resident may be granted citizenship after completing 90 days permanent service in the ADF, or 180 days in the reserve, and it is these provisions that this bill seeks to pass on to the spouses, partners and dependents of the transferees. We do it only where it suits the parent country. For example, the Royal Australian Navy is presently taking advantage of the United Kingdom's strategic defence and security review which is, amongst other things, reducing the number of personnel across the UK's four services. It is in the context of this move by the Cameron government that the Royal Australian Navy is increasing its recruitment of Royal Navy personnel in order to fill the capability gaps within our own ranks. It could take over a decade to recruit, train and skill engineers, pilots or other personnel with exceptionally high levels of skill. Having these personnel with these skills transfer from other militaries into ours saves the Commonwealth enormous time and enormous money. The ADF is presently looking to recruit, on their own numbers, approximately 300 lateral transfer personnel each year. As I have said, under the Australian Citizenship Act a permanent resident may be granted citizenship after completing the 90 days service. The legislation in its current form can and does cause discord within lateral transfer members' families. Australia currently has ADF lateral transfer members deployed on combat operations. One of the issues that can arise is that if a member is killed in training or in operations, there is legislative basis or guarantee that their spouse or dependants will be able to stay in Australia or have access to the benefits normally payable to the spouse and dependants of an ADF member. I note the government has made assurances that support should be provided; however, this is little comfort to the families and dependants. There is no reason why such assurances should not be put in legislation. The bill will provide certainty to those families considering a lateral transfer to the ADF and it will aid the ADF in its recruitment efforts. It will give peace of mind to the 300 lateral recruits and their families who will be anticipating the transfer to Australia in the next 12 months. There are also issues for dependants. Whilst currently they gain permanent residency, without citizenship they miss out on important benefits, such as university HELP based placements. This can lead to financial strain on families and makes the transfer to the ADF less attractive for those important recruits. The bill removes provisions in the Australian Citizenship Act 2007 that result in citizenship being granted to ADF members years in advance of their partner and dependants over certain ages. Behind every serving member is a support network. If we want these individuals to join the ADF we need to support these networks, whether they are a family, a spouse or a dependant. Family members of ADF personnel are the ones who, ultimately, offer the greatest support to those serving ADF personnel. Family members also experience the stresses and hardships associated with the role. This bill seeks to achieve that support, by removing discrimination and treating family members equally. As I noted earlier today, the coalition introduced its bill on 21 May 2012. Labor no introduced its near identical bill on 22 May 2012, despite saying in 2011 that it did not support the fast-tracking of citizenship for defence families. Labor made the decision to avoid a vote on the coalition bill by introducing a near carbon copy of the coalition's bill. Previous speakers have also pointed to the fact that the bill currently before the House is an almost exact copy of the coalition's bill introduced on 21 May. I will be supporting the bill, and I note the bill does propose some good changes, but those changes could easily have been introduced as amendments to the coalition's bill, rather than the government playing political games and introducing its own bill-when the government rejected these changes only last year. The reality is, Labor has done nothing over the past four years and now, suddenly, when the coalition puts up the bill, Labor decides within 24 hours it is time to act. It appears to be a case of more spin from a government motivated purely by political survival rather than by a concern for the welfare of these families. The minister should apologise to the affected families for ignoring the need to act and then, instead of supporting the coalition's bill, resorting to political games. Given the actions of the minister and the government, you cannot help but question the motives of the government. But, as the member for Scullin said, we should now move on from there and celebrate the fact that this has bipartisan support. This legislation will provide families with peace of mind. It is a policy wholly welcomed by Defence Families of Australia, which has been lobbying the government on this issue since 2010. DFA should be congratulated on its wonderful advocacy on behalf of these families on a wide range of issues ranging from defence housing to spousal support. It has been strong advocates for fixing the inequality for families of ADF lateral transfer members. I thank Defence Families of Australia for its ongoing advocacy and support of the ADF personnel. It does great work. Along with the coalition, I support this bill.",152
167,Mr ALEXANDER,BILLS," Again we find ourselves in this position. The coalition, with the limited resources we have in opposition, identify a policy gap that the government refuses to address. We develop a bill and present it to parliament. The government reject the bill purely because they did not think of it themselves and because they could not possibly support something that comes from the coalition. Then the government introduces an imitation bill because it actually was a good idea in the first place. We saw this earlier in the year with the Assisting Victims of Overseas Terrorism Bill introduced by the Leader of the Opposition, which was not worthy of government support. It was retitled to the Social Security Amendment (Supporting Australian Victims of Terrorism Overseas) Bill and, suddenly, it was a government-led initiative. Too many times to count, in this parliament the coalition have suggested variations to government bills through the proper process-we write an amendment and submit it during the second reading. Mostly these amendments are rejected by the government, but most observers would surely think that all legislators have since learned that the most suitable way to progress is to make an amendment to a bill, not to rewrite it from scratch. The Australian Citizenship Amendment (Defence Service Requirement) Bill, introduced by my colleague the member for Fadden, is a good bill supporting good policy. Yet the government have stated they cannot support it, instead choosing to introduce this, the Australian Citizenship Amendment (Defence Families) Bill 2012, because of a key difference: a definition. I quote the second reading speech of the government's first speaker on the original bill, the member for Chifley: The government's main reason for opposing this bill is that the bill's definition of a 'family unit' much more narrow in scope than that in the government's bill. And yet, for the sake of a definition, we need a new bill. A cynic might think the government is actually playing politics with this issue; somebody who is not a cynic might think the same. The coalition will support this government bill because it is good policy. We support all good policy. As a matter of fact, last year the coalition supported 87 per cent of the legislation submitted to the House by the government. As opposition it is our job to identify bad policy and to oppose it, as we did for the other 13 per cent of the time. On the other side of the scale, when the government have agreed with a coalition initiative so expressly they want to attach their own name to the policy, they have still voted against the coalition policy every single time. The reason I am harping on this issue is that these figures, and the reality of actions in this parliament, show that it is the government which always say no. They often accuse us of relentless negativity. They use this term incessantly, obviously thinking that if they say it often enough people will start believing it. Yet, whilst they are spending all their time attacking us, we are identifying policy gaps and writing new pieces of legislation. The great irony of this bill is that not only did the government do nothing on this issue for four years but, when the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel wrote to the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship suggesting this exact change in November 2010, Minister Bowen wrote back on 11 February 2011: 'I do not consider it necessary to amend the citizenship legislation.' It seems it was only when the coalition's shadow minister for defence science and personnel wrote his private member's bill that Minister Bowen suddenly is realised that if the coalition is suggesting it then it must be a good idea-and here we are back again. This bill highlights the coalition's strong support not only for our ADF personnel but also for their families. Spouses and dependants of ADF members make just as many sacrifices for our nation as the members themselves. They experience the hardships, the constant rotations and deployments and the stresses placed on ADF families. This bill supports the families of lateral transfer members who have chosen to help defend our nation, bringing unique skills and experience. The ADF has a long and strong record of recruiting lateral transfer members, as is currently happening in response to the UK's Strategic Defence and Security Review, which is reducing the number of personnel, providing the Royal Australian Navy with a great opportunity to fill capability gaps within its own ranks. The net benefit that Australia gains from lateral transfer recruitment and the associated savings in training costs far exceed the short-term costs of fast-tracking the citizenship status of the spouse and dependants. Ninety per cent of ADF lateral transfer members have families who they bring with them to Australia, and it is timely to ensure that the families of those willing to serve Australia in the ADF are provided the same citizenship status as the serving member. I note that both the coalition's and the government's bills include the support of Defence Families Australia. A new development by Defence Housing Australia in the suburb of Ermington, in my electorate of Bennelong, will provide a lot of housing for defence families, and our local community warmly looks forward to their arrival. We look forward to the families in this new community that have joined our nation through the lateral transfers scheme being provided with fast-tracked access to citizenship and all the rights and protections shared by other family members of ADF personnel as their loved ones serve overseas in the defence of our nation. I applaud the government for this bill. The process to get here may have been purely political, but the end result is a good policy written by the coalition to which the government are affixing their label. There is an old saying that imitation is the most sincere form of flattery. This bill, just like the Assisting Victims of Overseas Terrorism Bill I mentioned earlier, must make the coalition blush. We often get attacked by the government with the claim that we are not announcing all our policies. This bill highlights the real reason why-the government are so busy attacking us that they are stumped for ideas and they want to steal more from the coalition. Many commentators have referred to the very effective tactics of the member for Griffith in the lead-up to the 2007 election copying Prime Minister Howard's policies. Some even referred to him as 'Howard Lite', but felt this tactic was somewhat justified due to the minimal resources afforded to opposition members in comparison to the huge government bureaucracies. Now it seems they are back to the same old tricks, but this time from government they are copying the coalition in opposition. I thought I had seen it all. I commend the coalition's policies and this bill to the House.",156
168,Mr FRYDENBERG,BILLS," I rise to speak on the Australian Citizenship Amendment (Defence Families) Bill 2012 and in doing so support many of my colleagues in this House, including the last speaker, the member for Bennelong. This bill will amend the Australian Citizenship Act 2007 to fast-track citizenship for family members of defence personnel who are lateral recruits to the Australian Defence Force. As the law currently stands, a member of the Australian Defence Force and their children under the age of 16 years can apply for citizenship after that member has completed 90 days of service in the permanent forces or six months in the reserves. Family members who do not fall within this category, including children who are over the age of 16 years, have to wait for at least four years before applying for citizenship. They can get permanent residency but not citizenship. However, under the changes being proposed in this legislation, spouses and dependants will be deemed eligible to apply for citizenship after 90 days of the ADF member's service, which could be the equivalent of 90 days of paid service in the reserves, not the 180-day requirement as currently stands. There is a strong rationale for this bill. The Australian Defence Force already in recruits up to about 300 defence personnel from abroad coming from a range of countries that includes New Zealand, the United Kingdom, South Africa and the United States. Often these recruits come to Australia with the support of their original country. Importantly, 90 per cent of these lateral recruits have families and bring them with them. These lateral recruits fill important capability gaps in our service. We are providing them with a job in our first class Australian Defence Force, and in return Australia gets a skilled and highly trained military person who adds to our country's defence force's professionalism and skill set. It is in reality a win-win for both sides. This legislative change before the House tonight enhances the Australian Defence Force's ability to recruit the best on offer. It also recognises that we support not just the ADF personnel themselves but their families as well-the ones who provide the support, who live with the hardships while the Defence Force members are away and whose sacrifice is not necessarily with their own lives but often with their livelihoods, which are interrupted significantly by long periods away for ADF personnel. Be under no illusions; we need these lateral recruits. If one goes to the Army's online recruitment centre, as I did prior to coming into this House, there is a section for overseas applicants where it lists the positions for which the Australian Defence Force is looking for officers and soldiers. Applications, ironically, closed on 15 June this year, which has just gone, but there is a long list of positions for which the Australian Defence Force is seeking commissioned officers. It includes, in aviation, rotary wing pilots; in artillery, officers with surveillance and target acquisition and offensive support specialisation; in dental, specialised officers who are qualified dentists; in the nursing corps, qualified nurses; in engineering, aeronautical, electrical and mechanical engineers; in the intelligence corps, qualified intelligence corps officers; in transport, officers with amphibious experience in particular; in ordnance, logistics officers; in military police, qualified military police officers; in signals, officers with electronic warfare or cyberwarfare experience; and the list goes on. This shows the capability gaps which we need filled. This legislation cannot wait, as the opportunities to recruit these laterals and take advantage of, for example, what is happening in the United Kingdom with their significant reduction in military personnel numbers, is right now. In fact, if we act now and lift the incentives for the best and the brightest from overseas to come to our defence forces, we stand best positioned to meet some of these strategic challenges ahead. I remember my trip to Afghanistan last year to meet with some of the more than 1,500 men and women of the Australian Defence Force who are serving our country so bravely in that difficult warzone. I heard from both Australian soldiers and some British troops about the significant changes taking place in the UK military scene, where tough economic conditions had led to a reassessment of priorities by government there and a number of senior military personnel were going to be without jobs. It is also important to note that, for every one of these lateral recruits that Australia does attract, we do save some of the financial expense that otherwise would have been incurred in training that person up. For example, a fully trained pilot will cost the taxpayer between $1½ million and $2 million. Should you be able to recruit somebody with that skill set, you are saving the taxpayer an equivalent amount. One of the other important flow-on effects from this legislation is that it helps mitigate the likelihood of, in the terrible event that an ADF member is killed, the dependants being unable to stay in Australia or access benefits because they are not citizens-benefits that may otherwise be payable to an Australian spouse. Now we have lateral recruits who are serving in ADF combat operations in Afghanistan. It is personnel like these whose spouses and family members will get real benefit from this legislation, because fasttracking citizenship for them could mean that they are also going to be able to access benefits which otherwise might not be available. I want to say that this legislation introduced by the government is virtually identical to that which was introduced by my friend and colleague the coalition shadow minister, the member for Fadden. He took the initiative when the government did not. He got the support of Defence Families of Australia. He advocated for change because he was in touch with the needs of Australian defence personnel and their families. His bill was introduced first and the government shamelessly followed. I do welcome the government's bill before the House tonight, but I acknowledge that it took them a long time to change heart. In fact, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Chris Bowen, in a letter dated 4 February 2011, specifically rebuffed the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Warren Snowdon, on this point when he said, 'I do not consider it necessary to amend the citizenship legislation.' Now we have the government backflipping yet again-and don't we get used to it. However, this time, fortunately, it is in pursuit of a good cause, and I support the bill before the House. But I acknowledge that it was the member for Fadden and our shadow minister in this portfolio who took the initiative, who led the charge and who shone a light on this government's deficiencies. It is because of his effort that the government has followed with its own bill, and it is because of his effort that we are now seeing a change for the better for the Defence Families of Australia, who deserve our support. The world is unstable. We are seeing the economic crisis in Europe. We are seeing the United States in an election year galvanised by $14 trillion of debt. We are seeing a rising China, a rising India, and we are seeing tensions in our own region in the South China Sea which is leading to some countries-Vietnam, the Philippines, Singapore and others-balancing against what they see as an increased power play by China. In fact, we in Australia have seen that the US Marines are going to rotate through Darwin and perhaps elsewhere. They are all significant changes that reflect the sense of instability in our region. During this period of instability there is no more important Australian institution than our Defence Force. The men and women of our Australian Defence Force are our last line of defence. They uphold our values and help ensure that the world and our region is a better place. That has been the role played for more than a century by our Australian Defence Force. That is why it is unconscionable that so much of the defence budget has been ripped out by this government. According to ASPI, it has been more than $20 billion in the last few years alone. Mr Sidebottom interjecting",158
169,Mr FRYDENBERG,BILLS,It is not a laughing matter. Mr MCCormack interjecting,160
170,Mr FRYDENBERG,BILLS,Yes.,160
171,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS," The member for Riverina, the member for Kooyong has the call.",160
172,Mr FRYDENBERG,BILLS,"It is not a laughing matter, as Sid Sidebottom is having",160
173,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS,The member for Kooyong will refer to members by their title or their electorate.,160
174,Mr FRYDENBERG,BILLS,"The member for Braddon, may I say, from Tasmania. Can I say that he should not be laughing at what is a very serious point, which is actually this government's undermining of defence. I want to finish here, because we are talking about a bill which will enhance Australia's strategic depth and ensure that we can continue to attract the best and brightest from overseas. That is what this bill is about. I commend this bill, but I acknowledge that it is in the context of following the initiative of the member for Fadden and it is in the context of this government ripping billions of dollars out of a crucial defence budget at a time when our region is unstable and when we are seeing heightened tensions. I do support this bill. I think that giving lateral recruits fast access to citizenship for their families, for their spouses, for their dependents and for their children over the age of 16 is a very positive initiative. With 300-plus lateral recruits coming to this country every year, absolutely critical positions, as I outlined, in aviation, in the nursing corps, in engineers, in the intelligence corps, in ordnance, in military police, in signals, in artillery and in a lot more of these critical areas, enhancing these lateral recruits' and their families' ability to access citizenship is a positive development. But I say to this government, 'Don't play the politics of defence', because in this climate our Australian Defence Force deserve all the moral and financial support that this parliament can muster. I pay tribute to the legacy of the Howard government in defence and to the efforts of my colleague the member for Fadden in taking the initiative on this bill.",160
175,Mr MCCORMACK,BILLS," Australian Defence Force personnel play an important role, whether they are contributing to the rebuilding of Iraq, partaking in various United Nations peacekeeping operations or involved in multinational exercises within Australia or overseas. However, it is not just our military men and women who are serving our nation. So too are the spouses and partners of Australian Defence Force personnel and their dependants. The families of military personnel are their great enablers, their devoted supporters and play the largest role in influencing whether someone remains a member of the Defence Force. The families are also the ones who experience the reality of living with a member of the Defence Force. As their partner is moved around the country and the world to different rotations and deployment, they too get moved around and shuffled about. Many a Defence Force family has superb skills at packing and starting life again in a new town.",161
176,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, Order! The debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 34. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting and the member for Riverina will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS Army Reserve Bands,161
177,Mr RUDDOCK,BILLS," I move: That this House: (1) recognises that: (a) the band of the Royal New South Wales Lancers, based in Parramatta, makes a significant contribution to the local community; (b) similar Army Reserve Bands across Australia make significant contributions to their local communities; (c) these bands provide a key link between communities and the Australian Defence Force in this time of high operational tempo; (d) the recent Government decision, as part of the Strategic Reform Program, to remove financial support for these bands places the onus for support on regimental associations; and (e) such associations consist largely of retired veterans without the financial resources to provide such support; and (2) calls upon the Government to continue support for Army Reserve Bands, thus ensuring these key links with the local community are not lost. I would like to take a moment or two to say something of the 1st/15th Royal New South Wales Lancers. It is the oldest cavalry regiment in Australia. It was established on 3 January 1885. It is a regiment that has had troops deployed in South Africa at Federation. It took its name in 1956 when the 1st Royal New South Wales Lancers and the 15th Northern Rivers Lancers amalgamated. It carries battle honours of a number of former regiments, to a total of 31, from the Boer War, the First World War and the Second World War. Highlights include Gaza-Beersheba, the defence of ANZAC, Jordan, New Guinea, Wareo-Lakona, Gusika, Borneo, Balikpapan, Solomon Islands, South Africa, Egypt, Damascus, Stockton Bight and the Solomon Islands again. It is a regiment that has contributed troops as groups and individuals to many contemporary operations undertaken by the Australian Defence Force. It has very distinguished leadership and I acknowledge particularly its most recent honorary colonel, Lieutenant Colonel Warren Glenny, who was the General of the Army Reserve for Australia. The band of this particular regiment has been part of the Lancers almost from the beginning and was established in 1888. From its earliest days it struggled with financial survival, being forced from 1891 to undertake fundraising to purchase instruments due to the inadequate support from the General Officer Commanding, New South Wales. In 1897, the band was transferred to Parramatta and was located in the historic Lancer Barracks, which were built in 1819 under the instructions of the then Governor Lachlan Macquarie. They remain there today as the longest continually occupied military post in Australia. The band has been involved in the Commonwealth of Australia inauguration ceremonies in 1901, leading a section of the parade through Sydney. The following day, with 21 other bands, it participated in the Commonwealth Inauguration Tattoo. This event, with an attendance of over 30,000 people, was the largest attendance at any gathering in Australia to that point in time. On 12 March 1913 it played at the Canberra foundation ceremony. In 1921 it commenced the annual participation in the ANZAC Day march through Sydney, and this year on ANZAC Day I remember the band of the 1st/15th Royal New South Wales lancers playing and leading a significant part of that ceremonial parade. It played at the formal opening of the parliament following the accession of King George VI in 1922. On 18 October 1959 it led the regiment to receive the freedom of entry to the City of Parramatta. During the centenary of the regiment in 1985 it led the regiment to receive the freedom of entry to the City of Sydney. This band has been extraordinary. It has provided support to events across the local community, such as the Westmead Children's Hospital Bandaged Bear Ball, Floriade in Canberra, the Australia Day citizenship ceremonies at Parramatta, regimental dinners-I note the member for Parramatta is here; she and I attended the most recent regimental dinner, where again the band was playing. It has provided buglers for the local RSL ANZAC Day services, the ANZAC Day march in Sydney, the Reserve Forces Day 2011, the Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia Vietnam Veterans' Day 2011, the Battle of Crete service at the Sydney Cenotaph, the Manly Jazz Festival, and buglers for funerals of veterans. It is a vital link between the community and the military, and so at this important time of ongoing operations, when one is seeking to get people to support the military, when one is seeking to recruit people for the reserves, this is the visible face that people see and can relate to. To constrain it is, in my view, quite inappropriate at this time. The band is a reminder of the proud and long standing military history and record of service of a very fine regiment. So I want to speak about the funding cancellation. A minute on 24 August last year directed that ongoing support for bands in respect of replacement and repair of instruments and ceremonial uniforms would be withdrawn from most regimental bands. When I think of the size of the defence budget-and I know that there is a need for savings-I find it extraordinary that the savings are being made in relation to the replacement of instruments and ceremonial uniforms. I find that absolutely extraordinary. This band has enormous local support. I have no doubt that the 1st/15th Royal New South Wales Lancers Association will provide support for their band, but it needs be recognised that that will come from the pockets of retirees, many of whom are superannuants and whose savings are dwindling. Such spending also reduces the support the association can give to their activities-in the case of the 1st/15th Royal New South Wales Lancers, the fundraising for their museum and community activities in which they are engaged. Regimental bands support communities and they bind communities to the military. It is very important when troops are serving overseas-in Afghanistan and elsewherethat that support is forthcoming. Given that there are very few military units now based in Sydney-and there are not many Army Reserve units-bands are even more important than ever in bringing the community and the ADF closer together. The lancers recently deployed a squadron minus to the Solomon Islands, demonstrating an ongoing commitment to service. The cancellation of support for the Army Reserve bands comes with a budget that has cut defence spending dramatically, as I have mentioned. Ongoing efforts by Labor have seen, I think, unfortunately, a steady withdrawal of support for the Army reserves. It has been cloaked as a strategic reform program, but it aims to pick off what I would call low-hanging fruit to make quick savings-low-hanging fruit like stopping reservists being paid for attending ANZAC Day ceremonies in 2010; low-hanging fruit like reservist funding, such that the Army Reserve can no longer meet their full training and development needs for anything other than high-priority tasks; and low-hanging fruit like support for Army Reserve bands, like that of the lancers. As you would know, there is no higher priority that the coalition has than the defence and security of Australia and its to people. But targeting organisations like Army Reserve bands is, in my view, a very seriously misguided saving. It is a saving that will separate the community from the military. It is a saving that puts the onus for other support on a bunch of superannuated veterans and ex-servicemen. It is a saving that hits communities as much as it hits the motivated reservists who form part of the bands. Specific funding allocated to ADF reservists is now insufficient to meet their training and development needs for anything other than high-priority tasks. This motion deserves to be passed vigorously, and I hope the military brass are hearing what I hope will be support from both sides of the House. (Time expired)",161
178,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, Order! Is the motion seconded?,163
179,Mr Robert,BILLS,"I second the motion and reserve my right to speak, to allow the member for Canberra to speak and provide some appalling response from the government.",163
180,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS,"The member for Fadden will resume his seat. I, as the occupier of this chair, will decide who is the next speaker, not the member for Fadden. The question is that the motion be agreed to. I now call the member for Canberra.",163
181,Ms BRODTMANN,BILLS," I applaud the member for Berowra for his commitment to the musical life of the military, but I rise to speak against this motion tonight because it is unnecessary and it is somewhat confused. I attend many, many defence events in the course of my job as the member for Canberra. At all of those events there is always a very strong musical presence. One of the highlights of my time in Canberra was going to Beating the Retreat at Duntroon-on a freezing cold night, from memory. It was an absolute highlight. There is a very strong musical tradition in the military, and I applaud the member for Berowra for raising our awareness on that, but I do rise to speak against this motion tonight. I am not supporting this motion for the following reasons. The current draft of the private member's bill refers incorrectly to regimental bands as reserve bands. It refers specifically to the Royal New South Wales Lancers Band and similar bands. Such bands are in fact regimental bands, yet this motion calls on the government to continue to support Army Reserve bands. The government actually already supports reserve bands and will continue to do so. At present, the government supports six regional reserve bands and more than 20 Army Reserve personnel who work in four Army support bands. These personnel and bands are part of the Australian Army Band Corps. The matter of support raised in this motion by the member for Berowra is actually an administrative matter. What is more concerning is that this motion proposes to interfere with and reverse a decision the Chief of Army. I will go into more detail about these issues shortly but, before I do so, I would just like to talk a bit more about the current band structure in the Australian Army. As the member for Canberra, I am very appreciative of the role our Army bands play in our national discourse. The band of the Military College, Duntroon-often referred to as the RMC band or the Duntroon bandis based here in Canberra. The band is a respected and important part of Canberra's cultural life and is often called on to play at important events and ceremonies. So for me this is a pertinent issue. There are two broad categories or divisions of bands in the Australian Army. The first category is the Australian Army Band Corps, which is composed of musically trained reserve and permanent personnel and was established to provide a musical service to the Army and the broader community. Our Australian Army Band Corps plays an important role. It provides music for ceremonial and training activities conducted by the Army and other services of the ADF. It provides music for ceremonial activities, including for royal and vice-regal events and federal, state and territory and local government agencies. It enhances morale and esprit de corps through entertainment for Army personnel in barracks and those deployed on operations or exercises and supporting civil affairs and psychological operations. It contributes to the attraction of quality recruits to the Army and-this is really important-it promotes the public image of the Army through musical performance. The Australian Army Band Corps is organised as follows: it has one Army band of 43 Australian Regular Army musicians; four Army support bands of 22 Australian taken by Regular Army musicians and 21 Army Reserve musicians; six regional Army Reserve bands of 40 Army Reserve musicians and three Australian Regular Army staff; a Defence Force School of Music-I have been to that school and met many of the players there-with 11 regular Australian Army staff; and a Director of Music Army with six staff. This structure is based on a 43-piece Australian Regular Army band in Canberra, the Royal Military College Band, and Army support bands each consisting of 22 Australian Regular Army personnel located proximate to formations in Townsville, in Brisbane, in Sydney and in Wagga Wagga. Each Army support band will hold an Army Reserve establishment of 21 in addition to the Australian Regular Army element. Regional Army Reserve bands consisting of 40 Army Reserve and three Australian Regular Army staff will be located in Melbourne, Adelaide, Hobart, Newcastle, Perth and Darwin. Perth and Newcastle will contain an Army Reserve pipes and drums component. The second category refers to the regimental bands, which are composed of volunteers and are established to provide musical services primarily for a specific or regiment. As I mentioned before, the Royal New South Wales Lancers, referred to by the member for Berowra, is an established regimental band. Regimental bands are staffed by volunteers from both permanent and part-time Army personnel from the parent regiment. The members of these bands are already employed by the Army in other roles. For example, if they are employed by the army as a cook, they may volunteer to play in the regimental band. The motion we are debating here claims that associations like the Royal New South Wales Lancers are a reservist band. They are in fact a regimental band. The member also suggested that they consist largely of retired veterans without the financial resources to provide support. This is also incorrect. The Gillard government already supports Reserve bands and will continue to do so. As I said before, the Gillard government supports six regional Reserve bands and over 20 Army Reserve personnel who work in four Army support bands. These personnel and bands are part of the Australian Army Band Corps. As I also mentioned earlier, following a review into Army bands in May 2011, a decision was made by the Chief of Army to transfer the resourcing of regimental bands from the Commonwealth to the associated regimental associations. This decision by the Chief of Army is an administrative matter that is delegated to the Chief of Army pursuant to the Defence Act 1903. Therefore, the member's motion proposes to interfere with a decision by the Chief of Army. As I understand it, these resourcing changes were necessary to ensure Army's dedicated musical capability could be sustained in the long term. To ensure that resources were focused on Army's dedicated musical capability, voluntary bands such as the regimental bands were given the responsibility to repair or replace musical unit instruments, uniforms and other equipment. The Chief of Army made a decision to no longer replace the musical instruments, uniforms and other equipment held by the voluntary regimental bands in order to prioritise financial support to the dedicated members and bands of the Australian Army Band Corps. This decision was made to ensure the long-term sustainability of the Australian Army Band Corps. This decision was made with fiscal responsibility in mind as well as a determination to see the history and culture of our Australian Army bands continue. Members of the Royal New South Wales Lancers in Parramatta who are listed in the private member's motion, will be offered part-time positions with the Australian Army Band Sydney, which is an Australian Army Band Corps band funded by Army. The Australian Army does not plan to disestablish regimental bands. Regimental bands will retain their current musical instruments and uniforms. All Army Reserve members who are currently volunteering in regimental bands such as the Royal New South Wales Lancers and who are qualified as Army musicians will be given the option of transferring to an Australian Army Band Corps band. It is important to note that the regimental bands reflect the heritage of various units and corps and perform duties primarily for their own regiment, which is why the responsibility should lie with the unit. Ultimately this is an administrative matter which is delegated to the Chief of Army. I can appreciate the importance of our Army bands and I agree with the member for Berowra that they are incredibly important to the life of the military, to the culture of military and also to the culture of communities such as Canberra. They are steeped in history and they are important to our national character, but this motion is simply unwarranted and unnecessary.",164
182,Mr ROBERT,BILLS," I rise to support my colleague the honourable member for Berowra's motion and am happy to speak in support of it. The member for Berowra has given a very good account of the problems facing regimental bands-in this case the Royal New South Wales Lancers based in Parramatta. Whilst the member for Canberra has so eloquently gone through the issues of the Australian Army Band Corps and its history, she had the effrontery-the blatant audacity-to say that this $2 million saving was about fiscal responsibility. She said fiscal responsibility, after this government has just gutted the Defence Force to the tune of $5½ billion. Since 2008, the cuts, deferments and imposition on absorbed costs have resulted in over $20 billion being ripped out of Defence to hollow it out. You come in here, Member for Canberra, and talk about fiscal responsibility for $2 million from 14 regimental bands and you expect me to take you seriously. Well, ma'am, with the good grace that I have and as good a member of parliament that you may well be, I find that comment outrageous in the extreme. On 24 August last year the Army, in response to the government's dubious strategic reform program, issued a directive to withdraw support from 14 regimental bands. It was an arbitrary decision-another example where the government failed to consult with the senior staff of the military. The policy has resulted in the Army withdrawing all instruments from these regimental bands, in effect passing the cost of instruments, uniforms and the like onto regimental associations. Why? For that fiscal the responsibility, Member for Canberra: to save $2 million while your party and government gutted $20 billion. Let's put that in context: $2 million versus your $20 billion gutting. And you speak of fiscal responsibility-a drop in the ocean that is nothing short of outrageous, especially when you spend $30 million advertising your carbon tax and you cannot even say the term 'carbon tax.'",166
183,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS," Member for Fadden, I am reluctant to interrupt in the given time, but you are referring to 'you', being the occupier of this chair. I would ask",166
184,Mr ROBERT,BILLS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I apologise for my youthful exuberance and the word 'you'-but there is a public outrage at the cuts that our Defence Force is going through. The member for Canberra tells me that this wasn't the government's decision; this was General Morrison. General Morrison issued this decision, yet after the public outrage this punitive policy was fiddled, it was changed. The Sydney Morning Herald on 1 October 2001 said that the 14 regimental bands will be allowed to keep their existing instruments but will not be provided any support to maintain those instruments or to purchase new instruments. So, Member for Canberra, what you are saying is that the Chief of Army made this decision and then, after this great public outcry, General Morrison-a man I know well and a man not prone to changing his mind easily, may I say-suddenly changed his mind without any instruction from the minister and without any political engagement or fiddling at all. May I suggest this is what happened, Member for Canberra: that the government, under its strategic reform program, has forced the Army into a range of dreadful cuts, as it is doing right now. After the great outrage, could the minister have said: 'Oh, Chief, this is not going well; could we make a little bit of a change here'? Do you think that could have happened, Member for Canberra, or do you think the Chief of Army simply changed his mind because this was an administrative decision of the Army and nothing to do with the government of the day? If you are suggesting that, I find that hardly credible and I struggle to believe it. The member for Berowra has quite rightly noted that Labor's mean-spirited policy will put significant financial strain on Army reservists and their regimental associations connected with them. These associations so often made up of ex-regimental membersand I can attest to that from personal experience-are 100 per cent committed to their units-100 per cent committed to their communities and the units they serve with. The motion simply asked for a little bit goodwill. For all the fiscal responsibilities you talk about, how about community responsibility? How about responsibility for the unique nature of military service? But, then again, you will not index DFRDB pensions, so you are saying what your view of the unique nature of military service is. How about a bit of goodwill to assist 14 regimental bands, their associations and the communities that serve our nation? That would not go astray.",166
185,Ms OWENS,BILLS," With some regret, I have to say that I also cannot support this motion, because it is not really the parliament's role to look at the expenditure decisions of the Chief of Army and pick and choose which ones we as a parliament would have changed. It is just not our role to do that. This is a decision that the Chief of Army has made. The reason why I say it is with some regret is that I know the Army Band Corps very well. My father was in the 1st Military District Band for 20 years and won an Order of Australia for his services to the military as a musician in the army bands. It is a sound I know well. I was raised with it. I spent a lot of time in Enoggera. I spent a lot of time watching parades and listening to my father. I understand the extraordinary contribution that the army bands have made not just to the community but to the broader community by the provision of those full-time positions throughout our community and the support that those positions give to teaching, to part-time musicians that work in clubs in various bands. The effect of those full-time positions and the quality of that work feeds out to the music industry generally, so it has a double purpose. I am delighted to see in the decision that the Army made an absolute strong commitment to the maintenance of that professional band corps through the Army of band in Canberra, the four army support bands, the six regional Army Reserve bands and also the Defence Force School of Music. There is in its decision an extraordinary commitment to maintaining those professional bands both full-time Army and Reserve bands. I would say this as an observer to both Army and the regiment: bands like the lancers are very much a part of our community. It is the oldest surviving regimental band in Australia. It was formed in 1888. It is one of three bands in Parramatta that are over 100 years old. We also have the Parramatta City Brass band, which celebrated its 100th last year, and the Parramatta Citadel Band from the Salvation Army, which is also over 100 years old. We have three in Parramatta, but the lancers is associated with the oldest functioning barracks and the most decorated regiment, which was formed for the Boer War. It has this history which we in Parramatta take on as very much a part of our own-an extraordinary barracks because of the nature of its buildings and the nature of its history. It is where our men and women enlisted for the first and second world wars. It is an extraordinary place. The member for Berowra is incorrect in referring to them as superannuates and retirees. They are actually not; they are reservists and soldiers who have other jobs in the Army and do this on a part-time basis in their spare time. It would be reasonable, I would think, for a clarinettist always to provide their own clarinet and a trumpet player to provide their own trumpet-as they do in every band, by the way. The drums and the instruments, on the other hand, are a slightly different matter and are really quite expensive. So this will provide a difficulty for bands like the lancers and it would be quite tragic if in the course of time we saw these bands, particularly a band like this one with its extraordinary history, substantially weakened or disappearing. I would hope that in the transition period we are quite sensitive to the needs of these bands. Mind you, I am talking for the one I know; I am sure there will be other communities around Australia that will talk for their regimental bands as the well in exactly the same terms as I do. Once again, I do not criticise the Army for the decision it has had to make because I do not know of the other decisions it has had to make. This is one of a suite of decisionsyou cannot look at one alone. But I would say again that bands like the Lancers, in the role they have had, carry an extraordinary part of our military history and the loss of even one of these bands would be a tragedy. It is going to be quite an interesting transition. I will be working with the band through that as best I can, but I have to support the Chief of Army in the suite of decisions he has had to make. Mrs PRENTICE (Ryan) (20:30): I rise to speak on this important motion from the member for Berowra regarding the Royal New South Wales Lancers from Parramatta. This motion notes that many Defence Force bands similar to the Lancers make a significant contribution to the local community, but their very existence is presently under threat due to the decision by this Labor government to cut funding. The Reserves are an integral component of Australia's Defence Force. Along with my coalition colleagues, including the member for Brisbane, I have long supported the unique skills that reservists bring to defence and I have always supported the important work they carry out in achieving the ADF's objectives both at home and abroad. Unfortunately, as a result of Labor's poor and reckless financial management of the country's budget, the government has decided to cut funding to the Department of Defence and, as the member for Berowra said, to the so-called low-hanging fruit of that department. An important consequence for the community of Labor's Strategic Reform Program, which is supposed to save $20 billion over 10 years, is that such lowhanging fruit consists of things like paying for training and development needs of sectors of the Defence Force which are not considered high priority. At the very time that Australia has a significant number of troops overseas-clearly our highest priority-it does not make sense to be cutting funding in this way. A lot of sensible and positive programs that are not related to direct combat will be cut but the coalition does not believe that their funding should be cut-not in the current context and not ever. Yet this Labor government has decided that the defence department does not matter to the extent that their budget, as a percentage of GDP, is less than 1.5 per cent-the lowest it has been since 1938. The May budget saw $5.5 billion of cuts to the Defence portfolio. I ask the question: was there a specific strategic justification these cuts? The answer is simple: of course not. Has the world become safer or changed so much in the last couple of years that a capable Defence Force is deemed completely unnecessary? Of course not. At the same time, have conditions changed to the extent that the service of reservists in Army bands is no longer required? Of course not. The Labor government has abandoned its commitment to the reserves to the extent that specific funding allocated to Australian Defence Force reservists is so insufficient that some reserve units are down to as low as 20 days training per annum. This is despite numerous parliamentary studies of the Reserves agreeing that for an effective reserve service there must be a minimum of approximately 30 training days per year. There are two main streams of Defence Force bands in the Brisbane area with which reservists assist. They are the regular Australian Army Band Brisbane and the Band of the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment which formed 58 years ago. The band of the RAR recently performed at the Ashgrove dawn service on ANZAC Day this year for the 42nd year in a row. Unfortunately it may be the case that they will not be able to perform for the 43rd year in a row. It might the case that, as the member for Berowra highlighted, there will be no buglers available to provide their services for the funeral of a veteran. At passing-out parades for diggers who have been deployed overseas to risk their lives for this country there will not be a band to welcome them home or to see them off. A worrying development occurred on 24 August 2011 when it was announced that, for those in regimental bands, ongoing support for replacement and repair of instruments and financial support for things like ceremonial uniforms will be withdrawn. This is a threat to the Defence Force and the for community. It is not trivial that these bands serve as an entertainment outlet for serving Australians both here and on overseas deployment; that they perform at Defence and government occasions; that they support the Defence Force's public and community relations events; or that they contribute to educational programs at schools and other charity organisations. I assure the Australian people that a re-elected coalition government will urgently seek to address the Gillard government's failure to properly support the ADF Reserves. I call on all members to support this motion.",167
186,Mr FITZGIBBON,BILLS," It is a great pleasure, Mr Deputy Speaker Murphy, to be addressing the parliament while you are in the chair. I begin my contribution by acknowledging what I am sure is a very genuine motion from the member for Berowra. I understand that he, like all of us in this place, appreciates the enormous contribution these people make through their participation in Defence bands and like organisations. They are invaluable to local communities; there is no doubt about that. I am a late entrant to this debate because realised about an hour ago that I might have caused this debate. It was me who, as then Minister for Defence, put in place the Strategic Reform Program and I suspect there may be, as other speakers have indicated, some link between the Strategic Reform Program and the Chief of Army's decision to curtail some of these activities. At the end of the day it is pretty simple: when I became defence minister we began, as we had committed to, the process of developing another Defence white paper. As we all know in this place, we live in an uncertain world in a region which is going through dynamic change, and no-one would contest the fact that, over time, as we continue to grow economically along with our near and not-so-near neighbours we will need to continue to develop Australia's defences in a way which allows us to continue our ability to defend ourselves independently of any other nation state. Any look at our strategic outlook indicates that, over time, we will need to continue to spend more money on high-end capability, whether it be on air warfare destroyers, fast jets or other capabilities. There is only so much money a country can contribute to defence as a percentage of its GDP and, on average, we are up there with many comparable countries. It became clear to me as defence minister that, given our strategic outlook, we would not be able to find off the budget the sort of money we would need to be investing over the course of the next decade or more, so I came to the conclusion that the only way we could enhance the money coming from the centre of government was to find savings within defence. I remember vividly suggesting to the Chief of the Defence Force and the secretary I of the department at the time that, having had a thorough look at the organisation, we should be able to find $10 billion internally-not $10 billion to give back to the centre but $10 billion to redirect into high-end capability within defence. Some people criticised me for that assessment, but having asked an independent private sector organisation to come in and study defence I was informed: 'You were wrong, Minister. You probably got it wrong when you suggested that $10 billion could be found. We think $20 billion could be found.' That was the recommendation from the independent consultant. So we put in place a strategic reform program not to take money out of defence but to make savings internally so that they could be redirected back into defence. That is what the strategic reform program is all about. Having done that, we need to rely upon the service chiefs to make the decisions. If they want high-end capability and an efficient defence force they need to make some tough decisions about some of the legacy issues and how they might deal with them. It seems apparent to me-not that I look at these things all that closely these days-that the Chief of Army has decided that there needs to be some rationalisation with respect to Army bands. I think it would be a very dangerous thing for this place, this parliament, this House of Representatives to look to intervene every time a service chief took a decision about how they might rationalise the spending within their own defence organisation. Again, I accept the genuineness in the approach of the member for Berowra and of those who have supported him, but if we are going to have a strong defence force in the future we must have an ongoing reform program, we must rationalise, we must make savings and we must redirect those savings to the high-end capability in the force we need to protect our nation state. While not questioning anyone's genuineness, I think the parliament should stay out of these decisions. This is a relatively low-level decision for Chief of Army and we should support him in his decision. Mr EWEN JONES (Herbert) (20:40): Quite frankly, I am shocked. I rise to speak in support of my friend and colleague the member for Berowra and his motion that the band of the Royal New South Wales Lancers, based in Parramatta, makes a significant contribution to the local community and that Army bands across Australia make significant contributions to their local communities. I commend my friend for moving that this House recognise military bands. I represent the seat of Herbert and the garrison city of Townsville. We are home to Australia's largest Army base-the 3rd Brigade at Lavarack Barracks. Not only do we house Australia's best troops and ready deployed forces but we are also home to the world famous 1RAR band. I must first commend the commander of 3rd Brigade, Brigadier Shane Caughey, for his commitment to ensuring that the Army maintains a strong community presence. His commitment to our community and to the greater North Queensland community must have played some part in his very much deserved Queen's Birthday honour. The commander of 1RAR is Lieutenant Colonel Eamon Lenaghan. 1RAR is a battleready regiment. It maintains a high level of training for its primary role, which is to Australia safe. It continues a strong tradition of commitment to a number of community causes, but it is the 1RAR band which forms the social bond between all things military and civilian in my city. I note that the Chief of the Defence Force, General Hurley, was a former commander of 1RAR. Under the Leadership of Major Lindsay Mee the 1RAR band plays a constant stream of community events. They play with joy the and happiness. They play brilliantly. They have played the formal military role and they have also provided first-class musical accompaniment to a vast number of charitable and community events. Everything from the senior citizens to the Ronald MCDonald House ball will see the band providing dinner music, big band music, as well as jazz, blues, and rock and roll for every audience. The band also provides musicians for the local music scene. I was lucky enough to be present for the 3RAR welcome parade to see the 1RAR band team with the Barrier Reef Symphony Orchestra and the 4th field regiment's artillery to present an open air rendition of Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture. That, my friends, was a truly memorable evening. It is the willingness of the band to represent the entire community which I love the most. On ANZAC Day the brass section can be seen at every dawn service, including Magnetic Island. They will then join together for the march along the Strand and will end up playing somewhere that evening. I have a personal fondness for Grant Thomas. He plays the six-string bass in the main band and plays bass and lead in the rock band. He also plays trombone for the marching band-although the other band members tell me that he cannot play at all but they need the numbers so they give him a dummy trombone and let him pretend. His keep taste in music is wide and varied and he is just so happy to be there, playing music, but he is above all else a professional soldier. When the rock and roll band starts up Angie Currington moves from the back and brings a big and sassy jazz/blues voice to the front of house and really gets the party started. The thing I like most about the bands we have in the military of Australia is that they do not have to do the public shows. They can quite legitimately concentrate on their a military band and as soldiers. That they see the greater good in the role they play in extending the hand of friendship from the ADF to the community speaks volumes of the individuals in the band and the leadership role they play. It is this pastoral and parish care of their staff which leads the way in setting the example and opening doors the right way. There are many things in Townsville which need action. We have many problems and many things which require fixing. But we are an aspirational people. We care about our community. We care about the relationship between the ADF and our city and region. When everything is tough, and you turn up to a function and see the boys and girls of the 1RAR band setting up and laughing about the night ahead, you cannot help but feel good. This motion, from the father of the House, is a wonderful opportunity to thank the members of Australia's military bands for all the unpaid work they do for all our communities. I am glad we have them here and may they continue forever because, if they do stop, a part of history will be gone and it will be gone forever. These guys are soldiers first, but they are professional musicians second. I talked to Brigadier Shayne Caughey about the 1RAR band. I asked him, 'What you are here for?' and he said, 'I am with the band. That is all I am; I am with the band.' It is about being special and it is about being proper and great for Townsville. Long may they live. Dr MIKE KELLY (Eden-MonaroParliamentary Secretary for Defence) (20:45): First I would like to acknowledge the sentiments that have been expressed by my colleagues about the service members who perform in bands, regimental or reserve, and the service that they render to our nation role as as soldiers as well. I understand the sentiment that the member for Berowra is exhibiting on this issue. I commend his concern for the traditions of the Army. I certainly understand that. I understand very much the sentimentality that attaches to this but also the essence of the traditions and why those traditions are there and what constitutes the esprit de corps that makes the Australian Army what it is and the tradition that it has. Of course, many things have happened over the years that I would not like to see disappear from the Australian Army. I was very sad to see that we did not have batmen any more when I joined up, and I missed my morning cups of tea and clean shoes, but they disappeared with the traditions of a bygone age. Certainly chiefs of army over the years have made all sorts of decisions about the conditions of service and the traditions that we have served under. Some of those have included the previous chiefs of army and the land commanders deciding that members would no longer wear berets in many circumstances. There was a great deal of emotional response to that issue as well. But, at the end of the day, these are all decisions that the Chief of Army makes in relation to the authority that is delegated to him under the Defence Act. When we start trying to interfere with those decisions of the Chief of Army, where do we draw the line? This particular decision was not made as a result of any pressure put on the Chief of Army through the recent budget cuts because I remember these issues were being discussed with the Chief of Army prior to the last election. These were all part of his concept of rebalancing the Army. It really did not even relate to the strategic reform program as such. The issue that was being discussed then by the Chief of Army was his concern about reprioritising the efforts and maintaining his ability to sustain the actual band capability within the Army itself. I think the mistake that the member for Berowra makes in the motion is to conflate the regimental bands with the reserve bands, because they are different things. The regimental bands are made up of voluntary participants, permanent and reserve, who are not part of the band corps itself. There are certain formal band corps structures that are maintained within the Australian Army band corps itself. They are, in effect, professional musicians. The Army supports reserve bands and also permanent band capability within that construct. So there are six regional reserve bands and there are over 20 Army reserve personnel who are working for Army support bands as well. They are part of that band corps structure. The Chief of Army has not decided that he intends to do away with the regimental bands. They may, in fact, continue. Hopefully they will continue. The only decision that the Chief of Army has made in this respect is that he will no longer replace the musical instruments, uniforms and other equipment held by the voluntary regimental bands so that he can prioritise his support to the actual Army band corps personnel. Those regimental bands will hopefully be well supported by philanthropic groups and by those who raise funds through the normal regimental trust fund processes to make sure that those bands can sustain their instruments and their uniforms and the traditions associated with their regiments. Those who are involved with those regimental bands who wish to transfer to the reserve band structure or the band corps can do so and that will be facilitated. That structure consists presently of a 43-piece Australian regular Army band based in Canberra. Army support bands with 22 personnel each are located in various regions such as Townsville, Brisbane, Sydney and Wagga Wagga. The Army reserve bands of 40 Army reserve personnel and three regular personnel are located in Melbourne, Adelaide, Hobart, Newcastle, Perth and Darwin. Perth and Newcastle also contain an Army reserve pipes and drum component. So the fine traditions of the Australian Army in relation to the band tradition will be maintained, supported and funded by the Chief of Army. I expect that the regimental bands will continue to draw support to sustain their traditions and their musical capability into the future. I certainly look forward to watching them in action at ceremonies around Australia.",169
187,Mr HAWKE,BILLS," It is a pleasure to rise to support the member for Berowra's fine motion on Army reserve bands tonight. It is interesting to follow the Parliamentary Secretary. I want to start by saying I was a member of the 1st/15th Royal New South Wales Lancers and, for the Parliamentary Secretary, to suggest there is any difference between regular service and reserve service is a falsehood. It is in fact a hallmark of a free society to have the citizen soldier at its disposal. The 21 battle honours of the 1st/15th, the most decorated regiment of the Australian Army, are a fine testament to that regiment and all of its serving men and women over the years. This particular motion relates to the bands, and the band form part of the rich Australian cultural heritage that has developed through the Australian military. This band formed in 1891, and even in 1891, before Federation, £250 was received from the New South Wales government and, after Federation, £150 from the Commonwealth government. If it was good enough in 1891 to fund this band, what is wrong with funding it today? The service of the band has been recorded in the regimental history over more than 100 years. This is a regiment that has lasted the test of time. It has seen service in 21 different conflicts in defence of this nation. The rich tapestry that has been formed by the band goes to show the strength of our local community in Parramatta, and it was extraordinary to see the member for Parramatta come into this place and speak against the local Parramatta regiment, the 1st/15th Royal New South Wales Lancers, based at their historic headquarters at Parramatta. It was extraordinary for the member for Parramatta to come in here and say, 'That is an Army decision.' This is a direct decision of government that this motion relates to tonight-to fund the Australian Army and its reserve forces to be able to conduct its duties in Australia today-and it is the responsibility of this parliament to call to attention those deficiencies that come about when funding is not available for the reserve forces. We could fund it in 1891 with pounds from the New South Wales and Commonwealth governments, but we cannot afford to fund it today when we have $10 billion for a Clean Energy Finance Corporation? We cannot find instruments for people to play in their regimental bands on our ANZAC Days and at our memorial services in our communities, to help recruit young men and women to these reserve regiments to serve as citizen soldiers, to follow in that fine tradition of the Roman citizen soldier Cincinnatus-'I am not a soldier; I am a farmer'-and of the minutemen, and of privateers in Elizabethan England? Free societies have been dominated by citizen soldiers, and the 1st/15th Royal New South Wales Lancers is a fine example of a citizen soldier regiment, giving us great service. These people in the band do not do this for the money; I want to make that clear. They are not in this for the money. They do more service and voluntary activity than the government can ever possibly fund. We have heard from the member for Herbert about the dedication and the voluntary and selfless service that these young men and women provide. Yet this government says that there is no funding available for these great reserve regiments and for their bands. And that affects many bands. I have the minute here from Australian Army headquarters. These are the regiments affected: in 1st Brigade, 5RAR and 7RAR; in 7th Brigade, 2nd/14th LHR; and in 2nd Division, 1st/15th Royal New South Wales Lancers, the 4th/19th, the 23rd Field Regiment, the 2nd/10th Field Regiment, 8/7 RVR, 5/6 RVR, 9 RQR, 10/27 RSAR, 2/17 RNSWR, 25/49 RQR, the Queensland University Regiment, the Sydney University Regiment, the University of New South Wales Regiment and the Western Australian University Regiment-all of those reserve regimental bands. For the parliamentary secretary to stand here today in this place and say, 'Somehow they will find the funding,' and that they should be a charity case is really demonstrating a lack of understanding of the importance of these reserve regimental bands and how they operate. These people are already volunteering a lot of their time and a lot of their effort, putting their hearts and souls into these units that provide the social fabric at the heart of so many local communities around Australia. That is what a reserve regiment does. That is what a citizen soldier regiment does: it provides the corps at the heart of those communities-another social setup that provides unity and cohesion in society without the need for government to be involved. If it was good enough to fund the RNSWR Lancers in 1891 with £250 from the state government and £150 from Commonwealth government, it is good enough for us today to continue that fine tradition of 110 years of dedicated and selfless service that this regimental band and all of these regimental bands that I have mentioned, in all their societies all around Australia, provide, serving our nation, doing us proud and providing invaluable service to our communities. And it is a great motion before this House today to support them in what they do.  the contribution of the member for Mitchell; it was very passionate. In that spirit, in terms of declaring any particular interest, before I move to the motion raised by the member for Berowra, I will declare my particular interest, as a flight lieutenant in the RAAF Reserve, No. 23 (City of Brisbane) Squadron. Just before you get interested, I will just declare that I do not receive any money or any remuneration-no profit under the Crown. I do my work as a volunteer and do not get remunerated. I am not in a band. I have been in a band, but that did not receive any federal support. In fact, some could argue that it received almost no support at all! But that is another story for another day-on the curse of YouTube. I turn to the more serious matter of the motion raised by the member for Berowra, the Hon. Philip Ruddock, who I always listen to and have a lot of respect for. I am on committees with him. However, I do think that this motion is a little unnecessary and a little bit misguided and, I would suggest, even perhaps an interference with the Chief of Army's duties to administer the Army in an efficient and effective manner. I am from Brisbane, not from Sydney; I know that the member for Mitchell and the member for Berowra would have a better understanding of some of the decisions of the the Chief of Army in terms of how they apply. Under the Howard government, in those times, the changing of the guard and the band accompanying it at the Sydney barracks was a decision that was made for lots of reasons; it is not for me to inquire into. It was a decision made by the Chief of Army and I support that decision. As I said in my declaration of interest, it is as a legal officer in the RAAF Reserve, not the Army or the Navy. But my understanding is that this motion does incorrectly refer to regimental bands as 'reserve bands'. I am sorry I did not hear the earlier conversations or whether that was corrected; I was otherwise engaged. But this motion refers specifically to the New South Wales Lancers' band and similar bands. My understanding is that such bands are in fact regimental bands. Yet the motion calls on the government to continue to support the Army Reserve bands, and my understanding is that this is factually incorrect. Obviously, the Gillard Labor government already supports reserve bands and will continue to do so. I am advised that we support six regional reserve bands and over 20 Army Reserve personnel who work in four Army support bands. These personnel and bands are part of the Australian Army Band Corps, or the AABC. The government supports six regional reserve bands, and over 20 Army Reserve personnel who work in four Army support bands. These personnel and bands are part of the Australian Army Band Corps. Following a review into Army bands in May 2011, a decision was made by the Chief of Army to transfer the resourcing of regimental bands from the Commonwealth to the associated regimental associations. Regimental bands are staffed by volunteers from both permanent and part-time Army personnel from the parent regiment. The members of these bands are already employed by the Army in other roles. For example, they may be employed by the Army as a cook, but volunteer to play in the regimental band in their spare time, and perhaps even for no remuneration. Regimental bands are established to provide musical services primarily for a specific unit or regiment. The decision is an administrative matter which is delegated to the Chief of Army and, as I am sure those opposite would know, respecting that chain of command is pursuant to the Commonwealth Defence Act 1903. This motion, as I read it, proposes to interfere with the decision of the Chief of Army. The Chief of Army made a decision to no longer replace the musical instruments, uniforms and other equipment held by the voluntary regimental bandsThe DEPUTY SPEAKER Murphy): Order! The time allotted for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. The honourable member will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. Olive Oil",173
188,Ms RISHWORTH,BILLS," I move: That this House: (1) welcomes the introduction of the Australian Standard for Olive and Olive Pomace Oils in 2011 which clearly defines the grade, content and quality of olive oil products and establishes labelling and packaging requirements; (2) notes the findings of an analysis conducted recently by the Australian Olive Association which revealed that a significant number of imported olive oils in particular, still fail to comply with this national standard; (3) recognises that misleading labelling practices present considerable challenges for the commercial viability of our domestic olive oil industry, lead to low levels of consumer confidence in olive oil products and prevent consumers from making informed choices about the products they consume, and which may have adverse consequences, including on their health; (4) welcomes the news that some retailers intend to phase in the voluntary national standard in light of the recent findings, and calls on these retailers to do so in a timely and rigorous manner; and (5) urges all retailers in Australia to adopt and enforce the Australian Standard for Olive and Olive Pomace Oils so that consumers can make informed purchasing choices, and so that producers of accurately labelled olive oils benefit from a level playing field. I am very pleased to move this motion to highlight some of the ongoing challenges faced by our domestic olive oil industry and some challenges faced by the Australian consumers of olive oil products. (Mr I have previously spoken in the House about some of these challenges facing our olive oil industry and, in particular, facing the olive growers and olive oil producers that make a wonderful product on the Fleurieu Peninsula, which includes a portion of my own electorate. In 2009 I raised the concerning lack of transparency in the labelling of olive oil products and the consequences for industry competition and consumer protection. I have advocated for the development of clear guidelines to differentiate between various qualities of olive oil and to ensure accuracy and clarity in the labelling of olive oil products. Since that time, I am very pleased that Standards Australia has introduced an Australian standard for olive and olivepomace oils which clearly defines the grade, content and quality of olive oil products and establishes labelling and packaging requirements. I understand that Standards Australia received almost 800 submissions throughout the drafting of the standard and that there was strong support from both consumers and stakeholders such as olive oil producers to introduce a standard to effectively address the issues facing the industry. I welcome the standard, which was introduced in 2011 and defines a number of important areas: (1) clearly outlining different grades of olive oil, whether fresh refined; (2) unambiguously defining what constitutes extra virgin olive oil, including the most current and effective testing methods for quality and authenticity; (3) providing a technical basis for the 'best before' claims; (4) providing labelling requirements to minimise consumer confusion; (5) cracking down on the misuse of words such as premium, super, pure, light/lite; (6) requiring substantiation of words describing country/region of origin; (7) requiring substantiation of processing methods such as cold pressed and first extraction; and (8) accommodating the natural variations that occur in different countries, olive varieties and regions, without compromising the ability to test and verify quality. This motion notes the findings of an analysis conducted recently by the Australian Olive Association which revealed that a significant number of imported olive oils in particular still fail to comply with this national standard. Unfortunately, a number of studies have shown that olive oil products on the shelves of our supermarkets have been, and continue to be, deceiving consumers. A recently completed survey of Australian supermarket oils from 2008 to 2011, conducted by the Australian Olive Association as part of a research project funded by the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation, revealed that over 52 per cent of oil labelled as extra virgin found to be of a lower grade than extra virgin, as a consequence of either adulteration with refined oils, poor quality of the initial product and/or being too old or poorly stored. As a part of the survey, the Australian Olive Association analysed 30 olive oils against the new standard and revealed that, of the 22 purportedly 'extra virgin' olive oils, seven out of seven imported varieties failed to comply with the or standard due to factors such as rancidity, mildew and incorrect labelling. These findings are particularly concerning. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, as well as the consumer group CHOICE, having also investigated different brands of olive oils, have found that many do not live up to what they purport to be. This motion recognises that misleading labelling practices present considerable challenges for the commercial viability of our domestic olive oil industry, given that those Australian growers and producers who are doing the right thing, who are meeting the standard and who are labelling correctly have to unfairly compete with those olive oils that are not complying with the standard. The motion before us also recognises that misleading practices lead to a lower level of consumer confidence in olive oil products and prevent consumers from making informed choices about the products they consume, which can have adverse consequences for consumers, including for their health. The Australian Olive Association has noted that practices such as cutting higher quality oils such as extra virgin olive oil with lower quality and less expensive oils such as sunflower and canola oil are rife, particularly in imported products, and that this puts significant pressure on those Australian growers and producers who are doing the right thing but are having to was compete on the supermarket shelves against imported products which are not complying. Indeed, domestic olive growers and olive oil producers are forced to struggle in an environment where the retail price of olive oils has been slashed which is, in part, attributable to the importation of some products which are significantly cheaper because they do not contain the right standard of oil, but rather contain other oils such as cooking oils. Indeed, in one instance-and I think this is very concerning-it was exposed that one of these products contained refined lamp oil. For consumers it is particularly concerning that, when they are buying a product that seems cheap and is labelled extra virgin olive a specific olive oil, it is shown to have been mixed with lamp oil. In addition, the Australian Olive Association has raised concerns about the continuing use of deceptive terms, such as 'light', which have connotations of being healthier when in reality they are actually only light on beneficial things like antioxidants and can contain trans fatty acids that are not present in natural extra virgin olive oils. There has been significant evidence to attest to the fact that natural extra virgin olive oils do have health benefits, such as in relation to heart health, that are not present in refined olive oils. Indeed, the Australian Olive Association has said that almost all natural antioxidants and vitamins are lost during the refining process to create lower grade olive oils commonly labelled as 'light' or 'pure'. I would say that this is something the average consumer is not aware of. Most of us see terms like 'light' on an olive oil product in the supermarket and think we are making a positive choice for our health, but we have now heard this is not necessarily the case. I have spoken in this chamber many, many times about the importance of correct and accurate labelling so that consumers can make the choice. It would seem from the findings of surveys such as the one recently conducted by the Australian Olive Association that it continues to be extremely difficult for many Australian consumers to make informed choices about the products they purchase. This motion welcomes the news that some retailers intend to phase in the voluntary national standard in light of the recent findings and calls on these retailers to do so in a timely and rigorous manner. I must commend these retailers. It is really important that retailers have this standard for olive oil, but only some retailers are doing so. I take this opportunity to urge all retailers oil or in Australia to adopt and enforce the Australian Standard for Olive and OlivePomace Oils so that consumers, no matter which retailer they walk into, know there is an olive oil standard and can make informed purchasing choices in the knowledge that what they pick up meets that standard. We should note that olive oil is becoming increasingly popular. Australian consumption of olive oil has risen from about 30,000 tonnes to more than 40,000 tonnes in the past decade, and Australian growers supply about a quarter of that. Olive oil is a commonly used product by Australian consumers and it also constitutes an important part of primary production in our country. It is not good enough that we continue to have a situation whereby dishonest or improper labelling of olive oil products is occurring on our supermarket shelves. As I said, I encourage all retailers to adopt this standard. It is important that this standard be enforced, and that is where we must turn our attention. Once retailers have seen the importance of adopting this-and I am sure they will, as a number have already done so-we must enforce this standard effectively so that olive oil producers can have a level playing field for selling their products and Australian consumers are protected from confusing labelling practices and from misleading information, and honest growers and producers are disadvantaged. I commend this motion to the House.",176
189,Mr COULTON,BILLS," I too rise to speak on the motion introduced by the member for Kingston. I commend her on her valiant effort in failing health as she battled through her speech, perhaps in need of a little olive oil herself. While I completely agree with the sentiment of the motion and the comments the member made, I think we need to go further with this. We need some regulation with some real bite because, while it is nice to have aspirational motions, we have a role to put in place legislation that will benefit not only the industry but also consumers. This issue is basically divided into two halves: one as it affects the olive oil producers and the other as it affects the consumers. The olive oil industry is quite large in my electorate of Parkes, where, I believe, in all the river valleys across this third of New South Wales there are olive groves. It is an emerging industry that over the last 25 or 30 years has gone from a standing start to being quite significant. There has been a lot of concern about this issue. During Senate estimates my colleagues Senators Williams and Boswell tried to drill down into information from Food Standards Australia New Zealand and the ACCC to find out what control and regulation government has over the industry. We have been pursuing this on behalf of the industry for some time. Olive oil is blended, mixed and refined. It is labelled in many different ways, but only extra virgin olive oil has not been physically or chemically changed. Countries like Germany, Italy, Canada and South Africa are all looking into this issue, but in theory olive oil products are being marketed as comparable to high-quality extra virgin olive not oil. The voluntary standards are based on industry best practice. As I said, there are famers in my electorate who have put a lot of finance and effort into developing this industry. I was speaking to some of the farmers in the Gwydir Valley last week. They have considerable holdings of land under olives. We have an industry in my electorate that goes from farmers with thousand-acre groves down to smaller producers that might have five or 10 acres. At the moment, they are really struggling with the prices they are receiving. Over the last couple of decades we have seen more than $1 billion invested in Australia in groves and milling plants. Australians consume some 45 million litres of olive oil a year, and this is increasing. I understand that Australia is the second highest per capita consumer of olive oil and olive oil products after countries around the Mediterranean. And it should be recognised that the best olive oil products are based on high-quality produce. Unfortunately, cheap, inferior imports have undermined the price of high-quality olive oil. Farm-gate prices have been slashed by 50 per cent over the last four years despite substantial growth in the industry over the last 10 years. Australian growers have captured about 30 per cent of the market with a high-quality product competing unfairly in the same space with inferior, imported olive oils. There has been no compulsion for olive oil to be identified appropriately. Olive oil is often labelled 'light', 'extra light' and 'pure' in an attempt to market an inferior product as comparable with extra virgin olive oil. What is necessary are certain guidelines that are easy to follow and easily identified by the public and the consumers. If these guidelines were regulated then it would be possible for inferior products to be pursued by the ACCC for misrepresentation. We do not need to have protection. I am not talking about trade barriers here. I am just talking about setting up regulations so that the Australian industry can compete on a level playing field with the competitors from overseas. This would also show inferior imports for exactly what they are. There are also health benefits to the Australian public having these standards in a more definite way. As it is now, consumers may purchase oils that might be refined and then labelled 'light', which can be mistaken as low fat. Clear labelling would enable consumers to understand exactly what they were buying. I also believe it is very difficult because, if a product has a percentage of extra virgin olive oil added back into it, it is marketed as extra virgin. In fact, extra virgin olive oil is olive juice. It is just squeezed juice from the olive with no other refining taking place, but all sorts of blending goes on with a small percentage of extra virgin added to a refined product and then labelled as something else. A study in 2008 showed that 84 per cent of imported extra virgin olive oil was not actually extra virgin. Eighteen per cent of all olive oil imported was shown to actually be lamp oil, and this is not considered fit for human consumption. The industry has been working steadily to create voluntary standards, which is good. However, while ever these standards are voluntary, we will still have inferior products and incorrect labelling without any consideration for the ramifications of misleading consumers. One of the things I would like to see is defined labels that are enforceable so that, if something is misrepresented under that particular label and brand, it can be pursued by the ACCC for misrepresenting a product. Unfortunately, a lot of consumers are not educated or aware of the complexity of the blends that they might be seeing in the supermarket. I believe that now is the time and place to have a clear labelling regime that identifies what product is what so that, if people choose to pay less for an inferior product, they know that they are buying something that is of lesser nutritional value, is a blend or is a poorerquality substitute for a higher-quality product. At the moment, it is very difficult for consumers to make that decision. Regulations are necessary to ensure an appropriate standard of olive oil labelling. This will benefit consumers, who will be able to purchase a high-quality product, and producers, who will be assisted because inferior imported products will not be in direct comparison with higher-quality Australian oil. While this motion certainly is correct in its sentiment-I agree with it completely-I think the time has passed for feel-good motions in this place. The time has come that we stick up for the olive oil producers and this parliament looks after the interests of consumers and puts in some regulations that are enforceable and that will see a clear definition of product so that the industry and consumers can get onto an equitable playing field.

192,Ms BRODTMANN,BILLS," As someone who loves to cook and who was brought up by a mother who constantly told us that olive oil and garlic were the keys to good health, good skin, sparkly eyes and shiny hair, it gives me great pleasure to speak on this motion tonight. I have even missed out finding out who the finalist on The Voice is to speak on this motion tonight, so that shows my commitment to standards of olive oil! This motion raises the importance of supporting our Australian industries, because when it comes to olive oil, there have been some disturbing reports that suggest that 'oils ain't oils' and that some imported olive oils that are marketed as 'light' or 'extra virgin' are not those at all. In the case of olive some of the cheap foreign imports that you will find on your supermarket shelves not only are of inferior quality but have been found to be wrongly labelled. Many foreign olive oils marketed as Spanish or Italian are actually from places such as Morocco, so that is why I commend the member for Kingston for raising this important motion tonight. It is an issue that was raised by my sister late last year. She is a master of wine and a winemaker, and she is very good friends with Stefano de Pieri, who owns that fabulous restaurant in Mildura. I know that it has been an issue of concern for him for many years and it has been an issue of concern for my sister in recent years, so a real pleasure to be able to speak on it tonight, and I again commend the member for Kingston for raising it. Australians are big consumers of olive oil, but too often what we think we are buying is not what we are actually getting. According to the CEO of Standards Australia, consumers are often misled into believing they are buying healthy products such as extra virgin olive oil, which is natural, and unrefined, when they are not. In fact, a recent Australian Olive Association analysis found seven out of seven imported varieties failed to comply with extra virgin olive oil standards due to rancidity, mildew or incorrect labelling. By comparison, 75 per cent of Australian-made oils complied with the standard. It is unfortunate that Australia's quality olive oil products have had to compete with inferior overseas imports that simply are not labelled properly or are made up of other oils entirely, such as canola oil. We must do all we can to assist the commercial viability of our domestic olive oil industry, as this motion suggests. Misleading labelling poses oil, significant challenges for our domestic producers as well as consumers. It prevents us from making informed choices about the products we consume. For something many of us use so frequently, that we trust as a healthy product, this is simply not good enough. That is why, like the member for Kingston, I welcome the introduction of the Australian Standard for Olive Oils and Olive-Pomace Oils in 2011, which clearly defines the grade, content and quality of olive oil products and establishes labelling and packaging requirements. This new standard is helping to ensure customers can be confident that when they buy top-quality olive oil, that is what they will get. It will it is allow consumers to shop with confidence and know that, when they buy olive oil according to Australian standards, they are getting a top-quality product. The standard, introduced last year, applies to all olive and olive-pomace oils that are traded in Australia. It defines grades of olive oils, specifies chemical composition and quality parameters for these grades, establishes requirements for labelling and fresh packing and lists acceptable methods of analysis. The purpose of the standard is to provide all those involved in the olive oil and olive-pomace oil trade, from producers to consumers, with a modern reference document that establishes an objective basis for the trade of these products. But the standard cannot work properly unless retailers get on board too. That is why it is welcome news that some retailers intend to phase in the voluntary national standard for olive oil. I call on those retailers to do so in a timely and rigorous manner. I also urge all retailers to adopt and enforce the standard so that consumers can make informed purchasing choices. This will also ensure our producers of accurately-labelled olive oils, who are doing the right thing, benefit from a level playing field. Buying Australian-produced olive oil is not only delicious, but it is good news for our local producers, it uses less packaging and it helps to reduce our carbon footprint as well. Buying local is much better for our environment and ensures you will get a product that is fresh, Australian made and of proven high quality-and you cannot argue with that.",180
193,Mr MCCORMACK,BILLS," I rise this evening to support the motion on the Australian Standard for Olive and OlivePomace Oils in 2011. Extra virgin olive oil is the only mainstream edible oil which has not been chemically or physically refined and changed; it is just the natural juice of the olive. Due to the natural process and great taste and health benefits it offers, extra virgin olive oil is highly sought by consumers. The Australian olive oil industry has grown substantially over the past decade, with more than $1 billion invested in regional Australia in groves and milling plants which have created thousands of jobs. Certainly olive groves and their produce are generating income for the Riverina. Australians consume 45 million litres of olive oil a year, with consumption rising rapidly over the past 20 years to make Australia the highest consumers per capita outside the Mediterranean area. Australian growers have captured about 30 per cent of this market due to the outstanding quality of their extra virgin olive oil. However, most Australian olive growers are struggling to survive, despite producing world-class extra virgin olive oil, because they have watched the farm gate price more than have over the past four years. The Australian Olive Association's Paul Miller says producers cannot compete with cheap imports and are being forced to sell below the cost of production. Furthermore, these cheap imports are masquerading as the real thing and consumers are none the wiser. This is because imported oils have misleading labels which read 'pure', 'light' or 'extra light', although these names are illegal in most producing countries, including those in Europe. These deceptively-labelled products make up 45 per cent of the Australian retail market and sell for a similar price to extra virgin, in turn fooling Australian consumers, who believe they are purchasing extra virgin olive oil when the reality is that they are purchasing second-rate refined oil. The reasons behind the widespread practice of misleading labelling of olive oils is twofold. Firstly, it is for financial gain. It can be very profitable to purchase only lower grade cheaper products, such as refined olive oil, and sell them as something else, in this case extra virgin olive oil. Secondly, there is an abundance of low-grade refined olive oil and a shortage of extra virgin. Europe produces 80 per cent of the world's olive oil but half of that production is not for human consumption and must be refined. It is then transported to countries such as Australia and labelled as 'extra light' or 'pure', or is even in some cases called 'extra virgin'. In 2005 the Australian Olive Association published its own code of practice, which aims to guarantee the authenticity and quality of certified products and distinguish them from imported products. To be certified by the Australian Olive Association, products must be Australian and have undergone organoleptic testing for taste and for chemicals. Only after passing these tests can an Australian extra virgin olive oil become certified by the Australian Olive Association. Brands that are certified all carry a sticker, which helps make it easier consumers to know they are purchasing authentic Australian extra virgin olive oil. In addition to ensuring the quality and authenticity of Australian extra virgin olive the code of practiceDebate interrupted. NA",182
194,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT, Order! It being 9:30 pm I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Bradfield Electorate: Roads,183
195,Mr FLETCHER,ADJOURNMENT," A crucially needed piece of infrastructure in my electorate is the link between the F3 and M2. This is needed for a range of reasons: to reduce the appalling congestion on Pennant Hills Road, to reduce traffic on the Pacific Highway, and to establish the missing link between these two vital pieces of transport infrastructure, including for long-distance trucks travelling between Brisbane and Melbourne or otherwise taking long-distance journeys that do not necessarily originate or terminate in the Sydney metropolitan area. Two exhaustive studies recommended that the appropriate solution for the Pennant Hills Road congestion and the appropriate solution to establish a link between the F3 and the M2 is to build a tunnel under Pennant Hills Road. What then have we seen from the federal Labor government towards the achievement of this important objective? In last year's budget announcement, buried deep in the budget papers for 2011, there was a withdrawal of $150 million, which had previously been set aside in the forward estimates for planning work on the F3-M2 link. This year in the May 2012 budget, the position is at best extremely opaque. In an opinion piece during the week of the budget the Minister for for Infrastructure and Transport had this to say: In Tuesday's budget the Treasurer announced increased funding for infrastructure and measures to encourage private sector financing of Sydney's Moorebank Intermodal, the F3 to M2 link, and the M5 East. This is a magnificently Delphic statement and it is extremely unclear what the minister actually meant by that. On my examination of the budget papers-and I readily concede I have only been here a relatively short time-no mention of the F3 to M2 link can be found. We made inquiries of the minister's office and asked for clarification. The minister's office pointed to a glossy booklet entitled Sydney Transport Infrastructure: Project Highlights. That glossy booklet contains the following statement: Given the significant capital cost of both projects, the Australian Government tasked Infrastructure Australia to work with the NSW Government to explore private financing options for expansion of the M5 East and the F3 to M2. Again, this is a magnificently Delphic statement. It is very hard to understand what it actually means and what level of finance has been allocated to the task. The picture have gets even more murky when you look at the transcript of what the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport had to say in a recent interview with Adam Spencer on ABC Radio, where he made a vague claim that $150 million was still available for the F3 to M2 link. That claim was repeated in the recent consideration in detail in the Federation Chamber of the infrastructure and transport portfolio where the minister had this to say: In addition to that, $150 million that we committed is available also to assist in terms of being allocated in the budget for the F3 to M2. It is difficult to understand what the position is. It is clear from last year's budget that $150 million, which had previously been contained in the forward estimates for feasibility work on the F3 to M2 link, was removed. On an examination of this year's budget it is difficult to find any specific statement that refers to the F3 to M2 link and any specific statement that the $150 million has been reinstated. Yet we have statements made by the minister, both in an interview with Adam Spencer on ABC Radio and in the consideration in detail in the Federation Chamber, that the $150 million is still available. This is a matter of great importance to my constituents in the Bradfield electorate and everybody who would like to see a better connection between the F3 and the M2. I call upon the minister to clarify this position and indicate what federal funding is available for the F3 to M2 link. Grocery Prices",183
196,Mr ZAPPIA,ADJOURNMENT," For many years, Coles and Woolworths have dominated Australia's retail grocery sales with estimates placing their combined grocery market share at over 70 per cent. To date, most of the criticism, and indeed concern, about the duopoly has been the squeeze they have been able to apply to local food producers and the very low prices Coles and Woolworths pay for their produce. An additional concern has been the ability of the two retailers to completely exclude a product from their shelves or poorly display a product and effectively force a food producer out of the market. I accept, however, that there is some fierce competition between the two retailers and that the competition has kept retail grocery prices down. The drastic fall in milk prices is an example of that, and have today a litre of unbranded milk costs about half of what branded milk sold for a year or so ago. However, there is another growing concern emerging about the duopoly. Sales of Coles' and Woolworths' own brand products are steadily increasing. These are unbranded grocery products, with vague information about their origin, being sold at prices 20 to 30 per cent lower than the known brands. According to a report on 28 May 2012 by Melissa Fyfe and Royce Millar in the Age: In 2007, home brands made up 14% of grocery items sold in Australia, now they are 25%. Home brands make up 50% of UK groceries, 35% of US groceries. Nielsen predicts home brands will jump to 40 per cent of Australian grocery items within five years. With more and more of these products produced offshore in lower cost countries, food producers in Australia, both growers and manufacturers, are being squeezed out of the market. That of course means job losses, but there are other consequences. Foods produced overseas is in many cases produced using chemicals that have either been banned in Australia or under conditions where safe levels of those chemicals have been exceeded. Even where bans do apply, monitoring and enforcement of the bans is less likely to occur in developing countries. The consequence of more home-brand products being sold by Coles and Woolworths is that Australians will consume more foods produced offshore and, in turn, will very likely be exposed to more foodrelated health risks than presently is the case. Even with Australia's very robust biosecurity screening, the reality is that relatively few imported goods are tested. Furthermore, chemical levels only become an issue if the levels exceed a set threshold. Thresholds are at best guidelines and can never provide absolute certainty. The health effects of high levels of chemicals, even within prescribed safe levels, may not become apparent until years later. A subsequent report in the Age stated: An analysis by The Age of ''failed food'' since 2010 shows 1050 imported foods, or an average of one consignment a day, have not met Australian standards. Almost 400 foods were stopped at entry because of micro-organisms such as E. coli, 246 failed because they contained banned additives or substances, 228 contained contaminants and 138 failed chemical analysis. Let me make it absolutely clear that not all Australian produced foods always comply with local health standards. However, by international standards, Australia has a relatively good food compliance regime. There is of course an additional concern about all of this. The offshore countries where the food is produced are very likely to be developing countries with cheap labour and less regulation. That is why they can produce cheaper food. Workers in developing countries are also less likely to be aware of the chemical risks they are exposed to in producing those foods. Food production and processing provide job opportunities and economic growth. Supporting local industry opportunities in developing countries is one of the best forms of assistance that we can provide to them. However, Australia should not be a party to exploiting or profiting from placing at risk people in other countries. For a combination of reasons, offshore food production is of interest to many consumers, and they want to be able to make an informed choice about the food they purchase-a choice about what food they consume, how it is grown, where it is grown and how it is processed. They can only do that if a clear, unambiguous food labelling system is in place and if they have confidence in our biosecurity checks. As food imports grow, so too will public interest in this issue. I know that this is a much more complicated issue than many people believe it to be, but I also know that we can do much better to inform Australian consumers about the food that they consume. It is in the health results interests of the nation for us to do so. Forde Electorate: Community Organisations Mr VAN MANEN (Forde) (21:40): The Forde community have been very busy over the past couple of months, doing what they can to help support each other, and it is with great pride that I have the opportunity to share some of those local stories from my electorate with my parliamentary colleagues tonight. In the past eight years, Lighthouse Calvary Care has grown from one small store in Eagleby to three stores and a warehouse in Loganholme. As well as helping struggling families with $20 food trolleys, the Loganbased charity now has a shopfront selling low-cost groceries to help families make ends meet. Last week I had the opportunity to attend and sponsor a fundraiser held by the Bendigo Bank's Logan Community Bank to help raise funds for Lighthouse Calvary Care. It is great to live in a community that looks out for one another, with these wonderful organisations. My thanks also go to the many local businesses that constantly these community organisations. Beenleigh Cane Festival was held again this year. The 49th festival was another wonderful example of the community spirit in and around Beenleigh. The weather was perfect for this year's annual Cane Festival Parade, with thousands of people turning out for the day and some 70 floats taking part in the parade. I would like to congratulate the Rotary Club's Cane Festival Committee Chairman, John Fennell, along with the committee members, community organisations, volunteers and businesses for making this event such a great success this year, and we are looking forward to the celebration of the 50th Cane Festival next year. During its 49-year history there has been a cane quest, which over that time has raised some $500,000 for the local community. This year there were nine entrants: Melina Evans, Lauren Paterson, Kayla Eley, Mikaela Falcone, Jason Howitt, Emily Ponton, Sharni Willmann, Tess Haseler and Lyndon Captain. This year's overall winner and the 2012 Cane Quest Ambassador was Jason Howitt, who has set a first for being the first male to win this competition. I would like to also commend the efforts of Sharni Willmann for her fundraising efforts. She raised $17,884 and received the title of Cane Quest Charity Queen. In total the nine entrants raised over $65,126 for local charities. My thanks also go to the cane quest committee of Vicki Lorisch, Anje Piepier, Rhonda Dore, Katie Johnson and Alisha and June Collard. Our businesses also continue to give to community. Recently a sale was held at one of our local Harvey Norman stores, with proceeds going to the Logan Hospital. An event I enjoy each year is the Junior Quota Beenleigh. They hold a Big Box Sleep-Out to raise funds for the local homeless community. I had the pleasure of going along and cooking dinner on the barbecue for them and taking part in some of the other activities. The aim of the event was to raise awareness of homelessness, and all funds are donated back to the community. I am very proud of their efforts each and every year, and they have another sleep-out coming up in October for Halloween. Another group in our community that does tremendous work to raise funds for charity is the Shailerettes dance team from Shailer Park State School. Recently they performed in a dance competition to raise money for disadvantaged children so that those kids are able to participate in school events. In conclusion, I am privileged to represent the Forde electorate. It is fast becoming a great place to live and work because of the community spirit that is there in our community. It is a privilege to share some of those stories about the great things the community is doing in the electorate. Boer War Day",184
197,Ms BRODTMANN,ADJOURNMENT," Boer War Day was on 31 May and marked the 110th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Vereeniging, which ended the Second Boer War. So why should we remember a war that for most of the last century has been termed 'a forgotten war'? We should remember because it marked the beginning of Australia as an independent nation and it played a pivotal role in forming our national character. At the start of the war in 1899, Australia was comprised of six self-governing crown the colonies in the final stages of forming a federation. In June 1899 the people of all colonies except Western Australia had voted in favour of federation and in 1900 Western of Australia joined them. By then Australians, including the first servicewomen to serve overseas, were already serving alongside Britons, Canadians and New Zealanders as part of an imperial force. The British commanders particularly valued the Australians for their horsemanship, bush skills and initiative. The Australians were becoming known for a special type of Australian mounted infantry, which would become the Light Horse of the First World War. And for the first time Australians and New Zealanders fought together, as they would in future conflicts. Following Federation on 1 January 1901, the Australian Commonwealth Horse was formed, and the first version of Australia's rising sun badge appeared. And the Australian tradition of raising specific, volunteer forces to serve overseas was established. As would happen later in the 20th century, men were recruited from individual states but they fought as Australians. In all, some 23,000 Australians, including 60 women, served in the Boer War. In that war, 589 Australians lost their lives and 1,400 sustained serious wounds. Australia also lost its first servicewoman when Sister Frances Emma 'Fanny' Hines died of pneumonia. She died of pneumonia-but it was probably really exhaustion-in August 1900. It is sobering to think that almost half of all deaths were from disease or accident. The Boer War was also the first of our wars to be commemorated by public memorials. These were later erected in small towns and country areas that are today sparsely populated. In many cases they list the names of all local citizens who served, with special recognition of those who died. Although there are local memorials all over Australia, to date no specific national memorial to the Boer War has been built. The reasons for this are many. But now, more than 100 years after the event, steps are being taken to correct this. Very soon Canberra may have its own memorial to the Boer War on ANZAC Parade, which pays homage to the troops and the horses who fought so valiantly all those years ago. For the last several years, the members of the National Boer War Memorial Association have been working extremely hard to build a fitting memorial on ANZAC Parade. The site for the memorial was dedicated in 2008 and in March of this year the design was announced following its approval by the Canberra National Memorials Committee. The memorial will recognise that all Australian troops in the Boer War were mounted or dependent on horses to tow their ambulances, their artillery and their supply wagons. It will recall their endurance and sacrifice. To commemorate Boer War Day this year, a special service was held at St John's Church in Reid here in Canberra to commemorate two local citizens who served in the war: Sergeant William Bradshaw Galliard Smith and William Frederick Young. I was also in attendance at the ACT Committee of the National Boer War Memorial Association's commemorative ceremony at the new site of the National Boer War Memorial on ANZAC Parade. The design for that site is quite extraordinary. It is like a 3D memorial that goes right back towards St John's in Reid. It is a beautiful memorial and I am very much looking forward to seeing it opened. In a few weeks I will also be attending an ACT Reserves commemoration ceremony for the Boer War. This evening I ask that we all remember the brave men and women who served in Australia's first national war, the Boer War, 110 years ago. Canning Electorate: Employment",186
198,Mr RANDALL,ADJOURNMENT," I am raising the matter of skilled workers in the resources industry and the skills shortage because I am so concerned about the people who should be getting a job and who are not. This issue particularly affects Western Australia and the electorate of Canning, which has the second highest number of flyin fly-out and drive-in drive-out workers out of any Western Australian metropolitan electorate. The Labor Party and Prime Minister Gillard have yet again made a debacle of another policy-this time the enterprise migration agreements and the recent Roy Hill announcement. The coalition supports filling job shortages and knows this can be done through a temporary migration system with integrity, when necessary, and when Australian residents cannot be found to fulfil available jobs. This is sound economic practice. But following the Roy Hill announcement, the Labor Government has rushed the Jobs Board through, simply to appease the union bosses. Last Friday, a search of the Jobs Board website in my office returned some interesting results. We used the region of the Pilbara in Western Australia as a job search area. We looked at the jobs areas of machinery operators and drivers; technicians and trade workers; and labourers. If you want a job as a casual mystery shopper in Port Hedland, you are fine. The rest of the results were disappointing for someone really wanting to get into the mining sector. What we really need to see are training programs being put in place to get Australians job ready-people such as older age workers and those who have not got skills but who are not getting the mentoring or training they need to get them into a specific role. They need support. Last Friday I received a visit from one of my constituents, Kathy Webster. She knows two local people who are hard workers, who have families to support and who want to work in the mining industry but just cannot get a job. One is a forklift driver and the other can drive road trains. Both are willing to undertake on-the-job training and upskill. But where do they go to get this help? What is this Labor government doing to get people job ready in the mining sector? There needs to be more programs like at Newmont Boddington goldmine in my electorate. This company has about 50 to 100 job vacancies at any one time. These vacancies are usually for positions requiring significant experience or technical skills such as engineers, surveyors, mechanics, welders and fitters et cetera. Occasionally, they are calling for equipment operators as well. They tend not to take on people with zero experience; however, they do have a program which is an initiative of the company where they take on people with no experience and provide training through a volunteer system. This is only a token gesture in the scheme of things, but perhaps there needs to be government funding to put in place to create more tailored programs to get those with some skills so that they are job ready and trained specifically for these mining jobs that are in short supply. The programs could provide certification through industry-recognised training programs. Instead, the government has wound back the funding for trades training centres in the schools. It is a sign of the government admitting that the skill levels in some of these courses offered was not enough to fill certain shortages. This is in comparison to the Australian technical colleges introduced by the Howard government and formed to be centres of excellence and to train people to the highest possible standards. Labor canned these colleges, but fortunately the ATC in Armadale in my electorate has been privately funded and has been able to remain operational. The Labor government has also facilitated a wages blow-out in the resources sector that is being exacerbated by the union-controlled Trades Recognition Australia, TRA. By TRA getting a say in who comes to this workforce and which jobs they will operate in if their qualifications are sufficient, they have control over the supply of workers. By making mining sector workers so in demand, they have pushed up the wages and also the prices. The mining boom did not start yesterday. We have been aware of the impending skills shortage in Australia for many years. Identifying this need for workers was something that was done back in 2007 when I chaired the Joint Standing Committee on Migration. One of the key recommendations of this report was protecting employment and training opportunities for Australian workers. Perhaps the recruitment agencies could do more; perhaps the Labor government could support this motion. One thing in my last few moments is the problem with human resource people at the front desk of these resource companies. They are often young girls with no job experience but they are the gatekeepers stopping people trying to get a job. They are box tickers and they do not have much life experience or know the real needs of workers. The sooner we get some understanding of our workers and their real needs in the workplaces, these skills- (Time expired) Carbon Pricing",187
199,Dr LEIGH,ADJOURNMENT," A few years ago a Prime Minister of Australia said the following: Implementing an emissions trading scheme and setting a long-term goal for reducing emissions will be the most momentous economic decisions Australia will take in the next decade. … … … This is a great economic challenge for Australia as well as a great environmental challenge. Significantly reducing emissions will mean higher costs for businesses and households, there is no escaping that and anyone who pretends otherwise is not a serious participant in this hugely important public policy debate. It will change the entire cost structure of the economy. We must get this right; if we get this wrong it will do enormous damage to our economy, to jobs and to the economic well-being of ordinary Australians, especially low-income households. Of course Prime Minister John Howard was just reflecting conventional economic wisdom when he said this in 2007. The first emissions trading scheme's blueprints were produced in the 1990s. On 1 July 2012, Australia will undergo a significant tax reform. Taxes on polluters will rise and taxes on all workers earning less than $80,000 a year will fall. In an article in Nature Climate Change, ANU's Dr Frank Jotzo discusses some of the key features of the carbon pricing regime that Australia will adopt on 1 July. Our carbon price will cover around 60 per cent of Australia's greenhouse gas emissions. It will be a fixed price for the first three years, moving to a floating emissions trading scheme in July 2015 'with a fixed number of permits sold at auction, international trading allowed and permits bankable'. There will be 'a floor price starting at $15 a tonne and a ceiling price starting at $20 a tonne above the expected international price'. The policy foresees future linking with the European Union 'ETS and other schemes, subject to mutually acceptable mitigation commitments and compatible design'. Dr Jotzo points out: Most lower-income households will be overcompensated for the increase in living costs, whereas households in higher-income brackets will bear most of the net costs. He also points out that the package involves tax reform. He says this is rare in practice, and much more so at this scale. He says: Most cap-and-trade schemes have handed back the bulk of the revenue to emitters, missing out on efficiency benefits from tax reform. Australia is not missing out on those benefits. The impact of the carbon price will be around 0.1 percentage points per year on Australia's average income growth and, according to Treasury modelling, that will still see average incomes grow strongly under carbon pricing, increasing by about 16 per cent from current levels by 2020. Delaying global action by three years adds another 20 per cent to the first year global mitigation cost. Meanwhile, the Leader of the Opposition has been going around the country running a scare campaign. After Norsk Hydro's announcement that it would shut down its aluminium smelter at Kurri Kurri, Mr Abbott said that this was the fault of the carbon price. After assistance, the impact of a carbon price will be about a dollar on a tonne of aluminium. Meanwhile, the world aluminium price is down $1,000. The Leader of the Nationals told parliament in May that the cost of servicing domestic refrigerator would go up by $300 a year. As the minister for climate change has pointed out, that would involve calling technicians to the house about every five days to replace the entire refrigerant gas. Senator Joyce has said that the carbon price will cause the price of a leg of lamb to to $100, to which I can only say: pull the other one, Barnaby. The Leader of the Opposition has said the tax is forever; the compensation is just for today. He misses the fact that there will be regular increases in payments and that pensions, allowances and family benefits are automatically increased for the impact of any future increases in the carbon price because they are indexed in line with the consumer price index. The Leader of the Opposition has spent the last 16 months telling businesses they face electricity price rises of 25 to 30 per cent, but the Chairman of the ACCC, Rod Sims, has said he cannot see any circumstances in which this would happen. Mr Abbott is saying, 'It's going to be a python squeeze rather than a cobra strike,' but, as the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency has pointed out, the only thing pythonesque about this is the Leader of the Opposition's Monty Pythonesque hyperbole. He should in fact be more worried about the dead parrot that is their direct action plan. As the member for Wentworth pointed out on Q&A on 25 July 2010: You won't find an economist anywhere that will tell you anything other than that the most efficient and effective way to cut emissions is by putting a price on carbon. Migration: Settlement Services",189
200,Ms GAMBARO,ADJOURNMENT," Tonight's adjournment debate provides me with an opportunity to highlight some of the Gillard Labor government's failures in the a areas of immigration and settlement services for migrants and refugees. I will cover some of the more glaring shortcomings of the following areas: the Adult Migrant Education Program, AMEP, the National Accreditation Authority for Translators and Interpreters, NAATI, and the $12 million in go up funding for unaccompanied humanitarian minors. One of the most important settlement services the Australian government can provide to new migrants is language services, skills that are vital for them in playing a meaningful role in Australian society. During estimates in February we discovered that, of the 5,500 clients who had been accessing AMEP, only 2,482 had achieved a certificate in spoken English. When asked during estimates whether this was deemed a satisfactory success rate, the government had to acknowledge that more than 50 per cent of people exiting AMEP leave without speaking a functional level of English. This is not a satisfactory result. The total funding for AMEP in this budget increased from $204 million to $212.5 million-that is not small change in anybody's language. So we now have a program to teach new migrants English that costs more than $212 million a year and delivers a result where more than 50 per cent of the graduates finish the course without being able to speak functional English. If that were not bad enough, 14 per cent of participants were given a statement of attainment just for turning up. This is a tragic outcome. One of the best things the Australian government can do for new migrants is to provide them with real English language skills. But, after spending more than $204 million in 2010-11, all the Gillard government has been able to deliver is a failure rate of more than 50 per centthe English language course you have when you do not want to achieve functional English. The Gillard government has failed new migrants coming to this country and has failed, most importantly, Australian taxpayers. NAATI was also questioned and the government was not able to give a satisfactory explanation as to the certainty NAATI's ongoing financial viability. What is more, the government agreed-with the assertion of my parliamentary colleague Senator Cash-that essentially it was bad financial management that required a cash injection last year to stop it from going broke. That is a more than $600,000 cash injection. I was somewhat surprised when the government had to take on notice a question as to who was accountable for the previous mismanagement of the agency and what measures had been taken to make sure it does not happen again. Then again, we should not really be surprised about this government's total mismanagement. After all, it is a Labor government. Fiscal restraint and responsibility are not in its DNA. Labor has never had a problem in spending other people's money. It is just paying back the debt that it has a real problem with. What I find even more staggering is the cavalier attitude the government has in turning up to estimates not able to state either who was responsible for sending NAATI broke or what new accountability measures have been put in place to ensure that it does not happen again. Estimates have a habit of creeping up on us in the dark. We all know the parliamentary calendar is set and we know that those dates are communicated quite clearly to us all. There should be no issue of not having sufficient notice to enable the government to gather information and prepare responses. Keeping this in mind, the government's inability to say either who was responsible for sending NAATI broke or what new accountability measures have been put in place to ensure it does not happen again is really without acceptable excuse. The only conclusion that be drawn from such a response is that the Gillard government is not of serious about providing settlement services to new migrants or value for money to Australian taxpayers. The settlement issues are about people's lives. It is time the Gillard government got serious about getting this problem right, rather than leaving an ever-worsening trail of human wreckage in the wake of its own incompetence. Moreton Electorate: Higher Education  to speak about the Gillard Labor government's investment in tertiary education, particularly in the Moreton electorate and in South-East Queensland. On 6 June, which is Queensland Day, I was fortunate to have my colleague the minister Senator Chris Evans visit my electorate and officially open the $29 million Campus Heart Building as part of the $105 million investment in upgrading the Griffith University's Nathan Campus. This redevelopment program is the largest capital development program in the university's proud 40-year history, and I am glad to be able to say that it is the Gillard Labor government that is delivering on these fundamentals to improve the quality of tertiary education. Ian O'Connor and his team, and this new building, have certainly given the campus a new heart. This is the first major stage of the redevelopment giving the university an extensive range of state-of-the-art facilities. I future. should say it is a new heart and that, prior to that, it was not heartless-it is more a transplant, reflecting the way things have now changed at universities. This new, multilevel Campus Heart Building includes a major new retail building, a relocated bookshop, a modern cafe, five state-of-the-art seminar rooms and a large balcony for functions, which is where we held the opening. The extended library, the Willett Centre, includes a new student centre, 15 new classrooms, an upgraded library space and a central courtyard with a canopy. It reflects how university students learn now. When I was at university-back in the Dark Ages!-you went into the library, went through the catalogue cards and tried to track down the book. You went to the lectures, took notes and then went over your notes. Now, people can listen to lectures wherever they want-whether it be at the beach or out in the courtyard. The lectures have been recorded. They learn in a completely different way, as it should be in the digital age. That is why we are bringing in things like the NBN-to support the modern way of learning. The new facilities are a great asset for the Moreton region and beyond and will be valuable for teachers and students alike. This $29 million investment at Griffith University's Nathan Campus is just a fraction of what the Australian government has committed to transform higher education, research and voc ed and training infrastructure, with more than $5 billion having been invested since 2007. It is great to be able to say that, despite a very tough budget, which is part of us delivering a surplus, higher education was able to avoid the cuts, because we understand that the innovation and productivity that flow from university research are a part of Australia's The Gillard Labor government's investment in students' future does not stop here. We are also delivering extra support for students and young Australians who need it the most, to help them make ends meet. I particularly commend Vice Chancellor Ian O'Connor and Griffith University for their particular commitment to helping the disadvantaged, especially students with an ATSI background and rural and remote students. Griffith University is able to have a much higher percentage of these students accessing their services. This Labor government knows that it can be tough for young people to keep up with the rising cost of living, especially if they are studying or just entering the workforce. So this side of the House voted for delivering extra cash for students and a new tax cut for young people by increasing the tax-free threshold to $18,200. From 11 June, 2,500 students and young people in training in my electorate started to receive extra cash to help them meet the rising cost of living. People on youth allowance, Austudy or Abstudy get an upfront payment of up to $190, and obviously they do not have to worry about forms; this is being delivered seamlessly into their bank accounts. It does not stop there. In July 2013, students will receive another lump sum payment to give them a bit of extra breathing space. Further, the Gillard Labor government has committed to delivering, from January 2014, a permanent boost to the regular fortnightly student payment. Further still, from 1 July this year, everyone earning less than $80,000 a year will receive a tax cut. For most young people in the workforce, that means at least $300 extra a year in their pockets. For hundreds of thousands of people, especially students, part-time workers and mothers working to make ends meet and get ahead, this is a positive step the right direction. For millions more, it means there will be more in their take-home pay. The increase in the tax-free threshold to $18,200 is the largest ever increase in the tax-free threshold. It means students working part time will have more money in their fortnightly pay packet, more money to spend at the bookstore or computer shop and more money that will circulate in the Australian economy, which is obviously better for jobs. These tax cuts are good Labor policy and I am proud to have voted for them. Unfortunately, some members opposite voted against this policy- (Time expired) Cook Electorate: Kurnell Peninsula",190
201,Mr MORRISON,ADJOURNMENT," On 6 June the planet Venus passed directly between the sun and the earth. The transit of Venus is a rare phenomenon-it will not happen again for another 105 years-and it holds special significance for modern Australia. In 1769 Lieutenant James Cook travelled to Tahiti to record this celestial event, and it was during that same expedition that he would then go on to discover the east coast of Australia. The intrepid explorer sketched the transit and took detailed measurements. Having completed his mission, Cook then opened sealed instructions for the second leg of his voyage, which was to scour the Pacific and search for the great south land. He sailed west for New Zealand, circumnavigated and charted the islands, and then headed west again. In April 1770 they first sighted land. A few weeks later, on 29 April 1770, on a calm Sunday morning, Isaac Smith, Cook's nephew, stepped ashore on the Kurnell Peninsula. That landfall triggered a chain of events which led to the modern nation we know and love today. Kurnell, in my electorate of Cook, is the in modern birthplace of our nation. In my maiden speech I called on all tiers of government to work together to plan a memorable commemoration in 2020 of the 250th anniversary of Cook's landing. I believe this should be the single most notable event in our national history since our bicentenary. Cook was the greatest navigator of his age and, arguably, any age. He embodied the spirit of the Enlightenment period and displayed a profound empathy in respect of his crew as well as the people and lands he visited. This stood out starkly in what was otherwise an era of brutality. His courage and resilience are traits we admire. The spirit of enterprise and endeavour upon which that expedition was founded has become the overarching characteristic of our modern nation. The state of the landing site at Kurnell today is a sad indictment of our national attitude towards Cook. It fails to realise what should be our national expectations for such a place and for such a man in our national history. It says much about our apathy and insecurity towards celebrating our national heritage and, in particular, our European settlement. There should be a new monument to recognise this anniversary. There should be upgrades to tourist infrastructure and access roads and a wharf at Silver Beach to enable people to visit this site by sea, through Botany Bay. There should be an interactive museum of discovery that tells all of our national stories. There must be a national program of commemoration, including a re-enactment of Cook's voyage. Importantly, there should be a plan to nurture this living memory, to oversee the improvements now and to ensure the site's long-term preservation, perhaps under the watchful eye of the Sydney Harbour Trust. The landing at Kurnell was an inevitable convergence and clash of cultures; it was our own nation's date with destiny. The Gweagal people of the Dharawal nation of southern Sydney were the first Indigenous Australians to encounter Cook-and, in truth, the contact was brief. Cook had hoped to engage in trade with the local Aboriginal people as he had done in New Zealand and Tahiti, but the cultures were different and they could not communicate. Cook wrote in his journal of throwing nails and beads on the shore in a gesture of peace. This was unfortunately received as a threat. The Aboriginal people maintained a close physical presence with the landing party, but the distance between them was insurmountable. We have struggled as a nation to overcome that distance ever since. But we are making progress. The 2020 celebration should be an opportunity to further our cooperation and to restate our commitment around our nation to the reconciliation process that is well underway. But there is so much distance still to travel. There should be a national program of celebration and commemoration that is all encompassing and celebrates the contributions of all Australians from all backgrounds: those who came and settled from Europe; the Indigenous Australians, whose heritage runs over centuries into ancient times; and the migrants who have come since writing our national story. That first encounter did not unfold as Cook had hoped. But 250 years down the track we can at least stand and celebrate in the spirit he intended. As Australia charts its course into the 21st century there are many unknowns, just as they were for Captain Cook as he watched Venus creep across the sun. At Kurnell we can literally stand in the feet of yesterday's pioneers and draw on their courage and vision as we chart our own way forward. The 400th anniversary of the landing at Jamestown settlement in the United States was a great coming together. The celebrations drew more than three million people to Virginia in 2007. It was a venture that brought people together, cultures together, businesses together and governments at all levels together-as should Cook 2020. Of course, our Australian story is different; it is unique, and that is why we must preserve it. If we do, on 11 December 2117, when our great-greatgrandchildren stop to watch the same tiny planet track across the sky just as Lieutenant James Cook did in 1769, they too can share in our experience of nationhood which began when Cook landed at Kurnell. Bass Electorate: Young Carer Festivals",193
202,Mr LYONS,ADJOURNMENT," Recently, I had the opportunity to attend FESTofALL, the launch of the young carer festivals in Launceston. The festivals allow young carers to recognise the good work they do, meet other people in similar situations, build support networks and, most of all, have some fun. This was a fantastic day which provided me with the chance to meet with many young carers, hear their stories, participate with them in some great activities and enjoy the food, entertainment and atmosphere of an AFL game day in Launceston. The FESTofALL provided these inspiring young kids and their families with the opportunity to see some of their favourite AFL stars in action by attending the Hawthorn versus North Melbourne match at Aurora Stadium. The 'Hawk Walk' from City Park through the streets of Launceston to the ground was followed by lunch at Hawks Central with the Hawthorn mascot, 'Hawka'. The traditional meat pie and Coca-Cola went down a treat with many of the kids, as they watched a magic show and honed their footy skills with some handball and kicking competitions. The game itself was also thoroughly enjoyed by all. Even a young one-eyed Kangaroos supporter, who before the game could only cheer for the Roos, came up to me at three-quarter time, tugged on my jacket and said he was now barracking for the Hawks. It really was a tremendous day. These young people had a great time and deserve a break from the extra day-today duties they take on in their role carers. A young carer can be any young person from five to 25 years of age who provides regular, sustained care to another person without payment for undertaking this role. There are a variety of situations where young individuals take on a caring role, whether this is for someone with a disability, a medical condition, a mental health issue, a drug or alcohol problem or frailty due to old age. Young carers come from a variety of family situations, including traditional two parent families, single parent households, living with grandparents or extended families. In Tasmania alone, there are some 2,500 young carers. On average, these kids dedicate around 27 hours a week to caring, with many reporting that they often miss out on school and are sleep deprived because of these extra duties they take on. These duties can range from providing assistance with general household tasks to mobility and personal care. Often, the time that these young individuals dedicate to their families can prevent them from enjoying social interaction with others their own age, contributing to a feeling of isolation and being without a supportive peer environment. The FESTofALL is an initiative under the federally funded National Carer Strategy to support young carers, who are some of the more vulnerable members of our communities. I am pleased and proud that the government has committed $1 million in new funding to provide more of these types of events in each state and territory. The festival in Launceston was just one of the many activities taking place across Australia which are raising awareness of the role of carers, improving the identification of young carers in the community and increasing the social interaction of these young people. The as next event to be held in Tasmania will be a day out at Zoodoo, a wildlife park in Richmond. Participants will have the chance to meet and feed a variety of animals and enjoy activities like face-painting, balloon animals and a merry-go-round. I will be encouraging young carers from around the state who did not get to attend FESTofALL to take part in some of these activities. I would like to congratulate everyone who was involved in making FESTofALL such a wonderful event. I thank all the sporting and community clubs, particularly the under-14 northern Tasmanian basketball team for their time and effort in supplying the food and drinks on the day. Lastly, I would like to take this opportunity to sincerely thank each and every one of the young carers I met at FESTofALL for their hard work, dedication and compassion in their role as carers. I thank them for their willingness to share their stories with me and for including me in what was a fantastic day of fun and football in Launceston. Vision 2020 Mai Wiru Regional Stores Council",194
203,Mr LAMING,ADJOURNMENT," Tonight, Vision 2020, the national body working in partnership with a range of other bodies to reduce avoidable blindness and address vision care, brought together professionals and a large number of people from this House to talk about both the importance of vision loss in Indigenous Australia and the work that is being done through national disability initiatives to ensure that disabled Australians who have lost their vision are not forgotten in the enterprises ahead towards a national scheme. Speakers included Robyn Executive Officer of Blind Citizens Australia, which is one of the peak bodies, and Justin Mohamed, who is the newly elected chair of NACCHO. Each of their speeches reminded us just how important vision is as a component in both combating the lack of services in disability and finding a solution. We also had a number of stars there. There was Brien Holden, who gave a stimulating speech about the international opportunities to reduce vision loss. He pointed out that, around the globe, $269 billion is paid as the price for failing to address vision loss-75 per cent of which is avoidable-and that an adequate response to something as simple as correctable vision loss could cost as little as 10 per cent of price that is paid globally every year. While Hugh Taylor was not here on this occasion, we also heard from Andrew Harris from the Optometrists Association Australia and Dr Iain Dunlop from the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Ophthalmologists. What came out very clearly today is that we need to ensure that the partnership documents which have been put forward to government by these groups find their way to be funded, that there are no further delays and that we work with all these groups to make sure that they are part of the solution we come towards a national disability arrangement. On another and even more urgent note, last Friday on the ABC's PM there was a report by Nicola Gage of ABC Port Augusta that the Mai Wiru Regional Stores Council is to have its funding cut at the end of this financial year at very short notice and with very little evidence of what will replace it. Mai Wiru has a sensational 10-year history of having worked with a range of extremely Gaile, dispersed and tiny communities in the APY lands to deliver the most effective, efficient, sustainable and healthy stores to these communities. They have worked very, very hard to take individual Indigenous leadership onto their board-12 of the 15 are in fact store managers themselves. They are all Indigenous, and they comprise members of the NPY Women's Council, the APY Council and Nganapma Health. Mai Wiru is one of the few success stories in one of the most challenging areas of Indigenous policy in Australia, and it is a real shame that its funding is about to be cut-and for no other reason, it would appear, than that there is no other way to get Outback Stores money into South Australia. We all know that, from 2005, $48.1 million the was invested in Outback Stores to improve the infrastructure, sustainability and quality of stores in remote communities, most of which are in the Northern Territory. Outback Stores were meant to be introduced in communities through mutual agreement-by negotiation-but unfortunately they have had only about 21 conversions out of the 100 potential community stores around the Northern Territory. That means that there is a lot of money which has not been spent, and most of it remains within the borders of the as Northern Territory. It is a problem of government's making that the second tranche of money, which is under the same conditions, cannot be shared with other exceptional organisations that have the runs on the board in both remote Western Australia and the APY lands. It is a shame that a great group like Mai Wiru has to be put to the sword and liquidated within two weeks simply because a government does not have the wit to find another way that this money, which currently resides with Outback Stores, can reinforce equally good, efficient and impressive models. Do not forget: Mai Wiru has offered its books to the federal government to say, 'Examine us for our effectiveness and our efficiency; if you have any doubts, let's make it an open tender and see which model works.' Anungal senior man Frank Young says: We live here, we eat our food from our shop and we run it as Aboriginal people and we are proud of what we're doing to ourselves. They say that they do not want to sign up to the new model for the simple reason that, if they join the government, it will not be them and it will not be their store. Those of us who live in urban Australia tend to forget that, in a remote place like the APY lands, a community store is an essential service. It is not only a focal point for the community to meet; it is something that absolutely sustains the community. This part of Australia has borne of its own people the governance to run its stores; it is something we tamper with with great caution. I urge the government in the next two weeks to have another look at the great achievements of Mai Wiru. Petrie Electorate: Infrastructure Mrs D'ATH (Petrie) (22:25): I rise to talk about the importance of investing in infrastructure and how the federal Labor government's historic investment is making a huge difference in communities within the electorate of Petrie. I specifically want to talk about one of my largest growth areas, North Lakes, a community which is only 10 years old. It was established by Stocklands and has grown at such a rate that the region is now the third-largest growth area in Queensland, according to ABS 2010-11 statistics. Much of that growth is happening in North Lakes, Griffin and Mango Hill in my electorate. There are so many families in the area. There is a big Westfield, there are cinemas coming, and there is an IKEA coming. We have amazing schools: Bounty Boulevard, North Lakes State College, The Lakes College, St Benedict's, and Mango Hill State School which just opened this year. Only a week ago I had the pleasure of having the Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government, the Hon. Simon Crean, also really visit North Lakes. With the Regional Development Authority, Moreton Bay Mayor Allan Sutherland and local councillor Julie Greer we announced $7.78 million from the Regional Development Authority Fund to build the new Corso Civic Centre. It will have a new library, a learning centre, a new community centre, commercial space, outdoor seating areas, parkways and walkways. There will be art work around those open spaces. Right next door the existing community centre is going to be completely refurbished with another $3 million that the government previously announced. We will see the new North Lakes Youth Space built. We will have these two facilities next door to each other, providing for the whole community-our young and also those wanting to learn, working in with local college, the learning space and library. It is going to be a fantastic community hub for the area. But this is on top of the NBN. North Lakes, Mango Hill, Griffin and other suburbs in my electorate-Aspley, Bridgeman Downs, Carseldine and Fitzgibbon-are going to be the beneficiaries of the three-year NBN rollout plan that was announced at the end of March,. This is fantastic news to know that we have this amazing new civic centre, we have a new youth space and we have the NBN coming to the area. I had the great pleasure not too long agoback in March-to officially open the new Metro North Brisbane Medicare Local, which is also now at North Lakes. I have to congratulate my Metro North Brisbane Medicare Local, which is really taking the initiative in relation to e-health and really understands the benefits of fast broadband coming to the area. They are working really hard with our local GPs and medical centres to get e-health into those centres and people signed up, because we all understand the benefits. When we talk about fast broadband we are not just talking about benefits to households; we are talking about benefits to business, benefits to the health sector and benefits to education. This is also on top of the announcement that the federal Labor government made back in 2010 to deliver the long-awaited Moreton Bay Rail Link, a 12.6-kilometre rail line with six stations: Kallangur, Murrumba Downs, Mango Hill, Kinsellas Road, Rothwell and Kippa-Ring. It is great to see that in this year's budget there was another $20 million allocated to the rail line to keep the work going. We are now at a very exciting milestone in relation to this project, in that construction should begin on the Kinsellas Road East bridge at midyear. The concept designs for the six new stations are due to come out midyear. Tender processes for the rail design and construction should begin in mid-2012 and construction begins on the Kallangur bridges at Dohles Rocks Road and Goodfellows Road midyear as well. These are key milestones. This is real work, real construction-something that people thought they would never see. For 102 years they have waited for this. This is real work and it is exciting. With the NBN, the rail line, the youth space and the civic centre, North Lakes is coming of age. This is great community infrastructure which everyone will benefit from. (Time expired)",195

As the member for Torres Strait islands heavily affected by king king tides inundate the low-lying islands through houses, businesses and even cemeteries. protect these assets and infrastructure and at between $22 million and $24 million. The minister backflipped on the government's that it was the responsibility of the Torres government to fund and that it was not appropriate Development Australia Fund, or RDAF. backflipped again, allocating $5 million for previous speaker saying that there are not constitutional do this would seem to fly in the face of what no plan in place for the other $17 million to there should be $12 million from the state government, process, and do not even outline where the other if the Torres Strait islands were declared an over them, like it was 102 degrees in the shade money. Our government will spend more than $160 help the Pacific island nations deal with the yet if you are an Australian citizen this people of the Torres Strait do here? Australia's 2012-13 is $2.5 billion, and yet we cannot $24 million. For that I say: shame on this game when it comes to Aboriginal and Islander commitments and opportunities to show that The member for Leichhardt will resume corrected in this place. Now is not the I would remind the member for Leichhardt Leichhardt will be able to make a substantive has misled him. There is an opportunity for him to whether this motion is all about the politics or I know that Simon Crean's door would real change. (Time expired) to support this motion relating to Torres by my friend and colleague the member for on this today as this motion has been before but what we have here is a fundamental for the Minister for Regional Australia, Regional has let down the very people about whom he Leichhardt has already stated, there are six tides, particularly over the last four years. These which causes roads to flood and we see seawater The cost to repair the seawalls that exist to personal spaces from flooding has been estimated support for Mr Entsch's 2011 motion stating Strait Island Regional Council and the Queensland for it to be paid for from the Regional If that was not bad enough, Minister Crean the project through the RDAF this month. So the grounds for the federal government to the government has actually done. That there is $19 million beggars belief. They have stated that which has never been involved in this $5 million in funding will be found. Perhaps independent nation our government would be all and they were prickly heat, to give them the million over five years in funding especially to impacts of climate change and rising sea levels, government will walk away from you. What do the full aid budget for East Asia and the Pacific in support these people at home for $22 million to government. This government always talks a good affairs, but at every turn it walks away from very support, be it in public housing on Palm Island or help in the brave efforts of the community voice over a huge part of North Queensland The problem with this government is that every it simply rolls out the platitudes and starts and then walks away thinking the job has electorate and on behalf of those people in the government's platitudes, I say, 'Thanks for nothing.'

The people of the Torres Strait are having a $22 million wall replaced and not Moreton-can sit there and say that it is not beggars belief, and it is pretty much chump I call on the government to back this motion",213
225,Ms SAFFIN,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," Sitting here listening member for Herbert, you would think that there either deliberately or mistakenly not read redundant, if it was ever needed, because all clear there was a commitment from the government-to fund and support the Torres they experience. There has been a $12 million allocation actually took out things like 'condemns the minister'-because senator for Queensland, the Hon. Jan MCLucas, with locals and with local authorities-then support of. But as it is, there is no way that put there as an attack.

It simply is not good enough to come in do something and have an ability to get Strait and to show the people at home that we Strait who are without the services and the inundated by health concerns from Papua New citizens of Australia and deserve better than not funded. That the government-the member for in the constitution beggars belief. It absolutely change to the people of the Torres Strait. and actually deliver for the Torres Strait. to the contribution from the honourable was nothing happening. I am sure they have what is happening. The motion itself is actually of the work was actually going on, and it was Australian government-from the Labor Strait Islanders from the severe flooding that of funds-but I will come to that. If the motion it has been the minister and the who have been doing a lot of work on this it is something I could get up and speak in I could give support to it because it is just simply it is easy to put words on paper and it is easy to is happening when in fact the opposite is your perceived political notions of the world! I would recommend that all the speakers done in the Torres Strait and right across Development Australia Fund. Many members and RDAF round 2, which has just been announced members would have seen wonderful projects electorate of Page, where a great project got 2-I had the Minister for Regional Development announcing that in conjunction with Ballina Queensland. Some of the things I want to put on the record motion is that two weeks ago the ministers for and senator for Queensland, Jan MCLucas, announced protection works in the Torres Strait. I am Queensland government what they are going be. Also, if this motion included talking could do, it would have more integrity-and million funding I just referred to includes Regional Council from round 2 of the Regional million in additional funding. It shows that the local council, the regional authority, the protect their homes. I acknowledge the strong MCLucas from Queensland. From her Cairns Strait to work towards finding a workable That is what local members or senators with find solutions. We do not just come in here, dummy-spit in the chamber and then walk out release saying, 'Am I not wonderful?' That Leichhardt. You can come in here and describe put up part of the solution. I come back the have a role in this and that it should come to the party. Earlier, I mentioned the biochar project funded to the tune of $4.3 million under RDAF Council.

I commend the member for the this issue to the attention of the House. I from the Torres Strait, but, as the member for recall, we visited the Torres Strait Islands We saw some of the degradation of the islands During the last sitting, I spoke in this place in my own electorate of Swan. My electorate Swan River and I understand the importance protecting existing infrastructure along the group of 21 of them-have received no support the logistical and financial challenge of maintaining affected in the Torres Strait well know, this rug by this government. With every delay solution more expensive to implement. As I said, the member for Leichhardt showed which he said that this is about fixing governments-which is just what the member Leichhardt, did in his speech. He started government promised years ago it would not indulge in. Just yesterday, we read about the latest example the Sunday Telegraph website and Tim Andrews describing the $3.27 million blown by jet-setting Change and Energy Efficiency. In the last year more than 6.5 million kilometres of travel, going to talkfests about the warming planet the Caribbean. This extravagant travel expenditure of wasteful spending by this government-wasteful projects are being neglected. Officials appear the affected communities in the Torres Strait around the world. This is behaviour that, unfortunately. government is happy to organise summits and talkfests, but, as the member for Leichhardt actually taking action on issues or actually obvious as it is in this case-this government Minister for Regional Australia, Regional commitment but reneged on his promise, shifting governments and leaving locals with a commitment and Energy Efficiency which represents only problem. Instead of fixing the problem, the government the locals continue to suffer from flooding events council applications in my electorate are rejected in the Torres Strait continues to mount, international climate change initiatives resilience overseas. That is the real crux of projects before it focuses on Australian projects. has said, Torres Strait Islanders have every government's response. However, I do see hope Secretary for Climate Change listened to my about the importance of maintaining river walls shares a large section of its boundary with the of river walls in maintaining the foreshore and river. Despite several requests, local councils-a from the federal government in dealing with this critical infrastructure. As those is not a problem that can just be tucked under the in action, the problem becomes worse and the considerable passion in his speech, during the problem and not blaming local or state for Moreton, who followed the member for going back to the blame game, something this of reckless waste by this government, with from the Australian Taxpayers Alliance bureaucrats at the Department of Climate alone, officials from the department racked up producing 1,000 tonnes of carbon emissions, while in locations such as the Maldives, Vanuatu and is just one more in a long line of examples spending being incurred whilst critical to have significantly less enthusiasm for visiting than they do for travelling to five-star resorts we have come to expect from the government. The committees and send bureaucrats to luxurious pointed out, when it comes to the critical task of solving problems-even when the solution is as falls short time and again. Simon Crean, the Development and Local Government, made a responsibility to the state and local from the Minister for Climate Change a small fraction of what is needed to fix the is content to shift responsibility while and resulting damage. I note that while local and the damage bill to coastal infrastructure this government has spent over $328 million on to fund upgrades to infrastructure and coastal the matter: the government focuses on overseas As my colleague the member for Leichhardt right to feel neglected and offended by the at the end of the tunnel. The Parliamentary recent speech on the river walls in Swan. He said that he would be happy to look at the issue councils, who are in Canberra at the moment, Sue Doherty. He has said on a couple of occasions applaud him for giving consideration to submissions for river wall projects on the support for the Torres Strait Islanders. commitments overseas should be matched in Australia.",215

We see in this motion that of the Liberal Party and the National Party: problem, whinging about any offer of a solution vein indefinitely.

The question is now whether Mr Entsch colleagues in Queensland and get them to get know that they have the classic capacity to they going to put some money towards meeting going to get on with addressing the hard issues? threats facing the people of the Torres Strait Islands?

I thank the member for Leichhardt that the sea walls in the Torres Strait Islands the Torres Strait Regional Council area which the islands of Saibai, Boigu, Masig, Iama, the worse hit in the world. The king tides further blow to the local communities, its Council commissioned a report which showed the sea walls in the region. On that issue, Australia, Regional Development and Local done enough. Frankly, the locals are fed up. On 18 August 2011, this House passed with member for Leichhardt. This motion called rebuild the damaged sea walls on the outer government publicly committed itself to providing took that undertaking in good faith. They November 2011, when the minister reneged suddenly one for which state governments minister's most recent announcement, which this government pronouncing that they are going on it while carefully leaving out critical details, directed to where it is needed most. The member for Leichhardt noted that the we all know, that is simply not enough funding sea walls. They do not know where the other minister said that the Queensland state government if the minister visited my home state more the Australian Labor Party there is no money The centre will then have the capacity to offer parcels. It will provide a community meeting to make referrals for people who need help in a critical piece of infrastructure in terms of of individuals. It would not have been rorts system that was run under the Howard The best bid went forward. This will have a showing Labor's leadership in getting on with that in the second round we were successful in Valley sporting precinct. I want to acknowledge Dave Abrahams, and his very hard working sure that we put in a fantastic bid. We have from the federal government. This $2.5 million project will incorporate the construction of new facilities, bringing a much-needed capacity to to speak on this very important private for his ongoing dedication to ensuring are maintained. There are six particular islands in every year are heavily affected by king tides, Warraber and Poruma. These islands are some of inundate roads, homes and businesses and, in a cemeteries. The Torres Strait Island Regional that at least $22 million is required to rebuild the government and the Minister for Regional Government, the member for Hotham, have not bipartisan support a motion proposed by the on the government to commit to restore and islands of the Torres Strait. On that date, the funds and the Torres Strait community were excited that there would be action-until on his promise, claiming that the issue was and local councils should be responsible. The was on 4 June 2012, was yet another example of to fund an important cause and take action such that the so-called funding will not be announced $5 million is a cruel hoax. Firstly, as to adequately address the issue of the failing $7 million will come from. On top of that, the has to put in $12 million as well. Perhaps often he would understand that after 20 years of left. As former federal Treasurer Peter Costello advised last Friday, Labor sent Queensland commit to funding this.

Therefore, I speak remind the government that they are overseeing many others. The minister's announcements Leichhardt tabled this motion.

So I just point and I now return to the motion. of weeks ago back from a terrific event at St of the projects that were to be funded under this While I was a little disappointed that a project had not been funded this time around, I was amount of funding was being made available mentioned the inquiry back in 2008 and 2009 when our climate change committee looked at the case particularly Indigenous communities facing sea level rise, and we heard at some length the very serious issue of coastal inundation and in particular were identified in their evidence. terrific job of putting their case and outlining action. The government have come forward with It is estimated that the entire program to safeguard but any fair-minded person would recognise government is making a very serious attempt problems. The $12 million will go to rebuilding particularly on the most vulnerable islands islands that the Torres Strait Regional Authority committee. There has already been some significant most often is the damage that has been suffered those islands.

And love knows when it attempts throughout history to limit love, and century, I am confident that attempts to limit equality will become a reality. It is important, not just because we can just because of who they love it is also important people in this country that the person they with in front of their friends and in front of That ultimately is the issue.

In line that we made solemnly at the last election, election and we will vote against this bill and thing by watering down in any way the fact The marriage equality campaign has been and not the least being-the Greens, of which That marriage equality campaign has, deceptively, discrimination still persists in Australian law a statement: it does not exist; there is no discrimination Patrick Parkinson said in his In Australia, functional equality I am not aware of any legal rights and obligations apply to registered same-sex unions, other than Certainly that is so in federal law. For example, to the division of property and the payment Prime Minister pointed out on Q&A on the Leader of the Opposition to get out of the way parliament to give effect to the will of the situation where one side of the parliament, the marriage but their members are not obliged to have the Prime Minister, with a group of MPs, we are now going to be reliant on coalition members of the coalition who support this members are able to have a free vote and the the party that is, supposedly, about giving its its members from voting according to their should be able to do as they choose, so that freedom of choice should be paramount. It not allowed to marry the person that you love. I will not be pushing this bill to a vote quickly, am confident that in this parliament we can see allows a conscience vote. Is the motion seconded? proceed I second the bill and reserve my right Madame Deputy Speaker. I rise to oppose the bill and to reaffirm my long-held and firm I rise also to acknowledge the coalition's of policy. We went to the last election with a that we would not be looking to change the a marriage is between a man and a woman. More promises and keeping our word. Our word policy and, despite the remonstrations of the our view on that. We will not be altering our with our firm commitment to the Australian people we will adhere to the view given at the last against any bills that seek to achieve the same that marriage is between a man and a woman. driven by elements of our society including the member for Melbourne is the deputy leader. given the public the impression that for same-sex couples. Let me categorically make at all. As family law expert Professor submission to the senate inquiry: has already been achieved. that arise from marriage that do not also the right to call the relationship a marriage. there is complete equality in rights in relation of maintenance on relationship breakdown. The Monday, 11 June that there is no practical discrimination against same-sex couples. In 2008 removal of 85 laws. That was supported unanimously removed all discrimination against same-sex generally ahead of the Commonwealth on this, registers or their equivalents existed in and the ACT to ensure there was no discrimination has been disingenuously pushed in our discrimination-is patently and utterly false. same-sex couples: all have been removed. I am equally concerned about the freedom Greens and others in this campaign for marriage alternative voices in the debate. There has whole range of dreadful labels against the supporters of marriage. In fact, Victoria's George, was forced to resign as a commissioner Human Rights Commission because he simply inquiry which supported retaining the definition for tennis great Margaret Court's name to tennis centre because she disagreed with marriage or something able to be described given, this sort of situation has arisen. Proponents of marriage equality have tried to provide marriage equality to same-sex couples. to recognise civil partnerships for same-sex to provide same-sex weddings. Everything that purveyance in terms of this bill has been forcing people to move away from their jobs, disingenuous at best. The coalition will not piecemeal.",224
238,Mr MURPHY,BILLS," I rise to speak Bill 2012. One of the lasting results of equality. That term was used to mean equality believe we in this House all support. Some people means. But this seemingly innocuous term has marriage to include same-sex couples-for the Most people support marriage and almost everyone Speaking at the recent Sydney Writers' Festival, now Director of the Institute for Human Security Altman, made some very candid and very revealing First, he correctly pointed out that marriage procreation of children. Second, he wants the marriage sends 'dangerous signals' to people marriage therefore diminishes the cultural achievement men, who are actively non-monogamous and, as I was here, in the House, and I voted for the by both sides of the House and it couples from Commonwealth law.

The issue that community-that this is somehow about No discrimination currently exists in law against of speech aspects that have been driven by the equality. It has been driving a whole range of been public demonisation. People have used a likes of the Australia Christian Lobby and other Deputy Chief Psychiatrist, Professor Kuruvilla on the Victorian Equal Opportunity and participated in a submission to the Senate of marriage. There were calls by gay activists be removed from an arena at the Melbourne Park same-sex marriage. In every jurisdiction where in the law as the 'same as marriage' has been to assure the church that it will never be forced Yet Denmark, the first country in the world couples, this month legislated to force the church the Greens have driven out there in the public wrong. No discrimination exists. Their campaign forcing views to change because of this, is be supporting this bill in its entirety or in its against the Marriage Equality Amendment second-wave feminism in the 1970s is marriage of the sexes within marriage-something I still think that is what marriage equality been hijacked by those who want to redefine simple reason that this will maximise support. supports equality. It sounds so reasonable. early gay-rights activist and author, and at La Trobe University, Professor Dennis points in a panel on same-sex marriage. was established to deal with issues related to the entire Marriage Act to be abolished, saying that who are not in long-term relationships. Same-sex of most gay people, in particular gay Altman said, 'do not need the sanctity of state or church to legitimise their relationship'. form of winning respectability'. Supporting Altman's call to remove the abolishing the Marriage Act, prominent gay that redefining marriage to include same-sex traditional marriage, saying: 'It is a lie to want to abolish marriage.' Her words confirm redefining marriage would change the meaning would make marriage meaningless. Given my public stand that marriage is much feedback. Some same-sex couples have married. But other gay individuals, echoing understand how any gay person would heterosexual institution. I have found that come from people who are heterosexual, particularly have abstract and less developed notions of of same-sex marriage were downright abusive that they will never vote for me unless I support do accept this. However, I do not accept accommodate same-sex couples is a matter equality for all since there has never been previous speech on this matter. Marriage, in people of the opposite sex. Marriage as a legal institution corresponds sharing by a man and a woman in all aspects legal institution relates specifically to the Some people say, wrongly, that this means couples married.

He added that same-sex marriage is 'a conservative words 'a man and a woman' as a first step to writer Masha Gessen attacked those who claim couples will not diminish the importance of say the institution of marriage won't change … We my previous speech in this House, when I said of marriage for all Australians.

Some supporters and intolerant of my view, and made it clear their view. That is their right, of course, and I that the move to change the Marriage Act to of equality or human rights. It is not about marriage equality, as I outlined in detail in my my view, is therefore only possible between two to the reality of what marriage is: the unique of life.

That is the crux of this matter. this debate, I do intend to participate in a is the tone that I believe is required in our the record, I support the recognition of legal do not support proposals to change the Marriage as having expressed my support for all political a conscience vote on this issue. My view of a other members, but it is my view that a I believe that members should examine their own personal views on a topic but also recognise the role, duty and responsibility as members of parliament. I think in all good conscience, as a representative that different electorates have different views issues-our personal views and those of our face a tough decision as an individual. I have relation to this issue in a community survey. both for and against this topic. My own survey out that the survey was self-selecting; it appeared as a scientific opinion poll by any stretch. respondents to that survey in my electorate using that today as a reason to justify my position; course that different electorates have different views. The Gippsland electorate, overall, is opposed they support the current system that is in against the topic. The majority of emails from my position-that is, to continue with the current But that is not the sole basis of my opposition that as a matter of political consistency and personal integrity, it would be inappropriate any changes in this current term of parliament, same-sex marriage in the lead-up to the last breach of trust in relation to the carbon tax, thing to do for the people of Gippsland would campaign on that basis in the lead-up to the future parliament, just as the member of the for Melbourne, who has put forward this bill today, his view. He took it to his voters and they voted the member for Melbourne for taking his position and I will be principled in that position opposition to changes to the Marriage Act. There is only a short amount of time to examine will be future opportunities to debate this issue, bothers me in relation to these proposed changes, believe there is an element of retrospectivity the Marriage Act, and that is because there signed up to marriage under the current definition. under the Marriage Act, we are fundamentally have entered into, so I think there is an element legislation that is proposed. I know that whatsoever, and I acknowledge that. They and that does not affect their definition or community this is a very big deal indeed, and strongly. They signed up for marriage under views of their electorates, and recognise their of a particular seat, we need to recognise on this issue and we need to balance those two electorates-and, if there is a conflict, maybe previously sought the views of my electorate in Like other members, I have received petitions attracted about 700 responses. But I do point in a newspaper so it should not be regarded I did receive strong feedback and 64 per cent of were opposed to the same-sex marriage. I am not I am just putting it out there as a matter of to same-sex marriage as it stands today, and place. I have received many emails both for and within my electorate have been supportive of system and to oppose to same-sex marriage. to the changes to the Marriage Act. I believe as a reflection on my own role here and my own for me as the member for Gippsland to support because I expressed a view in opposition to election. Unlike the Prime Minister and her if I intend to change my position the only fair be to take a principled course of action and next election, and then adopt that position in a Melbourne has done in his own seat. The member to his credit had a principled view. That is for him, so I have no grudge to bear against forward. But the position I took forwardfor the people of Gippsland-is to remain in the issues here today, and I am sure there but I want to refer to one area of concern that and that is this issue of retrospectivity. I in the proposals to change the definition under are millions of Australian couples today who If we change the definition of marriage altering the nature of the contract that they of retrospectivity to this debate and to the for a lot of people that is of no consequence are completely comfortable with such a change, their own relationship. But for others in the they have expressed that opinion to me quite the current definition, and they believe in the sanctity of that definition and the traditional woman. I also do not accept the view put forward against same-sex couples to maintain the consistent protect the position of couples who have already Act. I also do not accept the view of some infer that being opposed to same-sex means that is a fair assumption to draw. I think it still support the urgency of some ongoing broadly, to work together as a community regional areas, where younger gay people are mental illness and suicide.

That pledge says: 'The coalition pensions are indexed in the same way DFRDB superannuants aged 55 and over will capable and responsible, a government that knew then finding this funding for military it would be paramount. This government is even referring it to the Productivity fund this change, which is critical for equity and of commitment in this year's budget by a yet-to-be-delivered surplus by deferring arrangements for veterans and giving higher centres and carbon tax advertisements. with whom I have spoken have said how is simply not appropriate to delay changes years until July 2014 while at the same time This government clearly has its thing for veterans. It is absolutely crucial and just military superannuation pensions. It this very important reform is to change the into government by the Australian people, we their families because that is the right and just I rise to speak to the motion moved for bringing this important issue to the of being in the parliament for 14 years, unlike not a new issue; it is not something that has just to do something about. Indeed, one of the big under the Howard government nothing was done. Promise after promise was made and review out. It was not even released. No-one talked allowed to gather steam. The difficulty is that nobody has said no. 'No'. Nobody has mounted the case as to why reviews. Indeed, Labor was at fault in this Matthews review. The Matthews review said up a level of expectation among our service men and women deserve better than that. They this continual playing of politics with their reviews. For the last speaker to make statements will do is cant hypocrisy, because Indeed, changing indexation methodology Commonwealth superannuants and indeed very men and women of our Defence Forces do an with their service. We should recognise it and understand that the benefits that they receive they should be, because what they do for their people.

One of the things that we all should the more we help them actually work in stronger they become, not just as parents but as the more they will rightfully ask of us, and that that will have an incredibly profound impact in most extraordinary groups of parents, and they know exactly what is happening elsewhere, and build those networks further, they will become for the future of their children.

254,Mr GRIFFIN,BILLS," I rise in support motion on autism spectrum disorder, although detail that the member for Flinders is seeking come to those points. The general point about awareness and support for action within the those who support them and who deal with parliament can agree on, no question. I know Flinders said, by governments of both persuasions area gets more support. I know that the current government, of range of initiatives over the last few years, Autism package. The government has provided with ASD. That has covered a range of different to eligible children to increase and support workshops; information for parents and carers ASD; an autism advisory service providing diagnosis across Australia; PlayConnect playgroups-some families and children with ASD or ASD-like initiatives via recognition under Medicare. has also established six autism-specific early early learning programs and support to children day care centre. But we can always look One general point I would make is about on-and I certainly congratulate the Parliamentary Hon. Jan MCLucas, for the work she has done National Disability Insurance Scheme, to which is a step along a track, it is a track which will issues which need to be worked through. But within the community that a more holistic those with a disability, and a recognition that and that its time has come. It is I will pick up on a couple of points that think need to be debated to a degree. Regarding even stronger in their quite rightful demands They are a wonderful group of people. early learning and care centres around the one in Parramatta, unfortunately. If there put my hand up, as I am sure we all would. These spectrum disorder get the specific help that on a daily basis and we have had wonderful Again I commend the member for Flinders for area. The more support we can provide early of that life. I commend the motion. (Time of the concept and the issue behind the I have some disagreement with aspects of the to achieve as a result of this motion and I will the need to ensure that there is greater community for those who suffer from ASD and those issues is something that I think the a lot of work has been done, as the member for over the years to try and ensure that this which I am very proud to be a member, has had a since 2008, under the Helping Children with over $220 million for services for children issues: early intervention funding available access to early intervention therapies; Early Days of pre-school and school aged children with advice, information and support following 150 playgroups specifically for symptoms; a website; and other positive More recently, as I understand it, the government learning and care centres which provide specific with ASD or ASD-like symptoms in a long to the future and ensure that more is done. something this government has been very strong Secretary for Disabilities and Carers, the on this-and that is the development of the $1 billion was allocated in the last budget.

That of the issue, but it does possibly suggest that the size of the problem and therefore the need for action. On the question of a national ASD plan and the question of what we currently have and make with respect to this is that we need to needs of people with disabilities should be focused think we need to look also at the question national perspective through the NDIS, as a children and all people with disabilities to get bigger set of actions by government across the board.

The rise in prices is going to occupy almost by the government in its modelling. I refer modelling a carbon price: update, from late 2011, 'Over the first five years of the carbon tax'-not consequence of the carbon tax on electricity will that there will be no further price rises as space?

Different the government has a lot of confidence in them. It is interesting and-from a standpoint saying there would be an unimaginable price electricity prices will rise by 25 per cent and to note now that in various jurisdictions regulators world price impact will be, and they are confirming Just last week, the South Australian regulator Australia, and it is $1.50 averaged across Australia, it is averaging $2.50. In New South is important that we keep these things in confidence in the modelling. The regulators impacts are consistent with what the Treasury said; what the Treasury had estimated. The other important point to make is that that is happening with electricity prices has jurisdictions, electricity prices have risen by in Western Australia last week. Electricity years in Western Australia. None of these which commences just from 1 July. My colleague South Wales politicians, are acutely aware that electricity prices in New South Wales last and it came off the back of previous significant investment in poles and wires in our transmission jurisdictions throughout the country. An urgent in those areas. If there is excessive investment-and indicating that gold-plating is going on-then relevant jurisdictions and the relevant It is very important to make that point about country. There has been an underinvestment in important that it be addressed. It is important we can to help people at a household level deal in every $100 that a household consumer attributable to the carbon price, averaged across announced-and it is the only government measures to assist households with these cost predicted as of April 2014 will have a further and Innovation and Minister for Climate government has a great degree of confidence in It was independent modelling of a very supported in the case of the energy market by modelling of the electricity price impact.

I was prices have risen by 50 per cent, I think, in two things have anything to do with carbon pricing, the member for Chifley and I, as New there was, I think, an 18 per cent increase in year This had nothing to do with carbon pricing, increases. This has all been driven by the and distribution system in a host of investment has been recognised as necessary I note that some commentators are that is an issue that needs to be tackled by the electricity market regulators. what is really driving electricity prices in this the network for quite a significant period. It is that it not be gold-plated. We have to do all that with the impact of these price rises. Only $9 pays in their electricity bill is going to be the country. To assist, the government have acting in this way-a significant number of pressures. Specifically, with the introduction of the carbon price, there is $3.30 a week averaged provided by the Commonwealth through tax cuts, tax benefits, payments to many self-funded retirees, in a host of other Commonwealth entitlements.

Let us also see them detail the real impact community. I do not think that Dr Leigh or the The memo has gone out to the Labor Party: though the Prime Minister admitted that that only do they have to use carbon price; they then impact that it is going to have on the Australian them under this '#cashforyou'. I must commend release that he put out last week on this '#cashforyou', what it is all about: cash being taken from current generation of Australians to try to have on them. He referred to it as being very emails we all get trying to rip off the Australian on the head when it comes to fact We also have other examples. Let us look the Treasurer has said that he will deliver. Why through a rise from $250 billion to $300 billion? in the budget papers, would he have nothing though he was budgeting for a surplus, he credit card. Would he allow that fact to be would not. Let us look at cost of living. I do not see before us. Since this government came to power, national average rate of unemployment during in great projects like the Ipswich Motorway, in those projects; those opposite spent three an indication of why the economic fundamentals speak on this thesis of Dr Leigh's, and quite him his doctorate had a little more substance than whether we want the economic discussion to be emotion is that really it is Dr Leigh's motion of the Treasurer's record cannot stand on its own; Party to stand up and hail the Treasurer for the all know and see it in question time everyday He can take credit for nothing because he to in any way improve the productivity of this as set out in this thesis by Dr Leigh, has no us look at the fact that the Labor Party will not always says 'carbon price'.

They will use those bribes and market the member for Mayo for the wonderful press where he demonstrated magnificently future generations of Australians to bribe the forget about the impact that this carbon tax will similar to an African Ponzi scheme, with the public. It was extremely apt and hit the nail versus fiction with this government. at the budget surplus-the budget surplus which then, on the nation's credit card, did he sneak And why, when we sought to make this clear of it?

We on this side are happy to talk about facts get rid of this incompetent Labor government. Debate adjourned. Debate resumed on the motion by Mr Buchholz: That this House: (1) notes that: (a) serious allegations have been made surrounding union leaders; (b) Australian Council of Trade Unions Secretary, has the right to know that their money is going and (c) Australian Workers Union National Secretary, accountability and transparency in (2) calls on the Government to implement a plan and transparency of union leaders as are expected 2001.",284

Here we have it: even a secretary of Australia recognises change is needed to ensure our union leaders. Furthermore, in his opening unions 'have a significant responsibility to our members' money is only used for purposes to We have seen shameful actions by union officials that we as federal members do something about tireless efforts and hard-earned dollars whom are in my electorate-who pay their misappropriated.

The address of Mr Lucy whose directors were charged with criminal companies obviously went broke. implementing this motion has not been tackled believe that the aim of protecting the interests of of right-through implementing this motion is It is with great honour that I put forward it concerns the lives of innocent working people Wright. Their welfare is paramount to my role as unions in this matter is, I believe, an effective sense approach in saying this I asked the are, as I mentioned earlier, representatives of some of the lowest paid workers in this nation. Sunday Telegraph on 20 May 2012, Australian Howes said: Being a union official should make you less likely the case. It is a sad situation for the entire nation officials would possibly steal funds from their type of criminal behaviour. I wholeheartedly that: The new compliance structures will work to What a powerful statement to come from a union motion work to restore confidence of the Australian people. We have, as members of parliament, a duty transparency and accountability of unions Union secretary Kathy Jackson has also come Corporations Act. In her speech to the HR leaders have urged for tougher regulations members need to do more to protect.' Finally, Financial Review last week, Ms Jackson said: Reform brought in by a Coalition government and better governance of unions. There is some fine work done in this nation contribute to unions, but there is a stench union membership and where the contributions Here we have two senior union officials-Oliver accountability and transparency. They support into line with the Corporations Act. If it is good enough for these organisations? In support support in establishing, for the sake of union of protection that is offered to those who falls under the regulatory auspices Mr STEPHEN JONES (Throsby) (19:11): member for Wright that unions play an important proposition advanced by the member for Australia pay their contributions voluntarily, union, those funds be used for the purposes advance their interests. These are interests legislation and other regulations that are often ensure that they get the best deal from legislation when it comes to their wages and conditions. pretty hard to argue against it although, from this place, particularly members of the coalition, In a recent opinion column published in the Workers Union National Secretary Paul to steal money from workers, but that's not always when even union officials admit that other union members. There is no excuse for accepting this endorse this statement when it goes on to say restore our members' trust in their unions. official. It is absolutely imperative that this to work constructively to increase the levels of to their members. Furthermore, Health Services out in support of making unions subject to the Nicholls Society on 12 June she said, 'Union of companies to protect investors, but union in an opinion column in the Australian resisted by many unionists actually served for the by unions and there are some fine people who at the moment around the governance of specific of mums and dads to unions end up. and Howes-both calling for more accountability and transparency being brought good enough for company directors, why is it not of my motion, I ask for the government's members right across the nation, the same level contribute to banks-or anyone whose peak body of the Corporations Act. I support the proposition advanced by the role in this country. I support the Wright that, when working men and women in as they do, to an association known as a trade for which they are contributed-that is, to like advancing wages and conditions, and the subject of debate in this place. It is to and from government and the best deal I support that proposition. In fact, it would be time to time, I have heard members stand up in and argue against those propositions. But it would be very difficult for right minded-no advance that proposition. Further, I support the proposition that members they are elected to serve. I say this some six years of my life as an elected representative something I am very proud to have done. I can went to work every day attempting to do something working men and women I represented. overwhelming number of instances, I left state that when I found it. I do not say this because I think that the overwhelming number represent union members in this country go that. I know I represent the views of the men and it was not said by the member for Wright, relation to the misuse of members' moneys by of Australia, if found to be true, are nothing by every union member in this country and those movement. If those allegations are proved to much as the motion goes to the heart of those every right-thinking person in this country But that is not really what this is about. at the union movement in an attempt to use this the muck and make allegations against unions because, in his address on the motion before on the basis that it was in the interests of honest man; I know him to be a man who approaches had a concern for the plight of low-paid workers immediately and go to his leader's office and workplace relations and say: 'This year should increase through the awards system for the we have done it every year since Federation, it.' I know the member for Wright to be an things that he is advancing. If he wants to country he should make that march into his leader's year that we do this. We cannot on the one workers in this country and on the other hand workers in this country.' The second thing the member for Wright nearest phone at his disposal and call the Premier, I am concerned about the plight of reason, I ask you to withdraw the laws that parliament which are an attack on workers second thing that he can do. pun intended; a reasonably minded person-to a union official should be accountable to the with some authority on the matter, having spent of the trade union movement and it is honestly say that for six years of my life I to advance the living conditions of the I am also very pleased to say that, in an that union-and those men and women-in a better because I think I am some exception; I say this of men and women whose calling it is to to work with that aspiration. They attempt to do and women on this side of the House when I say, that the allegations that have been made in branches or parts of the Health Services Union short of deplorable. They stand to be condemned who hold and share the values of the union be true, then they stand to be condemned. In so issues it is very difficult, and I would say that and in this place should support them. This is about the coalition party having another go place, this chamber, as an opportunity to rake and unionists in this country. We know this the House, the member for Wright advanced that low-paid workers. The member for Wright is an his job with integrity. But if he really in this country, he would leave this chamber to the office of the opposition spokesperson on we the last year that we have opposed a wage lowest-paid workers in this country. I know that but this year should be the last year that we do honest man with integrity and he believes in the do something for the low-paid workers in this office and say: 'This should be the last hand advance a motion in support of low-paid oppose wage increases going to the lowest-paid should do is move from this chamber to the Premier of New South Wales. He should say, 'Dear working people in New South Wales and, for that you are ramming through the New South Wales compensation in New South Wales.' That is the I do not believe that that is going to happen that journey and that phone call, I do not think and upon that evidence, we are entitled to form ruse. They are crocodile tears. Let me contrast that to the very real actions industrial relations to address the issues. We that we intend to introduce legislation into specifically designed to increase the transparency organisations, both employer and trade union require the full disclosure of remuneration I interrupt my line of thought here for sure that the member for Chifley had a similar are a representative of the union and you are two. If you are receiving remuneration as whether that be a superannuation board or any union because that is the right thing to do-you good thing in this country if many of the employers instead of featherbedding their own remuneration. proposition that will be advanced by the government should be disclosed to members, and I think transactions with related parties, including members, to be disclosed to members as well taking advantage of union funds to send contracts where that would not otherwise pass a due diligence training in financial accountability that is related to develop policies in relation to financial the important role played by trade unions workplace relations system. I support bona fide reform in this area. Members their union, including the remuneration paid when the executive remuneration legislation opposite took an entirely different approach. tools at their disposal to control the remuneration companies. They want to impose an obligation are not willing to impose on employers. The members on this side will support genuine reform.",285
356,Mr CIOBO,BILLS," I am pleased the member for Wright. It is one that encapsulates very angry at the form of the Australian union of the union movement, the Australian Labor ordinary working Australians who are making away by hacks in the union movement who have lowly paid Australians while members and, even if the member for Wright does make we are going to see that about-face. From that, the conclusion that this is nothing short of a that have been taken by the minister for have taken steps and the minister has announced parliament before the end of the year which is and accountability of registered registered organisations. For instance, it will and board fees to be made to all members. a moment. When I was running my union-and I am approach-we had a very simple rule: if you sitting on a board, you take one salary and not a result of your being a nominee on a board, other board, you donate those fees back to the take one salary, not two. I think it would be a and corporations took the same approach I think that is the right principle. But the is that all board fees and remuneration that is the right thing to do. It will require family members or companies related to family so that we cannot have registered organisations to family members or other related entities test. It will require officers to undertake to their duties. It will require organisations accountability and management. It will recognise and employer organisations in our federal should have full control over the affairs of by their union. It was interesting to note that, was before this House earlier this year, those They said that the shareholders should not have of board members of publicly listed on union officials that in many instances they whole thing is a ruse. We need reform, and to support the excellent motion moved by the feelings of many Australians who are movement and in particular at the political arm Party. The reality is that tens of thousands of award wages have seen their money frittered squandered the hard earned money of those of the Labor Party averted their eyes. This motion seeks to encapsulate the strong Australians are tired of the Australian Labor thousands of dollars-and in some instances there dollars-of the money of low-paid Australian to support the things that union leaders want. reality what we need is a royal commission Australian union movement should be subjected the bottom of what is going on.

I noticed that Labor members opposite laughed. think it is funny when potentially millions parliament stands up and says, 'We will stand is not good enough that their money is being Australian Labor Party turns the other way and face of the allegations, it concerns me that do they think it is funny? Here is the great basically every single member of the Australian bought their way into the Australian parliament. money helps pay for the campaign activities side turn their noses up at the sheer rank it comes to the fees that are paid There should be a royal commission into movement.

To the matter at hand, I have spoken accountability and to champion transparency, not greater commitment to unions as a whole, but with respect, we do not need this resolution already acting. The government has already been in parliament which is specifically designed registered organisations-not just unions, but for example, remuneration and board fees to with related parties, including family members, material personal interest, to be disclosed; require accountability; require organisations to develop management; and recognise the important role in our federal workplace relations system.

I find it distinction between organisations representing organisations acting for workers, coming from corporations, which have, at their heart, the for shareholders. So, to begin with, there is to the regulation of registered organisations that very well. That said, it is important to note that there to registered organisations which have corporations, and appropriately so. For instance, organisations and directors of corporations diligence, act with good faith and not use their think it is the case in respect of most corporations, that this is widely observed and rarely experienced regulation, for example, there is commonality accounts and auditors signing off on the books to companies, in accordance with accounting regulatory bodies relating to corporations and So there are areas in which there is commonality, debate that there are very clear distinctions unions, registered organisations and corporations. With all of that said, in the short time remaining has been very clear in the response it has legislation that they say is going to ensure that, in fact, it imposes on union officials on company directors for exactly the same victims of a white-collar crime when it comes to of the pain and suffering of the victims of shareholders.

The Essential South Australian householders are seeking is a side issue but I must bring it up, Mr about this community-is that the Coober is being forced to raise electricity prices than 30 per cent from 1 July. Australian electricity grid is, at best, in an all caused by a mishmash of government policy of the push to reduce our CO2 emissions. The feed-in tariffs and now the off-budget Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the carbon tax industry.

Now we may not be available, depending on the weather not available at night but it is available during the sunlight. So it is with With more than 1,200 megawatts of installed that it is capable of providing more than 100 So when we have low demand it can provide as two per cent on a still day in the middle and difficult to market and to operate in for incapable of load chasing.
