2,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to the 98th Inter-Parliamentary Union Conference held in Cairo and bilateral visit to Kuwait from 5 to 21 September 1997. The 98th InterParliamentary Union Conference debated and discussed a range of topics including the preservation of democratic processes, employment in a globalising world and the sexual exploitation of children. On all accounts, this was a very successful conference from the point of view of the Australian delegation. Not only was Australia successful with its item on the sexual exploitation of children, but we managed to provide a delegate onto every drafting committee. Two of these drafting committees were chaired by me and the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair). It is our intention that all Australian delegations participate as fully as possible in each conference and it is to the credit of the Australian delegation that we are regarded as a key contributor to the work of the IPU. This should be seen in the context that we are but one of l30 countries that regularly attend each conference. I was also called on to participate in, and subsequently chair, the special committee on the question of the affiliation of Palestine the union. The committee had the most difficult, unenviable and sensitive task of formulating a resolution which was to be c-nsidered by the IPU council. Unfortunately, thIS r-solution was not considered by the councIl because a group within the IPU sought to have this difficult matter again deferred until the next conference. I have commented on this matter in more detail in the report. In our last report to the parliament, we made a number of recommendations concerning the operation and finances of the IPu. These recommendations were conveyed to the IPU secretariat in Geneva with a request that they be responded to at the Cairo conference. To his credit, the Secretary-General did respond and in so doing has agreed to introduce program budgeting so as to more closely monitor IPU finances. With regard to our concern about the establishment of a New York office, the Secretary-General said that excellent terms had been concluded in relation to leasing a property near the United Nations headquarters. The outgoings were not expected to impact on current IPU finances. He also believed路 that the New York office would provide a suitable vehicle whereby all resolutions passed by the IPU could be reported to the wider United Nations forum; this was another concern raised by the Australian group in its last report. !he delegation also took the opportunity whIle in Egypt to visit the Commonwealth War Cemetery at EI Alamein and to visit the Multinational Force and Observers in the Sinai. The MFO plays a very important role in maintaining the peace between Egypt and Israel and its success is due in part to the very professional and widely acknowledged role played by the Australian contingent within the MFO. I would now like to make a few observations about the bilateral visit to Kuwait. The program that was put in place allowed us an opportunity to meet with a wide range of people at all levels and gave us an opportunity to see at first hand the rapid progress that has been achieved in rebuilding Kuwait into following the Iraqi invasion in 1990. The delegation was accorded the highest level of representation and was granted a meeting with the Emir of Kuwait. In the remaining time, I would like to make a number of brief comments in relation to the visit to Kuwait. This was the first official bilateral parliamentary visit to Kuwait. The bilateral relationship has grown significantly since 1991 and the prospects for further expansion of this relationship are promising. A visit to Kuwait demonstrates just how vulnerable a small country like Kuwait is. UNIKOM will need to play a peacekeeping role for many years to come. The Kuwaitis are aware of this and are introducing a number of policies that will further develop their links to the world economy. Many opportunities are available for Australian businesses to take the initiatives and establish ties with Kuwaiti companies. Political parties are forbidden in Kuwait, but their National Assembly is one of the most progressive and outspoken in the region. The government enjoys majority support in the assembly. This has not prevented vigorous debate and the election of a non-government speaker. Notwithstanding the massive debts following the Gulf War, Kuwait has managed to pay off its $US5.5 billion loan which was required to finance the war and help with reconstruction. The enormity of the clean up is difficult to comprehend. More than 50 per cent of the oil wells were torched, 80 per cent of the oil infrastructure was destroyed and 300 oil lakes were formed. Nevertheless, it took only 12 weeks to get the first two oil gathering sites back into production. Within two years production was back to normal, but sadly there are significant quantities of residual that need to be processed and the sites cleaned up. Kuwait is broadening its industrial base, but it will remain dependent on its oil wealth into the foreseeable future. Consequently, Kuwait has one of the world's highest gross domestic products per capita of around $US13,800. The public sector employs over 90 per cent of Kuwaiti nationals in the work force-a factor that may tend to inhibit further expansion of the private sector. Finally, I would like to place on record the delegation's appreciation to our hosts for providing such a comprehensive program and generous hospitality during the visit. this nature send a very clear and strong message to the region and I believe that this delegation's visit has strengthened the ties understanding between Australia and the people of Kuwait. I commend the report to the House.",13
3,Mr GRIFFIN,Unknown,"As 1 the deputy leader of the delegation, in the time. I have available I would like to comment briefly on the delegation's visit to the Middle East. One thing that needs to be understood, and it is something that I have come to understand over time, is that the Middle East situation and the great variations between the countries and circumstances in that area are not as widely understood as they should be. We often get media reports here of events that have occurred in this very troubled area of the world, but you get a very different appreciation of the great history of the area-the differences between and within those countries and the circumstances of the issues, particularly around Israel and the Palestinian people-and what has occurred and is occurring in the region if you can go there and actually talk to the people. The delegation's visit to Kuwait certainly gave me a much better understanding of the circumstances of the Kuwaiti people and the situation regarding the security concerns not only there but in Iraq in particular and to an extent Iran. The devastation that was mentioned by the Speaker earlier is significant, but the enormous wealth of Kuwait as a nation has seen a situation where, if you did oil not know that a war had happened and had not looked at the results of it, you would probably not realise that a war occurred there just a few years ago. I think that the situation in Kuwait and the opportunities there for Australian business are significant. They are something that I would encourage Australian business to look at in terms of achieving results for the Australian economy. I would certainly encourage anyone to go to Kuwait because I found it a fascinating, albeit extremely hot part of the world and somewhere well worth spending several days. I would also like to thank our hosts for the excellent hospitality they extended to us Visits of during the time we were there. The IPU conference was my first occasion at a conference of this nature. I found it, in and some respects, bewildering but also fascinating. The interrelationship between parliamentarians from all over the world is probably one of the most important aspects of conferences of this nature. The fact is that you get to speak to people from countries from all over the world, discuss with them their political situation, the issues that are facing their economies and their futures, exchange ideas and gain some experience, which is important in looking at how in fact government deals with issues within Australia. I would like to congratulate all members of the delegation for the work that they did at the conference. We certainly played a very constructive role in a number of the debates and motions that were considered at the conference-in particular, the motion on child exploitation, which was sponsored by Australia and which was successfully picked up as a motion by the conference. I think that was an important statement to get into the open for the consideration of parliaments all over the world. The situation in Egypt itself was quite fascinating. Although it is an Arabic country, it is caught between different cultures because of its development, its location and its路 circumstances. As the Speaker mentioned, we placed a wreath at EI Alamein and路 saw something of what would have faced diggers there some 50-plus years ago. That, in itself, was a very humbling experience. I felt enormously proud to be there and to take part. We were also able to visit the Australian members of the MFa force in the Sinai. I know they were certainly very pleased to have us along, and it was a very pleasant occasion. I would like to thank all those with the delegation for the work that they did. I would like to thank all the staff that were involved. I certainly commend the report to the House.",14
4,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown," Mr Speaker, I would like to echo your remarks as leader of the delegation, and those of the honourable member for Bruce (Mr Griffin), the deputy leader, as to the value worthwhile character of this delegation to the 1998 IPU conference and the visit to parts of Egypt and to Kuwait. Can I say that I hope that it is possible for a motion to be moved that the House take note of the report because it would be valuable to have some further discussion in the Main Committee at another stage. In the brief time that I have I want not only to commend you, Mr Speaker, and the other members of the delegation but in particular to place on record our thanks to Peter Keele of the Senate staff who is serving for the last time-at least for the time being-as secretary to this convention. He is going to join his wife, who is a former member of this place, in Colombo. We wish him well and certainly a happy return with his wife in due course. Of course, I also commend Richard Coventry of your own staff. I want to say a little bit about some aspects of the trip, firstly, regarding the Kuwaitis. I think we were all aware of the plight of those 604 missing paws who still have not been acknowledged in any way by the government of Iraq. While it is true that for us the Gulf War is long since over, for the Kuwaitis it is very much a moment of everyday threat and everyday understanding. One would hope that the government of Iraq might recognise the fears and apprehension of the people of Kuwait and the fact that 604 people who were taken still remain unaccounted for. I believe it is an international incident that needs to be addressed. I say to the people of Kuwait that we admired very much what they are doing. We trust that they might, in the future, look to Singapore and see what that city state has done. In Kuwait they might try to make themselves the entrepot port for the future that they once were in the Gulf. They have a future and one would hope they have taken upon themselves an investment to allow for the further processing of those immense resources that are there. As a by-product of our visit to the IPU, our visit to EI Alamein, I thought, was an extraordinarily moving experience. EI Alamein was of course a major battlefield during the and Second World War where many Australians fought and where too many died. It was very moving for us all to go to the war memorial. It brought home the harshness of the desert and the bravery of those who fought there. We also visited EI Arish, EI Gorah and the MFa. The EI Arish visit was particularly memorable because it was there that the forces, prior to going into the Battle of Beersheba, were stabled. As the late Major Eric Hyman from my own electorate led the charge at Beersheba, and many from my area served there, I thought it very memorable to visit there. To Lieutenant Colonel Nick Slingsby and the members of the MFO: congratulations on the job you do. The 26 Australian men and women serving in the force are doing a wonderful job. Until you visit, you do not realise the extent to which they serve that vital, continuing role of maintaining peace between Egypt and Israel. Thirdly, and very briefly, I think the IPU did go well. I am concerned about two aspects of it. Firstly, I am concerned about the funding, and there is some mention in the report of the ongoing need to address the funding of the IPU. This year they are increasing the contribution. I do not believe the management is adequate in a financial sense. I was pleased to learn that they are looking at budget financing into the future, but I am concerned. At a time when they are looking at a new Secretary-General, I think it is particularly important for that matter to receive ongoing attention in the Australian delegation. The second aspect I think is important, Mr Speaker, is the resolution of the subcommittee which you chaired and which was subsequently adopted by the IPU with respect to the need to eliminate all commercial and other forms of sexual exploitation of children and for the establishment of uniform laws to prohibit this indefensible violation of human rights of children. I believe that needs to be addressed at an international level. I hope all countries who are members of the IPU pick up the text of that resolution and address the problem, for it is a blight on mankind and on civilisation that these problems continue and that in so many countries children are treated as less than equal human beings. That, frankly, is a circumstance which should not be allowed to survive. I commend the report and suggest that there might well be a further opportunity to debate this issue in the main chamber at another time.",15
5,Mr QUICK,Unknown,"I am delighted to be able to speak to this report and to highlight several items that come to mind. Firstly, I would like to mention the special role the Australian delegation played in the whole IPU conference held in Cairo. I especially wish to note the role of you, Mr Speaker, and of the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) as the 'elder statesmen' for us young guys who were, in some cases, at an IPU conference for the first time. It was a very educational process. I was absolutely delighted that Australia's item was adopted by the conference. I would like to thank my fellow colleagues for the various roles they played in the various committees that were conducted during the conference. I was especially chuffed to be a member of the ll-member working party concentrating on a very relevant issue for me-that of that employment in the globalising world. To be able to work through the issues with 11 other countries ranging from Finland, Algeria, Egypt, New Zealand, Canada and ourselves and to tackle and come up with resolutions about employment, migrant workers and child labour was a very educational and very salutary process. To also be able to visit Egypt and to see at first hand El Alamein and the Sinai-places where previous generations of Australians had fought and died-was very meaningful for all of us. I had never been to El Alamein. As I have spoken to lots of diggers over the years, to actually walk on the hallowed ground to try to experience part of it was very enlightening. To also be where my father was 80-odd years ago before and after the Gallipoli campaign held special memories for me, and I would like to note that. The Sinai also brings to mind the wonderful role of our 26 Australian service personnel in the MFO. I have spoken in this place about the wonderful work they do under the command of Colonel Nick Slingsby . We had a wonderful time and also had an opportunity to learn about the vital role they play in Middle East peacekeeping processes. None of us can ever forget the wonderful hospitality displayed to us by the Kuwaitis. They gave us an excellent opportunity to experience the impact of the Gulf War on their people. To be able to meet the Emir, the Speaker, various ministers and the author of a book, to actually go out and see the role of the UN on the Iraq-Kuwait border and to experience the heat and to see the oilfields and the destruction that obviously must have taken place are other experiences I will long treasure. I would also like to place on record my thanks to Richard Coventry, to Peter Keele for the role he played as secretary and also to the two Australian ambassadors and their staff, who made our life so much easier over there. I commend the report to the House.",16
6,Mr SLIPPER,Unknown,"I am very pleased to have the opportunity to support the comments made by my colleagues in relation to this visit. I was privileged to a member of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to Kuwait and to the InterParliamentary Union Conference held in Cairo, Egypt. At the outset, I would like to commend you, Mr Speaker, on your leader the committee secretary, and Mr Richard Coventry, who was on your staff, as well as representatives of Australia in the countries we visited. In particular, I would like to thank Mr Mike Smith, the Australian Ambassador to Cairo, and his wife, Mrs Angela TiernanSmith. I believe that they provided the delegation with service 'above and beyond the call of duty'. It is always interesting to travel to the Middle East. I believe that when one goes there one appreciates that there are very real business opportunities for Australia. While certainly we are part of the Asia-Pacific region, and we emphasise that as a country, it is important - that we should have an Asia first policy and not one that is Asia only. My visits to Kuwait and' to Egypt made me very much appreciate that we do have a long standing relationship.",17
7,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! The time allotted for this debate has expired. Motion (by Mr Andrew) proposed: That the House take note of the paper. Debate (on motion by Mr Sinclair) adjourned. Delegation to Laos and Thailand and to the AIPO General Assembly,17
8,Mrs SULLIVAN,Unknown,"Moncrieff-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs) (12.52 p.m.)-I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to Thailand and Laos and to the ASEAN InterParliamentary Organisation (AIPO) General Assembly, September 1997. First of all, it gives me great pleasure to table this report. There are a number of things I want to say about the report and about the delegation. There are a couple of things I need to say at the outset. At the time. I led this delegation I had no' idea that I would later be appointed as the Parliamentary Secrebe tary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. It is of course appropriate for parliamentary secretaries to lead parliamentary delegations. However, I led this delegation in my capacity as a private member of the House of Representatives. On the delegation's return, as its leader I had circulated a draft report relating to the visits for consideration by all members of the delegation'. A number of recommendations were added to the draft report at a meeting I was unable to attend. I was aware that recommendations probably would be added at that meeting I could not attend, but I was unaware of the nature of them. In any event, I would not have intervened in their content. These recommendations, however, could be seen to fall within my area of official responsibility, particularly since they refer to Australia's aid program. One of the responsibilities of the delegation leader is to present a report, which I have done, including recommendations supported by members of the delegation. I just want to make the point that my discharging of my delegation duties in this way should not be taken as identifying me officially with those recommendations. That statement should also not be taken as my trying to walk away from the recommendations. At the very beginning I should express a number of thanks and a number of other comments, because on past performances I have run out of time and not done it properly. I am particularly pleased that we have been able to present this report so soon after the return of the delegation-only some five weeks later, including three sitting weeks. For that, I thank the secretary, John Carter, and also my colleagues on the delegation. I was anxious to table this report, Mr Speaker, just as I am sure you were anxious to table the IPU report, which you have just tabled. We all know that in the last couple of weeks of sitting there tends to be a bit of a logjam of reports and they do not get the time and attention that they might otherwise get. So I was very keen to get it tabled today so that other members of the delegation could speak. That said, I have to mention that, unfortunately, the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent) could not be here today. I know he hopes to speak to it at a later time. I wanted to make that point just so that nobody thought the fact he was not here to speak meant that he was taking the report lightly because I know he does not. So I thank the secretary, John Carter, for the efforts he put into getting the first draft report to me quickly and for picking up on all our amendments. I want to thank my colleagues the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Adams), who was the deputy leader of the delegation, the honourable member for Aston, the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Hicks) and Senator Mark Bishop for their support and their company 011 the delegation. Whilst on occasions it was a physically trying delegation, that is in no way a reflection on our hosts or the things we were doing. It is a fact that, when a group of disparate people get put in one another's company for a few weeks, sometimes there is the odd little rub, but I think I can say that this was a pretty happy delegation. In my comments I also want to mention the spouses who came. They were contributing members of the delegation and very helpful. All in all, it was just very nice to have them there for their company and the contribution that they made. Thanks also have to go to those Australian officials whom we encountered in the course of this delegation for the contribution they made. First of all, I mention our consul in Denpasar. The AIPO conference was not held in the capital city of Indonesia, the country hosting it. I think that, in some ways, some members of the delegation may have been a little disappointed-lovely as Bali is, and Nusa Dua in particular. When members travel to another country, they appreciate the opportunity to meet with officials who may only be accessible to them in the capital city. However, thanks to our consul in Denpasar, a program of visits to various aid projects that Australia has in Bali was arranged for the delegation, and we met with a number of people involved in those projects. That was a benefit of the conference not being held in Jakarta. The ambassador to Laos arranged a totally splendid program. Roland Rich has now been posted back to Canberra, but he was in the last week of his posting to Laos when we visited. I am sure that, when he found out the timing路 of the delegation, the thought must have crossed his mind that the last thing he really needed in his last week in Laos was a group of parliamentarians visiting the country. Nevertheless, he was superb in everything he did, as was the whole embassy and the program they had arranged for us. The ambassador accompanied us for a good part of our journeys through Laos. We did travel a lot because we were looking at several aid projects that Australia has in Laos, and he was extremely generous with his time away from his own office and his own affairs for those several days. Our ambassador to Thailand was called back to Australia for a meeting during the time that we were there, although he was in Thailand when we arrived, so we did get to meet him. Excellent ambassador though he is, I cannot say a lot about him in relation to our delegation, except to thank him and the embassy for everything they did to contribute to arranging our program and seeing it through to fruition. In the short amount of time now left to me, I want to make a few comments. Whilst I said earlier that the AIPO conference was not held in the capital city, I do want to urge my parliamentary colleagues to go to AIPO conferences. Unlike most delegations and conferences, there is an opportunity at an AIPO conference to really get to know the delegates from other countries. Whilst this is essentially an ASEAN parliamentary conference, there is quite a list of countries which also go as observer countries. Over the period of the visit and because of the time one spends in one another's company, which would not happen if it were in a capital city, one has the opportunity to really get to know members of parliament and officials from other countries. This is the fourth AIPO conference that I have attended. As well as urging colleagues to go to AIPO conferences, I urge them to go again. If you go more than once, the ASEAN parliamentarians are persuaded that you really take this exercise seriously. In other words, they do not think you are attending just because the conference is in a pleasant place like Bali. They think you are going because you really want to get to know them, get to know about ASEAN countries, get to know about the things that concern them and get to know about them in a deep way, as you can at this particular conference. I do strongly urge attendance. I became aware the second time. I went to an AIPO conference that there is significant benefit for our country and our parliament in repeat visits, even if one does not go in consecutive years. Now my time is indeed very brief. I have about one minute each to speak about Laos and Thailand, but I am sure other members of the delegation will fill lots of the holes I left. Laos was to me somewhat of a surprise package. I did not go with any preconceptions, but I was unaware of just in what high regard Australia is held in Laos. We have had a continuous diplomatic presence there for the last 50 years. We have a very significant business community there and we also have a very significant aid program. The people in government certainly are very aware of Australia's contribution to Laos and the role of Australians in Laos. We were very warmly welcomed. I should mention Dr Bhountham in particular. He was the leader of the Lao National Assembly delegation which looked after us and he accompanied us a lot of the time on our program as well. Finally, I will make a very brief reference to Thailand. One could say much about Thailand, but I am particularly mindful of some of the things that were said by members of the delegation which tabled the report previous to this today and of how moving they found their visit to El Alamein. I have to say that my visit to Hellfire Pass was an extremely moving experience for me. I do recommend to all Australians that they go there, see this place, pause, and think a little about the many allied soldiers-but, in particular, the many thousands of Australian soldiers-who died in that place and see what it was they were doing that led to their death. In so doing, they can get an understanding of what enormous sacrifice was involved from the Australians who served in World War II as they attempted to defend our wonderful country. (Time expired)",17
9,Mr ADAMS,Unknown,"I am very happy to have the opportunity to speak on this report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to AIPO and the bilateral visits to Laos and Thailand. I wish to thank early in my speech, in case I do not have time at the end, all those people who made our stay most enjoyable. I thank our own mission staff-in Indonesia, George Fraser and his staff; and in Laos, Roland Rich and his wife, Grace, and all the many staff who helped us, came with us and made sure we were comfortable at all times. From Thailand, I thank the ambassador, have Cavan Hogue, and all the mission's staff who came witH us at various times, particularly James Wise and John Williams. To all the staff from the Laos and Thai parliaments, who could not have done a better job of looking after us if they had tried-they were very efficient and very helpful-and to all the AusAID people and the NGOs for their great briefings and their helpful discussions, I thank you. Last but not least, I thank John Carter, our secretary, for keeping tabs on what we did and writing it all down so we could pull this report together and forward it to the parliament. Thank you for spotting the critical mass and then pinpointing those defining moments that were so crucial to our VISIt, particularly in Laos. Thank you to my parliamentary colleagues for making the trip a pleasure rather than just another busy race around countries. AIPO was interesting in that the congress wrestled with the problem of what to do with Burma because it has no national assembly as yet, and of course Brunei is in a very similar position. Laos was admitted as a full member and was very happy to be a part of AIPO. AIPO plays an important part as a forum to drive policies ahead of ASEAN agreements. Australia is well thought of throughout Asia, but there were some particular concerns from many of the delegates who have friends in Australia or who have been to Australia many times about the Pauline Hanson effect on the relationship between Australia and their countries. Many of them raised that with the Australian delegates. Members of parliament there have a better understanding probably than many, and they expressed concern more for Australia's sake than their own and for the harm it could do us. We do not need these sorts of barriers between the countries. They stop our countries developing trade and exchanging partnerships, something that we need. As part of the program in Indonesia, we visited the University of U-day-ana, which has been running a number of Australian programs through AusAID specially targeting basic science disciplines. That was very interesting to see and it is certainly lifting many people in those disciplines. The Australian Language Centre is also another very successful result of the Australian aid program. It is self-supporting now and very professional. Associated with it is Radio Kang Guru, which helps promote knowledge and understanding of Australia in Indonesia. A weekly 30-minute program is produced and is highly thought of. AusAID funding finishes there at the end of the year and, although corporate sponsorship is being sought, it is not guaranteed. On top of this is the fact Australia has closed down Radio Australia. This could set the cause of language exchange back considerably. All ASEAN countries are concentrating now on the development of education, particularly primary and secondary schooling. They see that English is going to playa major role in global information dissemination. It is the language of the future, yet Australia does not seem to be willing to assist them to continue to learn the language that would most benefit us. Radio Australia is sadly missed there, not only by the expatriates living in the region but by lots of other people. The lack of Radio Australia was raised on many occasions with members of the delegation. In Thailand, we were fortunate enough to go on a trip to the bridge over the River Kwai and to participate in a special unveiling of a plaque to recognise the 350 Americans who died there. That was very moving, along with the war graves visit. The visit to Hellfire Pass was also very interesting. (Time expired)",19
10,Mr HICKS,Unknown,"I have great pleasure in commenting on the report of the delegation to the ASEAN Inter-Parliamentary Organisation General Assembly held in Bali and on the delegation's journey to Laos and Thailand. I would like to thank all the members of the delegation for their support of the leader. I congratulate the member for Moncrieff, Mrs Sullivan, on the way she led the delegation. On a number of occasions there were some explanations to be given and the leader did that in a most efficient manner. The three things which most impressed me about the delegation's visit were, firstly, the friendship and goodwill in southern Asia towards Australia. That impressed me most of all. Everywhere we went, our hosts were most gracious. They welcomed us and really welcomed Australia's input, even though we were only observers to the conference. They saw it as being an important relationship between Australia and those other nations. Secondly, the calibre and skill of our diplomatic staff overseas-a number have been mentioned today-never cease to amaze me. that They are on top of their subject. They now, as soon as you walk in, what you want to know about particular countries and go to extraordinary means to help you out. Also, the people in the countries have a high regard for our diplomatic staff. Thirdly, people in my electorate have mentioned to me many times their concern that about the amount of aid that Australia to the developing countries to I must say, and I declare every time, that that aid is so very important. It is not a great amount in the scheme of things, but it does amount of good, not only for the development of nations but also in the goodwill that exists between Australia and those nations as become our trading partners and assist in development of the whole region. I think those three things stand out the most. The interesting thing about the impact of the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) was that those people who had been to Australia, as the member for Lyons (Mr Adams) touched on, were not so concerned because they understand the strength of our democracy and the right to freedom of speech. But those people who have not been to Australia may be sending their young sons and daughagree ters here to university were very concerned and they expressed their concern to us. The various aid programs are mentioned. When we went into Bali, we were talking to young students who had been on the Indonesian-Australian Language Foundation courses before they came to Australia to attend university. They were all fired up and very keen. It was really wonderful to speak to them, as it is to speak to most young people. In Laos, we had a look at some of the projects concerned with unexploded Laos is apparently the most bombed place on earth. I remember reading that about 80 per cent of the country is affected by unexploded ordnance which is causing tremendous damage. To see that there has been Australian involvement in trying to fix that problem gave me a great deal of pride because it is very important. In Thailand, the action by the Australian government, along with other countries, in supporting the baht did more to develop relationships between Australia and Thailand-and other countries in South-East Asia-than any other action we have takyn in the last 20 years. It was very good to see that support. I had the opportunity to speak to the  nunt, about the citrus industry and the fact there is a high tariff on citrus going into gives Thailand. He assured me that they were the north of us. working on that. Finally, the member for Lyons mentioned the opening of a memorial at the bridge over an the River Kwai to American servicemen who died on the Burma railway. Coincidentally, I met the widow of one of those American exthey servicemen just a few weeks ago and was the able to give her a photo of the monument being opened with the marines there and the American ambassador to Thailand performing that very important ceremony. As the member for Moncrieff said, it is very important to go to the AIPO conference. The continuation which she spoke of is also important. We must be seen to have a continuous interest in that and not be going just for the sake of a trip. I am sure that most and Australian members of parliament would with me.

Debate (on motion by Mr Adams) adjourned. NA Older Motor Vehicles Debate resumed from 20 October, on ordnance. motion by Mr MCClelland: That this House: (1) acknowledges the increasing environmental and safety problems posed by old warn out motor vehicles; (2) recognises that the removal of older motor vehicles from our roads would reduce pollution such as lead and other pollutants by increasing the proportion of vehicles using unleaded fuel and fitted with catalysts; (3) recognises that older vehicles are involved in proportionally more road accidents and that the removal of older vehicles from our roads would have substantial community benefits and health costs savings; and (4) recommends a reduction in wholesale sales tax on motor vehicles which would: (a) add between 150 000 to 200 000 new vehicles to the market per annum; (b) give a substantial boost to vehicle and component manufacturing with a substantial impact on employment in those industries; (c) give a substantial boost to employment in vehicle distribution retailing and wholesalmotor ing; (d) increase State revenues through stamp duty and registration increases; and (e) make better quality motor vehicles more affordable to average Australians due to the ""trickle down"" effect as new vehicles enter the top of the market.",20
11,Mr MARTYN EVANS,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I support the motion moved by the honourable member for Barton (Mr MCClelland). It is a very positive contribution to this debate. I come to this from the perspective of a member who represents a district for whom motor vehicle manufacturing is very important, whether in the form of direct manufacturing in General Motors or through one of the subsidiary companies which manufacture components which are then used by General Motors. There is something of the order of 7,000 families in my district who are supported one way or another by the motor vehicle industry. It is certainly very important to our district. I also come to this from the perspective of a member who represents a district where many of the people would not be able to purchase a new car. They do not have the economic means to do that, so the issue of the older motor vehicle fleet is also very important to them. One of the reasons why I support this motion is that it does not contain any mandatory requirements for the phasing out of older motor vehicles; it simply provides a very reasonable and sensible mechanism by which we might support the gradual reduction in the age of the fleet. Australia has a very substantial motor vehicle fleet with 10.6 million vehicles on the road and over 12 million drivers. We also have one of the oldest fleets. The average age of our fleet is now 1O- years, which is one of the highest in the developed world. That is relevant for a number of reasons. One is that older motor vehicles are more likely to be involved in road accidents, which is a serious social and economic cost to our country, and particularly tragic for the families where that occurs. But also, older motor vehicles are路 substantial contributors to pollution and to greenhouse gases. If we can find a way of reducing the average age of our vehicles, particularly increasing the number of those which are post-1986 when the new pollution controls took effect, we would make a very significant difference to pollution and greenhouse gas contribution in this country. Surveys of on-the-road vehicle emissions, using remote sensors, suggest that 10 per cent of the cars on the road emit fully half of all the hydrocarbons. Conversely, the cleanest half of all cars on the road emit only 10 per cent of those hydrocarbons. Of course, the story is repeated throughout the fleet with respect to carbon monoxide, to oxides of nitrogen and to other pollutants. They are very substantial greenhouse contributors. Some 13 per cent of Australia's greenhouse gas emissions come from the motor vehicle fleet, of which about nine per cent is due to the passenger fleet. So that is again a very substantial contribution. If we can find ways of increasing the fuel efficiency of our fleet and of reducing the amount of emissions through catalytic converters and other technologies which have been in use in recent years, we will do a great deal to improve the quality of our environment and to have a beneficial effect on Australia's greenhouse gas emissions. The reality is that this government has done very little in that regard. They have failed in leadership on greenhouse and they have failed in this area as well. That is why the motion put forward by the member for Barton路 is so significant, producing as it does a mechanism by which we can gradually reduce the age of the fleet. It would also have a very substantial and positive economic benefit in those areas that are reliant on the motor vehicle production industry-my own area in particular. But for the regional economies in South Australia and in Victoria-for example, in Geelong-and in those areas which are dependent on motor vehicle manufacturing, any mechanism which reduces the cost of new cars and thereby consequently reduces the cost of used cars as the effect of the new car reduction flows through into the marketplace would certainly be of benefit because people would be able to purchase a better quality used motor vehicle and an increased number would purchase new motor vehicles. Where we have the age of that fleet being reduced, in the case of a Holden I think we would see the sales tax adding about $4,000 to the purchase price of a vehicle. If we can reduce that in any way, we will go a long way towards allowing people not only to buy new cars but also to purchase better quality used motor vehicles and thereby contribute to the reduction in greenhouse emissions, to the reduction in pollution, to a reduction in motor vehicle accidents on our roads and generally improve our economic position while benefiting the environment at the same time. Mi BILLSON (Dunkley) (1.18 p.m.)-In supporting the sentiment of this motion before the House by the member for Barton (Mr MCClelland), I have to note that it fails to acknowledge that it was under Labor that a dramatic ageing of Australia's car fleet took place. In 1982, during the coalition term, the average age of passenger vehicles was eight years. By 1995, under Labor, it had increased to 10.6 years and, in the same year, there were almost five million cars of 11 years of age and over. This steady increase in the age of motor vehicles has many effects. As the motion acknowledges, it retards our motor car manufacturers, components industry, wholesalers and dealers from the benefits of growing demand for cars and impacts negatively on our environment. The application of new vehicle and safety technologies is stifled. In the years since 1983, the low point of sales was reached in 1987, when 451,829 new passenger vehicles were sold. I congratulate the member for Barton for raising this matter now. However, simply tinkering around at the edges of the wholesale sales tax on motor vehicles is not the solution to the problems this motion raises. A reduction in the 45 per cent luxury car WST is unlikely to make any significant change in demand. A fall in the lower standard motor vehicle WST rate would still leave significant challenges unaddressed. The coalition government believes that real tax reform is needed, not just a tickle here and there. When Labor was in power from 1983 to 1996, they made no effort to reduce wholesale sales tax rates. This year, with a coalition government, demand for new vehicles is increasing. The Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries predicts that 680,000 new vehicles will be sold during this calendar year. The more prudent management of the economy by the coalition is paying dividends. Low interest rates make substantial purchases like motor vehicles more affordable. A broader range of measures is required to tackle the environmental and safety problems posed by older cars. Petrol companies are already marketing half-lead fuels. The government, car clubs and manufacturers have combined to publish information on vehicles that, while designed for leaded fuel, can run successfully on unleaded petrol. Bringing forward the date from which leaded petrol is no longer sold from the presently suggested year of 2010 may be one solution. However, with 35 per cent of fuel sold today being unleaded, substantial incentives would be required to bring forward the turnover of the nation's fleet much before the years 2008-09. In Europe, some governments pay owners of cars greater than 10 years old an incentive to physically scrap their vehicles. However, in Australia the value of cars is far from zero at 10 years of age and all use unleaded fuel and are fitted with catalysts. Scrapping older vehicles is a blunt policy measure. Better environmental and safety outcomes can be achieved through improved fuel efficiency, vehicle maintenance, driver behaviour and traffic management. The government's desire to develop an automotive industry code of environmental performance will also deliver better outcomes than simply tinkering with the wholesale sales tax on vehicles. The car industry has voluntarily agreed to reduce the national average fuel consumption of our cars to 8.2 litres per 100 kilometres by the year 2000. This commitment outperforms the US corporate average fuel economy measure, which is aggregated across the full line of vehicles offered by an assembler, of 27.5 miles per gallon or 8.5 litres per 100 kilometres. Tax r-form n;tay make room for more efficient vehIcles being taxed more lightly than cars with poor fuel economy performance, providing an incentive to purchase more environmentally friendly and lower power mass unit rated vehicles. The motion before us today fails to mention the benefits from improved maintenance of motor vehicles. For instance, the Federal Office of Road Safety has suggested that simply tuning the entire car population would reduce hydrocarbon emissions by 10 times more than a legislative obligation that all cars sold this year be of zero emission levels. Driver behaviour can reduce fuel consumption and accident rates. The motion fails to address the direct role of the Commonwealth in road funding and how we can do more to promote improved traffic management. The Vaile inquiry into federal road funding has received submissions about the obvious deficiencies in the way Commonwealth moneys are distributed for roads. Beyond the national highway system, the Commonwealth should direct funding to projects of national economic and environmental significance. Projects such as the Scoresby corridor arterial right through to Frankston, widening the Princes Freeway between Melbourne and Geelong and completing the eastern ring-road would deliver enormous economic and environmental benefits and surely must be able to attract federal funds into the future. Stop-start travel on haemorrhaging road networks is bad for business, bad for the air we breathe, bad for vehicle conditions, bad for road safety and bad for the broader environment. Bad by how much? Just check the differential between city and highway fuel consumption figures for a start. These are issues of concern to this government, and I caB on this government to reflect this fact in its future federal road funding criteria. Addressing the environmental and safety problems of ageing motor vehicles requires more than a tickle of wholesale sales taxes. the member for Barton believes a WST tickle is helpful, he should seek to deal his Labor Party constructively and positively into a comprehensive tax reform debate.

12,Mr JENKINS,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I welcome the opportunity presented by the discussion of the motion moved by the honourable member for Barton (Mr MCClelland) to take into account some of the important measures that can be looked at to reduce the effect of the ageing of the motor vehicle fleet and its effect on things to do with the environment, especiaBy greenhouse gas emissions. The government's response has been characterised by the fact that the sale of older cars is not necessarily the most appropriate measnew ure. There are studies that show that we should ensure that the car fleet is maintained so that fuel efficiency, no matter what the age of the car, is kept up. I would agree that although that can be an important aspect of the way in which we tackle this problem that is not to say that it should not be taken into account as one of the measures. I also note the comments of the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Billson) about improving the road network. I think that it is important to understand that often the types of improvements to the road network do not increase the amount of traffic but, indeed, can ensure that traffic movements are more efficient. The western ring-road in Melbourne is a very important example of that. Commercial and industrial use of that road is more fuel efficient and, therefore, is of a net positive benefit to the Australian environment. In the continuing fight to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the role that motor vehicles play needs to be closely considered. This has become even more urgent since-the Howard government's refusal to commit to a reduction of greenhouse emissions. A recent Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics report entitled Transport and Greenhouse concluded: Reduction in greenhouse emissions can be achieved through targeted scrapping of older fuel-inefficient cars. Their replacement with newer vehicles would reduce both fuel consumption (and hence C02) and noxious emissions. A cumulative reduction of about If 20 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions (about 2% of the basecase car emissions) is achievable by 2015 at a marginal cost below $100 per tonne of C02 equivalent. The replacement of older cars with new vehicles not only reduces fuel consumption but also, importantly, reduces a number of other polluting substances. The federal Office of Road Safety has found that there is a relationship between the emission of other pollutants and the degree of fuel efficiency in older cars. So, the more fuel the car consumes, the greater the number of other pollutants being emitted by the car. As an incentive to scrap older cars, there are a number of schemes in place in various parts of the world worthy of considerationthe motion moved by the honourable member for Barton, of course, being one. In the US states of California, Delaware and lllinois, scrapping of old cars is encouraged by the government offering to buy the vehicle. These schemes are known as 'cash for clunkers' schemes. Each year, the government identifies particularly inefficient cars, offers to buy them and scraps those that it buys. For the purposes of the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics study, any car over 13 years old would be eligible for buyback. Obviously, the take-up rate-and, hence, the rate of greenhouse gas emission reduction-depends on the amount being offered for each car. The study estimates that an offer of $893 for a clunker would result in a takeup rate of 2Y2 per cent and a reduction of about 8.8 million tonnes of greenhouse gas by 2015, whereas the take-up rate increases to about 50 per cent of all cars aged over 13 when the buyback price rises to $3,129. Other countries have similar arrangements in place either to actively encourage the purchase of new vehicles or to act as a deterrent to keeping clunkers. In Japan, the cost of registering vehicles increases with the age of the vehicle. This is a proposal being looked at in Victoria by the state parliamentary Environment and Natural Resources Committee. On the grounds of equity it may be that this is a difficult scheme to support. I am pleased to see that the Victorian state opposition proposed a family car rebate in February this year in the context of the proposed changes to the car assembly industry. Under the opposition's plan, those trading in a car which is 13 years old or older for a new family car would receive a rebate of $3,000. This would consist of a $1,000 rebate of state government fees such as stamp duty and third party insurance, a $1,000 reduction of wholesale sales tax from the federal government and a further $1,000 discount from the car manufacturer. This, of course, would not only be of great benefit to the environment by the removal of the clunkers but also be a boost to the Australian automotive industry. I would have been more pleased if there were some way that we could direct this at Australian-made cars, but of course there are World Trade Organisation considerthe ations and this would be difficult. The type of scheme proposed by the Victorian opposition confirms Victoria as a centre of automotive excellence. In my local area, the establishment of a specialist research and design centre as part of a wider industrial project park is one option for achieving this. (Time expired)",24
13,Mr EOIN CAMERON,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"While the intentions of this motion are laudable, the motion simply brings up more questions about the Australian Labor Party and their policies than it answers. All members would share the view that older model vehicles are damaging to our environment and lacking in safety compared with newer models, and that it would be in the interests of our environment and road safety to remove older model cars from the roads. The member for Barton (Mr MCClelland) in moving the motion outlined the statistics which highlight the need for action. As he said, just 12 per cent of mainly older cars cause more than 50 per cent of motor vehicle exhaust pollution. On safety, he advised that the chances of a fatality are twice as great in a car more than 13 years old than in a car which is less than six years old. Although, as my colleague, the member for Griffith (Mr MCDougall) pointed out, it is more often the driver and not the car that is to blame. There is no doubt that it is in the interests of our community and the environment to reduce the average age of cars on our roads. Anyone who drives an older car, particularly a leaded-petrol motor vehicle, would cherish the opportunity to drive a newer model vehicle, but the barrier of going from an older vehicle to a newer one is cost. To reduce the cost, the member for Barton has proposed that the wholesale sales tax on cars be reduced. The motion moved by the member for Barton suggests that such a reduction would add between 150,000 and 200,000 new vehicles to the market per annum, as well as providing a number of other benefits. What the motion fails to outline is how the government should recoup the loss from reducing the wholesale sales tax. What is more, the Australian Labor Party needs to stop its silly notion that tinkering at of matters taxation will be the panacea to our nation's problems. If the Labor Party is going to talk about fiddling with wholesale sales taxes, then it ought to agree to reforming the whole box and dice. I would welcome a reduction in the wholesale sales tax, but it should only occur as part of a reform of the whole taxation system. A battler on the minimum wage will not be able to buy a newer model car because it is $5,000 cheaper, because he or she will not have any extra disposable income. This motion offers no benefits to the battlers in our community. However, if we reformed the whole tax system by introducing a broadly based consumption tax, reducing PAYE tax, and eliminating various other taxes, the battlers would be better off. The question is: will the Labor Party take its ideological , blinkers off and participate in the campaign to fix up our taxation system, which is in tatters? It is wrong for the member for Barton to pick and choose which products should be taxed and which should not, and at what rates. The taxation system is already manifestly stupid because the wholesale sales tax system is based on picking and choosing products to tax and the rates at which they are taxed. For example: we tax engagement rings but not wedding rings; taps are taxed but sinks are exempt; toothpaste is taxed but toothbrushes are not; biscuits are taxed but caviar is not. Where is the sense in the system? The Labor Party now wants to reduce the tax on cars but do nothing about bicycles, which incur the same wholesale sales tax as cars do but do no harm whatsoever to our environment. It is now up to the Australian Labor Party leadership to state whether they support the motion of the member for Barton. Is the Labor Party going to reduce the sales tax on cars and, if so, how will it pay for it? Or is there dissent in the Australian Labor Party on the matter of tax reform? Does new Labor-people like the member for Barton and the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor)-want tax reform, but old Laborthe edges like the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), his deputy, the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans), and the member for Hotham (Mr Crean}-oppose it? It is up to Labor to now advise the Australian people on its position on the wholesale sales tax system, because the member for Barton has shown it for what it is-a ridiculous shambles. Will the Australian Labor Party go to the next election keeping the shambles as it is, with a bit of tinkering here and there, or will it support reform of the ridiculous system? It is now time for Labor to outline its position on this. I support the need to reduce the impact on the environment of old cars, but this motion is not the solution.",25
14,Mr WILTON,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Before I speak on the motion on older motor vehicles, I must state that, quite contrary to the dissertation of the member for Stirling (Mr Eoin Cameron), the Australian Labor Party has never opposed a comprehensive review of the Australian tax system. We .simply have quite forcefully put to the Australian electorate that we oppose a single-minded, narrowviewed, tunnel-visioned examination of the need for a GST in its insularity. The party and those on this side of the House have never ruled out a comprehensive review of the tax system. However, we have certainly ruled out in a single-minded way any notion that a GST is the panacea to this country's problems. Indeed, this is the same form of GST that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) had ruled out as being off the agenda in perpetuity. The vast majority of countries in the oped world have addressed the issu- of the extensive number of aged cars on theu roads. These countries have realised that old cars generally much less safe than newer cars and that they contribute a disproportionate amount of carbon monoxide to the atmosphere. That Australia has not, recognised these problems is manifested in the fact that Australians, on average, drive what might best be described as the oldest car fleet in the developed world. The so-called scrappage rate is down to three per cent per year and the problem, by and large, is getting worse. As the member for Barton (Mr MCClelland) quite lucidly put it in his speech, in the late 1970s around 25 per cent of the cars on the road were more than 10 years old; today, the figure has more than doubled to 55 per cent-more than twice the percentage in Europe. I am not suggesting for one moment that the hard working men and women of Australia, and in particular those in my electorate of Isaacs, be encouraged to turn over their older cars without there being some significant benefit in it for them. Clearly, a multipronged approach is needed, of which taxation reform is but one prong. A reduction in sales tax from the present per cent to improve new car affordability is clearly another prong. The increased purchasing of new cars which would result would not only greatly boost the Australian automotive industry but also result in a larger number of newer, safer, cleaner second-hand vehicles being available on the market at lower prices than they are now. Clearly, an increase in supply would result in the lower price of newer second-hand vehicles. State governments could also take the opportunity to review stamp duty, registration and insurance charges-something which is clearly long overdue. The third component of our multi pronged approach would be to accelerate the depreciation of business vehicles. For example, if 80,000 kilometre/four-year depreciation cycle was halved to a 40,000 kilometre/two-year one, new car sales to business fleets should double to 320,000 units per year. This would also put newer, cheaper second-hand cars into develthe second-hand car yards of our country. The fourth prong of having a real difference of between 5c and, 10c per litre between the are price of leaded and unleaded petrol, and the phasing-out of unleaded fuel after the year 2000, when old cars could use lead additives, ought to be considered. The present 2c differential is not sufficient incentive to switch to an unleaded car. Labor did attempt to increase that differential in its 1993 budget but, despite Cheryl Kernot's then support for the proposal, it was stymied by the Democrats. According to an article by Harvey Grennan in the Bulletin of 23 April 1996, the chances of a fatality are twice' as great in a car more than 13 years old than in a car less than six years old. The ageing of Australia's car fleet is bad for road safety. It is also bad for the quality of the air we breathe. University of Melbourne studies indicate that half of our pollution is caused by 12 per cent of the cars. British research suggests that a lO-year-old car, even if well maintained, causes four times as much pollution as a new car. I encourage the House to support this motion as a means of not only improving the quality of our air but also lowering medical 22 costs by improving the safety of our cars and lowering the rate of fatalities and injuries. I think it is an excellent proposal by the member for Barton and ought to receive the support of the House. (Time expired)",26
15,Mrs WEST,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"The opposition with a Democrat on board had. better watch their greenhouse gas emissions and make sure that it is not just more hot air that we are getting from that side of the House from now on. I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this motion and commend the member for Barton (Mr MCClelland) for bringing this subject to the notice of the House. For many years we have seen this problem grow with no clear-cut policy commitment from the opposition. lam the pleased that our government is moving towards a national response - with a defined action plan to tackle greenhouse gas emissions. While I congratulate the member for Barton on bringing this issue to the attention of the House, I must say his solutions are but one small part of a whole range of actions needed to be put into place to affect long-term environmental change. I agree we need a fleet policy-one that tackles the overall problem of greenhouse gas emissions, not just one which is aimed at punishing those with the least means to purchase new vehicles. While acknowledging that these recommendations by the member for Barton are going some way to address greenhouse gas emissions, they are in effect not going far enough. They are fiddling around the edges with taxation issues. These recommendations do relate to the overall greenhouse gas emissions issue, but Australia shares the challenge of developing a realistic approach to greenhouse gas emission-reduction based on the relative contribution by industry and the whole community. According to Senator Hill: Australia remains a small contributor to total greenhouse gas emissions . . . contributing about only 1.4 per cent of global emissions ... nevertheTo less, we share the challenge of contributing to a global stabilisation of greenhouse gas emissions. Senator Hill went on to state that any commitment must be fair, realistic and achievable. This is what Australia is pursuing through its proposal for differentiated targets. If we were to accept the European model and aim for a 15 per cent reduction by the year 2000 in relation to the 1990 level of greenhouse gas emissions, the resultant effect on our economy would be devastating. Australia would stand to lose an estimated 90,000 long-term jobs. Coal output would be 20 per cent lower. Aluminium smelting would reduce by 25 per cent as a result of lower prices. The cost of petrol could rise by 70c, as would the price of diesel. It has been estimated that the average increase in electricity prices could be as much as 100 per cent on current levels. However, I am not advocating that we do nothing about the problem. It is not going to go away by itself-quite the contrary. Today I propose a partial solution to the problem. I would like to raise an issue which I feel would be of great benefit to both the environment and business. I am in favour of a fleet policy-one aimed at ensuring the vehicles on our roads, particularly those belonging to fleets, cause minimal damage to our environment. The age of vehicles on our roads is increasing, with the majority over 10 years old, as acknowledged by the member for Barton. But when you consider the number of fleet vehicles bought at auction by private purchasers, it is little wonder we have an ageing motor vehicle population. These vehicles, unless carefully maintained, are more likely to contribute to pollution than a new car or even one converted to liquefied petroleum gas, which brings me to my main point. In introducing a fleet policy I believe we should be looking at ways of encouraging fleet managers to convert their fleets to LPG. LPG is a much cleaner and more costefficient fuel for vehicles which cover large distances. Unfortunately, there is a disincentive-a cost of $1,800 to convert each vehicle. If the cars are converted before purchase, the buyer is also hit with a fringe benefits tax. cap it off, the resale value is lessened. So you can understand why fleet managers are not rushing out to convert their fleets to LPG. I have tried a vehicle that runs on LPG. I must admit there is no appreciable difference in the performance of the vehicle. There are many aspects to a fleet policy which would need to be ironed out-how old cars can be; whether they need to be replaced or whether they can be overhauled; and what effect, if any, it would have on the price of new cars. We need to look at this issue. As the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has stated, we are not prepared to sell out the Australian national interest; we are prepared to carry a reasonable burden, and this is one way of going about it.",27

19,Mr COBB,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I rise to honour the passing of John Douglas Kelly at his home in Sydney last Saturday night. John was Chief Executive Officer of the Taronga Park Zoo and the Western Plains Zoo at Dubbo. He held that position since October 1987. John had a heart-lung transplant back in Drugs May 1993 after contracting cardiomyopathy in the early 1990s. John was a rare and wonderful individual who left a great impression on everybody who knew him. He was born at Lismore on 17 May 1946. He graduated from Sydney University with first-class honours in veterinary science. I went through university with him. He then moved on to become a Doctor of Philosophy and earned other honours. He was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia in January 1995. John had a great vision for wildlife management in this country. He initiated many projects on endangered species such as Przewalski's horses, the black rhinos and Australian animals such as the yellow-footed rock wallaby, the bridled nail-tail wallaby, mala and the bilby. He also initiated research and education programs into the echidna, koala, quoll, platypus and other marine mammals.

20,Mr FILING,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"The government is under significant attack from aged care providers, especially those from the not-for-profit sector, as well as those in the aged sector and their families. In many instances these attacks are justified, intense and have been, to a certain extent, ignored on previous occasions when represented to the minister. I will give a couple of examples in my electorate where these changes are impacting very seriously on people who otherwise should never have had to go through this process. There is one case where a constituent's father is residing in a nursing and his daily fees are going from $408 up to $730 a fortnight. This means, in effect, this gentleman will have to move out-a matter that is obviously of serious note to him. In fact, in a letter to his family, the aged care provider said, 'Please would you speak to him, because he is going to be deeply shocked when he finds out about these changes.' Another constituent of mine has an elderly husband with Alzheimer's disease living in a nursing home. She is going to find it increasingly hard to maintain her family home because of the increase in daily charges. In another instance, the management at Belgrade Park Village in Wanneroo have sent out a notice basically saying to the people, 'Please sit down and have a cup of tea. You're in for a shock because, until the assessment process is complete, we're going to have to charge residents the maximum daily fee applicable.' Obviously this is a matter of great concern to them. There was a very sensible solution proposed the by Tony Parker of Horton House in Canberra prior to the weekend. He suggested that the 25 per cent flat rate of daily charges should be on a sliding scale of 10 to 25 per cent. (Time expired) Rosalind Park Water Cascades",30
21,Mr REID,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I want to bring to the House's attention an important event which occurred in Bendigo yesterday, and that was the opening of the magnificent water cascades in Rosalind Park by the Minister for Planning in the state of Victoria, Rob Maclellan. The project architect described the restoration of these water cascades as a community love affair. He said the idea for the cascades came after Bendigo's Quartz King, George Lansell, visited Italy in 1876 and became infatuated with water features in gardens. In April 1880, he sent a letter to the city of Bendigo proposing two projects: the cascades and the famous Alexandra Fountain at Charing Cross in Bendigo. The cascades were built in conjunction with renowned Bendigo architect W.e. Vahland, but for some reason they were buried for many years. This project has been extremely home, successful, and I am pleased to have been associated in getting some federal money for this project. It is a magnificent feature in Rosalind Park. It adds to the joy and the community benefit of Rosalind Park and also Bendigo's tourism, which is enjoying a very big increase. The tourism figures in Bendigo have increased rapidly over the past 12 months. Thousands of visitors came to Bendigo for the inaugural arts festival and the three-day Bendigo agricultural show. (Time expired) Injured Workers: Legal Rights",30
22,Mr JENKINS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Yet again, the Kennett government has launched an attack on the rights of ordinary Victorians. The state government wants to take away Victorians' common law rights to sue employers whose negligence has resulted in their employees' injuries. At the same time, it will introduce statutory limits on the amounts that injured workers can receive. This will have the effect of severely reducing the amounts that injured Victorian workers will be eligible for in the future. Opinion polls show that this attack on Victorian workers is extremely unpopUlar. The campaign against the changes has broad community support. It is expected that this Wednesday there will be one of the largest demonstrations against the Kennet.t government ever as the community unites to show its support for injured Victorian workers. The attempt to limit Victorians' common law rights is nothing new for the Kennett government. It has been doing it since its election in October 1992. Successive pieces of legislation have removed Victorians' rights to appeal, such as in the Grand Prix Act or the City Link Act. It is ironic that in today's Age under the headline 'Employer threat on union action', it is reported that the state government and the Victorian Employers Chamber of Commerce and Industry urge employers to use their legal avenues to punish unions participating in the campaign against the changes. The utter hypocrisy of this should be evident to all. While trying to take away one set of Victorians' legal rights, the state government under Jeffrey 'Glib' Kennett will assist others to use their legal rights to punish ordinary Victorians. Nursing Homes",31
23,Mr RANDALL,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I was disgusted and appalled yesterday when watching the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) on the Sunday program attempting to scare elderly people in Australia, and not for the first time. This deliberate misinformation surrounding the federal government's aged care reforms has escalated beyond control to the point where the elderly, in particular, and their families, are confused about the truth and are frightened about their futures. I am disappointed that the opposition and certain media-and I am not in any way pointing the finger at all media-have seized on this issue as a way of political point scoring. I have not seen one report in the media asking if people would be willing to pay extra tax or to have a tax levied to safeguard the inheritances of the younger generation. I have not seen one article asking children if they would be prepared to put up a bond for their elderly parents, especially if they stood to gain an attractive inheritance. There is a distinct lack of balance evident in this debate. When the Labor Party introduced accommodation bonds for hostels, did the then opposition go out and try to scare the public? No, we realised it was good policy and supported the then government. I feel quite certain that, had the then opposition treated that policy reform the way the Labor Party are treating this policy reform, the Labor government could have achieved the same hysterical result. To put it in context, only 15 per cent of the total aged population use residential aged care facilities and, of these, only around six per cent will use nursing homes. (Time expired) Filipino Senior Citizens Society of Sydney Nursing Homes",31
24,Mr MOSSFIELD,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Ijoin with  my congratulations to the Filipino Senior Citizens Society of Sydney on their 10th anniversary. Ten years ago, a small group of Filipino migrants gathered together to help each other and provide companionship. 'Today, there are over 300 members of the Filipino community who meet regularly to organise social and other activities. My wife Jan and I attended one of these social activities on Saturday night-the 10th anniversary ball which, as usual, was a colourful, happy occasion, with members of the association taking an active part in the parades and dancing. I compliment the President of the Filipino Senior Citizens Society of Sydney, Mrs Levy G. Cortez, and the officers of her association on this very successful social function. There was, however, an uncharacteristic sombre note raised at this function, and this was the fear that the coalition government has raised in our older community because of the increases in nursing home fees and charges. It is at these types of functions that one is able to get a real feeling about the aged community's concerns about these increases. I believe these fears are greater in the migrant community because of the distance from their homeland and their restricted family connections-many of whom may still reside in their country of birth; At this time of life they are starting to feel lonely and forgotten. This government should realise that their economic rationalist policies are out of control and are inflicting great pain and fear into the minds and hearts of all Australians. They must be reversed. Papua New Guinea",31
25,Mr BROUGH,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"-,-I just wish to briefly comment on the drought in PNG. Just over a week ago I was fortunate enough to visit the Highlands and see at first hand the devastation. This drought is unlike those that we know of in Australia. There is still great greenery. In fact, they had two inches of rain the week before I got there. But in this place, you have 1.2 million people who are subsis.tence farmers. They require very high levels of rainfall to be able to continue their hood and they are finding this extremely difficult. People are not only starving but law and order have broken down. The whole community itself is in a form of disruption. On top of this, they have had massive bushfires which leave the place in a pall of smoke, which is also extremely unhealthy. Adding to their woes are the frosts. It might seem hard to believe for many in this place that Papua New Guinea would be having frosts, but much of the Highlands is higher than the Kosciuszko region that we know of. They were having frosts as late as last week. Diesel was freezing in motor vehicles. This combination of factors requires the efforts of all Australians and the world in general to help those people. It is not just a quick remedy that is required; it will take substantial time because the crops will take several months to be regrown so that these families can get back to having some form of normality in their life. I congratulate the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) for the work that has been done and the Defence Force for the work it is currently up there doing. I look forward to this federal government continuing to assist. (Time expired) Woden School",32
26,Ms ELLIS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"We have a very special school in Canberra-it is called the Woden School. This school teaches very special students. The students, aged 12 to 16, have a variety of disabilities. The students, staff and parents at Woden School work very hard to ensure the activities of the school meet the special needs of the students. The school's drama teacher, Moyra Maestros, has been conducting after-school drama class. The enthusiasm displayed has led the school to enter the International Children's Festival, which is sponsored by UNESCO's cultural arm, the International Amateur Theatre Association. The festival will b.e held in New Delhi, India, in November. School Principal Elsie MCDonnell tells me this is the first time the school has been able to organise an overseas excursion for students. The International Amateur Theatre Association's philosophy of 'participation for livelieveryone' is enthusiastically embraced by Woden School. The students are very excited also at the prospect, and the parents are thrilled that their children can participate in a festival such as this. The school feels strongly that, as adolescents from other schools have similar opportunities, it was right that the Woden School kids have the same opportunity and the same experiences. This is the first group of students with disabilities to take part in the festival. Fundraising has been essential, of course. I congratulate everyone at the school, along with Rotary, Woden Lions Club, artist Dale Huddleston, National World Travel and the Greater Indian and International Restaurant in Curtin for their wonderful support. I wish the nine special students and their teachers every success in this wonderful adventure in which they are about to partake. Domestic Violence",32
27,Mr HOCKEY,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"While I recognise the number of apprehended violence orders granted on the lower North Shore last year was well below the state average, we cannot afford to be complacent about domestic violence, no matter how few incidents are recorded in our local community. According to the latest New South Wales Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research, a rate of 97.3 apprehended violence orders for every 100,000 people was recorded on the lower addressed North Shore in 1996. Although this figure represents the second lowest in the state, a stark reminder that domestic violence no socio-economic boundaries. Statistics recorded by the Royal North Shore Hospital's Emergency Department in August 1996 suggest that up to one in five women in the North Shore area experience some form of violence in the home. The National Domestic Violence Summit, by bringing together federal and state leaders, will help bring about a more comprehensive approach to preventing domestic violence. urge my constituents to attend that meeting. growth.",33

30,Mr GARETH EVAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer. I refer to Qis statement last Thursday morning that the impact it is on Australia of the economic turmoil in knows South-East Asia would 'hardly be measurable'. I ask him: does he still stand by that statement or did he change his mind in light of events further north in the region a few hours later? If he has not changed his mind, will he explain why. his view is so totally at variance with that of almost every other economic commentator? If he has changed his mind, will he advise the House what his current estimate is of the likely impact of the Asian financial crisis on I Australia's future economic and employment",33
31,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Can I say at the outset that this is a serious question. I will overlook the cheap little shots that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition could not resist making. He does himself no good and he does the Labor The fact of the matter is, as the government be has made clear over a number of days now, that currency movements in South-East Asia indicate how economies which are vulnerable one way or another can be subject to shifts market sentiment. A point that we have made regularly in Australia is路 that those countries which run large current account deficits or those countries which have high of foreign debt are countries that have be sure that market sentiment does not turn quickly against them otherwise they can have major readjustments. That certainly was the case in South-East Asia.",33
32,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What about Hong Kong?,33
33,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is a serious issue and something, my friend, that you would do well to listen to. In relation to South-East Asia, as the government made clear at the time, we thought it was important that those countries which had been exposed took steps to rectify fundamentals in conjunction with the IMP. An IMP program has been put to Thailand and the Philippines and assistance has been sought in relation to Indonesia. Long term those countries that are able to restructure, as a consequence of that, will put their economies on a more sustainable base. The effect on Australiari exports to South East Asia is probably best measured by the fact that about 10 per cent of our exports go to those countries which are particularly affected. When growth turns down in those countries that will have an effect on Australia, but it will not be a large effect because Australia's exports by destination into those areas are around 10 per cent. If other countries with whom we trade should get into difficulties that too would affect Australia. If other countries in North Asia were affected, for the same or for different reasons, that would have another effect on Australia. In relation to Australia, the the government has put very strong fundamentals in place. The reason why the government has put strong fundamentals in place is to guard against exactly the kind of scenario . that I outlined before-as has happened in South-East Asia. If we were still running high current account deficits, if we still had Labor's policy of $10 billion budget deficits, we would not have put in place the policy changes which have given us that buffer position in relation to the movements in South-East Asia. At the time. I made the point, on behalf of the government, that it was important to rectify those fundamentals. I can report to the House that the Australian fundamentals are exceptionally strong. The monetary framework, with the new agreement between the Reserve Bank and the government, has locked in low inflation. Inflation now is at a 30-year low. The differential between the Australian and the US lO-year bonds has narrowed from 250 basis points. Fiscal policy is now on a sound footing. After taking on a $10 billion deficit this government has put Australia on a path which in 1998-99 will put our budget into underlying surplus. Last year the government repaid debt. This year we will repay debt. Next year we will repay debt. By the year 2000, the debt to GDP ratio in Australia will have halved to 10 per cent. Australia has a sophisticated and freely floating exchange rate. As a result we are able, in relation to the exchange rates, to have orderly adjustments which are appropriate to the relevant economic position at the time. We do have a strong household and corporate position in relation to finances. We have not had a speCUlative boom in relation to asset prices over recent times. Problem loans in the banking system are historically low. Corporate gearing ratios are at modest levels with debt to equity ratios around 60 per cent. What this illustrates is the importance of the fundamentals. Those who have been arguing that over the course of the last year Australia should have been boosting its deficits are those who have been arguing that we should not have taken the appropriate steps to put Australia in a strong position to weather situation is that events like these. The events in South-East Asia have illustrated the importance of making the big changes, the fundamental changes. In addition to that, they also remind us that we, as a country, have to keep reaching out and taking路 the challenges in relation to economic policy.",34

As I said earlier, in relation to currency movements in relation to South-East Asia, it is becoming clearer that there are problems in the financial systems in many of those countries which have approached the IMP and are now seeking IMP assistance. I remind the House that Australia has played its part both as a member of the IMP and on a bilateral basis in relation to the package which has been put together in relation to Thailand. I also remind the House, as I have said previously, that it is important for those countries that are seeking IMP assistance to follow through in relation to those packages. Those packages are designed to secure financial systems in the South-East Asian economies and, over a period of time, put down the basis which would sustain longer term medium growth. Mr Latham-This is like the classic catches replays.",35
50,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Werriwa!,35
51,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Separately to the issues in South-East Asia are movements in relation to international stock markets. The movements in relation to international stock markets are something that have occurred not just in South-East Asia but also in Wall Street. Since July, movements in the Australian Stock Exchange have been down around nine or 10 per cent, including those movements today. But over the last two years, even taking into account those movements, the all ordinaries is up around 18 per cent-that is, it has gone up and there has been a correction back but it is still some 18 per cent above where it was two years ago. In relation to those stock market movements investors will be making their own decision. That is a matter which obviously is looked at in different parts of the globe. The third point is policy in relation to the Australian currency. In relation to the AustralTreasurer's Ian currency, the government operates a policy of open trading and the currency has the ability to adjust in relation to external events. The policy has been to allow the currency to find its right level and it has been quite stable over the course of the last 18 months-57, 58, 59 of the trade weighted index and around about 56 today. In relation to domestic conditions, all Australians, with the possible exception of the Australian Labor Party, will welcome the fact that the domestic economy is picking up, as evidenced most recently by the ACCI media release today entitled 'An economy in recovery: results of ACCI's October 1997 Survey of Investor Confidence'. The survey finds that a growing proportion of business people are showing confidence, which I believe is the highest, as shown by that survey, in the last two years. In relation to domestic events, we are now at a historic point for Australia: growth is above three per cent; inflation is at a 30-year low; interest rates have come off five times in official terms since the government was elected; home mortgage rates are now the lowest since the 1960s; there is rising consumer confidence in relation to domestic events; and good strong business confidence and investment figures are coming on board. Mr Speaker, when I announced that Australia would participate in relation to the IMP package in Thailand, I made it clear that we did so for two reasons. We did so because it was certainly in our interests to see economic reform in the South-East Asian region, and it was certainly in the Thai interest to ensure that there was finance available during a period of radical restructuring. Mr Speaker, the government believes that Australia has very important trading partners in the South-East Asian region. We do believe that they can use this opportunity to secure longer term futures in relation to economic restructuring, and we still continue to believe that Australia will assist them in that regard. Taxation: Family Trusts",35
52,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I address my question to the Treasurer. I refer to the statement to the House last Thursday that the previous government's 1995 legislation to prevent tax avoidance through trafficking in trust losses would have denied a family trading through trusts the ability to offset losses and income. I ask the Treasurer: isn't it the case that, contrary to your statement, the 1995 legislation did specifically allow offset of losses against income within a family trust, and also allowed beneficiaries of the trust-though not non-beneficiaries-to inject income into the trust free of the income injection test? Will the Treasurer now explain why he misled the House in his statement last Thursday?",36
53,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, because, as I told the House last Thursday, after consultation in relation to that legislation, the fact of the matter is the legislation was flawed. The member for Gellibrand well knows that. What it did not allow in relation to the income injection test was an income injection where the beneficiaries may have traded through another trust or they may have traded through another entity. That was the prime area of concern which would have meant that, for example, if the beneficiaries had one trust owning a block of land that made profits, and another trust operating a small business that made a loss, they would not be in a position to offset the losses and the profits. Nobody would say that that would be a fair situation. On what basis, where overall business was through two entities, would you tax the income and leave aside the loss? You would not do it in relation to an individual; you would not do it relation to a company. You would not say to an individual, if they had income from this particular area, 'That is assessable, but losses which were incurred as part of deriving that income will not be offset against the income.' Of course you would not do that. The basic principle was to bring it back to exactly the same situation in relation to other entities. What is more, Mr Speaker, we narrowed the definition of 'family'. We narrowed the definition so that it would not include extended families and would not include people through other marriages and the like. So there was an allowance in relation to income and losses, but a narrowing in relation to the definition of 'family'. When it comes toMr Gareth Evans interjecting",36
54,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You had it completely wrong, yet again, as nailed by the Age. There is one problem with being a QC SA: it does not mean that you understand anything about it-QC self-appointed! It is not a good recommendation, Mr Speaker. Mr Gareth Evans- Mr Speaker, could I take a point of order? That is a grotesque misrepresentation of my personal situation, as he well knows. I will seek leave once again, after question time, to correct it.",37
55,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order.,37
56,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, the point I also make in relation to trust When trust loss legislation was introduced as part of the 1995 election, it was described as trafficking in trust losses. It was designed to hit that situation where independent persons could come along and use a trust loss which was not related to their business: they could effectively shop around in relation to trust losses. It was never designed for that small business situation where the small business may have income in one part of their business and losses in another-where they should be able to get an overall income position as they could in relation to a company and as they could in relation to an individual. As part of the negotiation and the discussion with interested parties, this government made sure that the legislation will achieve purposes. And, what is more, this government will get that legislation into effect. This government will get this legislation into effect. The Labor Party sat from 1983 until 1995 and did nothing about this. You did not put any legislation into effect-not in 1983, not in 1984, not in 1985, nor in 1986, nor 1287, nor 1988, nor 1989, nor 1990, nor 1'991, nor 1992, nor 1993, nor 1994, nor 1995. It is very rich indeed for these newfound tax hounds to have suddenly discovered, once they left office, all of the problems which they had ignored when they were in it. Nursing Homes",37
57,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, my question is addressed to the Minister for Family Services. Given the federal government's commitment to improve aged care in Australia, what contribution is made by the Commonwealth government for people in residential care? What will be the impact of income testing on these benefits?",37
58,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker, and I thank the member for Bradfield, Dr Nelson, for his question. Indeed, as most members will know as this matter was subject to extensive debate last week, residential care is expensive. Currently, the government pays an average of $30,000 per year for every nursing home resident on top of the daily contribution to the resident, made up to about $36,000 for those needing the losses is this. highest level of care. Last week I outlined that the contribution by the Commonwealth to residential aid care in this current financial year is about $2.6 billion, rising to slightly over $3 billion by the year 2000. I also indicated that there will be more residential care places required every year. Around 2,500 new places are funded each year, adding to the 130,000-odd places currently funded. Members should be aware that the cost of providing this care is growing at a faster rate than the amount of taxes paid each year. In relation to the proposed changes we talked about last week, I should indicate that 65 per cent of those residents---of the 135,000 in its nursing homes and hostels-in actual fact are full pensioners and not affected by those changes. Over the course of the first week as minister, I have been hearing many views put to me by members on all sides of the House, and also by many in the community. I took these concerns to cabinet this morning and I am pleased to indicate, firstly, that the thrust of the policy of the federal government is maintained. In this country, we are about giving an aged care policy that deals with that demographic problem that I talked about so regularly last week, deals with the improvement of the infrastructure and the care and asks those who have the means and the capacity to contribute towards that care to meet those fundamental facts that I have just recited to the member for Bradfield. I am pleased to indicate to the House, and I will table a ministerial statement released shortly to all members, that the introduction of the income testing for nursing home residents will be deferred until 1 March 1998. Residents in care before 1 March will not be income tested, and income tested fees will apply only to those entering care from that date. Further, I indicate that, for the purpose of income testing for nursing homes and hostel benefits, assets gifted prior to 20 August 1996 will not be taken into account, that being the operative date of the announcement previously. A further measure designed to protect residents who were in hostels before 1 August 1997 is announced now. Some of these residents were to lose up to $11.50 per fortnight as a result of those increasing basic daily fees for hostels to align that fee with fees paid by nursing home residents. They will have their fees reduced to the level they were paying before 1 October. I should indicate that the government remains committed to ensuring that older people will not be forced to sell their family home to enter a nursing home. I will be focusing on the prospect of periodic payments and the deferment of the entry contribution by way of deferment to a charge against the estate. Honourable members who have researched this matter will know that that is a real option for many people who have been concerned. I reiterate the point that I made: over 50 per cent of people now, as they go into a nursing home, do in fact sell their home. There is also a proposal to enable the support to carers to be varied from five years to two years which is, I think, an eminently sensible proposal. We are extending the hardship provisions. Finally, I want to say to the many people in nursing homes, those who care for them and the staff in those nursing homes that I have heard what they have had to say in the period that I have been minister. I gave a pledge to the two nursing homes that I opened in my own electorate that we would listen. I will continue to listen. I will continue to consult, as the government has done, with regard to this matter. I commend the statement to the that will be House and seek to table it.

68,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! There is no point of order. If the member for Dobell wanted to ask a procedural question, he could put a question to me. But, as he was looking around the chamber and at no stage of the game addressing his question to me, I ruled that it was inappropriate at this time of the proceeding to do so. Mr Lee-I seek your indulgence, Mr Speaker. ,",39
69,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The hook has been cast. I am happy to hear your indulgence, but I reserve the right to sit you down. Mr Tim Fischer-The answer to the member's question is no. Mrs Crosio--Are you giving indulgence?",39
70,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will listen to the member for Dobell. Mr Lee-I think you are granting me indulgence this time, Mr Speaker, and I thank you for that. The Minister for Family Services has given the opposition no notice of a statement later today. Honourable member interjecting Mr Lee-If it is a press statement, why do you refer to it as a ministerial statement? We would welcome a debate on the minister's statement. We would welcome an opportunity to debate these matters.",39
71,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The indulgence is withdrawn. The point that we should realise here is that, if the opposition is disturbed by the tabling of a media release, which I think it was, It IS well within the compass of a minister at any time to table a media release. Mrs Crosio--He called it a ministerial statement.",39
72,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,He said 'a ministerial statement' !,39
73,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! It was not a ministerial statement. The question did not ask for a pronouncement on a ministerial initiative. However, if the minister wishes to draw on some initiative that the government is about to make, his response is totally in order. Mr Lee- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order.",39
74,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"-'-The point had better not be frivolous. Mr Lee-It is not frivolous, Mr Speaker. It goes to the heart of the point you have just made. The statement the minister tabled is headed 'Ministerial statement'.",39

76,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I think the confusion is apparent from the way in which he referred to his statement and the language he has used in it. But now that that is clarified, perhaps we can move on.",39

81,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I have not seen the statement. I was alluding to what the minister said. I call the Deputy Leader of the Opposition.,39
82,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again to the Treasurer and it follows the answer he gave to the member for Gellibrand. Treasurer, isn't it the case that your trust loss legislation allows family members who are non-beneficiaries of a family trust with losses to inject income into that trust free of the income injection test and that, in so doing, you have left it wide open to massive tax avoidance by very wealthy families with multiple business interests? Isn't it the case, for ple, that, under your legislation but not Labor's, a non-beneficiary as remote as a wife's grandmother or a niece's husband who wants to avoid paying tax on, say, $200,000 of property income can inject that amount into a family trust of which they are not a beneficiary, write-off the income against any loss up to that value being carried. by that trust and then have the $200,000 distributed back tax free? Treasurer, why did yoy mislead the House last week and again today when answering the member for Gellibrand by refusing to acknowledge that your legislation had any such effect? Mr Ross Cameron- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: your statement to us of 27 May 1997 said, 'lengthy introductory statements will not be tolerated'. I ask you to enforce that provision now.",39
83,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the honourable member for Parramatta. I will not uphold your point of order at this time. The issue is a very complex one and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition needed to draw on specifics in order to address his question. I am sure the Treasurer is now in a position to answer. I call the Treasurer.,40
84,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As to the last part of the question, I did not. The other parts have been answered. Greenhouse Gases",40
85,Mr ANTHONY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. It is nice to get the call. My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Could the minister advise the House of the outcome of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, specifically on the question of climate change? What effort is the government making to protect Australia's national interests in the climate change negotiations?",40
86,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Richmond for his question. I acknowledge the honourable member's interest in the important issue of climate change and the climate change negotiations. The Australian government warmly welcomes the Economic Declaration by the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meetexam- ing in Edinburgh. We particularly welcome the comments made in that declaration on the issue of climate change. There are really three aspects of this which we see as important. Firstly, the declaration recognises the need for the Kyoto outcome to involve realistic and achievable goals. Secondly, and importantly, the declaration recognises the importance of differentiation. Thirdly, the declaration says that not only the OECD countries but all countries have a role to play in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The government regards the CHOGM outcome as a very satisfactory one and one that the Australian government can fully endorse. It is completely consistent with the arguments the government has been vigorously promoting-indeed promoting in the face of criticism from the opposition. We should not forget, nor should the opposition forget, that CHOGM covers a spectrum of both developed and developing countries which collectively account for about a quarter of the world's population. CHOGM has sent a clear message that the Kyoto agreement needs to be workable and provide a framework for a global solution to what we recognise is a serious global problem. This has all happened despite the ridiculous suggestions by the opposition that Australia is not taken seriously in the climate change debate. Quite clearly, the opposite is true. We utterly reject the fatuous comment of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition this morning that the Prime Minister did not have much to be proud about in the CHOGM outcome on climate change. The fact is that the government has a good deal to be proud about. We are proud of our efforts to promote the national interest and to protect Australian jobs. Apparently, the alternative-the opposition-has no interest in protecting Australia's national interest, no interest in protecting jobs in this country and only an interest in currying favour with some in more radical environmental groups. The more the Australian public understands that, the more discredited the opposition will become. Let me say in conclusion that the CHOGM declaration puts to bed once and for all the simply fatuous proposition of the opposition that Australia is isolated on the climate change issue and, in particular, on differentiation. The fact is that 53 other countries signed this declaration in Edinburgh. Not only do those countries acknowledge the importance of differentiation, but Japan's proposal for Kyoto subscribes to the need for differentiation, the European Union clearly supports differentiated targets for the 15 members of the EU and for the emerging economies in Central and Eastern Europe, and Norway, Brazil and Korea have all expressed support for some form of differentiation. So claims by the opposition when they always take the side of others and never take the side of Australia and claims by the opposition that we are isolated are claims which are manifestly false. Greenhouse Gases",40
87,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and follows the answer he has just given. Will he confirm that there are only six developed country members of the Commonwealth, with 48 of its now 54 members having developing country status? Isn't it the case that the differentiation language of the CHOGM communique refers primarily to the differentiation between developed and developing country obligations, which the developing countries continue to insist upon, and that there is no reference to targets in the communique because targets are the last things that most developing countries want to be bound by?",41
88,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will move to the question.,41
89,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"How can the Prime Minister claim any kind of win or leadership when he did not get any statement of support for the responsibility of developing countries to make their own contributions at Kyoto to resolving the greenhouse emission problem? You have got nothing of the kind. Mr Randall- Mr Speaker, I have a point of order that follows from the member for Parramatta's point of order on lengthy introductory statements.",41
90,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have already drawn my displeasure about the length of the question to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, and I heed all questioners to take that advice. I call the Minister for Foreign Affairs.",41
91,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for his question. Firstly, in relation to the last part of the question-and it is an important component of his question-the Deputy Leader of the Opposition claims that developing countries which are members of the Commonwealth are apparently not prepared to agree to participate in some sort of effort to reduce greenhouse emissions. The fact is that the declaration made it clear that all countries have a role to play in reducing greenhouse gas. emissions. So to suggest somehow, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has, that developing countries in the Commonwealth have decided that they should play no role in addressing climate change issues is wrong. One central feature of the Australian government's position, a position which is agreed to by the United States administration, is that developing countries must be involved in efforts to reduce climate change emissions. That is the simple point of this declaration. As far as differentiation is concerned, let us think of the countries that have agreed to the language in support of differentiation. Yes, of course they are the developing members of the Commonwealth, which belies the arguments that you get from the opposition that Australia is isolated on differentiation. You have just conceded yourself that developing members of the Commonwealth support differentiation. Well, fancy that! Why don't you say that at your doorstops? Why don't you say that Australia's support for differentiation is supported by all of the developing members of the Commonwealth, and what is more, that the developed members of the Commonwealth also signed up to that declaration, which is a declaration in support of differentiation? That includes not just New Zealand, not just-importantlyCanada, but, above all, that includes the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom is a leading member of the European Union. It has signed up to language in support of differentiation. It is intellectually consistent for Britain to do so because differentiation within the European Union is supported by the United Kingdom. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition does not like to hear all this. He wants to go around slagging Australia's name and reputation, basically doing everything he possibly can to undermine the Australian government's determination to maintain and build employment in this country, and that is what the opposition is about on this issue. It is about getting rid of Australian jobs, nothing more and nothing less. Let US not have any more crocodile tears from the opposition on the issue of employment ever again.",41
92,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I ask a supplementary question. Will the minister concede that the communique gives no commitment at all by the developing countries to do anything about greenhouse at Kyoto?",42
93,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The question is out of order.,42
94,Mr MCARTHUR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Finance and Administration. Given the government's overwhelming mandate at the last election for the one-third sale of Telstra, can the minister inform the House of the government's response to reports which indicate other political groups may now throw their weight behind a further sale of Telstra? Mr FAHEYI thank the honourable member for Corangamite for his question. I did see an article in the Australian Financial Review last Friday which carried the headline 'Labor prepares to backflip on Telstra'. That article, by Steve Lewis, suggested that the Labor Party has backed away from its hardline opposition to the privatisation of Telstra and is now looking to adopt a more moderate position. The article said: Party strategists want the ALP to ditch its hard-line stance on Telstra, arguing that Labor should have flexibility to sell-down another 16 per cent. When you see articles such as this, one must wonder just who are these party strategist? I can only presume that the party strategists do not include the former leader of the Australian Democrats, the now ex-senator Cheryl Kernot. I noted from a statement that was issued by the Labor Party that Mrs Kernot has gone on an extended holiday courtesy of her superannuation contributions. It seems to me fairly obvious that the Labor Party would want Mrs Kernot to go on an extended holiday because the biennial policy stoush is about to happen for the Labor Party. In January next year the biennial conference will be on. It is now fairly clear, from what Mrs Kernot has said in the past about privatisation, that she is probably not welcome at the biennial conference. As leader of the Australian Democrats, in respect of the privatisation of both Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank she said that both were undertaken by the Labor Party regardless of its party platform. She said in the Senate on 9 May last year: The privatisation of both Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank was strenuously opposed by all Australian Democrat senators. The Democrats with Cheryl Kernot at the helm also strenuously opposed the sale of Telstra Telstra. We see now that the nominal spokesman on telecommunications for the ALP, Senator Chris Schacht, as confirmed that the ALP may approve the draft platform to adopt a further sell-down of Telstra. Of course, that was enough provocation for the ALP left wing. Just as they did with the back-flips on the sale of Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank, the left wing is now drawing its line in the sand in respect of the proposed sell-down of a further 16 per cent of Telstra. No doubt they are trying to contact the former leader of' the Australian Democrats who is on extended holidays trying to get her support. And no doubt the right wing wants to keep Mrs Kemot right away from the left wing at the present time because they do not want Mrs Kernot championing the cause of the further sell-down of Telstra. The ALP are on the record as saying that they would not support any sell off-in fact, they oppose the draft platform. We know of course what happened with Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank. They allowed the Left to have their say; they allowed them to get it off their chest. And then they hopped onto the steamroller and drove right over the top of them-and went on with the sale. I suppose history will repeat itself. In January the Left will have a bit of an opportunity to say a few things, to get a few things off their chests, and the Right will get onto the steamroller again and drive over the top of them. What I would like to know is just where Mrs Kernot will be on all of this. Will she be driving the steamroller? Or will she be with the Left drawing those lines in the sand? We have had a front flip on privatisation by the Labor Party from the time that they were in government to the time they got to opposition. Now we have had a backflip by Labor, by the right wing in particular in respect of Telstra. Is it any wonder that members on the other side have to resort to the use of crutches these days? Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme",42
95,Mr CAMPBELL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Deputy Prime Minister. In view of the present irrational greenhouse hysteria, does the government intend to take up the initiative offered in Senator Brown's private member's bill that would enable people in receipt of diesel fuel rebates to capitalise rebates for 10 years and use the money to install alternative energy? If so, will the government be careful to ensure that the rebates for on-farm transport or production are not affected, or is your government in reality as bereft of ideas as the members for Denison and Holt?",43
96,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member . for Kalgoorlie for his question. I advise the House that, notwithstanding the very tough budgetary circumstance we faced last year and this, we have maintained the diesel fuel rebate scheme. We have maintained it for farming, for fisheries, for forestry, and for mining. We will continue to do so. That is the precise position of the government, because it is essentially the use of diesel fuel off road where the rebate is paid. With regard to Senator Brown's and everyone else's posturing on greenhouse, the government has a very clear-cut pathway forward to Kyoto. We will be making further announcements between now and the Kyoto conference. We will be responsible and constructive with regard to recognising that there is a problem with greenhouse gas emissions, but the science needs to be examined very carefully and we want to adopt an approach whJch sticks up for Australian industry, Australian mining industry, to ensure that jobs are protected.",43
97,Mr CAMPBELL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I raise a point of order. I obviously neglected the Deputy Prime Minister's hearing impediment. I asked: is the government going to support the proposed Brown legislation to enable the diesel rebate to be capitalised to be used for alternative energy? It has nothing to do with his political diatribe. .,43
98,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order.,43
99,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It has everything to do, my friend, with the diesel fuel rebate scheme, which I am defending in its current situation. And we are not about to see the diesel fuel rebate-and that is where your question has its genesis---capitalised for any weird view of the Greens senator. I do allow that the government will return their to this matter between now and Kyoto with a comprehensive statement where further approaches of the government with regard to alternative energy will be spelt out, because we want to make a positive and constructive contribution but one which defends Australian jobs and allows for the fact that there has to be a flexible approach, one which allows for differentiation and will recognise that the position of developing countries cannot be ignored in this debate. Waterfront Productivity",43
100,Mr CHARLES,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business. Is the minister aware of reports in last Friday's daily commercial news that productivity at Melbourne's East Swanson dock has declined since the Maritime Union of Australia signed an enterprise bargain that was meant to improve productivity? Can the minister detail what the government's first steps will be to improve productivity on the waterfront?,43
101,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for La Trobe for his question. I did see that report the remarks of Commissioner Wilkes in the Industrial Relations Commission in the daily commercial news. It is a relevant matter, because I am meeting this week with the representatives of the Maritime Union of Australia plus Greg Combet of the ACTU. It was interesting that Commissioner Wilkes was saying that the MUA should be working to increasing its productivity in that operation to 22 crane lifts per hour. He was asking that they lift the productivity to what it was they signed an agreement earlier this year. This is a statement not from the government but from the independent arbitrator or umpire-in this case, the Industrial Relations Commission. The point that they are making is that an agreement was entered into at the start of this year and, instead of the situation improving, it has actually got worse. Unfortunately, this is not an isolated example. We saw in the productivity employment program in Port Botany not so long ago that this agreement with the MUA was touted as improving the situation, and yet within weeks of the commencement of that operation the productivity levels were actually falling and increasing costsMr Tanner-Tell us about the latest figures-the ,productivity improvement and the five per cent increase.",44
102,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Melbourne interjects and says, 'What about the latest figures?' The latest figures are lousy. The figures before that were bad, and the reality is that we have still got a long way to go. You know that. I know that. What we say to the MUA is that we want to have a sensible discussion about what the problems are and what can be done to fix them. Yesterday I put out a very simply agenda for the meeting, just covering some of these obvious issues. We do need to improve Australia's productivity on the waterfront. The crane rates are a long way behind what they should be comparable to similar situations overseas-not comparable to Singapore, which has a bigger throughput and the capital and the volume to have much better crane rates. But against those whom we would fairly compare ourselves, Australia's crane of rates today are far too low and we could do far better. We have the equipment and, quite frankly, we have the people. We have the people who have the capacity, and there is no reason why this cannot be done. I also would like to talk to them about health and safety issues, because the record on health issues,and particularly safety issues, on the waterfront is not nearly as good as it could be. I am sure that that is an area where we can work constructively if we can at least before share a common objective to see improvements in health and safety. The level of industrial action on the Australian waterfront is something like 10 times the national average. It is far too high by any reasonable standard. We basically have a shocking record when it comes to industrial action. Australia's reputation as a reliable supplier is tarnished as a result of that industrial action. The fourth area which I think we ought to be discussing is having in place a system where we can have more flexible arrangements about managing the work force. We are approaching this on a constructive basis. It is important that we sit down and talk with the respective parties. I would have to say I am not holding my breath. There have been a lot of discussions with the MUA in the past, and those discussions have not brought forward the dynamic change on the waterfront that Australia desperately needs. But, from the government's point of view, we go into our discussions on Wednesday night with a straightforward and committed view that we need to improve the waterfront. We are prepared to sit down with people and constructively talk about achieving that objective. Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism",44
103,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Acting Prime Minister. Has the Acting Prime Minister satisfied himself that the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism has made the appropriate declarations at the appropriate time to the Prime Minister, the cabinet and parliament through the register of members' interests in relation to the more than 35,000 BHP shares, valued at some half a million dollars, reportedly held by a member of his immediate family? Acting Prime Minister, are you satisfied that the code of ministerial conduct is working or should it be clarified to take account of situations such as this?",44
104,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In answer to the member for Dobell' s question, I am able to advise the House that I have satisfied myself that all ministers in the government have met all obligations required under the guide for key elements of ministerial responsibility. I would add, with regard to the matter of spouses, that I respect that spouses these days have quite complex and comprehensive interests in some cases, but these are not always known to the other partner. Indeed, I could do no better than refer you to page 157 of the register which has been tabled in this House for the 38th parliament. I find, on page 157, an entry by Laurence John Brereton, member for Kingsford-Smith: 'spouse interest-none known to me'. Work Skills: Rural and Regional Youth",45
105,Mr HAWKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs. Minister, residents within my electorate of Wannon have reacted positively to a number of recent government initiatives such as the work for the dole pilot program and new apprenticeships. Minister, what is the impact of the government's initiatives in improving opportunities for Australia's youth living in regiongram al and rural Australia to gain valuable work skills and employment?",45
106,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Wannon for his question. I know how concerned he is about the expansion of opportunities for young people in his electorate. The government's education and training policies, unlike those on the other side of the House, are designed to expand educational opportunities for all young Australians. One of the saddest legacies of the previous government was the persisting educational disadvantage of young people in rural and regional Australia. The government's new apprenticeship system is going to offer very substantial new opportunities through flexible training to expand the skill levels of young people throughout regional Australia, particularly through its great emphasis on flexibility in the delivery of training. In addition, of course, for young people in regional Australia who have to move away home there is a living away from home allowance of $70 a week. Through the last budgets, the government has allocated sufficient funding to provide for 90,000 new apprenticeships and traineeships in regional Australia over the next two years-a very substantial increase in the opportunities than existed during the last years of the previous government. The work for the dole pilot program recognises the fact that unemployment amongst young people was particularly high in regional Australia and that there were many communities throughout regional Australia which wanted to work with young people to help bring them back into those communities to break the cycle of despair and rebuild their self-confidence. Of course, a great many of the 10,000 places allocated under these pilots will be in regional Australia. Members of this House will also remember how the previous government moved to get rid of the jobs placement employment and training program which had proven particularly helpful in assisting homeless young people and young people at risk. This government re-established that program and funded it at a significant level. Thirty out of the 90 agencies that have been funded under the JPET proare throughout rural and regional Australia. Again, under the jobs pathway program, 70 projects have been funded by the government to assist over 20,000 students at 1,100 high schools across Australia to move from school to work. We know that these proposals to expand vocational education opportunities are consistently opposed by the Labor Party. They do not want young people to get these skills. They do not want schools to help young people get jobs. No-one has been a stronger opponent of these initiatives than the member for Werriwa, who says that he believes this country is overbalancing in trying to expand opportunities for the 70 per cent of young people who are not going straight from school to university. In fact, when a major announcement was made to expand opportunities for young people to get industry recognised training, nationally recognised training, last week, the immediate response of the member for Werriwa was to say that the initiatives should be immediately abandoned. This government stands for expanding education and training opportunities for all young Australians. The Australian Labor Party does not. It has neglected young people. It betrayed a generation and, in particular, it neglected young people in rural and regional Australia. Nursing Homes",45
107,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Family Services. Minister, you have announced the latest changes to your outrageous nursing home provisions. When will the minister announce a real backdown that will protect people like Mr Nikolai Mazin who, throughout his difficult life-which included depressions and world wars-worked to own his own home? Why won't the minister back down and remove the family home from the nursing home assets test?",46
108,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I said on Monday of last week, I will not canvass individual cases; but, if you have issues you wish to raise with me or my officers, I will attend to those. To answer your question, I am not going to deal with, I think it was, Mr MazinMr Lee-You are not able to.",46
109,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I think I am more able to than you, given the form you just displayed in the ridiculous question you just asked. The answer to the question is, as I said a moment ago in answering the member for Bradfield's question, that the focus is on the options that are available to meet a contrition, bution as you enter a home; that is, deferment in favour of the estate, periodic payments, or a lump-sum payment. They are the ways in which the contribution will be made, and I will be focusing on those issues. Breast Cancer",46
110,Dr SOUTHCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Family Services. As the minister will be aware, today is Australia Breast Cancer Day. How important is it that women are aware of the risks of breast cancer? What has been done recently to assist general practitioners to deal with this disease? Can the minister advise the House of any recent Commonwealth funding that will further assist breast cancer research in Australia?",46
111,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question and for the interest he has in this area. I understand that, as a former medical practitioner, he worked in the breast cancer area. Today is our fourth annual Breast Cancer Day. The theme is 'Take care, take charge; any change, see your doctor'. Activities are organised throughout all states of Australia. Breast cancer is Australia's leading cancer amongst women. It is responsible for 25 per cent of cancer deaths, and it is increasing at a rate of about two per cent a year. The incidence was 63 per 100,000 of the population in 1988 and, even adjusting for an ageing population, we expect that incidence to be 81 per 100,000 of the population by the year 2000. However, there is some good news. Survival is increasing amongst women with breast cancer; partly through earlier diagnosis, but also partly through better treatments. In fact, it is estimated that there are probably 100,000 Australian women alive today who have had breast cancer. The annual Breast Cancer Day is run by the Australian Cancer Society, the Royal Australasian College of General Practitioners, Breast Screen Australia, and the National Breast Cancer Centre. Pink ribbons are being sold, and a good number of honourable members are wearing the ribbons. The money from this will go to the Kathleen Cunningham Foundawhich funds breast cancer research. The honourable member asked about two specific initiatives, both of which occurred last week. Last week I launched a joint program between the National Breast Cancer Centre and the Royal Australian College of GPs to have a clear flow chart for the investigation of a breast lump. We are going to distribute that to all 23,000 of Australia's GPs. It gives them the most up-to-date information on the most up-to-date treatment of a breast lump. The second thing the honourable member asked about was research. I am pleased to say that on Friday last week I announced a sum of $1 Y2 million for the Jean Hailes Foundation in Melbourne. Jean Hailes was a physician and a pioneer in the area of women's health and she left a substantial part of her estate to set up the foundation that bears her name. This foundation, amongst other things, undertakes research under Dr Susan Davis. It has been very high quality research, and the money that the federal government is giving over three years will allow it to continue its work, which will include research into breast cancer but also into other things such as links between heart disease, high cholesterol, and hormone replacement therapy; Aboriginal women's health; and links between diet and cancer. This is groundbreaking research of international significance and it is very fitting that on national Australia Breast Cancer Day, someone like Jean Hailes is remembered. Nursing Homes",46
112,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Family Services. Why did you fail today to respond to the concern about the $500 million your government has ripped out of the nursing home system-the system which you have repeatedly described as run down? Why won't you agree to put back this massive funding cut to our nation's aged care system?,47
113,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The question was posed last week. The announcement that I have just made gives a very significant benefit to the current residents in nursing homes and hostels in Australia-a very significant benefit. I have not finally ed the exact figures, but those fees do not start until I March, and all current residents are therefore not expected to make a provision under the original November start date. The amount of funds that are being provided to residential care facilities again I outlined in answer to the member for Bradfield's question. The simple fact is that, unless we make the decisions, adhere to the fundamentals and address the long-term problems that are there in the terms that I outlined all last week and again today, we will not improve the care for aged Australians into the future. And I make the point again that the increase in demand outstrips the amount that we are collecting in actual tax. I make the same point to the member for Jagajaga that I did last year. Why don't you tell us about your new taxes that you have outlined? I have listened to the community. I hear what they are saying. I have responded today, after one week in the ministry, in a way that is positive. You know that what I have said today is very positive and will be welcomed by the aged care community because it is responsive to their needs. You are the ones who should be making it known to aged care people, both the providers and the residentsMs Macklin-They still have to sell their homes, don't they?",47
114,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What are you going to do? How are you going to raise the money? What are your new taxes? You tell us. Immigration: Asians,47
115,Mr GEORGIOU,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. I refer the minister to recent research based on the 1996 census on the settlement patterns of migrants in Australia. Can the minister advise the House whether there is evidence that migrants, particularly from Asia, congregate in what some people call ghettos and do not integrate?",47
116,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Kooyong for his question. It is often surmised-and perhaps it is"" almost implicit in the comments of the hondurable calculat- member-that ghettos are in some way inherently wrong. I have always made the point when I have talked about this issue that perhaps one of the most notable ghettos in the world for a long time was the congregation of Australians in Earls Court in London. I was interested to read the research of Nancy Viviani, Professor of International Politics at Griffith University. She published a report entitled Vietnamese in Sydney and Melbourne in 1996: some preliminary results from the census. There are some points that I would like to make about this. It has been observed-I think, in a way very unfairlythat Asians form ghettos and do not assimilate. I am sure honourable members will relate to the words that have been uttered by one of our colleagues in that form. Mr Hardgrave-She is not here again. She is gone again.",47
117,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I notice the honourable member is not here to hear these comments. The research shatters that myth. It does use concrete data from the recent census. People who use the word 'Asians' very often fail to recognise that Asians are not a homogeneous mass of people all from the same culture and origins. They have very different cultures and very different histories. Asia covers a large number of countries ranging from India and Afghanistan in the west to Japan, Singapore and China further in the east. The word 'ghetto' is often an emotive word that is used to suggest that people are living in areas which might be full of poverty where sometimes the housing is very inadequate. If you look at the way in which we have seen the settlement of migrants in Australia, to suggest that we would have any ghettos in those terms would be quite obtuse. Nancy Viviani's comments have shown that Vietnamese are the only group of Asians who have tended to concentrate in two limited areas-in Springvale in Melbourne and in Fairfield in Sydney. The data tends to show that people from other Asian countries do not tend to congregate in particular areas at all. think that dispels the myth about Asians generally. In relation to the Vietnamese in particular, there has been no increase in concentration. It is a stabilised situation and there is significant movement in and out. If you look at the figures, you will see that there has been significant dispersal of the Vietnamese right throughout Sydney and Melbourne in recent years. That tends to reflect the changes that we have seen in relation to other groups that congregated after their first years of arrival in Australia. One of the other interesting aspects of the data that has not been the subject of comment and I think ought to be noted is that the other most concentrated group in Australia is of people from Britain and Ireland. If you look at the suburbs of Manly, Mosman, North Sydney in Sydney and the suburbs of Mornington and Frankston in Melbourne, you can see that the concentration, which does receive very little attention, is very similar to the figures for the Vietnamese communities in the areas that I identified. Nursing Homes",48
118,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Family Services. Is the minister aware of the Prime Minister's comments this morning that 'there is nothing wrong or un-Australian or unfair about the government's nursing home policies'? Mr Costello-Of course he does.,48
119,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"And the Treasurer agrees. Minister, do you know that, even after your latest changes, your higher daily fees mean that part pensioners will face an effective marginal tax rate of up to 92c in the dollar? Minister, if today you have accepted that it is unfair to impose this higher daily fee on those who move into nursing homes before 1 March, why is it fair to impose this 92c in the dollar penalty on part pensioners who move into nursing homes after I March?",48
120,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Not surprisingly, I agree with the Prime Minister. This policy is fair. This policy is designed to meet the national interests and the long-term needs of aged care in this country. The announceI ments that we have made today fall into the category of finetuning to give us more time to explain the policy to deal with the rampant scare campaign that you have been pursuing around this country, of which you should be ashamed. Public Service and Merit Protection Commission",48
121,Mr NAIRN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs. Can the minister inform the House of how the Public Service and Merit Protection Commission has taken advantage of the flexibilities afforded by the government's Workplace Relations Act to establish a certified agreement for the benefit of staff and the commission?",48
122,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Eden Monaro for his question. Last week, in a secret ballot conducted by the Australian Electoral Commission, 85 per cent of the eligible staff agreed to the certified agreement proposed by the Public Service and Merit Protection Commission. This certified agreement shows the benefits of flexibility that arise from the government's workplace relations reforms. The government is committed to giving all Australian workplaces, including the Public Service, the ability and the capacity to organise their workplaces and the benefits in those workplaces to maximise productivity to the customers or the clients and to improve conditions for employees. The certified agreement proposed by the Public Service and Merit Protection Commission is the first agreement in the Public Service made directly between the employer and a majority of employees. It is a comprehensive agreement in that there is a single instrument providing the terms and conditions of employment in the commission. There are a number of innovative features in this agreement which will improve working conditions and allow for greater client focus. The commission has shown how advantageous it can be to staff when workplace arrangements are decided at the workplace level. One of these benefits of the certified agreement includes-in return for an average pay increase of 6.5 per cent over the next two years-very significant increases in productivity, which will make this increase possible. These agreements include the abolition of higher duties allowances, overtime arrangements and agreements to work within a band of extended hours, including performance pay. The benefits to staff include a team recognition and rewards scheme for exceptional workplace teams organised within the Public Service and Merit Protection Commission. It also permits flexible working hours for those with family responsibilities. These are the kinds of reforms that are possible in workplaces throughout Australia as a result of the changes to legislation introduced by this government, particularly through the leadership of the member for Flinders, the Leader of the House, who has made possible these significant improvements in conditions for the employees of the Public Service and Merit Protection Commission. The agreement will allow the commission to improve its productivity and provide better services to government and, ultimately, to the wider community. Nursing Homes",49
123,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Family Services. Minister, now that you have failed to rule out forcing nursing home applicants to sell their family homes and failed to restore the government funding you slashed from nursing homes, how many frail aged Australians do you expect will sleep with a sense of security and peace tonight?",49
124,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, to be quite honest with you, I hardly think the question deserves an answer. This continues the litany of the attempts by the opposition, particularly the shadow spokesman, to scare elderly Australians. We have had representations over the last 10 days that have led to a constructive contribution to the debate in the announcements that I have made to enhance the opportunities in security for elderly Australians. I am committed to that process. That will continue. I have invited all those who were involved in the consultation, in putting this policy together, to continue to consult with me. I did that last week; I will continue that this week. Last week I did announce a review of the residential classification code, and that also will be reporting to me in due course. Your attempt now-the last grasp, the last question in question time-to try to scare the elderly again should be seen for what it is: a desperate attempt by the opposition to try to grab something out of what has been a profoundly good statement that the elderly of this country know to be so. Workplace Relations Act: Labour Market",49
125,Mr REID,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business. Minister, since the introduction of the Workplace Relations Act, there have been significant reforms to the labour market. Can the minister outline the key reforms and the impact they have had on the Australian economy and the future benefits that will flow from them?",49
126,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Bendigo for his question. The Workplace Relations Act is one of the great reforms of this government. It is interesting to see that, as you look across the full range of measures that we have introduced, there has been a very wide acceptance of many of the important parts of the legislation. My colleague Dr Kemp just referred to one: the introduction for the first time of a non-union agreement in the Public Service. That in itself is a milestone the development of better employee relations in the 'Public Service, and I congratulate him on the work that he has done to bring that to fruition. There are new provisions now for non-union agreements. We had 136 of those up until 26 September. That is a new form of agreement. When Labor introduced their new form of agreement, EFAs, they had only 27 introduced at the end of nine months. In a corresponding period of nine months, we have had 136, and a lot of people are using them. They are using them for much more flexible arrangements. For example, I saw one the other day. They had changed, by agreement, the timing of annual leave. That is quite an important change for a lot of businesses. For example, if you are in manufacturing, to close the business down for the whole of January is not a good deal either for some of the employees and certainly not for the efficient use of the capital in the business. So we have agreements which change the timing of annual leave. We have had agreements where accrued annual leave has actually been cashed out to the benefit of both the business and the employees. We have had 3,993 agreements certified since the act came into operation. We have had over 2,000 individual agreements, the Australian workplace agreements. They are new. Again, it is a good new system which is relevant to so many businesses. Unfair dismissals are down by 53 per cent in the federal jurisdiction. The unfair dismissal provisions are a very significant reform and of tremendous benefit, particularly to small business. With the section 127 applications, where you can go down to the commission and get an order requiring people not to take certain industrial action, we have had over 170 such applications. Many of those have seen an early return to work, which is ultimately a benefit for both employers and the employees. We have even seen the ACCC take action for the first time to enforce the secondary boycott provisions of the Trade Practices Act, and that is a milestone in itself. It is a tremenin dous reassurance for small business to know that the ACCC, which is funded by the taxpayer,. can come in and protect their interests to ensure that justice is made available to them. That is a good operation of the system. On the administrative side, we have also recently announced the appointment of additional inspectors to uphold the freedom of association provisions of the Workplace Relations Act. So whether you want to be in a union or you do not want to be in a union, that choice can be protected. If, for example, you are being pushed around by an employer, you can ring up the inspectorate and they will look after you. There have been examples of that. I was at an employer organisation the other night and when I said that we were going to have more inspectors, one of them turned to me and said, 'All the rest of these employers are wondering whether or not they will be the ones in the line forthat action.' All those reforms were possible because of the agreement which the government entered into last year to secure the passage of our legislation. I have with me a copy of that agreement, which I would have to say is a unique document in Australian political history. It is certainly the first time. I have ever signed a deal with Cheryl Kernot and probably the last as well. Today is a historic occasion because it marks the first anniversary of the securing of the passage of the Workplace Relations Act. Did you get anything in writing, Gareth? Having it in writing is no guarantee for the future either. But we got it in writing and we got it through the parliament. As a result, we now have the secondary boycott provisions, the primary boycott provisions affecting international trade, the provisions dealing with individual agreements and non-union agreements, and the freedom of association provisions. This was a great agreement and it has been oftremendous benefit to both employers and employees. I wish Cheryl a happy anniversary. Mr Tim Fischer-After 20 questions, Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA",50
127,Mr LEE,NURSING HOMES,"I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Member for Dobell moving forthwith that this House calls on the Minister for Family Services to debate forthwith the ministerial statement which he tabled Neville, P.

Is it possible for you to take some action with respect to the Treasurer and anyone else who might be minded to repeat blatant untruths which have been made the subject of explicit denials on questions of fact in this place? I know, Mr Speaker, you have had occasion to address this issue in the context of the minister for employment and of the member for Sydney.

144,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. This has been the centre of some discussion hitherto, as you rightly affirm, between the minister and the member for Sydney. I shall reflect on those words that already passed and, in the light of your retraction, the personal explanation this afternoon. If I need to, I shall revisit it in the chamber or discuss it with you privately. Parliamentary Behaviour",54
145,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, I have a question for you, as the person who is recognised as the defender of members' rights in the House of Representatives. I refer to page 462 of House of Representatives Practice which refers to statements by leave. It states: This procedure is used, in the main, by Ministers to announce domestic and foreign policies and other decisions of the Government. It is usual for a copy of a proposed ministeri-. statement to be supplied to the Leader of OppOSItion or .the appropriate shadow minister some minimum tIme bef?re the ministerial statement is made. At the conclusIOn of the Minister's speech, he or she may table a copy of the statement and move 'That the House take note of the paper'. The shadow minister or opposition spokesperson may then speak to that motionand so on. The point I wish to make is that earlier today for the first time in my memory a minister sought to deliver a ministerial statement by tabling it rather than by reading it, which failed to give the opposition a chance to respond and participate in the debate. If we have ministers who are too embarrassed to even read out their ministerial statements, how can the opposition have a chance to debate these issues?",54
146,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,I am happy to take the question on board. We are not going to debate the issue here.,55
147,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"If Mr Speaker is happy to take that matter on board, I would be very grateful. If this practice extends to other ministers, then the opposition will not have a proper chance to debate serious matters of public importance. Mr Reith- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I put it to you that there is nothing to take on board whatsoever, absolutely nothing. If a minister makes a statement during question time, that does not make ita ministerial statement becauseMr Leo MCLeay-He said it was. Mr Reith-He can call it whatever he wants to-a ministerial statement or a statement by a minister-the words are irrelevant. Mr Leo MCLeay- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. Mr Reith-No, I am on my feet. You sit do-n.",55
148,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"We are on a poirit;-f order. Resume your seat. Mr Reith-My point of order to you, Mr Speaker, is that it would be inappropriate for, you to take on board the point put by the previous speaker. The fact is that it may be novel for ministers to fully answer a question by providing a statement of the government's position. It was certainly novel in the 13 years that Labor was in office, but it is not novel in this government. Mr Speaker, it requires no further action under the standing orders. Mr Gareth Evans- Mr Speaker, on the point of ord.::: I would suggest to you that it is entirely appropriate that you take seriously the point raised by the member for Dobell. This was no ordinary response in question time. It was one that was described by the minister himself orally as a ministerial statement and it was one that, in the accompanying documentation which he tabled, was labelled as a ministerial statement. Under those circumstances, there is a lot more than a prima facie case that this was a ministerial statement which should allow the opposition time for debate and prior consideration in the normal way. To the extent that opportunity is denied the opposition, members' rights are being spectacularly infringed and the government ought to be comprehensively ashamed of itself.",55
149,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I hope the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is not casting aspersions on the chair during this very difficult contemplation. I did visit this during question time. If my memory serves me correctly, and I will look at Hansard later, the minister did allude to a media statement. Mr Leo MCLeay-No, a ministerial statement.",55
150,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I think we will check the Hansard. I do not have a particular difficulty with that. I did not have a difficulty with it during question time. Whilst I take all of your points of order, I will reflect on it, but I am not expecting at this juncture to change the nature of the discussion that has already ' ensued.  of order: the Badin edition of House of Representatives Practice points out that a question can be ruled out of order if it seeks a minister to ,:1elaborate",55
151,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"That is a question. Mr Reith-That is a question, not an answer.  Speaker has difficulty determining what constitutes new policy or announcing government policy. In this instance, it would appear, and I would invite you to reflect on the Hansard, that the minister himself clarified that ambiguity by saying that he was making a statement and announcing policy changes.",55
152,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I thank the honourable member for Chifley. The question, which is really the scene setter in this particular instance, did not seek an expression of ministerial policy or ministerial statement. However, in the course of the minister answering the question, which he was certainly duly empowered to do, he made certain allusions to a statement and then tabled it, which was his right. He did seek leave, but I did not grant it to him, nor did you, because there was absolutely no requirement for him to do so. Mr Lee-I have a concluding point of order, Mr Speaker. Given that we are all fallible, if your recollection proves to be wrong and the Minister for Family Services did in fact refer to a ministerial statement",55
153,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"As I said, this is a conTo cluding point of order which I will not uphold. The honourable member for Dobell will resume his seat. Mr Lee-If this matter is to be clarified, the Leader of the House could quite simply ation. move that the minister's statement be noted, funding and that would allow us to have a proper debate on the changes.",56
154,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,I am very much aware the conventions and rules of the House. NA,56
155,The Clerk,PETITIONS,"Petitions have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be House referred to the appropriate ministers: Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain pensioners, superannuants and retirees points out to the House that Government funding for the Australian Pensioners' and Superannuants' Federation's national secretariat will cease on 30 September 1997. The Federation provides advice to the Government on older people's needs and concerns, publishes independent information for older people and works to ensure that older people have a say in decisions their lives. Your petitioners therefore ask the House to direct the Government to provide funding to ensure that the Australian Pensioners' and Superannuants' Federation can continue its valuable work for and with older Australians. by Mr Andrew (from 22 citizens), Mr Bradford (from 67 citizens), Mr Cobb (from 77 citizens), Mr Dondas (from 24 citizens), Mr Martin Ferguson (from 90 citizens), Mr Hardgrave (from 26 citizens), Mr MCGauran (from 70 citizens), Mr Nehl (from eight citizens),  Mr Tuckey (from 16 citizens) and Mr Vaile (from 36 citizens). Funding: Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: This petition of certain residents of Sydney draws to the attention of the House that: The Federal Government has cut funding to the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants FederWe petition for an immediate restoration of in view of the essential service the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation provides in giving information and assistance to senior citizens in respect to issues affecting finanof cial security and quality of life. by Mr MCClelland (from 39 citizens). Navy: Service Recognition To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the of Representatives assembled in Parliament: This petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the House the fact that members of the Royal Australian Navy who served in Malaya between 1955 and 1960 are still the only Australians, sent overseas on active service, whose service has not been recognised in three important areas: I. R.A.N. casualties are not yet included on the Roll of Honour at the Australian War Memorial alongside Army and R.A.AF. casualties; 2. R.A.N. service has not yet been recognised with the visible signs of service to Australia; the Returned from Active Service Badge and the Naval that affect campaign medal; and 3. R.AN. service is still not acknowledged as eligible service for the Australian Service Pension, while service by Commonwealth and allied veterans from 55 other countries is. Members of the Army and R.AA.F. who served during the same period in Malaya had their service fully recognised 24 hours after arriving in Malaya. In the 1997 Budget the Government partly recognised that R.A.N. service was 'operational' and accepted responsibility for disabilities resulting from that service. Those affected appreciate the belated, partial recognition. However, government departments are still resorting to old, and inventing new excuses, to deny the above 3 points. Your petitioners therefore request that the House acts to help remove the injustice of 40 years and fully recognise R.A.N. service by providing the same recognition and benefits for that service. The cost will be miniscule, being mainly a transfer of pensions from 'age' as paid by the Department of Social Security, to 'service' pensions, paid by the Department of Veterans' Affairs. by Ms Gambaro (from 16 citizens) and Mrs Sullivan (from 12 citizens). Medicare Office: Marrickville To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of citizens of Australia draws attention of the House the opposition of residents of the electorate of Grayndler to the closure of Marrickville Medicare office. We are concerned that many residents will not be able to access the services currently provided. We are also concerned about the privacy of residents if these services are contracted out. Your petitioners therefore request the House to ensure the Marrickville office of Medicare remains open. by- Mr Albanese (from 563 citizens). Nursing Homes To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain electors of the Division Brand draws to the attention of the House concerns that the level of nursing home type beds in Collie is inadequate. This leads to families that have to either care for their aged family members at home, or to send them out of town to other facilities. This places great strain on the families, as there is little public transport between Collie and neighbouring towns. The aged care hostel in the town, which also has a waiting list, is forced to keep as residents people who really need round-the-clock nursing because no nursing home beds are available. Many families try to care for their aged relatives in their own home, but the level of support for these people is inadequate. Funding for Home and Community Care programs are a low growth area. Your petitioners therefore request the House to ensure that available beds in the Collie Hospital are allocated in a more flexible way to reflect the changing needs of the Collie population in regard to their nursing home requirements. by Mr Beazley (from 1,811 citizens). Medicare Office: Salisbury To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of the Division of Bonython draws to the attention of the House: that the Medicare Office in Salisbury, South Australia which provides cash reimbursements on Medicare and Child Care rebates will cease operation altogether some time after November 1997. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House: allow the Salisbury Medicare office to continue to function as it does now, allowing the people resident in this area access to cash rebates across the counter, and all the other services presently provided by this office to the local community. by Mr Martyn Evans (from 349 citizens). Badgerys Creek Airport To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of the residents of Western Sydney draws to the attention of the House our concern about the proposed second Sydney airport at Badgerys Creek. We believe the extra air, water and noise pollution from such an airport will have a detrimental impact on the health of the residents of Western Sydney, as well as on the quality of life in the region. of Your petitioners therefore request the House to take note of our concerns and ensure that they are addressed. by Miss Jackie Kelly (from 56 citizens). Small Businesses or no To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of South-West Sydney draws to the attention of the House the extremely difficult trading environment confronted by small business in Australia. Many thousands of small businesses are suffering from harsh, unfair and oppressive conduct at the hands of landlords, franchisors, oil companies and large retail chains. As a result many hard working small businesses are being driven to the wall, inevitably leading to more unemployment. We also draw the House's attention to the recommendations of the Fair Trading Inquiry which provides a solution to the aforementioned problems. We the undersigned therefore ask the House to implement these recommendations, particularly those which give legislative protection to small businesses. by Mr Latham (from 52 citizens). To the Honourable the Speaker and the Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: This petition of certain members of the Australian community affirms our commitment to a culturally diverse Australian society which is unified by a common desire to see all Australians, regardless of their race, ethnicity, religion, sex, or ability treated with respect and dignity. We recognise the contribution that all Australians have made to the cultural, social and economic development of Australia, and reject the views expressed by Pauline Hanson路 as divisive and not based in fact. In recognition of the need to debate these issues honestly and publicly, we request the House to call upon the Federal Government to mount a high profile anti-racism campaign (for which funds were provided in the 1996-97 budget) and fulfil its obligations to build and maintain a harmonious and united Australia. by Mr Latham (from 19 citizens). Forest Protection To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. This Petition from the undersigned respectfully points out that: there is an increasing and urgent demand for urgent from the people, to protect all remaining high conservation value forests which support flora and fauna unique to Australia, thus complying with the United Nations Biodiversity Convention to which Australia is a signatory. We have a responsibility to future and present generations, and the necessary reasons, knowledge and technology to act now on the following achievable solutions. Your petitioners therefore request the House of Representatives legislate to: immediately stop all logging and woodchipping activities in high conservation value native forests; ensure intergenerational equity by planning for the rights of future generations, and protecting in perpetuity all biologically diverse old-growth forests, wilderness, rainforests and critical habitats of endangered species; facilitate rapid transition of the timber industry from harvesting high conservation value native forests to establishing mixed-species farm forestry on existing cleared and degraded lands, using nontoxic methods to protect ecological sustainability; maximise use of readily-available plantation timber for industry needs, using appropriate forestry techniques and progressive minimal-waste processing methods, such as radial sawing, and wherever Racism possible, reuse and recycle wood and paper products; support incentives for nationwide employment in composting, soil rernineralisation programs, and the planting of trees and annual fibre crops, inter-grown with appropriate fruit and nut trees and medicinal plants; encourage sensitively-managed, environmental age education tourism in appropriate forest areas, with full respect for natural ecosystems, Aboriginal cultural heritage, sacred sites and other sites of significance; progressively utilise technological expertise and resources transferred from the military sector, to help implement these tree planting solutions; and to motivate the international community to follow this example. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Dr Lawrence (from 647 citizens). Nursing Care To the Honourable Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: We the undersigned residents of the South E:ast of South Australia note that there is insufficient accommodation in the South East of South Australia for post-operative recovery patients, and for elderly arid incapacitated patients, some of whom have to be sent away from their home towns for nursing care. Your petitioners therefore pray that your Honourable House will call upon the Government to ensure that sufficient licensed accommodation is made available to meet this steadily increasing need. And your petitioners in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr MCLachlan (from 98 citizens). Medicare Office: Deer Park To the honourable the speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: This petition of certain residents of the State of Victoria draws to the attention of the House the opposition in the Deer Park community and surrounding areas to the proposal by the Howard Government to close the Deer Park Medicare Office. The Deer Park Medicare Office carries out an essential service to a large area of the Western suburbs of Melbourne. It allows convenient and local access for Medicare users who are unable to travel to, other more distant offices for immediate processing of their claims, or who require for budgeting purposes ready access to cash rebates. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House urge the Government to urgently review this decision, and allow the Deer Park Medicare Office to remain open. by Mr O'Keefe (from 23 citizens). Medicare Office: Mount Druitt To the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Western Sydney calls to the attention of the House that proposed closure of Mt Druitt Medicare will cause hardship to many battling families. Your petitioners therefore request that the House forthwith abandon such proposals and allow Mt Druitt Medicare to remain open.  Badgerys Creek Airport To the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. This petition of certain citizens of Western Sydney draws to the attention of the House proposal- to allow an airport to be built in Badgery's Creek. This would have devastating effects on health, children's education, property values and the environment. Your petitioners therefore request the House to abandon plans to build an airport at Badgery's Creek.  SBS Television Services To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives Assembled in the Parliament: The petition of certain electors Lyne draws to the attention of the House the strong case for funding to expand SBS Television services to the Lower Mid-North Coast through a transmitted on the National Transmission Agency site at Middle Brother Mountain, north of Taree. We the undersigned ask the House to draw this matter to the attemion of the Minister for Communications so that he may pursue the matter as a high priority as part of the Federal Government's expansion program of SBS Television services across Australia. by Mr Vaile (from 726 citizens). Petitions received. NA Development Approval Process",56
156,Mr MCDOUGALL,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Griffith) (3.56 p.m.)by leave-On behalf of the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay), I move: That this House: (1) expresses its concern that the current lengthy and uncertain process of securing necessary development approvals acts as a significant disincentive to attracting and securing new capital investment in Australia; (2) acknowledges that the approval process differs between States and Territories and is cumbersome and confusing for potential investors; (3) agrees that the time taken to negotiate and complete the approval process is well behind that achieved elsewhere in other countries and demands improvement; (4) supports a uniform national approval process to be agreed between the Commonwealth and the States, and to be administered by the States and Territories; and (5) calls for concerted action to achieve a streamlined appeal process recognising the need to seek changes to relevant legislation. To put it simply, anyone attempting to generate new business in Australia is blighted by bureaucracy. We are experiencing the worse possible example of this in my Brisbane electorate of Griffith. The state government, in tandem with the Brisbane City Council, developed a far thinking strategic plan, which included what is known as the 'Gateway strategy'. This took advantage of the proximity of the new port of Brisbane to the international airport and the new and effective road and rail network that has been developed with substantial money from the Commonwealth of the Division of government. The strategic plan allowed for new, clean industry to be established in an area along the Brisbane River. It took 10 long years to develop and complete the strategic plan, and marketing went into overdrive in search of customers. The first to show major interest in the region was Australia's own BHP. It came up with a $160 million proposal. The result was that, after about 18 months, the proposal was knocked back by the Brisbane City Council Planning Authority through a costly appeal process. I believe this situation is common across the nation. New investment, either domestic or international, or a combination of both, has to be prepared to tiptoe through a bureaucratic minefield to achieve an outcome in an economic time frame. Part of the problem is created by the fact that everyone has to get approval from three levels of government and various government agencies. This needs to be streamlined. As it stands in Queensland, the approval process can take up to five years. This is an issue the member for Herbert feels most strongly about, and for good reason. Let me highlight a situation his electorate has faced. In Townsville, the Sun Metals project is considered to have gone relatively smoothly under our existing system. It has taken only four years for the necessary approvals to be finalised, which is unacceptable by international standards. In Cairns the previous skyrail project took seven years from application to approval. This is not to say long and involved consideration was not needed to ensure an acceptable development, but it does indicate inefficiency in our consultation and appeal system. Under our current system, an investor who approaches our shores needs not only determination but to be prepared to spend extra money to cover unpredictable delays. One of the most crucial areas of an approval process lies in our appeals system. An appeal process is necessary for both the investor and the people of the nation, but the criteria and the process must be clear to all participants from the outset and, when a decision is made, it should be final. This process must be relevant to our future, past. I believe we must acknowledge our need to encourage overseas investment in Australia. Whether we are talking manufacturing, information technology or the service industriessuch as tourism-we must face the reality that we are an integral part of a global marketplace. If we are to increase our vital export market, we need private sector investment. Our neighbours, particularly to the north, make it clear in no uncertain terms that they are competing with us to capture international capital. They are far more aggressive players than we are. - One of our major problems is that we do not present a united front. With each state government trying to take the initiative, we are competing with each other and I believe that is to the nation's detriment. A colleague of mine recently attended an international convention to discuss the hosting of international sports events. He reported that we literally shot ourselves in the foot at that convention. Australia had representatives from four of our states-and might I add there was nobody else there representing any other states. Those four representatives presented such diverging views and offers that they totally confused the international participants. We looked like four separate countries, not one single nation. The result was an image that we cannot agree amongst ourselveshardly an inviting incentive for international investors responsible for billions of dollars. With this motion, I call for a uniform national approach to considering investment, both national and international. We need to show the world we are a leader in the Pacific Rim and the South-East Asian region. A growing number of North American and European countries are looking to Australia as a possible business location. For many large companies, Australia is the third leg of a regionalisation strategy. Sectors which have particular interest in using Australia as a regional base include manufacturing, telecommunications, medical and pharmaceutical products and technology, information technology and environmental engineering. All of them mean export incentives and, most not our important, jobs for Australians. We all know that, if Australia is to continue to increase its export market while maintaining sufficient investment for our domestic market, we need that private sector investment. If we are to be a player in the global game-more particularly, in the Pacific Rim and Asian regions-we have to offer incentives to investors, not bureaucratic barriers. We must realise we are competing with our neighbours in this region. It is no good our putting our head in the sand and saying, 'We don't want foreign investment.' It is no good saying, 'We don't want international companies moving on to our shores.' If we want jobs for our children and to maintain a lifestyle we have come to expect, we must attract large projects and most of them will have a foreign investment component. We need a process whereby all levels of government work together to achieve the same goal-the goal of sustainable, environmentally acceptable development. I believe it is the role of the federal government to lead this process. It is what the international investors expect-a national government to set and establish national guidelines which acknowledge the responsibilities of state, territory and local governments. Unfortunately, we have debated this issue over many years and at all levels of government, but I believe the time has come. We must act if we are going to move forward in our region in that global market and attract the incentive that we need for the future. (Time expired)",59
157,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,Mr Jenkins)Is the motion seconded?,61
158,Mr REID,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,61
159,Mr KERR,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"There is much in the motion moved by the member for Griffith (Mr MCDougall) that most members of this House would agree with, but there are a couple of points that I will indicate some reservations on. Might I say at the outset that it is not a new experience for members on the government side to urge that we find a solution that enables a more comprehensive and national approach to the giving of approvals for major development processes. Indeed, one of the initiatives of the Keating government when first elected was to appoint the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton) to be a special facilitator for large programs. So this is not a new concern, but it is one which remains very lively in the minds of most in the community. The second point I make is that we need to ensure not only that the processes are more conveniently dealt with but also that there is a case for adopting the kind of strategic approach that the MTIA has suggested. For example, there could be a framework of industry policy in which government might deliberately look, on a case by case basis, at special tax related incentives or other programs that would enable an investment to locate to Australia, if it is offered a comparable set of incentives to make an alternative arrangement. We have to ac;cept that this is a world in which countries an? now competing actively for footloose foreign investment. That said, however, it is very important to avoid going to the next stage, which is to say that we would in any way abrogate our responsibility to go through proper and comprehensive planning processes. The environment is too significant an issue for us to abrogate our responsibility in that regard. The previous speaker, the member for Griffith, mentioned an opportunity in Townsville. I too have been to Townsville. A good example of what can go wrong, if enthusiasm replaces good planning, is what occurs at Magnetic Island and the stone structure that now juts into Nellie Bay. The planning for a proposal to build a hotel that would have dwarfed any of the hotels in Townsville city was inadequate. Those who put forward the project obtained their finance from a bank that ultimately collapsed. But the problem with the project as a whole was that, even if the finance had been sustained, it would never have succeeded because the technology and investigation necessary to proof it up had not been done. Nor had we required adequate guarantees in case of the failure of the project halfway through. Anyone who goes to Nellie Bay now will find a stone wall jutting out from a cliff face that has been blasted down in an area of immense environmental significance on the border of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, certainly within the world heritage property. It just looks dreadful, and that is because no-one did the geomorphological studies that were necessary to determine whether or not the substrata would enable the process to proceed. We are now faced with the Commonwealth problem of what to do with the wreckage of the project. There are various contentions: some say we should leave the mess as it is, that it is least environmentally damaging to do that; others say we should cart it away at the cost of several millions, perhaps tens of millions of dollars. A project that misfires can leave very severe consequences for Australian taxpayers. We know ourselves that we can sometimes become overenthusiastic about large projects. A good example was in my home state of Tasmania where what was a very good ideawealth the Wesley Vale pulp mill proposal-failed on environmental grounds. What I think that demonstrated was, again, the need for us to get a grip on those processes and to make sure that we have a comprehensive system 'We'll that works nationally, that coordinates with the states. The one point on which I differ member for Griffith is that the administration of this fast tracking process-if you want to call it that-or a process that enables there be a coordination of Commonwealth and state planning processes to enable larger investment ments to be looked at and to be facilitated, not simply a matter to be administered by state and territory governments; the Commonand wealth does have a role. It is not a role this parliament should abrogate. So, in clause 4, I would be very sceptical about the lanany guage of that particular proposition. The thrust of the honourable member's proposals is not one which would find any dissent from this side of the House. We do believe that it is important for us to provide a framework which enables complex planning processes to be brought together in a which makes it less confusing for people who wish to make a large investment. It is difficult to explain our federal system to overseas. It is a complex system and one in which some of us take some considerable pride, but it is not one that the rest of the world sees as anything other than a muddle. We should be alert to that and realise that Commonwealth parliament has, over a very long period, not grasped the nettle in making certain that there is an overall compliance regime that works across all state boundaries. The last thing we want is a system where states compete against each other for the lowest common environmental denominator. That is a danger that enables the processes to be located at state or territory level without Commonwealth participation. I appreciate that the motion talks of coordination, acknowledges that the process differs between different states and territories and calls for concerted action to achieve streamlining. Those are noble aspirations but they do require the participation of the Commonin a way which the ideological framework of the coalition government rarely facilitates. There is an issue here with an aspiration but the solution is difficult to find with a coalition government which really says, leave it to the states and territories.' The tension that is inherent in that proposition is illustrated by what is essentially inconsistencies internally within the proposition that from the has been put forward. I conclude my remarks by saying that the to government has a number of matters which I think would test the goodwill of this parliawere they to proceed. A good example is is the Koongarra uranium project, which was first proposed during the Fraser government involved an excision out of what is now that the world heritage area of Kakadu. This opposition would be implacably opposed to process that enabled the destruction of the world heritage area. On the issue of that mine proceeding, the minister has said that he is keeping at least an open mind, the door open, to the possibility of proclaiming the relevant legislation to enable it do so-legislation which we did not way proclaim when we came to government, it having been passed in the Fraser years but not proclaimed. The minister has said that that people from issue is being looked at. I do not want to see resolutions like this being put forward as, in a sense, a stalking horse for the idea that all development projects are good. It is not true. A uranium the mining project in Kakadu, for example, which would be visible from the most important tourist sites and the most environmentally sensitive points within the park would simply be one which we would say is inappropriate for development. But I have no reservations with the thrust of the principle that has been put forward that we can do it better, that we have to coordinate with the states and that it does require Commonwealth leadership. The final point I make is that in that process we must make certain that the environmental parameters are not ignored. They are too important for us to treat lightly. And now I think that even large international mobile capital knows that they have to address environmental issues, whichever territory they come to-whether they come to Australia or do business in any other part of the globe. So we need not be shy about insisting on those, but we ought to be embarrassed by the complexity and the muddledness of our system at present, and we do need to look at some of the federal consequences in the way we address this issue. (Time expired)",61
160,Mr REID,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I take the opportunity to speak on this motion and to follow my colleague the honourable member for Griffith (Mr MCDougall) to talk about some of the things that are happening in my home state of Victoria, where there is and has been for a few years now a can-do attitude at this time. They are well served by some can-do ministers in Victoria. I refer particularly to: the Hon. Rob Maclellan, the Minister for Planning and Local Government, who is responsible for infrastructure and development in that state; the Hon. Mark Birrell, the industry, science and technology minister; and the Treasurer, the Hon. Alan Stockdale. They are all can-do ministers in Victoria in terms of attracting investment and developments which might create employment in Victoria. I want to talk about one of the unique things that they have done there. They introduced a scheme which was, I believe, quite exciting, because it is very difficult to establish this sort of activity in a state or in a nation. It is an organisation known as First Place Business Directions, which is a tripartite agreement between local, state and federal government. I am sure the honourable member at the table, the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Martin), would recognise just how difficult it is to try to get those levels of government working together in Australia, and how crucial it is to development programs in this nation. It is absolutely imperative. That is why I was attracted to the motion that was brought forward this afternoon. I want to refer to what First Place Business Directions does. It is a one-stop shop for people who are interested in development in Victoria and in putting infrastructure into place. They have one.single point of referral. It certainly does add to the ease with which any developer or any potential investor can go and deal with all of those levels of government. At the one location they can get the appropriate advice on developing their project and their thrust towards providing infrastructure and creating employment opportunities. Among the things that it does in bringing all of those people under the one roof is provide business information. It also goes into all of the permits and licence applicationseverything that is required to overcome not only the state issues but also the local government and federal government issues. People from the Australian Taxation Office have been seconded into that facility as well, and they are able to provide information about the federal requirements in terms of taxation. It can be done not only at an international level but also at a local level. The Victorian state government has located a number of these First Place centres around Victoria. They are not all located in the metropolitan area, I am pleased to say. They are located in areas such as Dandenong, Geelong and Bendigo, naturally-where they do an excellent job-and also in Shepparton, Ballarat, Traralgon, Mildura, Wodonga and Wangaratta. So you can see that the state is particularly well covered. The service provides assistance for developers-not only at the local level, because information can be provided about a whole range of activities in any level of government-in taxation, finance, planning, permits and applications. Apparently, there has been a move in Queensland-and I refer to an MTIA document-towards a new approval system for Queensland which has been develthree oped by their Minister for Local Government and Planning. The MTIA commends the process, but they are getting impatient and they want to see this implemented at the closest possible opportunity. I suggest that they look at First Place in Victoria.

161,Mr MARTIN,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Cunningham) (4.21 p.m.)This motion allows me an opportunity to practise my former black art of urban and regional planning that some 13 years ago earned me a crust while working for the New South Wales state government. I wish to refer to two issues associated with the motion that my good friend the member for Griffith (Mr MCDougall) has moved today and, by way of illustration, refer to two projects which I sum up exactly the sorts of difficulties he is talking about. The first is in respect of a proposal to reopen a copper smelter in the electorate of my good friend and adjoining neighbour the member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) at Port Kembla. This smelter project started in about 1927 and ran into various problems. A couple of years ago it finally closed down. After much effort by the New South Wales state government, an investor was attracted from Japan. Something like $270 million was invested in that project, and 300 permanent jobs will have been created by the time the project is completed. Through various state government inquiries and controls, world leading edge technology is to be applied to that particular project. In an area like ours where unemployment is about 11 per cent and in some of the southern suburbs in the electorate of Throsby closer to 20 per cent, one would have thought that the prospect of getting a project like particularly one attracting foreign investment, would be welcome. But a small group of individuals-surprisingly, led by somebody who used to work at the former smelter-did their level best to scupper the project. Fortunately, the New South Wales government, with the leadership displayed by Bob Carr and Michael Egan, clearly recognised the importance of this project to the III awarra. They had to go to the extent of passing special legislation to give it final approval, because one of these people appealed to the Land and Environment Court against the original decision by state and local authorities to grant approval for the project. When the original project was on display for approval only about two people lodged objections to the whole thing, and she was not one, and then after the event said, 'Oh, well, they should have written to me.' As a consequence, she launched an appeal in the Land and Environment Court using environmental funds provided by the state government to do so. I will not earn any more friends down there by raising this in the parliament again today. But, as the Chairman of the Illawarra Regionthink al Economic Development Organisation, as somebody who believes that you have got to put the national good above some self-centred local good from time to time, convinced by the fact that the environmental processes have been followed and that the strictest forms of environmental control will be applied to this project and guided by the fact that we need jobs in Wollongong, I will be the first to put my hand up and support it at every tum. The second issue is something on which I think we have to be a touch careful. It draws on some of the comments made by my friend the member for Denison (Mr Kerr). I am sorry the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) has gone, because he recently chaired a House of Representatives committee which looked at fair trading. He handed down in this place a report on fair trading, specifically in respect of retail shopping centres, and a section in that report dealt with the need in the planning process for retail impact analyses when local government and state authorities look at the that, way in which approval should be given for the expansion of existing shopping centres or the development of new ones. The reason that this was advanced in the report of the committee of inquir.y- Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, I am delighted to see you here, because you are a member of that committee; you have an interest in this because of your local government experience and know what I am talking about-was that the problem encountered was that on many occasions not enough attention was gi ven to expanding regional shopping centres at the expense of existing shopping centres and small retailers in ribbon developments. In days gone by, the prosperity of a local community was often measured by the height of the spire on the local cathedral or church. It seems that these days it is measured by the number of speciality shops associated with a Coles Myer or David Jones development in a regional shopping centre. My concern here is that I recently visited a proposed shopping development at Raymond Terrace in New South Wales and it seems the local council owns some land and has decided to rezone it because it is going to sell it to Woolworths to build a new shopping centre. The only thing is that Woolworths already owns one. All the tenants in the existing retail centre that Woolworths manages are quite upset by the prospect of this other centre taking place. Lack of coordination and failing to look at the bottom line-in this case, as I understand it, by the local council-are issues that need to be addressed. (Time expired)路",64
162,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Mr Jenkins)Order! The time allotted for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. Debate resumed from 20 October, on . motion by Mrs Elizabeth Grace: That this House recognises the adverse effects gambling on society in general and on the small business sector in particular and takes steps to discourage State governments from expanding gambling as a means of raising revenue.",65
163,Mr BRADFORD,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I would like to place on record my thanks to the member for Lilley (Mrs Elizabeth Grace) who, during my absence a week ago, moved this motion of which I had given notice which called on this House to recognise: . . . the adverse effects of gambling on society in general and on the small business sector in lar and takes steps to discourage State governments from expanding gambling as a means of raising revenue. I appreciate the remarks that the member for Lilley made at the time that she moved that motion. There are, I believe, a number of very good arguments why we should be concerned about the moral side of gambling and why we should be concerned about a society that is so predicated on greed and materialism that people are so gullible and susceptible to the idea of getting rich in an instant, which is quite often the prospect put before us in the very glamorous advertising for gambling. But, having said that, I think there are some very good economic reasons we should be concerned about the expansion of gambling that has occurred in Australia in the last 10 years. The fact is that Australians are now the biggest gamblers in the world. They gamble at three times the rate that people in America do. If people think America is Las Vegas they are very much mistaken. Las Vegas is a very small pocket of America where gambling is, of course, the whole basis of the local economy, but the rest of the United States is very much more conservative and concerned about the proliferation of gambling. I think we need to be aware that there has been in recent years what I now see as a rather serious overreliance by state governments on gambling revenue. Victoria, I think, is the most obvious case in point. It has gone absolutely right over the top and now relies Gambling very heavily on gambling revenue. In many respects, people see Victoria as having had a gambling led recovery. The fact is, however, that recent research in America shows that, of for every $1 that governments raise in revenue associated with gambling, it costs as much as $3 to fix up the problems that are created by gambling excess. Quite a large number of people easily become addicted to gambling. I recently heard about the sad case of a constituent whose wife had lost $600,000 at our local casino. Unfortunately, it was not the first time. I have heard that sort of story. I have heard about business people who have lost millions of dollars in our local casino. And it is not only in casinos . particuMany of our casinos are a necessary evil and a part of life. When you live in an area like mine, they are an important tourist attraction. Mr Martin-It's just up the road from your office.",65
164,Mr BRADFORD,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Actually, I have moved my office-but that's another story. Mr Martin-Oh, have you?",65
165,Mr BRADFORD,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I have moved closer to where your parents live, actually. Mr Martin-Did you tell them?",66
166,Mr BRADFORD,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"The fact is-I am sorry, I am being distracted-that we also have a proliferation of gambling on poker machines, keno and scratch-its. You cannot even go to the newsagency these days without thinking you are in a mini-casino. The downsides of gambling are not what we see in the glamorous advertising. The downsides are significant, and governments inevitably end up picking up the tab for the downsides. The downsides include family breakdown, child abuse, suicide-a direct connection has been demonstrated in a number of cases-and crime that is associated with excessive gambling. It is not only crime in an organised sense, which often is perpetuated through gambling because it is a very easy way of money laundering, but also what could be regarded as the less obvious or serious crimes of fraud and embezzlement. People who get addicted to gambling in my experience-and I have had quite a good deal of it living where I do-find the affliction even worse than alcoholism. With the man who came to see me recently about his wife and who pleaded for help, I asked, 'Why are you still married to the lady?' He said, 'We have been married for 40 years and I love the lady. For three weeks of the month she is a perfectly wonderful woman, but then she succumbs to this terrible addiction she has and she has to gamble. I have been unable to stop her, and I have been unwilling to close the bank account.' He told me that they came to live on the Gold Coast as wealthy people and they are now on the pension. I commend my motion to the House. (Time expired)  p.m.)-I strongly support this private members' motion on gambling which, is before the parliament. I will not repeat what was covered by the previous speaker, the member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford). I simply say that gambling is an insidious disease that is being promoted across this country, sponsored in the main by government agencies and the stock exchange. It is a problem that derives from the failure of state路 and federal governments to come to appropriate arrangements in respect of funding the services of each level of government. We cannot run away from it as federal members of parliament and say these agencies and the regulation of gambling is a state responsibility. The problem starts here and the problem has to be solved here. When members on both sides of the chamber, as is taking place in this debate, recognise the problem and are aware of it in their electorate, that ought to be sufficient to lead us on both sides of the House to get together and to pull the Premiers in. There ought to be a special Premiers Conference to deal with the national addiction to gambling and the government sponsored promotion of gambling. I will read a series of headlines. 'Gambling addicts pay high prices' reads the Telegraph of 16 February 1997. The Sydney Morning Herald of 13 September 1997 had the headline 'The wages of sin' and it gave a lot of detail on the losses and the damage being done through gambling and the promotion of gambling. The Newcastle Morning Herald of 8 October and 10 October said 'Dream on Keno gambler' and 'Double-up Keno a dangerous game'. ' Those headlines are about the odds, and the odds of winning are millions to one. The campaign is being targeted at youth, particularly through the use of well-known sporting identities, with the slogan 'A dollar to play and a million to take away'. That is straight deception. It is targeted at young people, because once they are hooked you have got them. As their income goes up, so their losses on gambling go up, and so the impact of gambling goes up. The Daily Telegraph of 2 September 1997 had an article about how, in four hours, a man lost $30,000 playing keno. The Australian Financial Review of the weekend of 18-19 October had the headline 'Victorian racing  Tabcorp in Victoria goes on to describe how it has had to expand its market, expand its industry and convert those occasional gamblers of a few weeks in the year to year-round gamblers. That means the destruction of families and the destruction of lives. The front page headline in today's Sydney Morning Herald reads 'Unmasked: our new drug bosses'. This story deals with one of the drug bosses-the top heroin distributor, as alleged in this newspaper report-who has lost more than $20 million at the Sydney casino since it opened two years ago. How many young Australians died on the streets from drug abuse, how many new drug addicts were established and how many other people were attracted into drug abuse to supply that $20 million? That $20 million came out of Australian families. The level of advertising reminds me of what we used to have with tobacco. We banned the advertising of tobacco where it was linked to an illusory lifestyle. But this same kind of insidious advertising now takes place: 'A dollar to pay and a million to take away'. The odds are about 5Yz million to one. It is deceptive, it is insidious and it ought to be banned, or at least the odds of winning ought to be published. At the time those as go on, in the same way that the warning of ill health is published for cigarette smoking, so ought the odds of winning be advertised. That advertising is directed at young people to hook them for life, and especially at young women-as the newspaper report shows. It is directed at people who are susceptible to this crude type of advertising that portrays an illusory kind of lifestyle that can be won so easily. It is directed to appeal to greed and human weakness. It leads in some cases to addiction to drugs. We have banned tobacco advertising, we warn people of the dangers of alcohol and now we are out there with headlines like 'States pave way for Net gambling' and 'HudCon retains majority stake option in casino deal'. The ultimate abuse of this process is that the stock exchange is now promoting shares, a return on dividends and a return on investment on the basis of how many fellow Australians can be suborned, tricked and fooled into wasting their money. And last of all is the damage done to Australian families. (Time expired)",66
167,Mr ROSS CAMERON,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"It gives me pleasure to agree wholeheartedly with the remarks of the member for  typically incisive and prescient. I join to support the motion on gambling by the member for Lilley (Mrs Elizabeth Grace). The facts are that governments around Australia derived in 1972 about $980 million from gambling revenues, and in 1997 the figure was $3.235 billion. That represents roughly 10 per cent of state own revenue, but in - very state the proportion is rising. The fertile question is: what percentage of increase in states' revenues comes from gambling? Over a quarter of the increase in revenue in Victoria over the past five years has come from gambling revenues, which indicates the state governments' increasing level of reliance on gambling revenues. Most alarming is the fact that expenditure of household disposable income by Australians on gambling has doubled in the past five years, increasing by $4.4 billion from 1991. The evidence seems to indicate-and I refer to the Access Economics report of July 1997 entitled Gambling on the move-that that additional expenditure is coming not primarily at the expense of retail expenditure but at the expense of household savings. The one thing in the country which as a matter of public policy we really have to be working to encourage, to foster and to nourish is the one thing which is being punished because of the reliance of governments nationally on the need to encourage individual Australians to increase their expenditure on gambling. This to me is the most immoral aspect of the discussion. I am not here-and I suspect other members are not either---on some sort of a puritan crusade against the annual flutter on the Melbourne Cup or a game of two-up in the pub on ANZAC Day. What we are looking at is a national epidemic which is infecting the whole psychology of the culture. Lifeline Financial Counselling in western Sydney has its headquarters in my electorate. It takes 35,000 calls a year from individuals in financial distress. That is one organisation alone. Not all of those calls are gambling related, but I have to tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that it has just appointed a brandnew full-time gambling counsellor whose whole task is to respond to those whose lives are in crisis as a result of their addiction to gambling. The irony is that that counselling position is being funded by the Casino Community Benefit Fund. It is a statutory requirement for the Sydney Harbour Casino to provide money to give counselling to people whose addictions it is handsomely profiting from. This arrangement has really Orwellian overtones to me. The title in particular-the Casino Community Benefit Fund-reminds me of Orwell's famous lottery that was administered by the so-called Ministry of Plenty in his book 1984. No major prizes were actually awarded in that lottery, but that was not a problem because the principal function of the lottery was to suborn the population into a kind of pliant, captive and depressed grouping who only lived with the hope of a chimera of financial gain which was never possible and which never came. Orwell says in the book: It was probable that there were some millions for who:n the Lottery was the principal, if not the reason for remaining alive. It was their delight, their folly, their anodyne, their intellectual lant. Where the Lottery was concerned, even people who could barely read and write seemed capable of intricate calculations and staggering feats of memory. There was a whole tribe of men who made a living simply by selling systems, forecasts and lucky amulets. Really that is quite representative of the situation we have produced here. But, as I say, the real evil is governments out there spending something like $30 million a year to try to persuade Australians to spend more money gambling, to spend more money doing the one thing which we know destroys initiative, destroys national savings and locks people into a kind of economic servitude. It is an embarrassment. This must be added to the top of the list for the restructure of Commonwealth-state financial relations. I want to finish by quoting Menzies, who said that the art of politics is to persuade people to think in the long term. That is our challenge. Gambling encourages the exact opposite. So I urge all members to support the motion.",67
168,Mr MARTIN,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Cunningham) (4.42 p.m.)The motion by the member for Lilley (Mrs Elizabeth Grace) in front of the House this afternoon seems to have captured the minds of members specifically in respect of the growth of casinos, what has happened in Australia in regards to gambling, the way in which certain developments around this fair nation of ours owe their very existence to the fact that there is some major Taj Mahal of a casino and the fact that governments draw a lot of revenue from the existence of those buildings. All of that is true; all of that is dead right. If you look at the history of the way in which various states eventually came to the party in respect of allowing casinos of a legal variety to be developed, I think New South Wales was probably one of the last that came to that proposition, although everybody knew that there was always an illegal casino, thus described, operating just around the corner from where everybody lived. I certainly knew where a couple were in W ollongong. I know it will shock my friend on the other side to only, learn that there was an illegal casino in Wollongong, but there was. People frequented stimuit and probably more than a couple of matchsticks changed hands during its existence. Everybody knew it was there. State governments decided that casinos would be a pretty reasonable source of funding. As a consequence, they decided to legalise and help develop casinos. We will see the latest and greatest of those casinos being opened in Sydney towards the end of the year with much flourish-perhaps not with the same level of artists being imported from overseas for the opening night as they did for the opening of the Crown Casino in Victoria, but nevertheless it will be there. The point that needs to be made is that you have to start to distinguish what most Australians believe to be fair and reasonable-a bit of a flutter on a Saturday afternoon on the gee-gees, buying a scratchie when they go to get the local papers on the weekend or taking a lotto, whether it be systems 100, 200, 6, 7 or whatever the combinations may be these days-from the hard:..core gambling that my friend has been concerned about and which this motion specifically goes to. There is no doubt that there are some consequences of that ,particular habit which are absolutely detrimental. My good friend the member for  number of those in the newspapers that he quoted from and in the headlines he read into Hansard. One has to think back only to the cases of children being locked in cars in the basement of the Crown Casino whilst parents were upstairs gambling to get a feel for what that means and the social consequences that that has on people who do have a gambling sickness and cannot seem to break that. But, as I said, you have to distinguish the people who are genuinely out there having a flutter now and again from those hard-core people whom I think this particular motion is about. Another issue-and I think the member for Parramatta (Mr Ross Cameron) briefly touched on this-is what will happen in the future, particularly now with the use of the Internet. I see my good friend the member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) tapping away here on his computer, and I am reminded that back on 22 August of this year Phillip Lasker reported for the AM program in the United States about the growth of the Internet and how gambling was coming onto that site. It was interesting to read what Mr Kevin MCCurie, a spokesperson for the Interactive Gaming Council in the US, said: Online casinos are inevitable; interactive gaming is inevitable; it's a natural outgrowth of the web; a natural outgrowth of web commerce; and whether you try to outlaw it, it's still going to happen, the logistical nightmare of trying to enforce these laws is not going to suppress it in any way. That is probably of more concern to people in government-or it should be-than anything else. In a regulated gaming and gambling environment, this dramatic increase in the capability of using modern technology will have an effect on commerce-lost revenue for government is certainly one element of itbut the way in which people who do have this gambling sickness will have access to this sort of facility in the future is of great concern. I bring that element to the attention of the House this afternoon as part of this broader debate and consideration of this very important issue. There are some beneficial lotteries that are carried out around the world. Look at the sports lotteries in many European countries. They are actually imposed on the people to provide a benefit to the people. It is a form of taxation directly to effect and give support to the need for sporting and cultural infrastructure in cities. I think that is an element that needs some consideration and support. (Time expired)",68
169,Mr ANTHONY,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I rise tonight to support the motion on gambling. I certainly concur with the comments made by the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin). It is interesting that, when you look at Australian history, we have had a passion with gambling, the affair with lady luck. There is no other country in the world which comes to a grinding halt on Melbourne Cup day for a racetrack, even going back to the time of two-up. So in our history there have been many occasions where gambling has been quite prevalent, and the funds from gambling were very instrumental in earlier days for erecting churches or schools or hospitals. As has been quite clearly pointed out by other speakers, the fear now is the proliferation and acceleration in gambling, which is beyond the means of most ordinary households. Indeed, now there is a clear reliance of state governments to use gambling as a major it's source of revenue. In Victoria, 25 per cent of the state revenue collected is through gamand bling. Obviously the proliferation, mainly of late, is ''hot just coming through with casinos but with poker machines. Those one-armed bandits are at any location, whether it is a pub or a club or even a shopping centre. When you look at the actual spending, in 1972-73, $2.6 billion was spent in gambling, principally in the racing industry. That figure has now gone to $9.6 billion. The actual turnover in gambling is now over $61 billion. It is an enormous figure. But, worse of all, Australians lost $8.26 billion over the last year. On average-let us say for every voting person-that is $617 that we have all lost through gambling. As the member for Cunningham said, obviously illegal gambling is becoming less prevalent now because there are outlets where people can do legitimate gambling. As was pointed out by the member for Parramatta (Mr Ross Cameron), the other disturbing factor is consumer spending. It is estimated now that three per cent of disposable income of the average population is spent on gambling. As was pointed out by the member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford), gambling is an enormous social cost, particularly for low income earners, women and the aged. It is interesting to note that 86 per cent of the elderly population spends at least six hours or more gambling. Women who are aged 55 to 59 spend 25 hours a week, on average, gambling. Admittedly, that might be the bingo or the pokies but, nevertheless, it is a change in psychology. The fact is that there is an enormous amount of distress amongst many families. The multiplier effect means that one to 10 of those people is affected. As was mentioned by the member for Parramatta, even though there is obviously funding coming from the casino industry to regulate it, the working. I think it is terribly important, particularly with the government's tax reform package, that the state-Commonwealth tax sharing abilities need to be analysed, because there is no doubt that many states are being forced into this position by the previous federal government. There does need to be an avenue whereby they can raise taxes, or at least taxes are appropriately spent, rather than rely on the turnover which comes from gambling. The other point with gambling is that, when you look at the actual amount spent on gambling, it is now over $9.6 billion for all forms of gambling. With the Internet coming on stream, the Chicago Crime Commission, which is a non-profit crime fighting group, estimates that, by the year 2000, $US25 billion or $A34.4 billion will actually be spent on gambling through the Internet. That could be a little high, but even conservative estimates are around $9 billion. So there is another huge avenue which is opening up on an international scale. It is terribly important that this government and all governments look to regulating certain aspects. Otherwise you will get gambling down at the club or the casino and also get gambling right in your own home, where obviously the propensity to gamble is significantly higher. We all know that taxes have been raised on tobacco and beer. The problem with gambling tax is that it is a very convenient way of raising revenue. There is obviously not the sense that taxes are increasing, but clearly there has been an increase. A very high proportion of tax has been paid out of money gambled at horse races and also at casinos. I think it is terribly important that we look at regulating this industry. (Time expired)",69
170,Mr HOLDING,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"While supporting the motion, my starting point is a quote from the famous English playwright George Bernard Shaw, who said that gambling promises the poor that which property performs for the rich. As other speakers have said, gambling has become not only a major problem in our society but also a part of the infrastructure of our government fact is that it is not operations. As a very young man, I was at my very first Labor Party conference when the then Minister for Health, Jack Barry, in the first Labor government, introduced the motion to bring Tattersall's back to Victoria because it was going to solve all our health problems. Despite all the advances in medical science, our hospitals in Victoria are still in a difficult situation and probably as bad as if not worse than they were then. But Tattersall's has gone from strength to strength: it permeates our hotels; it permeates our social structures; and it provides the wherewithal for our returned servicemen's organisations. That is just one aspect of gambling. Do we need a casino that is as big as it is, with the kind of gaudy advertising which makes you feel that you are not really a modem young person unless you have been there once or twice and had a flutter? There has been an enormous social shift in the ethos of our society, and gambling is just one factor of it. So long as we as a society are developing on the basis that the only thing that is relevant is the profit on the balance sheet at the end of the day-that the morality of the marketplace is the only dominant realitythen we are not going to be able to seriously deal with this problem of gambling. These things are interrelated and linked. When I was growing up in this society, there was a very strong sense of social responsibility. People just did not turn their backs on those who were dispossessed or poor. There was a genuine concern that straddled and ran right through the community. The morality of the gambler is the morality of 'Damn you, Jack, 1'm all right. ' We should not forget where the numbers game that we now see in our casinos was developed. It was developed in the slums and the ghettos of New York by the Mafia. There have been great riches made. In my own party, you only have to read quite a famous novel about a tote shop in my former state electorate of Richmond which was the foundation of considerable riches. No state government, irrespective of its political philosophy, is going to abandon a tax . which is now a very substantial part of state revenue. Until such time as we in the federal parliament are prepared to devote a lot more time to tackling these problems in a broader sphere which involves the states, we are not going to solve it. All we are going to do is spend a short time in this parliament condemning the problems and the social situations that gambling gives rise to. I hope this motion is only a start because I believe it is time the broader Australian community started to face up to the fact that we are producing an omy. uncaring, materialistic society in which people are not encouraged to look at the problems which we are creating in our mad pursuit of the dollar.",70

172,Mr LATHAM,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Werriwa) (4.57 p.m.)With the advent of globalisation, most of our society'S problems have deepened and become. far more complex. The conventional methods of government are struggling to deal with the entrenched problems of economic and social exclusion. Parts of the policies and structure of the state public sector now appear broken. Nations are struggling to reassert their economic sovereignty in the face of the massive mobility and footloose features of global capital. Old policies-Keynesian economics, crude protectionism and openended subsidies for the corporate sector-are not likely to succeed in the new economy. In the global marketplace, economic problems cannot be solved by the restraint of economic freedoms. On every front, the legitimacy and effectiveness of the post-war welfare state is in decline. Our society has lost too much faith in the processes of public governance to truly maintain the benefits of public mutuality. Those of us interested in a more equal and just society need to find new ways of creating the basis of social trust and commonality. Social problems are not being solved by the old formula of providing more money for more programs. Without effort, risk and innovation at a community level-without solutions from the bottom upwards as well as the top down-there can be no resolution of the issues facing our open society and econThese issues provide an immense challenge to all sides of politics. In many respects, the social democratic project has been a victim of its own success-having by the 1970s achieved each of its goals in securing the active role of the state-through Keynesian economics, welfare statism and service planning. The exhaustion of this agenda left a policy vacuum in the 1980s which, in most nations, was filled by the deregulation of product and capital markets. Now in the 1990s, both the old Left and the old Right are struggling to rejuvenate their relevance and policies. This is why, at least on my side of politics, the rise of the new Democrats in the United States and new Labour in Britain has been so significant. The success of the new Labour project relies on creating new policy answers through new forms of governance. In this age of possibilities-a time when the information, choices and opportunities in our life have never been so great-the state needs to establish a new relationship with its citizens. It needs to get out of the habit of people what to do, of always trying to plan and control society's direction, and allow more of society's answers to arise from community and civic life. It needs to concentrate its role on resourcing and regulating the processes of social provision, while transferring many of its functions in service delivery to the work of the non-state public sector. The future of government now relies on the devolution of public governance. One way of developing this policy approach is to realise the potential of the cooperatives movement. Last month, on a tour led by Australia's leading Fabian and a former member of this House, Race Mathews, I was able to examine the success of the Mondragon cooperatives in the Basque region of Spain. These cooperatives employ 27,000 people, representing six per cent of the region's employment base. They have emerged as an outstanding example of public mutuality with their economic activities complemented by a range of welfare, health and education cooperatives. In Mondragon through the 1960s and 1970s cooperative banks and credit unions were able to mobilise local capital for the establishment and expansion of economic cooperatives. A substantial number of manufacturing, retail and service enterprises are now owned jointly by their workers and consumers. This has provided the basis of solid productivity gains and a virtuous cycle of local and regional economic activity. Surplus funds are distributed to members who have an incentive to purchase their goods and services locally. The cooperatives provide the basis by which labour can hire capital, rather than the reverse, and engage in participatory decision making in the management of enterprises. Moreover, the ownership features of cooperatives disallow the possibility of equity investment, thereby ensuring that the economic benefits, control and ownership of these ventures remain anchored in the nation state-anchored in local communities. With the disaggregation of the scale of production and the relative ease of market entry in the new economy, the establishment of cooperative enterprises is becoming a more telling feasible method of economic adjustment. Australian policy makers need to learn from the Mondragon experience. Cooperatives can be an effective way of reconciling the tension between the global movement of capital and the local consequences of employment displacement. Opportunities should be made available for retrenched workers to use their accumulated savings and benefits to form cooperative ventures, either in their existing industry or in new markets. Presently, a large number of displaced manufacturing workers are entering the in-person services sector, either as prospective employees or franchisees. The cooperatives movement, displaying the virtues of nationally defined ownership and worker control, offers a more satisfactory process by which this transition can be made. The public sector can assist the growth and potential of this new source of economic activity and employment in Australia through carefully targeted measures such as the provision of advisory services and seed capital to ease the costs of market entry. Cooperatives of this kind also represent an effective means by which the resources and leadership of the trade union movement in Australia may find renewed relevance. While the Mondragon experience is deeply rooted in the history and culture of the Basque region, it nonetheless holds important lessons for those of us in public life who are interested in issues of institutional design. The way legislators structure the institutions of public governance can have a profound impact on social habits and values. I would argue that it is possible to change public culture, albeit incrementally, by altering the relationship the state might hold with its citizens. It is possible to build new forms of public mutuality and social capital through the reform of the public sector. This does not mean establishing more programs of the old kind. It requires a fundamental restructuring of the work of the state through the devolution of governance. This applies as much in the discharge of social provision as in economic policy. In many cases, the best way of creating social equality and connectedness lies in fostering the role of mutual organisations in the middle of society-that is, governments should continue to fulfil their traditional role as funders and regulators of service provision whilst ensuring that part of their functions as service providers is devolved to the non-state public sector. This approach relies on two related organisational principles. Firstly, the vertical coerself-governance cive structures of the state are deployed in the collection of resource inputs, thereby establishing the actuarial basis of a social safety net. This positions the role of government as a social insurer without necessarily requiring from it the conventional top-down method of service delivery. Taxes and other forms of revenue would continue to be collected by central government but instead of then being distributed to service providers within the state sector, they would be allocated directly to cooperatives and other mutual bodies. Within this system of demand side entitlements, government agencies would be required to undertake an assessment, according to the principles of equity and universality, of the amount and type of resources that need to be made available. In the health sector, for instance, this approach has been described as 'demand side socialism'. Secondly, the methods of civil society are used for determining the means by which these resources can be deployed for service delivery. Governments would need to fulfil their role as a regulator by establishing solid guidelines, prudential and administrative, by which these mutual organisations might operate. The cooperatives movement has provided a useful model for this type of public governance-based on the benefits of common ownership and control, strong standards of accountability and a record of democratic administration. While the cooperatives structure in Australia has been used mainly for the purpose of economic production and, as you would appreciate Madam Deputy Speaker Kelly, rural marketing, its ethos and methods are just as relevant to the task of social policy. It reflects, in the facilitation of common interests and social connectedness, the possibilities of governance without government. In Mondragon this has been achieved through the establishment of cooperatives for university education, income support and health purposes. These principles reflect a different way of thinking about the scale of public administration-using the nation state as the most appropriate unit for raising public resources and using freely路 formed small scale units of as the most appropriate means of organising the provision of public services. They also help to resolve many of the difficulties now facing the welfare state. As the British sociologist Anthony Giddens has written: The welfare state is a passive risk system-it isn't designed to encourage people to make active investment decisions with their lives. It only reacts to things when they go wrong: it takes care of you when you are ill, it puts you on the dole when you are unemployed. But it has been ineffective in actually countering poverty or redistributing wealth in the long term. Think of the welfare state not as the Left has traditionally thought of it-as a mechanism to alleviate inequality-but as a kind of insurance system that allows people to take risks. You must provide people with the resources they require to be active investors, as it were, but at the same time we must provide security mechanisms which protect them. For more than a century left-of-centre thinking has cast its equity goals in terms of state ownership. For practical purposes, this has produced a policy cul-de-sac. It is more likely in a post-industrial society that equality needs to be thought of in terms of the cohesiveness and connectedness in our society-the glue of reciprocated trust and mutuality that leads to acts of equality and social responsibility in practice. In the words of Tony Blair-socialism. The Mondragon experience reflects the benefits of this approach. It demonstrates how equality in practice relies more on a certain type of relation between people than the topdown programs of the state. In the words of Mondragon's founder, the Catholic social action priest, Jose Maria Arizmendi: If there is cooperation we can be supportive, if we have support we can make progress without masters. I commend the Mondragon experience to the House. (Time expired) International Trade: Language Studies",71
173,Dr SOUTHCOTT,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Boothby) (5.07 p.m.)That was an interesting speech by the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham). In thinking about how Australia is best poised to prepare its businesses and .work forces for the 21 st century we need - to think whether the trend that we have seen, where growth in trade and services has actually outstripped merchandise trade, is likely - o be seen in Australia. Australia's comparative advantage as a nation has long been in the area of agriculture and resources. More recently, as our economy has been more competitive, we have seen a rise in our export of elaborately transformed manufactures and tradeable goods, an area where Australia will have an advantage in certain niche markets. But our future lies in the area of our people, our human capital. As the services sector becomes more important in our trade we need to ensure that in areas such as health, education, toutism, and financial and legal services, we are poised to seize the opportunities of the next century. CrJtic1l1 to our successful engagement in our region will be the development of a generation of Australian workers who are 'Asia-literate', who are comfortable with the differing cultures and languages of the countries in our region, and who, through their language skills, will enhance our economic performance and also their own employment opportunities. Benjamin Disraeli, in his novel Tancred talked aboQt creating a career in-the east. The notion was' that bright young students would find fulfilment in doggedly pursuing interests in areas like India and China. That is the sort of thing that Australia needs to do-not in a neo-colonialist way. We need to have as a goal an Australian society which understands the languages and cultures of our region, which will not only be critical to underpinning the successful engagement of Australia and Asia but also be important in Australia and being able to play a part and look to the region with confidence. The idea of having Australians well versed in Asian languages is not a new one. Wayne Muller, in the Unicorn magazine, in December 1996, pointed out that Asian languages first appeared in the Australian education system in 1917 when James Murdoch was appointed to teach Japanese at the University of Sydney. That was in reaction to the swift and convincing victory of Japan in the RussoJapanese war of 1904 and the government's rising national security fears. By the end of the Second WorId War there were six Asian languages and studies faculties in Australian universities. The first reat' Asian studies movement' in Australia began in the 1960s when Australia's flow of raw export materials started to swing from Europe to Asia, and in particular to Japan. The expansion of Asian languages and studies in the curriculum is often referred to as the 'first Asian studies movement'. It provided students with the chance to choose between the classic European languages and an Asian language, mainly Japanese or Indonesian. The movement also led to Asian studies components being added to secondary and primary school social science curriculums. The limitation of the first movement was that there was no compulsion in the study of Asian languages. This seemed to cause a decrease in the number of students opting to take Asian studies or languages. By the 1980s Japan was well entrenched as Australia's leading trade partner and was fast-tracking itself into the position of the world's second largest economy. The 'tiger economies' of Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea were exploding. Asian immigration levels were increasing rapidly, as was Asian investment and tourism. As these factors were taking place it became recognised that the first Asian studies movement had levelled out and in some levels had declined. That resulted in the second Asian studies movement which was established in 1985. The council was chaired by Dr Stephen Fitzgerald. Until it was disbanded in 1991 the council played an important role in forming policy and curriculum development in the area of Asian studies and Asian languages. In 1994, COAG commissioned a report on a proposed national Asian languages and studies strategy for Australian schools. Just as the economic and financial reforms of the last decade have enhanced Australia's competitiveness in international trade, this report highlighted that our goal should be to have young Australians to whom the countries, languages and cultures of our region are familiar. The ideas in this report were not new. There have been more than a dozen government reports since 1969 which looked at increasing the number of Australians learning, firstly, second languages, and particularly an Asian language. Despite this, we see that, in the late 1960s, 40 per cent of year 12 students studied a language other than English; by 1982 that had dropped to 16.1 per cent. In 1992, only 12Y2 per cent of year 12 students were studying a second language and less than four per cent of them were studying an Asian language. The East Asia analytical unit of the Departand ment of Foreign Affairs and Trade argues that the languages that Australia should focus on for the future are Japanese, Mandarin, Indonesian and Korean. This replicates a September 1993 AGB MCNair survey of Australian business attitudes which indicated that, if businesses wanted to employ someone, they would most commonly seek the top three languages. The department also noted that Thai and Vietnamese may become more important in the future. These are the four languages that young Australians should think about taking at school and at university if they have the opportunity. Improving levels of language skills and cultural education will help in removing resistances to export growth and will help communications with our markets. While we need to use the language skills of Australians who do come from non-English speaking backgrounds, that alone will not be enough to meet the linguistic requirements of business. The next generation of Australians will need to combine language skills with other professional skills-for example, having Japanese with law, Mandarin with commerce or Indonesian with accountancy. People with those sorts of skills will be particularly sought after in the job market. The Commonwealth's 1991 white paper on Australian language and literacy policy set a target of 25 per cent of year 12 students studying a second language by the year 2000. The COAG report extended that target date to 2006. While the COAG report endorsed a school based program as the best means of improving language education we should realise that many, especially from regional and remote areas,will not have the opportunity to have a school based second language program. If they do, it is a fact that Australia does not have enough good teachers for people to get access to good teaching at the school level. We also need to think about people at a university level having the opportunity, when they are doing a general degree, to take up Japanese, Mandarin or Indonesian. The targets that the COAG report talked about having in the future were 60 per cent of year 10 students studying an Asian language 25 per cent of final year students studying a language other than English, with 15 per cent studying Asian languages and 10 per cent studying the more traditional European languages. The point of this is that it is critical to Australia's engagement in Asia that we do have high levels of literacy not only amongst people who work in business but also amongst the general community so that the general community has some sort of proficiency in the languages of our region. If you look at the way the United Kingdom has approached its languages policy, you will see that it was very much like the traditional Australian example, in that people would focus on French, German and, to a lesser extent, Spanish, but everyone would have to do a second language. At present, although the levels of Asian languages are very low in Australia, we still have a situation where we have more people per capita studying Japanese in Australia than in any other nation in the world. That is where I believe Australia's advantage will be in the future. We are a nation which has English as its first language but also has people present who lare comfortable working in the region, comfortable travelling in the region and comfortable speaking in the region who are able to use those things when working in areas like tourism, accountancy, commerce and the law. Technical and Further Education: New South Wales",74
174,Mr MOSSFIELD,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Greenway) (5.17 . p.m.}-I rise to speak in this grievance debate because I grieve for the New South Wales T AFE system under the unfair cuts being imposed by the federal government's funding arrangements. I have received very disturbing correspondence from the general secretary of the New South Wales Teachers Federation, the highly respected John Hennessy. In his correspondence, Mr Hennessy states that the abolition of growth funds and funding cuts over the last two Howard budgets has placed unacceptable pressure on TAFE. The federation claims that the level of skills of the Australian work force is seriously threatened by the misuse of competency based training and flexible delivery which are being used to reduce costs at the expense of quality education and training. I agree with the New South Wales Teachers Federation brief that TAFE plays a critical role in the education and skilling of the work force. It is important to note that the brief draws to the attention of all of us that there are more than twice the number of people with a TAFE qualification than with a university qualification. For those who seem to believe that we should all become totally besotted with the university aspect of education, I think it is timely to remind all members that T AFE is the largest and, I suspect, the most successful educator of our adult population. Surely no-one could deny that T AFE is a great and successful public institubeen tion which relies heavily on state and federal government funding. When federal governments take bean counter budget decisions to cut grants to T AFE they place enormous strains upon state government administrations. The millions of dollars in grant cuts to TAFE make it highly stressful and difficult for TAFE to service the community's vocational education and training needs while at the time providing high quality courses. All of these continue to be expected and demanded of TAFE by local communities, particularly businesses who rely on the training of their trainees and apprentices and the retraining of their existing work force. In a previous speech I referred to the concerns of the New South Wales minister for education, John Aquilina, about demands by the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Dr Kemp) that TAFE provides an efficiency dividend of 100,000 extra enrolments each year without increasing federal funding. The government continues to try to claim that claims of funding cuts are not correct. As we keep telling the government, even if they cannot read the budget papers, we can. They have cut and cut savagely. TAFE is facing problems not only because of grant cuts but also because the minister is insisting that the states meet the costs of training places for 150,000 unemployed 16to 17-year-olds previously on unemployment benefits. In New South Wales this will cost the state government $585 million. Does the federal government intend to give New South Wales a larger share of the tax income that it gets from New South Wales taxpayers? Of course it does not. This means that, in New South Wales, where we have the largest population and the largest number of unemployed, the people of New South Wales will be hardest hit by the inability to provide funds. This then flows into TAFE and it simply cannot meet the demands being made upon it. The result is either less students or less staff or both. The conditions the government is trying to enforce on states and our TAFE system have described as morally reprehensible and are used to manipulate education methodology to undermine course delivery and replace it with cheap, inadequate training. These unacceptable conditions are driving class sizes up, reducing the length of courses, threatening more expensive courses such as those that have necessarily high equipment and material costs, preventing community needs and demands being met, reducing access to T AFE by many of TAFE's traditional students, reducing classroom support, threatening the safety and welfare of students and teachers, and forcing the casualisation of T AFE's work force which, in New South Wales, means the loss of fully trained teachers. I know that T AFE is very concerned that the application of user choice policies by the federal government may well destroy one of the world's best trade training systems. It believes the government's so-called new apprenticeship policies amount to a disbanding of apprenticeships in favour of cheap traineeships, a reduction in the future skills base of Australians, deregulation and reduced supervision of trade training, a handing over of power to determine the training of employees to employers which will lead to narrow enterprise specific skills training, reduction trade training, and reduced education of tradespeople. At least the decision of the New South Wales government to refuse to abolish its declaration of trade legislation will help to offset the minister's attempt to destroy the apprenticeship system, and I congratulate the New South Wales government on its principled stand. I was most impressed with the recent recommendations of the New South Wales Teachers Federation on the future of vocational education and training for Australia. They proposed that we should reject the application of economic rationalism to the very foundation of our vocational education and training system in this country; insist that the federal government immediately increase funding to TAFE to enable it to meet the needs of the 16to 17-year-olds who will seek TAFE enrolment as a result of the abolition of the dole for this group; insist on a federally funded fee-free vocational education year in T AFE for all school leavers unable to obtain a job; insist that the government restore guaranteed growth funding to TAFE; insist that the federal government cooperate with the states to fund TAFE's community service obligations; protect the infrastructure of T AFE, which provides over 90 per cent of all vocational education and trammg in this nation; support its highly trained personnel in their quest to provide the skilled work force this nation needs; reject the proposed new apprenticeship system. Of course, the present government will have none of these, and for this I grieve deeply for the diminishing T AFE system. I grieve also for Australia's apprenticeship system. In 1989-90, approximately 66,000 young people commenced apprenticeship training. By 1997, this commencement figure was approximately 35,500, a drop of 46 per cent. I thank the Australian Education Union for a few thought starters on this particular issue. In the same period, one-year traineeships increased from approximately 10,000 to 77,000. While these figures are healthy, there is little evidence to suggest that traineeships in total have the same level of intense training in and skill formation that are contained in fouryear apprenticeships. Only three per cent of all traineeships reach level 3 of the Australian qualifications framework. It should be stated, however, that this is not a criticism of traineeships in themselves, as this scheme has in fact provided a basic skills base that has certainly attracted a lot of young people to employers on a full-time basis. The scheme is commended but, of course, it cannot take the place of full apprentices. Some of the reasons for the decline in apprenticeships are that employers appear reluctant to take on apprentices in a business environment where the economy is undergoing significant structural change. They are also reluctant where many industrialists are downsizing and where the dominant feelings about the economy are of uncertainty and a lack of confidence. The restructuring of many state government enterprises such as rail, electricity and water has meant these organisations are not training apprentices. High retention rates in school at the post-compulsory level have not been matched with a vocational culture in schools which would encourage young people into the world of work and have resulted in young people setting their sights on university education. The federal government has responded by convincing all states and territory governments, with the exception of New South Wales, to deregulate the apprenticeship system. This means that employers who were previously obliged to enter into a four-year contract of training with apprentices are no longer required to do so. In a recent report for ANTA, KPMG management consultants were asked to cost the new apprenticeship system. KPMG came up with 60 different scenarios, and none predicted an increase in four-year trained apprentices. All the predicted increases will come from oneor two-year traineeships with most of the training occurring on the job. Employers in future have the flexibility to discontinue the employment of an apprentice after one year-again, a total lack of security for young people so affected. New apprentices will continue their training only if the employer agrees to extend their contract of training. Young people may be encouraged to drop out of their apprenticeship if higher wages are available with other employers. User choice funding arrangements will also contribute to the dismantling of the four-year apprenticeship system. Employers will be able to nominate themselves as recipients of public funds if they become registered providers. (Time expired)",76
175,Mrs WEST,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I appreciate the opportunity to speak today in the grievance debate on an issue which I believe is of great concern to most, if not all, members of this parliament and all parliaments across Australia. The growing drug problem, the use and abuse of legal and illicit drugs in Australia and, more specifically, the use of these amongst our youth are of great concern to me. As some reports would state, some of our youth-and, if there are some, that is already too many-are smoking, drinking, sniffing, snorting and injecting themselves, and in some cases into oblivion. My grievance is that we, as federal parliamentarians, need to assist to find more positive solutions to this problem. Successive governments have attempted to correct the problem with a variety of policies and programs. Many to date are yet to be proven successful. We need to have real outcomes such as lowering the use and abuse of illicit drugs, diminishing the number of young people taking up a habit, controlling binge drinking or having measures to address the spread of crime related activities in relation to drug habits. For those who want to argue that point, if the programs had been successful I would be commending the efforts of those involved in the prevention of illicit drug use. I will delve further into the various programs later but, for now, let us look at the history of the drug culture in Australia. Drug use is not an isolated social problem. It has been noted that for the past 30 yearssince the 1960s when 'make love, not war' was the catch cry and everyone was encouraged to tune in, turn on and drop out as well as do their own thing-Australia has been part of a growing drug culture. However, this is hardly surprising when you consider the mass desensitisation of the Australian public towards drug use over the past couple of decades. Due to the graphic portrayal of drugs, sex and violence on our movie and television screens, the Australian public has come to see these things as routine and day-today occurrences. A visit to any video arcade will find children as young as 12, and younger, playing Drugs games whose object is to maim their opponent in the most violent of ways. Over the years, our youth have come to see violence and drugs as glamorous-very rarely do they see the seedy side of the industry. A flick through our daily newspapers will no doubt uncover numerous references to drug related deaths or crime. But these reports are becoming buried through the newspaper, unless they are accompanied by a sensationalised photograph similar to the one recently run in our national majors of the young boy sitting in the gutter beside his drugged out mother. Desensitisation of this issue has seen our drug problem increase. I can honestly say that I must be part of the last generation that had no contact, no knowledge and, indeed, no use or need for a drug related experience in my youth. This cannot unfortunately be said of a higher proportion of today's youth at school. If anything, it is getting worse. Incidences related over recent times have indicated that the use of and contact with illicit drugs is occurring at a younger and younger age. I have personal knowledge of a year 5 student smoking marijuana behind the toilet block at his primary school. That is a 10 year old. But this is one example of what is happening on a daily basis across this country and it reflects the seriousness of a loss of innocence. Childhood is being robbed by such incidences. By year 12, students in schools are fully aware of who the crack heads are, who the dealers are and what the situation is with regard to availability and supply. One student I spoke to recently has her own method of survival. She said, 'You know who they are. You just stay away from them.' This promotes the concept of teach them the principles and let them choose for themselves, and this is exactly what they have been doing. Can I say that it is a very mature outlook; however, it does not help curtail the drug related activities. If you closely followed the growth of illicit drug abuse, you would see that it has grown roughly in proportion to the plethora of law enforcement agencies designed to cope with the increase in crime. We currently have 22 law enforcement agencies tailored to use their collective resources to cut down on the escalating crime rate. This is not happening. Crime-in particular, drug related crimecontinues. Break and enters, robbery with violence and vandalism in many instances are drug related. It has been indicated that there are approximately 200,000 heroin users out of the 18 million Australians-that is, one in every 90 Australians uses heroin. If we equate that to the number of members in this chamber, we would have two heroin addicts in our midstquite a startling statistic and one which should alarm all Australians. How did we get to this point? If you look at the statistics from a government survey of 3,600 year 12 students from across the county, you will begin to understand where these addicts come from. Of those students surveyed, more than half had tried marijuana and one in five were regular users. Further to that, more than 10 per cent had tried the hallucinogenic LSD-about half of those as recently as a month prior to the survey. But it is not just the illicit or illegal drugs we should be concerned about. The survey also. found that more than half the year 12 students had drunk alcohol in the week prior and that 90 per cent had consumed alcohol in the past year. If we look at statistics provided by Teen Challenge in South Australia, we get an even more graphic snapshot of the problem of alcohol abuse. Their statistics were that 4Y2 million teenagers have a drinking problem; four per cent of high school seniors drink alcohol every day; alcohol related accidents are the leading cause of death among our young people 15 to 24 years of age; about half of all our youthful deaths in drowning, fires, suicide and homicide are alcohol related; and young people who use alcohol at an early age are more likely to use alcohol heavily and have alcohol related problemsthey are also more likely to abuse other drugs and get into trouble with the law. Why is this the case? How could we have failed our youth so badly? What is needed to combat this problem is a strong message: drugs are death and death is forever. This message needs to be made clear to children while they are still young. It needs to be consistent, repetitive and supportive. We need to assure our children that they are loved and appreciated and that there is no need for drugs. If we take the tobacco issue as an example, it has taken over 200 years for the message to get out that smoking kills. The industry had to be led kicking and screaming to the point where they would include the message, 'Smoking causes cancer,' on their packaging. I only hope it does not take that long to get the drug message across. But you do have to wonder when you look back over the long series of programs which have had spectacular failures. Harm reduction-or harm minimisation, as it was some:' times known-was a concept first mentioned by the former Labor health minister Neal Blewett. He claimed that the aim was to 'minimise the harmful effect of drugs on Australian society'. Following this came the 1986 'stay in control' program launched by the New South Wales Department of Health and jointly funded by the' New South Wales and federal governments. The message was aimed at 15to 17-year-old children and said, 'If you're going to drink, stay in control. Don't get drunk.' Not surprisingly, the program was abandoned as a failure. Another program which has been promoted as a successful example of harm minimisation is that of the needle exchange. In a paper published on the Internet by Craig Thompson, the author quotes some alarming statistics which would appear to prove this program has in fact failed. In relation to the rate of hepatifound tis C, it has been found that most new infections occur among drug injectors. About 60 per cent of drug injectors in Australia are already infected, which means there are 30 times as many drug injectors infected with hep C than HIV. He points out that the only way to gain control of the disease is to eradicate drug injecting. This is because the easiest way to catch the disease is through sharing needles. If addicts are so readily sharing needles, it must then be concluded that the needle exchange program is not working. This is but one example of how harm minimisation is failing our youth. (Time expired) Wood Royal Commission",78
176,Mr ALBANESE,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Grayndler) (5.37 p.m.)I rise this afternoon to talk about the Wood Royal Commission which concluded recently in New South Wales. Seventy million dollars was spent on the commission, which reported in August, and I would like to draw the attention of the House to two of Justice Woods's most pertinent findings: the link between corrupt police and illicit drugs and the dreadful findings about child abuse. While a great amount of information has surfaced about the nature and extent of paedophilia in New South Wales, one thing has remained a source of great concern, that is, the erroneous link which some sections of the media and individuals such as NSW MLC Franca Arena have drawn between homosexuality and paedophilia. Even the report of the Wood Royal Commission has commented about the damage that is being done by confusing the issue of someone's sexuality with whether or not they are a child abuser. Let me quote Justice Wood: The greater proportion of the information or allegations of conspiracy and wrong doings of the kind hinted at in public or the subject of notification to the commission was found to relate to the assumed homosexuality of the persons named and to rest solely on inference from the fact that they were involved in paedophile type offences. Justice Wood said that it was wrong to automatically link homosexuality with paedophilia and cited several cases in which there was little or no evidence for wide ranging allegations. In one example, a lengthy inquiry had that claims originated from gossip at a dinner party and no witnesses interviewed could provide any evidence whatsoever. There is no greater likelihood that if you are gay you will be a paedophile, and clearly no link between the two. This is in no way to suggest that paedophilia is not an extremely serious issue. All the evidence in fact suggests that the vast majority of child abusers are heterosexual men preying on little girls, often their own children or relatives. Patricia Easteal, Senior Criminologist at the Australian Institute of Criminology, conducted a survey of survivors of sexual assault in 1992. She found that young children were at greatest risk of sexual abuse from a member of their own family. In her survey stepfathers were.most frequently named as rapists. Now that Franca Arena's files are in the hands of the New South Wales Police Commissioner, her conspiracy theories might finally be investigated with a degree of thoroughness that even she will have to be happy with. Not, mind you, that Ms Arena has let the truth stop her making absurd allegations in the past based on no amount of evidence. The trouble is, Franca is a homophobe and cannot seem to distinguish between someone who is gay or bisexual and someone who is a child abuser. Her degree of hysteria about homosexuality is about the same as that of Fred Nile, who raves on in a most fascinated fashion about his favourite topics: homosexuals, lust and sodomy. The public first became acquainted with Ms Arena's homophobia in 1991 when she gained publicity in the gay and lesbian media by insisting in parliament that people who had acquired HIV through medical transmission were 'innocent victims' as opposed to gay men with HIV who were the 'guilty victims'. Justice Wood not only condemned those who have ruined lives on the basis of their assumptions about gay men but he also made positive recommendations about the way in which the state government might proceed on the issue of young men having sex together. Justice Wood recommended that sections of the Crimes Act be amended such that the age of consent is equalised for young men and women, both gay and straight, at 16. Why did he recommend this? Because, as well as its being a basic issue of discrimination based on sexuality, he said: The appearance of discriminatory treatment risks reinforcing homophobic bias and creating a false stereotype that homosexual males are likely to behave in a predatory fashion towards adolescents or have homosexual relations with boys. The other arguments in favour of a common age of consent are simple. There is no rational basis for the distinction and New South Wales legislation is out of line with some other states and territories. A discriminatory age of consent has potentially adverse affects on public health and education policies and existing laws stigmatise sexually active adolescent male homosexuals, or young men who may be experimenting, making it more difficult for them to come to terms with their sexuality. This leads to emotional disturbance, depression and unfortunately an extremely high rate of youth suicide. Recently in Sydney, 10,000 people participated in a rally to support the equalisation of the age of consent. These people have my support. I congratulate Labor MLC Jan Bumswoods on her private member's bill which would remove this discrimination and urge all New South Wales MPs to support this initiative. The other major issue that the royal commission has brought to our attention is illicit ?rug use and the link between that and organIsed crime. The New South Wales parliament has taken up three suggestions of the commission: firstly, that a heroin trial should be conducted-unfortunately, despite six years of work, John Howard effectively vetoed that; secondly, the Howard government should institute a national drugs summit-we have seen no action on that to date from the federal government; and, thirdly, the state government has set up a commission of inquiry into the issue of safe injecting rooms. Drug use by individuals is a health issue not a criminal issue. Whilst we continue to argue, as the member for Bowman (Mrs West) argued, that we can run a campaign based on 'Just say no,' we will continue to fail. It is an issue on which politicians should be providing some leadership. Tomorrow I will be attending the National Drug Community Action Conference here in Parliament House organised by the group Family and Friends for Drug Law Reform and the Damien Trimmingham Foundation, to be chaired by the Reverend Bill Crews, who, I note, is in the gallery tonight and who plays a tremendous role working with young people in the inner western suburbs of Sydney. The conference will be looking at national action which can be taken to reduce the harm associated with heroin use. A report to be tabled in the New South Wales upper house following visits to Cabramatta, Kings Cross, Byron Bay, Newcastle and Wollongong hopefully will support the view that governments should be looking at this issue as one of health. Information was also made available about the use of safe injecting rooms in a number of cities in Europe. It has been found that not only have there been no overdoses in any of these injecting facilities, but that these centres provided an excellent opportunity for community health education. Reverend Hans Visser operates safe injecting rooms in the basement of his church in Rotterdam with substantial community support. The philosophy behind this move is to bring injecting drug users back into the community and assist them to lead as normal lives as possible. Some of those drug users will continue to use drugs but the evidence suggests that most drug users will use it over a period of their lives which is strictly defined: perhaps for 10 years, perhaps for 15 years. The answer is not to push them outside society into the hands of criminal elements. The answer is to provide them with support and encouragement so that, hopefully, when they choose to give up their existing drug use and drug habit they are in a position to receive community support and, therefore, come back into the mainstream of society. I am astounded that anyone could argue in this parliament, for example, that initiatives taken on an issue like HIV - AIDS such as allowing needle exchanges have not been successful. It shows extraordinary ignorance. During the 1980s Australian governments on a bipartisan basis took very brave decisions about how to deal with what was then a controversial issue-HIV-AIDS. As a result, the HIV infection rate in Australia is 3.9 per 100,000. Compare that with the United States and with Spain, and you see a very stark contrast. It is that sort of vision and determination which politicians today must run with. We must ensure that there is bipartisan support on these issues if we are going to deal with the problem of drug use. As politicians we must now look at this with the same sort of courage. The United States has the 'just say no' approach, and last year the so-called war on drugs was shown to be such a failure that over 600,000 people were charged and sent to gaol on marijuana related issues. That sort of figure shows how young citizens are being brought into contact with the criminal elements. As the Wood royal commission and every other independent study throughout the world have shown, the only people who benefit from the outlawing of drugs are the criminal elements-be they the Mafia in the United States or the drug lords in Australia. It is those people who support. the 'just say no' campaign because they have an economic interest. This issue is far too important the easy political options. On this issue we must have courage. I call upon all members of the House to show that courage in their approach to the issue of drug use and to helping young Australians to live a healthier lifestyle. (Time expired) Law and Order",80
177,Mr HARDGRAVE,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Collectively, we are not thought of very highly by so many people in Australia. They tend to watch us argue the toss on a great number of matters and wonder why there is little or no progress on some of the important issues which concern them on an everyday basis. The most important issue in my electorate, as I imagine it is for all honourable members, is crime-law and order. It certainly is one of the basic responsibilities of governments of all levels to provide a certain amount of peace and security for our citizens. It is my submission that a challenge by which our constituents test us is: if a government cannot guarantee a reasonable level of security to its citizens, it is a failure. We have seen a succession of state governments being tipped out of office in the last handful of years simply because there has been a growing recognition of how state governments of the Labor persuasion let down a lot of people in regard to law and order issues. Challenges are now on coalition governments all around the country, though, to deliver the goods. Crime certainly is a growing problem in all urban areas, in particular. It needs the involvement of all of uslocal citizens, the police and members of parliament at all levels. The Victims of Crime Association in Queensland also plays a strong advocacy role. I make this point as one who helped start the association about nine years ago. Neighbourhood Watch organisations which operate throughout Australia and which operate effectively through my electorate also need encouragement. I have made it my business as a federal member to do everything I can to assist local Neighbourhood Watch groups to operate effectively-and with some good for us to take results in my area. Statistics show there to be lower crime rates where Neighbourhood Watch groups are effective. They really do need the support of all local residents. I would like to take a moment of the House's time to congratulate people in my electorate. They include: Lloyd Hawkins at Moorooka South; Tony Galletly at Moorooka North; Brian Lincoln at Salisbury West; Dave Richards at Upper Mount Gravatt watch 13; William Spratt at Eight Mile Plains on watch 10; Debbie Mullins at Greenslopes; Merle Clancy at Annerley watch 4; Michael Rolski at Coopers Plains; Trevor Rogers at Nathan; Debbie Kember at Yeronga West; and so many others in my local community who have dug in, stood up and played leadership roles in local Neighbourhood Watch groups. I particularly want to draw the House's attention to the efforts of Sue Fountain, who is, I must confess, a near neighbour of mine in the suburb of Eight Mile Plains in my electorate. Sue wrote to me on a number of occasions over the last year about her frustrations about juvenile laws, in particular. She pointed out in a letter to me earlier this year: 'if you're a dog owner, you're responsible for the actions of your dog but apparently not for those of your children.' In her submission, there needed to be some urgent legislative changes to ensure parents played a role in the rearing of their children and pointed out basic right from wrong. She suggested immediate changes in the law. In her view, while the majority of us are'very complacent, more and more people are getting very disillusioned with the deficiency of legal action where juveniles are concerned. She found the obvious lack of respect which children now have for people in authority and adults completely unacceptable. This came after Sue had been threatened with a violent assault by a juvenile offender well known to police in my electorate-after she had witnessed drug deals taking place within 100 metres of her home, and after eggs were pelted through windows and flyscreen doors and onto her roof and those of her neighbours. Juveniles were involved, and the police in the area have felt awfully powerless to act. They fear the Criminal Justice Commission in Queensland, for one, which has been an effective tool for those who want to get back at somebody by tying them up through the legal system. They also fear the juvenile justice system as such. There is good news, though, for people like Sue Fountain. The state Attorney-General in Queensland, the Hon. Denver Beanland, has actually come up with the goods. He really has made some changes to the juvenile justice legislation which are worth referring to in this place. He has brought in a tougher new criminal code, tough new laws and penalties-with more of those penalties carrying life sentences. The juvenile justice legislation has been drastically overhauled to bring in such things as victim offence conferencing to try to show some of these young kids the effect of some of their crimes. These changes occurred on July 1 of this year-{;hanges which are probably not as well noted in the general community as they will be and changes which are redressing the previous Labor government's quite soft approach on crime. The changes also make sure parents become more responsible, and have more rights as well to deal with their children. Parents are put back into the equation. There is a basic catch cry, which is: if you act like a"" criminal you will be treated like one, regardless of your age. The number of offenders in Queensland between the ages of 10 years and 24 years who committed homicide-which includes murder, attempted murder, conspiracy to murder, manslaughter and dangerous driving causing death-totalled 85 in the years 1995-96, juveniles as young as 15 and 16 having committed murder and one 14-year-old having attempted murder. This is a frightening statement of fact. Fifty per cent of all motor vehicle thefts in Queensland were committed by males aged 15 to 19, with 584 offenders aged 14 years or younger. There were II I sex offenders in the IO to 14 age bracket and 189 between 15 and 19. Despite accounting for only 23 per cent of the total population, offenders in the 10 to 24 age bracket were responsible for 83 per cent of all break and enters in Queensland. These are frightening statistics, facts of life that people in my electorate deal with on a daily basis. So, I am pleased Attorney-General Beanland has acted-and acted so effectively. The Goss government presided over a reduction in police power for various offences, noticeably the juvenile crime aspect and early release of prisoners, and the authoriwhatever ty of the courts was undermined by the softer penalties which were legislated. One of the first things the Goss government did when it came to power in 1989 was to reverse the previous government's tough approach on mandatory life sentences for trafficking in drugs. We cannot afford to go back to this sort of thing. The sort of system which has now evolved in this country has produced the absolutely disgraceful verdict involving the footballer, Nadruku, last week: 38 beers under your belt, three people bashed up, and you get off. That is where the court system in this country is going. As I said before, I helped start the Victims of Crime Association in路 Queensland back in 1988. It took seven years from that point on for the old Labor government in Queensland to act. Attorney-General Beanland should be congratulated for his efforts in trying to make sure victims of crime are afforded some of the rights which have been eroded over the years. We also need to look at the role of families. There has been a general decline in social values. A well-meaning but misguided assault by some on the role of the family has seen a disturbing decline in the authority of the family over the years. We need to ensure there is parental responsibility for the actions of children and, just as importantly, we need to ensure the authority of the courts, the police and the parliament. A multi-pronged approach is vital if we are to stop rising crime rates and return greater law and order to our streets and suburbs. Society should not be afraid to take on the responsibilities which families which cannot cope cannot meet. If parents fail in their role of teaching children right from wrong-the most basic value I think any of us can try to instil in our children-society should not walk away from punishment which fits the crime. We must also assist those families which are facing difficulties, because we believe in the importance and integrity of families. But we must restore the balance of rights with responsibilities and obligations for parents and their children. If the family is the basic unit of society, form that particular basic unit may take, then we must support and nurture it to prevent the course of action we should be prepared to undertake if necessary, that is, as a society, teaching children what happens if they do not understand what is right and what is wrong. We in this place have, as do all those in state parliaments around this country, a key responsibility to protect law-abiding citizens and provide security in our suburbs. We respect the separation of powers between the law-makers, the enforcers and the arbitrators, but we must ensure the courts act deftly and sensibly as well as fairly and the police have the confidence to act. We need to restore confidence in the minds of our nation's citizens: confidence in their personal security, confidence in their suburban safety and confidence that their key institutions will not let them down. We need to ensure all those key institutions are working well and working effectively and are focused on ensuring our citizenry are well protected at all times. I congratulate the Attorney-General (Mr Williams), who is in the chamber now, and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on the national campaign against violence and crime. It is acknowledgment at the federal government level that there is not a splitting up of responsibilities, that it is not simply a state matter to look after law and order. It really does start here in this place where we can provide the leadership and the inspiration and vocalise some of the real concerns which need to be addressed, that is, the safety and security of all the citizens we represent here. Medicare Office Closures Greenhouse Gases",82
178,Mr LAURIE FERGUSON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Before dealing with the central matter on which I want to speak today, I want briefly to cite correspondence from a constituent, Jan Thomas of Guildford, who articulates the concern of many residents about the continuing problem of the closure of Medicare offices in my electorate. Of course, this problem is interrelated with the fact that, despite the efforts of the previous government in supplying the Y-link train connection between Parramatta and Liverpool, Parramatta faces extreme traffic congestion problems, to the point where alternative train routes into the CBD are being considered. One thing which will add to that problem, of course, is the closure of the offices at Auburn and Merrylands. I want to indicate the words of my constituent-who is, as I say, representative of many others. She said: Instead of attending the doctor at Merrylands and then walking over to the office for reimbursement of my non-bulk billed account, I have to drive to Parramatta, thus fuelling the pollution problem and exacerbating the parking problems at Parramatta. Doesn't this government think further than the purse strings? Also, the fact is that, if one has to the doctor, one is sick, and one doesn't really want to drive to Parramatta for reimbursement. Also, one has to leave dependents at home while one drives to Parramatta for the same reimbursement. If I sound angry it is because I am. I know I am just a little person and have no clout whatsoever over the big boys, but enough little drops can cause a sink to sink a ship. I wanted to very briefly continue this criticism by my electorate of the very short-sighted moves of this government to restrict services in the western suburbs whilst, as we have seen in statistical analysis, maintaining a disproportionate number of those services in National and Liberal Party held electorates. However, the main issue on which I want to speak today is climate change and the continuing attempt by the current Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to hide his gross irresponsibility under the mantle of patriotism and nationalism. Earlier in the term of this government we saw the rampant hypocrisy of this policy line. After much drama and many histrionics over many years about how they were going to protect the flag, they came in here having decided that, despite years of rhetoric, they could not entrench the legislation to protect that flag. They brought in a measure which can be abolished by any government within five minutes. They did not even bother to require a majority of states to vote for change, despite the fact that a week ago we had the ridiculous proposition from the current Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) that, if we, the Australian people, chose to have an Australian head of state, that choice would have to be adopted not only by the majority of voters in this country but by every single state. That is an example of the kind of hypocrisy that attaches itself to those who utilise the flag and hide behind the guise of patriotism to protect what is a very sick level of studied opportunism and ignorance of world needs. The Prime Minister prances around the place saying that the CHOGM meeting showed that the countries involved resolved to avoid conflict and to confront the issue and that they have come to a degree of agreement about supporting differentiation, but there is been no definitive statement as to what differentiation they support. As has been indicated by many others in this debate around the country and internationally, there is obviously a degree of self interest. After thousands and thousands of sackings in the Public Service in this country, after he has stood back from the steel industry in Wollongong, when one of his ministers found it more important to go to a casino in Melbourne rather than attend meetings of workers in Newcastle, it is a sick response for the Prime Minister today internationally-and for his spokespeople here today-to say that he is interested in the future of coal industry jobs. The government's track record does not indicate a skerrick of interest in job protection in this country. Essentially, this government is dedicated to undermining people's conditions, to individualising people's ability to fight for themselves and to ensuring that they are alone in standing up for their conditions, and to making them very ready for the scrap heap. As well as that, we are aware that this government is dedicated to eroding the unemployment benefit rights of young people. Those people who were on the scrap heap in the late 19501> are now forced to utilise their roll overs before they can get unemployment benefits. For this government to say that it is concerned about the protection of coal industry jobs, or jobs in general, is an absolute grace. There are a number of reasons why has had a degree of success in reducing the emission of greenhouse gases over the last few years. The first was the collapse of the Soviet bloc and the fact that fairly ancient and anachronistic machinery has been slowly replaced in that region. While it might not be an issue on which we all agree, one of the facts of life in the short term is that France's nuclear program has also reduced greenhouse gases. One of the other facts of life is the term crisis. very strong attack on coalminers' jobs by the British government. It is interesting to note that, on Prime Minister Howard's visit to the United Kingway dom-as he told anyone who would listenprojects one of the high points of the visit, as well the flop of his cricket efforts, was that he was able to curtsy to former Prime Minister Thatcher. With its great respect for Thatcherpreserve ite policies, which involved wholesale closnot ures of mines in the UK, for this government to then say that it has any concern for coalminers' jobs in this country is an absolute farce. The concern the government has for the coal industry and coal workers has been the displayed in its attitudes to the Hunter Valley dispute where we have seen a continuing international attitude by this government, led by Minister Reith, that the solution to this dispute is to use the traditions of this country in regard to conciliation and arbitration. He does not want a solution. He does not want an end this dispute. What he essentially is that this company, and some of its confederates which own so many mines internament tionally, can afford to starve these workers until they surrender. This is indicative of the kind of attitude towards the coalminers that this government is supposedly protecting. What it is really concerned about is essentially ignoring interindustries national pressures, ignoring international crises and ignoring the confrontation that going to occur in decades to come when there are scarce resources and the impact of temUnited perature on food supplies actually hits home. This government is ignoring the reality that, disinternationally, large numbers of jobs can be created, as Germany has shown, by going into Europe alternatives at an early stage. This government relies upon a degree of self-interest, ignoring the well-understood international consensus of climate scientists that this is at crisis point. It is five minutes to midnight. This government prefers to kowtow to some industry interests. It prefers to ignore . the problem and hope it goes away. It prefers to take a position which kowtows to this kind of opportunism rather than face up to a longIn the same way that people are responsible for congestion today in cities around the world from Ankara to Bangkok, in the same that others are responsible for irrigation that basically destroyed their countas ries, this Prime Minister, when history is written in five, 10, 15 or 20 years time, might be able to say that he supposedly helped a few coal mining jobs, but he will be able to have any pride in regard to trying to get together an international solution whatsoever to a far greater problem. The hypocrisy of the proposition that the government has any interest whatsoever in the national interest is shown by the fact that, in long term, it is going to hurt us economically and we might actually be the subject of boycotts in the transfer of areas like solar energy where we are involved in not renewable energy and alternatives. We will possibly be subject to boycotts if we are not in the agreement. If we are part of underminto ing the need for an agreement, we will also relies upon be seen as a pariah. The demonstrable hypocrisy of this governis also shown at the same time by its industrial relations policy towards the coalminers. We have seen the situation in the Hunter Valley where it wants to starve people out, force people out of the union and whinge about people in one of the most dangerous in this country-an industry where life-threatening injuries and deaths occur is every day. This government has also been turning a blind eye to the introduction of States style Pinkerton detectives and security guards at the Gordonstone mine. It is not an Australian tradition to import US security companies to intimidate workers in this country. Not only is the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) fighting daily to make sure that workers in the Hunter Valley have to surrender their conditions, supposedly for $170 a day, but at the end of the ball game they are earning far less than they have earned up to now. Not only is he content with that but he is essentially out there condoning intimidation by US security forces in this countryMr Marek-Rubbish!",84
179,Mr LAURIE FERGUSON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"The member interrupts and says that it is rubbish, but the next election will show him that his own disinterest, his studied inability to tackle miners' problems, is going to be part of why he will be defeated. (Time expired)",87
180,Mr MAREK,GRIEVANCE DEBATE," retailers Today I would like to raise concern to small business. Put very simply: small business pays more sales tax per item than big business. I advise those reading this address that I owned and operated my own small business-a panel beating and sprayagainst painting shop-in Clermont for nine years, so people can rest assured that I am well across this topic that I talk on here today. In the amble as well it is also important to point that this sales tax issue is one of the factors that go right to the heart of employment prospects for all Australians. It is a fact that, although big business employ large numbers of people compared reveals with small business operators, there are many more small businesses than big businesses this country and, on the whole, it is assistance to small business that will pick up the majorialso ty of the unemployed in this country. We already see downsizing in big business. This is more work and more hours, often with more money or other incentives, but with fewer people. Our independent retailers are suffering because they are unable to compete against the giants like Woolworths and Coles. Beto pay more. cause independent retailers pay more in sales tax, they either have to charge more or have smaller margins within which to work. Unless we can address the way sales tax is applied, small business runs a severe risk of losing the market share it so greatly needs to survive in this very competitive market. Big businesses have market power simply because they have their own warehouses and can apply sales tax prior to freight and service fees. Independent retailers buy through a wholesaler, while major supermarkets buy into their own warehouses. This means that chains are paying tax on the manufacturing seIling price without taking into account freight and warehouse costs. Independent retailers, on the other hand, must pay tax on the wholesaler's selling price, which includes freight charged by the manufacturer and the warehouse margin. On top of this, large chains like Woolworths, Coles, et cetera can base their tax calculations on manufacturer's Sales Tax price net of rebates-something that small are unable to do; they have to pay on a matter of grave the full price. Accordingly, the major chains are miles ahead, receiving a competitive advantage of some $120 million a year over small businesses. This is nothing more than discrimination the independent retailer and small businesses in general. The unfair application of sales tax to independent retailers has prenothing to do with buying power or efficienout cy; the only difference is in the way the government applies wholesale sales tax-in other words, differing taxation points. Information provided by the National does Association of Retail Grocers of Australia that an independent retailer pays 2.5c more for a 700 gram can of Pal dog food and in 3c more on a 1.25 litre bottle of Coke compared with a major chain. Similar differences apply over a range of products. The impact of this unfair and inequitable system is being felt by small businesses Australia wide. Consider for a moment the impact that sales tax on freight has on those small businesses in rural and remote areas of Australia. The result is that country people in areas like all Alpha, Jericho and Clermont usually have In order to take advantage of cheaper prices, they will often choose to travel to the closest regional centre to do their shopping. This will lead to more small businesses closing because they cannot compete with the big chains. This is very prevalent in towns like Clermont and some mining towns in central Queensland in the electorate of Capri cornia. People often wait until long weekends or when they have days off and, instead of buying locally at the independent shops, they go and buy in the cities of Rockhampton, Mackay or even Emerald because they can get a better deal. That is what is knocking around small business in the small towns in rural and regional Australia. In June 1975, 60 per cent of the retail grocery market was held by the independent sector. Last year this dropped to 23 per cent and it is believed that it may possibly drop another two or three per cent this year. These statistics are absolutely frightening. ly, it means that, for every one per cent of market share that shifts from the independent retailer to the big chain, the government loses sales tax revenue. Ultimately, it falls back to the taxpayer because someone has to pay the difference. I am presently studying for my masters degree in business administration. With this in mind, I cannot for the life of me understand how we can continue to allow the present sales tax system to be applied. If we allow it to continue, the situation will be fraught with the danger of losing more small business operators in our nation. As long as the market share continues to shift from the independent retailer to the big chains, we are actually losing valuable sales tax revenuerevenue that could be used to improve competitiveness and boost employment. Although I certainly support big business in its various endeavours, I find it irresponsible to stand by and watch big business succeed at the expense of small business. The situation has reached a crucial stage. As a government we must address it now. I do not believe we can afford to wait for major tax reform. At the rate the market shift is happening, we must act now to address this situation. We can no longer sit idly by and watch the current system let big chains get more market share. It is time the big chains were also made to pay sales tax at the same point in the retail chain as small business. Recently the government announced its response to the fair trading report, New deal: a fair deal for small business. Let us continue our good work and go further by giving small business a break by making big business and small business pay sales tax at the same point in the retail chain, thus providing a fair deal for small business.",87
181,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE, Order! The time for the debate has concluded. I put the question: That grievances be noted. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA Message from the Governor General reported informing the House of assent to the Effectivefollowing bills: Auditor-General Bill 1997 Audit (Transitional and Miscellaneous) Amendment Bill 1997 Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill 1997 Financial Management and Accountability Bill 1997 Taxation Laws Amendment (Foreign Income Measures) Bill 1997 Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 1997 NA NA BILL 1997 Consideration of Senate Message Bill returned from the Senate with amendments.

182,Mr ENTSCH,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund, I present the 10th report of the committee, incorporating a dissenting report, entitled The Native Title Amendment Bill 1997, together with evidence received by the committee. Ordered that the report be printed.",88
183,Mr ENTSCH,COMMITTEES,"by leave-On 4 September, the House referred the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 to the parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund for consideration and report. During the committee's inquiry, over 1,600 submissions were received. Hearings were held on 12 days, and the locations included Broome, Alice Springs and Cairns. In all, more than 200 witnesses were heard-some on more than one occasion. On behalf of the committee I wish to thank all of those who assisted and provided the written and oral evidence. All views have been considered carefully and many submissions, both oral and written, were of considerable assistance. I would also like to take the opportunity of thanking the secretariat, particularly Peter Grundy for the wonderful work that he has done in assisting to compile this report. It certainly has been a difficult job, he has done it very well. I thank him and the secretariat for their efforts. The bill incorporates some important previous proposals for amending the Native Title Act. The amendments put forward by the Keating government in 1995 to cater for the High Court's decision in the Brandy case lapsed with the 1996 election. The changes put forward in the 1996 amendment bill by the present government were overtaken to some extent by the High Court's Wik decision, delivered on 23 September last year. Therefore, the current bill is a consolidation of some proposals which predated the Wik decision combined with amendments designed to deal with the impact of that decision. Unfortunately, this inquiry has been polarised on political lines from the outset. Accordingly, the committee has not been able to agree on the merits of the bill for its report. The document tabled today consists of a report by the majority of the committee, a minority report from the ALP members and the Democrat member on the committee and an addendum from Senator Woodley. I understand that the member for Banks (Mr Melham) will be speaking after me and that he will canvass the minority report. My remarks will, of course, centre on the majority report. However, I simply cannot let this opportunity pass without drawing to the attention of the House the disgraceful way in which the opposition has brought into play grubby party politics with what is unquestionably this nation's most important issue. We on this side of the House see this issue as being above partisanship. The behaviour of Labor has been appalling. At best, shabby politics at the expense of the indigenous community is to be reviled by all honourable members genuinely concerned with achieving a solution to issues surrounding native title. The ALP briefed the media for this morning's newspapers, boxed copies of the minority report prior to the tabling and held a televised press conference to discuss and distribute the minority report. Even worse, on page 21 of the minority report, the opposition presented a sanitised version of what transpired in a private meeting of the committeebut all of which are clear, deliberate breaches of privilege. I say to the House: how hypocritical! All this is further evidence of the indulgence of the political party opposite in cheap political point scoring, with no consideration for resolutions on this issue. The majority report recommended that the bill be adopted subject to four relatively minor matters. These relate to broadening the definition of banks in which representative bodies must keep their funds so as to include credit unions; the need for the government to be sensitive in situations where indigenous people continue to live on reserves but are unable to register native title applications over that land; clarifications of the conditions under which the exploration for opals may occur; and amending the bill provision dealing with the conduct of proceedings in the Federal Court so as to ensure that the appropriate balance is struck between the needs of the indigenous and non-indigenous parties. The majority report notes that although parts of the bill were controversial it also contains provisions which enjoy considerable support both within the committee and more widely. These include the amendments to cater for the High Court's 1995 Brandy decision, which are largely supported by the minority report; the amendments concerning the indigenous land use agreements, which are supported by the minority report; and the amendments affecting the operations of representative bodies. I should mention that the minority report has some reservations about these proposed amendments. In addition, there is a general agreement amongst stakeholders on the need for increased threshold tests on native title claim applications, although they differ on the details. Importantreport ly, the minority report does not acknowledge the extent of agreement on this point. The committee considers that the test proposed in the bill will sift out the applications, will allay the concerns of those who at present have to become involved in the claim process without good cause, and will upgrade and make more reputable the currency of native title. It will also have desired effect of preventing unrealistic expeclegal tations amongst potential claimants and inconvenience to non-claimants who, in some cases, include members of the indigenous community. Many development activities were carried out on pastoral leases following the coming into force of the Native Title Act at the end Of 1993. Some of those acts were done without reference to the Native Title Act because of the assumption that pastoral leases extinguished native title in many circumstances. The committee notes that this assumption was adopted by the Keating government, which strongly urged it on others. Significantly, the Wik decision rendered the assumption incorrect. The bill proposes to validate the possibly invalid acts, with compensation to be paid for any native title affected. The committee considers that this is a reasonable solution. At present, the act provides only very inadequate indication as to where native title may not exist in Australia. As a result, uncersubject tainty abounds in the community and ambit claims have been lodged which drag respondents into the claims process, even though ultimately the claims have little chance of success. The bill addresses this problem by providing a clear statement confirming that freehold and other specified tenures which confer exclusive possession have extinguished native title. The committee found this approach to be both necessary and appropriate. One way in which the bill confirms extinguishment is by including certain types of tenures which granted exclusive possession on a schedule to the bill. The committee examined the process by which items were selected for inclusion in the schedule. The majority found this process to be both conservative and rigorous, erring on the side of omission. Items were only included if it could be said with all confidence that they had extinguished native title under the tests contained hopeless in the judgments of the High Court. In part, the Wik decision created uncertainty over the extent of the rights of pastoralists in the face of possibly coexisting native title. the The bill contains amendments to protect the rights of pastoralists to enable them to carry out their legitimate activities. These amendments appear to have been somewhat misunderstood in the community as empowering pastoralists to intensify their use of the land, engage in activity damaging to the environment or to upgrade their leases. I should emphasise that it was demonstrated in the committee's inquiry that nothing in the bill relieves pastoralists who are seeking to expand the scope of their activities from having to comply with all the applicable land management, environmental and heritage protection laws. As the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) noted in his second reading speech, one of the shortcomings of the current act is that the right to negotiate procedures, which apply to mining and certain compulsory acquisitions, have failed to deliver the outcomes that were expected. Evidence to the committee supported this view. For example, the committee was told that, of the 1,910 acts which have been to the full right to negotiate process, only 148 were cleared for grant as at 10 October 1997. This is a clearance rate of about 7.7 per cent. The bill removes the right to negotiate where the scope of the rights to be granted will have only minimal impact on the land or where the native title rights that can exist on that land are very limited. The bill also contains provisions designed to reduce unnecessary delay in the right to negotiate process and to give greater scope for the states and territories to deal with these matters. The committee endorses the proposed amendments to the right to negotiate process. The bill contains provisions designed to assist the Federal Court properly to manage native title proceedings in a flexible manner and to balance the competing interests in litigation. Evidence to the committee identified a difficulty with one of these provisions. The new section 82(2) proposed in the bill will prevent the Federal Court from taking account of the customary and cultural concerns of indigenous people, but not so as to prejudice any other party to the proceedings. The committee is concerned that, in its present form, this would allow any prejudice to another party-no matter how small-to prevent the court from taking into account the indigenous concerns, no matter how significant. The committee recommends that the provision should be amended to insert the word 'unduly'. This will enable the court to assess the degree of prejudice to parties and balance it against the degree of benefit to the indigensions, ous parties. The bill contains sunset provisions setting a six-year limit on the lodging of sions. claims. The committee considers that these provisions are appropriate. The bill provides for the payment of compensation in all cases where native title is acquired or otherwise adversely affected. The bill limits the value compensation to that payable for the acquisition of freehold, and is intended to guarantee 'just terms' compensation as required by the constitution. The Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 is, to say the least, controversial. It has engendered a wide political debate with considerable feeling. Regrettably, much of the heat of this debate has emanated from misunderstandings of the provisions and effects of the proposed measures. The parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund has conducted a thorough inquiry which, I hope, will confirm any fair-minded analysis that this bill entails the twin virtues of providing with justice a new and more workable native title regime in Australia.",89
184,Mr MELHAM,COMMITTEES,"by leave-In rising to speak to the third minority report of the parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund, I remind the House of my words when speaking to the motion to refer the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 to the committee. At that time on 4 September 1997, I said: The committee bears an onerous responsibility ... It must fairly and dispassionately allow stakeholders a last desperate chance to be heard . . . The committee owes it to the parliament and the people of Australia to be a servant of the parliament and an agent of an incisive and fair inquiry. It should be neither a lackey to the government nor an agent of obstruction. Members of that Committee, burdened though some might be by declared or undeclared vested interests, must do what the government has failed to do. They must listen openly to criticism of the bill and show how it can be improved. The committee met over 12 days with more than 92 hours of sitting time. Over 2,050 pages of evidence were received into evidence. There is over 15 volumes of submiswith each volume having some 200 pages; so that is over 5,000 pages of submisThe fact that there is a substantial minority report signed by ALP and Democrat members is a measure of the failure of the coalition members of the committee to take up the task of set for them. They did, in fact, allow themselves to be used as instruments of the government rather than as servants of the parliament. They failed to address their task with any semblance of rigour or openmindedness. In the face of overwhelming evidence of disquiet on all sides as to the fairness and workability of the bill, they have chosen to toe the government line. We had the unseemly experience of a chairman going onto the public record as being in favour of the Australian Law Reform Commission appearing before the committee, only to reverse his attitude following the government expressing its opposition to the move. The committee did not hear the view of all key stakeholders. As reported in the media today, and commented upon in the minority report, indigenous people in the Kimberley region have not been heard. Despite travelling hundreds of kilometres to give evidence and despite the availability of translators, their evidence is unrecorded, and thus given no weight or credence. It is simply noted in Hansard that some witnesses gave evidence in a language other than English. Unlike every other witness before the committee and despite their names being spelt out for the Hansard reporters, they are not even named-so much for platitudes about coexistence; so much for platitudes about reconciliation. This was not reconciliation, this was humiliation. In returning to the substance of the legislation, it was incumbent on the minority to say the things the coalition members dared not. We have reflected on the overwhelming evidence presented that the legislation is unworkable, that it is unduly complex, that it will visit unprecedented bills for compensation upon the Australian taxpayers and that it is doomed to mUltiple challenges in the courts. Expert witnesses by the score came forward to demonstrate that the legislation in its present form is unworkable, and a recipe for uncertainty and economic stagnation in regional Australia. The committee could refuse to hear the Australian Law Reform Commission but they could not silence them. Together with the Victorian Law Institute and the New South Wales Bar Association, the commission is now on the public record in its trenchant and detailed criticism of the bill. The institute, New South Wales Bar Association and the commission cannot be dismissed as 'vested interests', easily consigned to the 'you would expect them to say that' category. The coalition members of the committee are joining the government in whistling in the dark if they think that they can proceed without heeding the authoritative and irrefutable criticism coming from organisations such as these. The Labor and Democrat members of the committee could not in conscience do so. Whilst endorsing the praise that witnesses appearing before the committee had for aspects of the bill, such as its enhancement of indigenous land use agreements and the role of representative bodies in resolving native title issues, we have been obliged to give voice to the widespread concern expressed by witnesses at fundamental flaws in the legislation. The recommendations made in the minority report provide a framework within which the bill can be amended and made workable. In contrast to the majority report, we have provided a comprehensive analysis of the legislation, a full consideration of the evidence presented to the committee and recommendations that reflect an open-minded consideration of what we have read, and seen, and heard. All of the stakeholders-miners, the petroleum industry, pastoralists, governments, pearling and fishing interests, indigenous peoples and the Australian taxpayer-have every right to expect that those gathered in this place will work together for their benefit. They have a right to expect that we will approach legislation such as the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 and the problems it seeks to solve with openness and rigour. They should expect, as a minimum, that any such legislation will solve more problems than it creates. This legislation fails that basic test. The minority finds that it is seriously flawed, unworkable in practice and destined for successful High Court challenge. Beyond this, it also contains the seeds of social division and international condemnation. I commend the minority report to the House and, in so the doing, repeat the offer made often and in good faith from this side to work with the government to deliver certainty on this issue through decent and workable legislation. At the time that the parliamentary committee was inquiring into the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997, a debate ensued in this House on the second reading. Fifty speakers spoke in that debate: there were 24 from the opposition, five from the Independents and 21 frorn the government. The Attorney-General (Mr Williams), who is the minister at the tabl- now, was the only minister who spoke in t-e debate. The Prime Minister (Mr Howardh-who made this issue dear to his heartdid not speak, nor did the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) nor any other minister or office holder. From the opposition's point of view, we had 13 members of shadow cabinet speak in the debate. These included: Mr Beazley, the Leader of the Opposition; Mr Evans, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition; 11 other shadow ministers; and two shadow parliamentary secretaries. That is indicative of the seriousness with which the opposition has entered this debate. Yet on the government side only the Attorney-General spoke. Last time in 1993, the then Prime Minister, Mr Keating, introduced the second reading debate into the House and then four ministers and two parliamentary secretaries spoke during the debate. It is disturbing that the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister did not choose to speak in the second reading debate. I commend the minority report to the House. I hope that it does allow further consideration on what we say are real problems with this bill.",91
185,Unknown,COMMITTEES,"Sitting suspended from 6.34 p.m. to 8.00 NA AMENDMENT (PARENTING AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 1997 Second Reading Debate resumed from 2 October, on motion by Mr Ruddock: That the bill be now read a second time. upon which Ms Macklin moved by way of amendment: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House: (1) condemns the government for its continuing assault on low income Australian families through, for example, the abolition of the dental health program, higher costs for prescriptions, higher child care costs and introduction of accommodation bonds and income tested daily fees for aged care; and (2) calls on the government to reconsider its plans to further penalise families with children with disabilities and sole parents"". Miss JACKIE KELLY (Lindsay) (8.01 p.m.)-Madam Deputy Speaker Kelly, let me congratulate you once again on the fine job you are doing in the chair. The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Parenting and Other Measures) Bill 1997, which we are discussing tonight, deals with a number of issues including the child disability allowance and related health care cards, the change of the single parents allowance into the parenting allowance and the change of the family payment into the family allowance. It provides some uniformity between waiting periods for the allowances. It also provides for name changes to be reflected in the computer systems that run in our social security department. As an aside, it is interesting to note that the new section 5lOH wi II introduce a situation whereby if the computer program determines a change in parenting allowance then a decision to change the payment will be taken to have been made by the secretary. I will come to that later. The range of allowances and benefits administered by Social Security is vast. It includes: parenting allowance, maternity p.m. allowance, guardian allowance, multiple birth allowance, lump sum advance, family payment, rent assistance, residential care allowance, double orphan pension, child disability allowance, health care cards, pensioner concession cards, health benefit cards, pharmaceutical allowance and family tax payments. That is just one area. Then there is newstart allowance, youth training allowance, partner allowance, sickness allowance, widows allowance, age pension, disability support pension, disability wage supplement, carers payments, bereavement allowance, mature age allowance, mature age partner allowance and all of the allowances which came before them which are still administered so as not to affect people retrospectively. Sometimes these changes deter people from attempting to re-enter the work force, even in their old age, because if they get sick or are the not confident that they will be able to remain in employment they risk not being able to go back to the same social security position that they were in before they commenced employment. They are afraid that they would have to requalify. Because each of these many and varied payments has a different set of criteria to be satisfied before it will be granted, it gets confusing for the consumers and for those administering the payments-and for those trying to explain it to us poor workers in electorate offices trying to understand the system. Yet all of these separate qualifying criteria are very important because people are individuals. We are trying to accommodate the extraordinary cross-section of needs in our community. I spent a few nights on the streets with the Sydney City Mission talking to those in need in our society. The universal thing they had in common was that their specific set of circumstances did not fit into any government sponsored program to date. It is very expensive to run individualistic programs in the changing geographic areas of need in this modem, fast moving, widespread, dislocated society without a substantial injection of funding into this area. Every time another payment is introduced, more government resources are expended in administering it. Every so often government needs to streamline those processes so there is no blow-out in administration and the extra resources are directed at those most in need in our community. This is where computer technology comes to the fore. By streamlining the waiting periods, deeming rates and income levels before payments cease, computers can provide great savings in terms of administration, data matching and incorrect payments. In this way, any increase in government expenditure, when we finally get back into the black after years of Labor over-expenditure, in this area of social security will go directly to the coalface-directly to those battlers in Lindsayand will not be soaked up by administration costs on the way through the bureaucracy. There are currently around 20,000 people employed to administer our social security system. They are assisted by the cross-referencing of social security numbers with tax file numbers. It is a very complex and time consuming system. Later we will discuss a few of the amendments that will make this system a lot easier. We will discuss ,the benefits that can be gained from this information age. For now I tum to our Asian neighbours very who, especially today, are struggling to gain developed world status. Taking pot shots at George Soros certainly has not helped. The recent decline in those tiger economies illustrates clearly how intertwined our economic stability in this region is. Members will have noticed the drop in the Australian dollar today. We need to help one another. We cannot take just a domestic view of issues like these. I hope that if we get the technology and the programs together to run the most efficient social security system in the world then when our neighbours in the region are in a position to set up their own social security systems we will have the products and the government technology to sell to them. We will have experienced and talented people within our Public Service to take advantage of job opportunities within our region to put a system into place. It is a matter of having a dedicated Public Service with an eye on foreign markets, job opportunities and export growth in our region. We have exceptional people in the CES, in Centrelink, who have years of experience. With the right leadership, they can take up the challenge of the information age and bring Australia back to a top-10 world ranking, where we once were. In Penrith, in my area, there are three Centrelink sites. As such, Centrelink has a long way to go, but it is a step in the right direction. The workplace for many of the staff in our area is cramped but it is heading towards cutting edge technologies. We are on the right track. Everybody needs to be reskilling to take advantage of the new technologies available and the efficiencies that can be brought to bear in the tools that are available for our public servants today, and to get more and more of the budget allocation to social security up against the coalface. From 20 March 1998, a single payment will replace the sole parent pension and the parenting allowance. This one payment will be easier to administer with similar assets tests and income tests. It targets the children rather than the marital status of their parents. The family payment will be renamed the family allowance, which is what it was called before 1992. At present, the waivers of waiting periods in the social security legislation vary very widely and cause confusion to users. One similar test will be introduced for ordinary waiting periods, for liquid assets test waiting periods and for the income maintenance period. This is so that the waiver of these periods will be consistent throughout. It is interesting to note that section 6.20 subsection 1 provides, with regard to waiving an ordinary waiting period, that the secretary needs to be satisfied that the person would suffer severe financial hardship if the person were subject to the ordinary waiting period. We can contrast this to section 598(5) which provides circumstances in which the liquid assets test waiting period can be waived. It may be waived if the secretary is satisfied that the application of subsection I to a person will cause undue long-term disadvantage or significant hardship to the person. Finally, to waive the income maintenance period under section 1067H5M, the secretary needs to be satisfied that the application of the income maintenance period to the person would cause the person severe financial hardship and that the circumstances that caused the severe financial hardship were not reasonably foreseeable by the person. We have three different situations there. We have long-term disadvantage, financial hardship that is not reasonably foreseeable and, basically, that they would suffer severe financial hardship. This has all been combined with a simple severe financial hardship test. Under this schedule, the secretary is able to waive part of the waiting period, instead of only the entire period or nothing. It is estimatfive years. ed that approximately 50,000 customers will benefit from this measure by having their waiting periods waived. It is important that we keep refining legislanumber tion such as this because these sorts of anomalies continue to crop up in such an amended piece of legislation. It is important that we reach some sort of standardisation that adds clarity and certainty to matters which really affect battlers in my area. The child disability allowance measures ensure that the $74.90 per fortnight paid under this allowance, which is to make up for the added expenses of caring for a child with a disability, go to those who experience those extra expenses. If a child has a disability so mild that there are no added expenses, such as where a child who qualified for the CDA by virtue of having had a transplant now lives day to day with no added expenses apart from those of a normal child, then it is appropriate to keep the government's limited resources for people who do need support from day to day. However, the requirement-and this is of concern to a number of parents in my areawas that they needed to claim the child disability allowance because that qualified them for the health care card. They were not terribly concerned about the money, but they did need the card. Allowance has been made for that as well. The card is still available for the children who previously qualified for it, but it is not attached to the child disability allowance. The Australian College of Paediatrics and the Asthma Foundation and deaf societies have congratulated the government on the formation of the child disability allowance tool, or the CDAT, which measures functional ability or level of disability of a child as well as their behavioural and emotional states and their special care needs. There is also a prescribed list of manifest disabilities and chronic illnesses. If you qualify under this tool for the child disability allowance, then it is given. This gets rid of a number of inconsistencies that were occurring between states and DSS offices in borderline cases, especially in hearing affected children. Those currently in receipt of a pension are protected for I also have to commend this bill on the increase in domiciliary care. This bill increases not only the amount paid but also the of respite days for carers from 43 days a year to 63 days a year. This means it is a day a week for parents or carers, and it includes a two-week holiday. That starts to bring carers of severely disabled children into line with the mainstream in the community. They get a two-week break for their own holidays. The other change is the permission to transfer tax file numbers by on-line computer services. Section 8 of the data-matching act provides that data is not to be transferred between agencies with tax file numbers attached. The administrative time involved in deleting and reapplying those numbers is extreme. Many resources are used in this administrative procedure rather than going to the coalface. I think some sort of link-up between social security numbers, tax file numbers and the introduction of the ability to transfer this information between departments in its true form will go a substantial way towards getting more of the resources in this area at the coalface rather than their being lost in administration. This goes some way to matching the tremendous strides this government has already taken in this area. We will continue to do what is best for Australia and our national interests in this area. We will provide the social security net that Australians demand of their standard of living. We will continue to refine this area and, as resources become available, we will continue to apply them in areas of need and reduce the wastage that sometimes goes on in this area. I know that we have the dedicated Public Service and the right leadership to bring this together after years of neglect. We will build this up into a very exciting, dynamic, techno age for Public Service delivery of social welfare needs. I commend the bill to the House. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs DeAnne Kelly)-Before calling the next speaker, may I thank the honourable member for Lindsay for her kind welcome.",93
186,Mr LEE,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Madam Deputy Speaker, I also congratulate you on your elevation to high office-certainly you are physically higher than the rest of us at the moment. I begin by taking a slightly different approach to the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Parenting and Other Measures) Bill 1997 than the honourable member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly). This bill once again demonstrates the penny-pinching attitude of the Howard government when it comes to families and family support. The bill makes a great many small cuts to family services by introducing harsh new eligibility tests, by cutting back on payments and by forcing families to further run down their savings before they get any financial support from the government. We have seen the same sort of attitude in the cutbacks to federal funding for public hospitals. We have seen the same attitude in the introduction of higher charges for essential medicines. We have also seen this attitude in the cuts to operational funding for child-care centres around Australia. All of these cuts have been in clear breach of the Howard government's election promises. This bill makes cuts to family payments, sole parent payments, the child disability allowance and to people in severe financial hardship who are in need of emergency support. I will begin by dealing with the child disability allowance. The federal government has historically recognised the extra costs which families face when raising children with severe physical or intellectual disabilities through the payment of the child disability allowance and other measures. Since its election, the Howard government has taken every opportunity to cut back on Commonwealth assistance for child disability allowance. This bill introduces a new, much harsher list of eligible disabilities for which payment may be claimed. I would like to give an example to the House tonight of a way these particular measures can be applied which places families at a disadvantage, particularly families where one of the children has a disability. I will not mention the surname or the address of the family concerned, but the example concerns a family who lives in my electorate and their son Adam. It began with a letter in June to the family which says: We cannot pay you Child Disability Allowance for Adam. Although you look after Adam at home, he does not need the level of care and attention daily to get Child Disability Allowance. This decision has been made under section 965 of the Social Security Act 1991. Do not use Adam's health care card after 19 June 1997. It goes on to make a few other comments in that very brief three paragraph letter. A follow-up letter contained the following paragraph: We cannot pay you Child Disability Allowance for Adam. This is because Adam does not need the level of care and attention daily to get Child Disability Allowance even though Adam is cared for by you at home. Thankfully, the family concerned were not prepared to simply accept the department's edict. The family concerned knew enough about their own rights and the opportunities that are available to them under the Social Security Act to seek to have this decision reviewed. As part of a submission seeking a review, they sent a letter to the Department of Social Security stating: I am writing to you about our claim for child disability allowance for our son Adam which has been rejected. Adam was born with a significant bilateral upper limb deficiency. On his right side he has a shortened humerus which narrows to a point. At the end of the right arm is a small digit with no movement or bone. This digit constantly twists and cuts off circulation to finger, which causes extreme pain. On his left side the humerus has formed normally but there is no elbow or forearm. He has a small partial hand with three digits, these are mobile but don't close enough to grasp or hold objects and he is unable to reach his mouth. It goes on to say: Because of Adam's disability he cannot use his hands like other babies of the same age. He has to be encouraged to use his feet for things that a baby would naturally use their hands for. He becomes frustrated when he is put down at playtime because he cannot reach out to touch things. We cannot give him toys, rattles, etc, to hold as his small hand cannot hold objects. He cannot entertain himself and cries until I go to him and shake a rattle, hold toys in front of him. He needs to be constantly supervised day and night to make sure he hasn't rolled into a position he cannot push himself out of. He needs to be seen by the limb deficiency clinic at westmead childrens hospital frequently. He has to go to westmead childrens hospital for his first surgery on ... July. He has frequent visits to paediatricians to monitor his growth. Visits to doctors, hand surgeon, hospitals which all require extra time. He requires physiotherapy and his legs need to be exercised so he has full mobility. He will be taught to use his feet for playing, feeding, writing and dressing. It goes on to say: I think Adams disability is obviously permanent and will require care for the rest of his life. Each week that he develops he requires more care. He cannot put things in his mouth when he starts teething. He cannot hold his own bottle. He cannot feed himself and needs to be shown how to do everything with his feet. That is quite a clear description of the extra care and attention which Adam's family have had to provide to him because of his disability. Yet the Department of Social Security ruled in that case that the family was not eligible for social security because they believed that Adam did not require the level of care and attention needed to qualify for child disability allowance. I really did find that an amazing decision. I am pleased to say that the review officer within the Department of Social Security, having received that letter, and after the family had approached me and I had sent a letter of support to the department-as I am sure a member from either side of the House would have sent a letter to support that family's claim-quite rightly agreed to overturn the original decision. The point I am trying to make is that there are many families out there who might not have had enough confidence in themselves or might not have known how to exercise their legal rights to appeal. Many families might not have known that they could have put in an appeal, despite the fact that the standard words go in all the letters from the Department of Social Security. There are many people who are quite apprehensive about the way processes work in government departments. I think we have to be very careful about making sure that the staff at the primary level of decision making within Centrelink, the new department, do try to make sure that families are treated with more justice than that family was when the original decision was made not to provide them with child disability allowance. I am pleased that that decision was overturned on appeal. One of the measures in this particular bill that does cause me some concern is the decision by the government to reduce the period for arrears from 12 months to six months. This is perhaps no surprise, given that this government last year made an attempt to reduce the period of arrears from 12 months to three months. We were very pleased that the Labor Party, in cooperation with the minor parties, was able to defeat that in the Senate last year. This particular bill seeks to reduce the period of arrears from 12 months to six months. In combination with other measures in the bill, that means a net saving to the government of $10 million. This is quite unfair, given that there are a number of disabilities which children may suffer from which become obvious to parents only after the kids have spent time growing, developing and seeking to develop all of their skills. It quite unfair that the government seeks to say to parents that, unless they find the time to lodg- an application for this allowance with the Department of Social Security within six months, they will suffer some financial penalty. For families who are seeking to raise a child with a disability, you can imagine that that might be the last thing on their minds: finding the time to rush up to a government department to lodge lots of paperwork. We on this side of the House believe that the government should retain that 12-month period of arrears, which will allow parents sufficient time to make sure that they have all the information-information from their doctor and all of the reports that need to be commissioned to support claims-before they do lodge that material. The bill also seeks to introduce new restrictions on the criteria for severe financial hardship under which waiting periods for payments can be waived. Severe financial hardship will now mean that a person must have liquid assets of no more than two weeks payment for income maintenance. The liquid assets test must also demonstrate that, in the view of an official at Centrelink, the government department, they are in such a financial predicament because of a condition that is unavoidable and requires essential expenditure. Unavoidable and essential expenditure is not taken to mean someone who is in need of clothing or medical expenses. Apparently it does include essential household repairs, electricity bills or food-it is very generous of them to allow food to be counted-but not child care, medical check-ups or other necessities of life. I do think the government needs to reconsider the definitions that are so contained. Finally, I wish to outline my reasons for supporting the amendment which has been moved by the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) in outlining the opposition's position on this legislation. In addition to stating that the opposition will not be seeking to decline to give the bill a second reading, we make clear our condemnation of the government for is many other changes that have been introduced during the life of the Howard government. In particular, the honourable member for Jagajaga's amendment condemns the government for the abolition of the Commonwealth dental health program, a decision made in the August 1996 budget which slashed $100 million a year from federal funding for dental services for low income Australians. This decision was described by the Melbourne Age as the cruellest decision of that first Howard budget, a decision which is already starting to produce quite lengthy waiting periods in many of the dental clinics that in the past were run by state governments. The government quite callously seeks to suggest that the Commonwealth government should not have a role in providing assistance, emergency dental care and preventive dental care for low income Australians. Certainly, over the three years before the Howard government made this decision to abolish the Commonwealth dental health program, there was seen to be a role for the federal government. In fact, the federal government's funding of $100 million a year almost doubled the amount of Commonwealth and state funding going into providing government dental care funding. I have to say to those members who represent rural and provincial electorates that some of that funding went to make sure there were dentists in country towns that otherwise would not have access to dental services at all. I know from people in the New England area that there is going to be a great deal of difficulty maintaining the services that were expanded during the period of the Commonwealth dental health program because of these decisions that have been made by this government. We also know that many low income Australians are suffering because of the government's decision to increase the cost of essential medicines. In that first Howard budget, we had the decision to increase the cost of pharmaceuticals for concessional patients from $2.70 to $3.20. In addition, in the first and second Howard budgets, we had decisions to delist certain essential medications and therapeutic goods. There was also the decision in the last budget to introduce therapeutic group premium policy come 1 February next year. Many low income Australians are already starting to be hurt by this government's decision to increase the cost of essential medicines but, come 1 February next year, they are going to find that, if they need to use drugs for high blood pressure, high cholesterol, ulcers or depression, they may be faced with the fact that the government will only subsidise the cheapest medication available in that particular group of drugs. That will mean that concessionaJ patients could be up for significant additional amounts of money on top of the $3.20 for their essential drugs. Families that are already paying up to $20 for medication might be required to pay an additional premium if their doctor says they cannot afford to use the cheapest drug in any of these five particular groups. We have had other speakers on this side explain the impact on families of the higher child care costs. The other measure that is mentioned in the honourable member for Jagajaga's second reading amendment is the fact that the Labor Party has condemned the government for the introduction of the Howard nursing home policy. Today has been an interesting day with the government's latest changes to the nursing home policy. If we really had a government that listened to older Australians, they would have scrapped the nursing home changes today. We would not have had the third set of changes to this policy announced today by the Minister for Family Services (Mr Warwick Smith). If we had a Minister for Family Services who had gone back to Launceston and listened to what his older constituents were telling him, he would have gone to cabinet and argued for the complete scrapping of the nursing home policy, not simply another minor tinkering and finetuning as described by the government. If we had a Prime Minister who had the strength to admit he had made a mistake, he would have been on the phone to his cabinet from Edinburgh saying, 'It's time for us to scrap the nursing home changes. It's time to correct the mistake that we made.' If we had the a Prime Minister who had the strength to admit he had made a mistake, it would not have been finetuning; it would have been the complete scrapping of these changes. If we had a Minister for Family Services who was not there simply because John Howard decided to get square with him because he backed John Elliott and Andrew Peacock against John Howard in the late 1980s, we would have had a minister who had the confidence of the cabinet to scrap the measures, not to simply do some finetuning. At the end of the day, after the changes that have been announced today, people are still going to have to pay those accommodation bonds. They will still have to pay them. A small group were exempted today-that is, those who had carers who lived in houses with nursing home residents for between two and five years. They were the only people who were exempted today from that accommodation bond. The minister's only answer to the massive roar of disapproval from older Australians right around the country in opposition to the accommodation bond is, 'If you don't want to pay an accommodation bond, we can take it out of your estate.' We went through an example on this last week. In my own electorate, I know of at least four nursing homes which operate for profit that are asking people for $90,000 or more for an accommodation bond. The figures we did last week were that, if you decide to have the money taken out of your estate for a nursing home for which the accommodation bond is $100,000, it adds up to a lot of money very quickly. The government lets the nursing home proprietor take out $13,000 if you are there for five years and you are up for eight per cent compound interest on $100,000. That adds up to $56,000 after five years. So the nursing home says to you, 'Option A is you can sell your house and give us a bond of $100,000. If you pass away after five years, we get $13,OOO,'-that is the up-front accommodation option-'and option B is we'll take it out of your estate but, after five years, we take out $56,000.' There is the choice: 'Sell your house and we'll take $13,000, or you can keep the house and we'll take $56,000.' Which choice do you think most elderly Australians are going to be forced to make? That is why today's decision means no-one is exempted from those accommodation bonds. We have the ridiculous position that the government's decision today means it has accepted our argument that it is unfair to apply that higher daily fee to anyone who is in a nursing home before 1 March next year, but come the first minute of 1 March 1998 suddenly it becomes fair. It is all right, according to this government, for a part pensioner to pay up to 92c in the dollar as an effective tax rate-because of the 50c in the dollar social security means test, tax and the new 25c in the dollar means test on the nursing home daily fee. Why is it unfair for someone to be hit by a 92c in the dollar penalty if they are in a nursing home before 1 March but, according to this government, it suddenly becomes fair if they are unlucky enough to be admitted to a nursing home after I March? For all of these reasons, we are going to maintain the blowtorch to the belly of this government until they back down on all of these nursing home changes. If we had a Prime Minister with some strength, he would be prepared to back down and scrap the measures. It was reported in the papers last week that apparently he said to his party room that they could not afford to back down because they would appear weak. He is so worried that his authority as Prime Minister has been undermined after the last 12 months. If Jeff Kennett were Prime Minister of Australia, do you think the nursing home changes would not have been scrapped today? If we had a Prime Minister with a bit of strength and a minister who had his confidence, these changes would have been abolished today. That is the challenge for this government. It is a test that every older Australian is going to apply to this government as we get closer and closer to next year's election. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs DeAnne Kelly)-I thank the member for Dobell for his kind words.",96
187,Mrs JOHNSTON,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Canning) (8.38 p.m.)Madam Deputy Speaker, I also add my congratulations on your appointment to the Chair. I am impressed by the way you are carrying out your duties on such a short, very fast learning curve. In speaking to the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Parenting and Other Measures) Bill, I am reminded of the immense responsibility involved in being a parent. I am sure all mothers and fathers can vouch for the fact that raising a family can, at times, be difficult. Most of us would agree that the enjoyment, pride and happiness that only family life can offer far outweighs any such difficulties that they may experience. The measures we are debating tonight attempt to give better support to families and will ensure that the system which provides assistance to parents is made simpler. To pick up one of the points made by the member for Dobell (Mr Lee), I feel very sorry for young Adam and wish him and his family every success in making sure that the rehabilitation program which he will have to undergo in his future life will be successful. The reforms that we are talking about will help families such as Adam's. What we will do on this side of the House in this change to the bill is to measure the child's 'functional' ability, rather than the care and attention that the member spoke about before: issues such as the child's 'gross and fine motor skills', the ability for young Adam to provide self-care and perhaps to be able to dress and feed himself. When they are assessed, all of these things will a huge influence on Centrelink's decision on whether or not the additional disability allowance will be made available. In the 20 months since coming to office, the coalition has delivered on its pre-election commitment to get a better deal for families. Some of these initiatives are the family tax initiative, immunisation incentives and the private health insurance rebate which is very much welcomed by the elderly in our community. In the main, it is the elderly peoplewhom the opposition have totally scared with their very inappropriate comments in the last few weeks-who contribute to private health insurance. I think the member for Dobell should be looking at himself when he makes comments about the nursing home accommodation fee. It is very unbecoming, very un-Australian and certainly very unfair to use tactics such as the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), for example, has used to totally scare elderly people. The measures I am about to discuss give effect to announcements made by the Howard government in the 1997-98 budget. The first of these measures deals with the current parenting allowance and sole parent pension. Under the present arrangements, an immediate distinction is made between those parents who are unpartnered or alone and those where two people take on parental responsibility. Renaming the family income support payment from the sole parent pension and parenting allowance to the singularly entitled 'parenting payment' is more than just a symbolic gesture. This measure will deliver equity to all. It will simplify administrative arrangements, especially for those parents whose marital status changes. Some sole parents feel there is a social stigma attached to being singled out from other parents in respect of income support entitlements. The recognition of parents who may have lost their former partners to illness or as a result of marriage breakdown will be among those who particularly welcome this measure. However, the coalition acknowledges it can be more difficult for a lone parent to address the needs of their children. That is why conditions in respect to entitlements, have whilst in the main being standardised, will remain largely unaffected. The new parenting payment will come into effect on 20 March 1998. The bill also seeks to amend social security allowance provisions in respect to hardship rules. These new rules, although applying across the spectrum of income support payments, will largely benefit those people applying for newstart allowance. Before becoming eligible to receive unemployment benefits, depending op the circumstances that preceded them being out Of work, applicants may have to comply with certain waiting periods. These waiting periods are tested in respect of liquid assets, income maintenance and the ordinary waiting period. Currently, if an unemployed person can demonstrate they are experiencing severe or significant financial hardship, waiting periods can be waived. However, the rules to which the applicant must adhere are different across all these categories. The bill seeks to redress this anomaly and to ensure that the hardship rules for the waiving of waiting periods are standardised across the board as of 1 July 1998. The third. measure on which I wish to comment is the amendments being sought to the payment of child disability allowance. Measures to be introduced seek to implement-again from 1 July 1998-a new way of assessing claims for the child disability allowance. Indeed, I gave an example of that earlier. A simpler, more responsive process will be introduced. This will improve the targeting of assistance to individual carers or parents in an effort to relieve those with the largest caring load. Again, Adam may very well be one of the children who will benefit the most from this measure. The adequacy of payments to those carers of children with disabilities will be extended to cover an extra 21 days of temporary respite care. The coalition strongly acknowledges the tireless and often stressful work of carers, regardless of whether that role is carried out within the home environment by parents and relatives or through outside help. Families are the cornerstone of our society. Indeed, it was only yesterday that Australia celebrated National Family Day in recognition of their importance. I was fortunate enough to join with many of my constituents in Canning in a wonderful family day picnic. Families form the basis of our children's understanding about the world. How our children impact on and respond to life's challenges is primarily fostered through relationships between family members. The Labor opposition professes to care for families, but it is that same party which has neglected to encourage parents to fully immunise their children. The Labor Party are experts at espousing promises on how to allay the fears of families about their children's future. We are all too well aware of Labor's greatest lie-that 'by 1990 no Australian child shall live in poverty'. I urge parents not to be fooled by such statements. Let us never lose sight of the fact that those opposite do not follow through on their promises. Australian families are well aware of what sort of government the ALP delivers. The previous government was one which expected parents to work from Monday to Wednesday, because that is how long it took parents on average to pay their tax before they started to receive any earnings for themselves for their efforts on the job. Big taxing, big spending are what the former government is very well known for. And we had the Beazley black hole to show for it. Mr O'Connor-Not true. Why don't you look at the facts? You are peddling all this nonsense.",100
188,Mrs JOHNSTON,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Let me remind the member opposite that the Australian public voted overwhelmingly last year for some responsibility, because the Keating-Beazley team just lost the plot. Responsible and responsive government is what the Howard government is committed to delivering to Australian families. I notice that the member opposite smiles, so perhaps he might even agree with me. The measures introduced as part of this bill this evening reflect on an overall strategy by this government to improve the social security system of our country, to provide an adequate safety net for those in need, and to ensure that income support is provided in a flexible, responsive and consistent manner. At the official launch of Centrelink in my electorate, it was pleasing to be told by Trevor Sainsbury, the regional manager at the Gosnells office, about the positive feedback from clients on the change in delivery of services. The service is now far more accessible, far more friendly and much more convenient for the overwhelming majority of my constituents. Perhaps this is a good opportunity for me to congratulate not only Trevor Sainsbury but also his very dedicated staff on being prepared to accept the changes that this government has introduced, to go along with them and to acknowledge them as being successful. It is also encouraging to hear from many of my constituents that the streamlining of services delivered throughout the electorate of Canning has been welcomed by them. As I said before, this is all part of the coalition delivering responsive and responsible government. We often hear about the level or percentage of people who are unemployed, particularly those who have been without a job for a very long time. This is a tragedy that must be addressed and can be improved on only by the business community being given an environment in which they can succeed financially. They need to be given certain assurances that they can be rid of the impediments currently preventing their continued prosperity-impediments such as the disastrous unfair dismissal laws introduced by the Keating government and continuing to be supported by the current Beazley opposition. Having said this, though, it is equally important to note that approximately 92 per cent of Australians are gainfully employed. It is from this generation of output that wealth is created. Let us not forget that this, together with the payment of people's hard earned taxes, enables the government of any party to redistribute benefits to fund the parenting allowance and other such social welfare payments that we are discussing tonight. As Margaret Thatcher once said: Government is the user not the creator of wealth; its job is to facilitate the creation of wealth by individuals, by industry and commerce ... These are the basic social services ... They provide Without a job there is no way of looking after one's family ... The measures debated in the bill before us provide a degree of equity and accountability to the families of my electorate of Canning and to the nation at large. The member for Dobell (Mr Lee) was talking about the Howard government being one which is considered to be unfair and callous. I challenge him to remember what his government's legacy to this country was. He needs to remember that it was the Labor government of which he was a member that neglected the well-being of the overall economy. They made the big and irresponsible spending decisions. They are the people who left this country with a $10 billion debt. And although we on this side of the House did not create the mess, as a responsible government we have taken it upon ourselves to fix it. And fix it we will, no matter how much crying there is from the opposite side of this chamber. We will be responsible to our electorates. We gave them a commitment when we were elected to government that we would provide for them not only just for today but also for their future. To that end, what we as a government must first achieve is to ensure that this economy is once again in black figures, that this country can once again live within its own llleans, because unless we do that we have absolutely nowhere to go. I commend this bill to the House. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-I thank the honourable member for Canning for her very gracious welcome.",102
189,Mr ENTSCH,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Leichhardt) (8.53 p.m.)Madam Deputy Speaker, I also would like to take this opportunity-the first one that I have had-to congratulate you on your elevation to such an esteemed position. I am sure that you will perform your role as Deputy Speaker proudly. Congratulations. I rise this evening to lend my strong support to the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Parenting and Other Measures) Bill 1997. The various measures introduced by this. bill will fix five main problem areas which have been identified in the legislation jobs. as it now stands. These problems are as follows: firstly, there are unnecessary paperwork requirements for recipients whose marital status changes but not the circumstances which make them deserving of support; secondly, there is a requirement for parents to wait too long a period before being permitted to claim arrears of child disability allowance; thirdly, inconsistent hardship rules are applied to ordinary waiting periods and the income maintenance periods; fourthly, some people are abusing the assessment system for health care card eligibility by making their income appear lower for the short four-week period in which they are means tested; and, fifthly, there are unnecessary and burdensome costs to the taxpayer and wastage of this parliament's time by necessitating changes to be made to the data matching legislation every time a new social security payment is introduced. I will focus my remarks this evening on only some of the measures implemented through this bill: the introduction of the parenting payment; the changes to the child disability allowance, and maintaining the eligibility to the health care card for those soon to be excluded from the child disability allowance; and making the welfare system less open to abuse by welfare cheats. The government intends to remove the unnecessary paperwork requirements for recipients whose marital status changes, but not their need for assistance, by introducing the parenting payment from 20 March 1998. It will be available to married and non-married parents alike whose low income levels require them to rely on the state. It will simplify the administrative arrangements in much the same way as other new measures, like the youth allowance, by reducing the number of possible programs open to parents who need our support. In the place of the parenting allowance and the sole parents pension there will be created one simple and non-discriminatory system. Parenting for people with low incomes is difficult enough without being burdened with the requirement to change from one discriminatory system to another, as was the requirement under the Labor Party. If the social stigma of needing to rely on the government for assistance in rearing children in times of crisis is not enough, the Labor Party would have the struggling parents who are not married tagged with the additional 'sole parent' label-an identifier which I believe is totally unnecessary. I am particularly pleased with the increase in the number of days of leave that carers can now access-up from 42 to 63 days-without having their payments reduced or terminated. This is just one aspect of the broader carer reform package which has done so much to help those who help others in our community. Considering the stressful, distressing and frequently physically exhausting nature of their work, carers could do with a little bit more time off. This is necessary just for them to recuperate and energise so that they can continue their work as carers more effectively for a much longer period. Without the threat of penalties, carers can concentrate more fully on their work. I would like at this point to bring to the attention of the House a very special constituent in my electorate of Leichhardt: Mrs Jeanne Olufson, who is now aged 65, has been a carer for her father on a full-time basis for the last 12 years. While looking after her own father, she has also provided much support and assistance for her father-in-law, his wife and his brother. She provided support for her father-in-law, as his part-time carer, and off for the last six years of his life. He passed away in 1989. Jeanne has been a full time carer for the last 12 years, as I said earlier. Jeanne's father, who is now 91, has been living with Jeanne and her husband since his arrival from England in 1986. In addition to many other difficulties associated with old age, Jeanne's father developed retention of urine earlier this year and had to have an indwelling catheter inserted. Jeanne was advised to apply for urinary drainage bags through the state Department of Community Health, and received a limited supply in June this year. She soon learned that there was a minimum waiting period of 12 weeks. While waiting for bags to come through, Jeanne had to frequent the urology ward at the local hospital where she has been able to obtain only one week's supply. Very occasionally she has been lucky enough to get two weeks supply. Apparently the hospital itself is in short supply, and it is almost impossible to obtain more than one or two weeks supply at a time. There have been instances when, out of desperation, Jeanne had to almost beg for bags. On very rare occasions some urinary drainage bags have been available through the Blue Nursing Service when they were no longer needed, and Jeanne was fortunate enough to receive these. Something as fundamental as urinary drainage bags should be available on demand. To force carers and patients to be rationed in such a way is simply outrageous and unacceptable. At 91, Jeanne's father is really quite frail and needs Jeanne to help him with showering and dressing and, of course, he needs to have the drainage bags emptied and changed regularly. He is totally dependent on her. She also takes him to hospital for regular checkups every month to have his catheter changed. Sadly, Jeanne's dad is also totally incontinent. He takes diuretic tablets on a daily basis to prevent heart failure. His clothing and linen need to be changed frequently, and he regularly depends on Jeanne-as he does in everything-to do this. The story with the catheter bags is often repeated with the on incontinence pads. The waiting period is, again, 12 weeks, and Jeanne and her husband have to buy these pads themselves, at a cost of $76 for 48 pads. This is an enormous cost burden to them. While young at heart, at 65 Jeanne is not what we would call a young person. Her health is also deteriorating. In June this year she had a serious heart condition and spent several weeks in hospital. In spite of her ill health, Jeanne is still totally committed to the cause of her dad. She is one of the many carers in my electorate who will benefit from the increased number of days of leave that carers will be able to access. Carers such as Jeanne sacrifice everything to take care of their loved ones. They do this out of pure love and do so in a selfless manner. The duties of a carer are beyond the ordinary person. Carers take on jobs of enormous responsibility; jobs that most of us in the community would find daunting and very stressful to fulfil. Jeanne's dedication, selflesstalking ness and perseverance have made life for others more comfortable and meaningful, and for that she deserves recognition. I take this opportunity to thank her and to commend her for her work. It is people like Jeanne who actually reduce the burden of cost on our government by being prepared to do this work freely and with total commitment. Allowing a little bit more time for them to recharge their batteries-and 63 days, in reality, is not a long time, given the difficulty of the work they have to do-is certainly going some way to recognising the wonderful contribution they make to our community. Changes made to the current system in this legislation relating to the child disability allowance are also a step forward. The notion of more reliable, simpler methods of assessing eligibility for child disability allowances are reasonable. I am pleased by the inclusion of the list of manifest and chronic medical conditions which will enable families to fasttrack access to the child disability allowance. This ensures that those in most need of our support receive it first and foremost. The measures introduced in this legislation with respect to the child disability allowance are generally very positive. It is particularly pleasing to know that the government recognises the sensitivities involved in the special needs of families which have a child or children with disabilities. I am sure those families that are already receiving the child disability allowance, and those which will be receiving it at the end of June 1988, will be relieved to know that they will continue to receive payments until 30 June 2003 without being subject to further medical reviews. Few families will mind reverting to the new assessment system at the end of this period. Under this legislation, some children with minor disabilities will be excluded from eligibility for the child disability allowance. I was initially concerned on hearing that, but on further inspection I found that the type of disability that now entitles someone to the allowance includes some very mild medical problems like asthma-I must stress that I am about very mild cases, not chronic disabilities-conditions which are very manageable and cause little disruption to the sufferer's quality of life, given proper management. With this in mind, I am pleased to point out that the new child disability allowance applicants who do not qualify for the benefit under the new table of assessments system, but who have a medical condition, will qualify for the health care card. This will assist in meeting the costs of medication, and will benefit families in my electorate. This measure could easily be adopted in other areas too, particularly where it concerns people on low incomes, part-time workers, or self-funded retirees on very modest incomes who are not eligible for the health care card but who clearly, without a doubt, need one. I strongly urge our government to consider extending the benefits of the health care card to these needy citizens. It would be a very small gesture, but one that would be greatly appreciated, particularly by people like the self-funded retirees who have made a commitment through their entire lives to look after themselves and their families into their retirement, at a time when it was not fashionable to do so. On reaching retirement, and having a very limited income, they are finding that things are extremely difficult to manage. I believe that this is one way, albeit small, of acknowledging their contribution and their responsible attitude to life, and rewarding them in a very small way for their attitude. A measure introduced in this legislation also sees a reduction in the waiting period before parents can claim child disability allowance. This brings the child disability allowance into line with other social security payments. Some people have clearly been abusing the system of assessing health care card eligibility by making their income appear lower for the short four-week period in which they are means tested. This legislation doubles the income assessment period to make it harder for people to give the impression of having a lower income than they actually have. While this government is not about shirking its responsibilities in relation to welfare, the community has responded very positively to the number of measures we have introduced to prevent people from taking advantage of the taxpayer. I think the previous speaker, the member for Canning (Mrs Johnston), made the comment that it is not the government that is creating wealth; it is the people who create wealth and it is governments that spend it. I think it is important that we acknowledge that the taxpayers are the ones who are losing out here. It is important that we make sure that the money that is contributed-in some cases overgenerously by some taxpayers-is spent appropriately in areas where it is really needed. Unlike our predecessors, we will continue to crack down on welfare cheats. It is something that this government certainly has the courage to do. I hope that at the end of the day, with some of those taxpayer savings that we made, we will be in a far better position to be able to put some of that additional money back into the hands of people who really have absolutely no hope whatsoever of being able to raise money themselves-and I talk about the elderly, people who are both physically and mentally disabled, and carers. These are the areas where I believe we have to focus. Every dollar that we can save on people who are cheating the welfare system I believe is a dollar that we can put into the hands of those who are desperately in need of it. I very strongly endorse and support those measures. In closing, let me say that this legislation further proof that our government is capable of lateral thinking. We are not prepared to continue to offer bandaid solutions. We are a government that is looking to establish new and innovative ways of dealing with age-old problems and one that is finally starting to get its priorities right. It is going to go some way-and I stress 'some way' as there is still a long way to go-towards identifying, supporting and rewarding the most needy in our society as well those who are without doubt the most worthy. I am confident that, with continued successful financial management, we will continue to grow and further develop these essential programs. I commend this bill to the House.",103
190,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I take the opportunity in closing this debate on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Parenting and Other Measures) Bill 1997 to thank the honourable members who have participated. It has certainly been quite a lengthy debate, starting last week with the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), the opposition shadow minister for social security. My colleagues the members for Longman (Mr Brough), Moreton (Mr Hardgrave), Fisher (Mr Slipper), Stirling (Mr Eoin Cameron), Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly), Canning (Mrs Johnston) and Leichhardt (Mr Entsch), who has just kindly finished, have also contributed to the debate. The member for Jagajaga was joined in the debate by her colleagues the members for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris), Lyons (Mr Adams), Namadgi (Ms Ellis), Dobell (Mr Lee) and Prospect (Mrs Crosio). The honourable member for Jagajaga moved a second reading amendment-a form of amendment that I am not unfamiliar with. It is one that is designed to ensure that, rather than discuss the substance of the legislation, you cover as wide an ambit of issues as you can. So we have seen the opposition roam wide and far over a range of social security issues, condemning the government for its assault on low income families and dealing with the abolition of the dental health program, higher costs for prescriptions, higher child-care costs, the introduction of accommois dation bonds and income tested daily fees for aged care. I suspect one has more front in moving a motion of that sort if you were not in the parliament in 1987 when the Labor Party started to phase out the widow B pension and replace it with the less beneficial widows allowance or if you were not in the parliament in 1989 when the Labor Party made a commitment to remove all aged and service pensioners from the tax system, rather misleading them as to the then government's intentions. But, of course, they failed to deliver in relation to that. They even had the gall in 1993 to reaffirm it at a policy launch at that time, again leading pensioners to believe that they would be removed from the tax system when the Labor Party had no intention of doing that at all. We saw in 1993 that the Labor Party introduced a number of changes which it did not announce in the election fought just a few months before. We saw the announcement of ,an increase in the pension age for women from 60 to 65 years. I have a list here of a page of measures that the Labor Party was then involved in. We saw stricter job search and review activity for those who received essentially unemployment benefits. We saw the requirement for eligible pensioners to claim overseas pension before claiming an Australian pension-there was no mention of that in the campaign. We saw the inclusion of certain employer fringe benefits in the income test under the income test for family payment-no announcement of that during the campaign. We also saw the income and assets test to be applied to student parents. We had not seen that measure dealt with before. I could go on. It was a fairly comprehensive list. This legislation has a large number of positive measures and, when you balance them out, they produce some savings to enable a better and more comprehensive scheme to be put in placeMr Martin Ferguson interjecting",106
191,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,These matters are changing very significantly. I hope you have started using fluoride yourself. Perhaps your mother had you on tablets at the appropriate age.,107
192,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION, Order! I ask both speakers to make their remarks through the chair.,107
193,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I must say it was a remarkable admission from the honourable member about how long we have had fluoride in New South Wales and what it means in the likelihood of dentures. Perhaps he was talking about his crowns. While we are in such good humour, let me say that there were some issues of more substance raised by the honourable member for Jagajaga. I would like to take the opportunity of taking the House through them. The specific matters the member for Jagajaga took up included a question in relation to the amalgamation of the sole parent pension parenting allowance into the parenting payment., She was concerned that lone parents will lose as a result of the amendments. For example, lone parents will over lose because of the application of a nontapered assets test and the income maintenance period. The application of a nontapered assets test and an income maintenance period to lone parents will achieve greater equity between lone and partnered parents by standardising the treatment of assets and leave payments for all parents, regardless of marital status. The application to lone parents of the assets test that currently applies to partnered parents will adversely affect only those lone parents with assets, not counting the family home, in excess of $125,750 for home owners and $215,750 for non-home owners. These are the same assets test limits that preclude partnered parents from receiving payment. Hardship provisions exist under the assets test for cases where a person has assets that cannot be realised. With respect to the income maintenance period, currently lump sum payments received by lone parents only affect the rate of sole parent pension if employment is continuing. The application to lone parents of the income maintenance period that currently applies to partnered parents will also take into account leave payments received on termination of employment. Such leave payments are already taken into account when calculating the level of payment for partnered parents. It is reasonable to expect all parents, regardless of marital status, to utilise their leave payments, especially given that they would be assessable if received while still in employment. The average leave periods would be two weeks. The introduction of the parenting payment is not an attack on lone parents. As well as the above measures, the alignment of the conditions that currently vary between lone and partnered parents include reducing residence requirements for lone parents from five years to two years, simplification of the administrative arrangements for parents whose marital status changes and continuity of income support when a parent separates or repartners. These changes will benefit lone parents. In relation to the child disability allowance amendments, the honourable member for Jagajaga asked what was the explanation for the figure in the social security Portfolio Budget Statements, which stated that 21 per cent of CDA recipients did not have a handicap. This figure cited from the Australian Bureau of Statistics research was a misinterpretation of ABS data. Nevertheless, the Department of Social Security has other data showing that over 20 per cent of CDA children do not have a handicap. That data is from sources such as the Coopers and Lybrand feasibility study in 1994 and 1995. The member also sought a break-up of the savings in the CDA area referred to in the Portfolio Budget Statements. The savings, as indicated in the Portfolio Budget Statements, can be identified as follows: savings achieved from normal review activity, which do not form part of the bill now under consideration; savings from targeting CDA to children with more serious conditions, and the sum here is $17.1 million from 1999 to the year 2000; and the limitation of CDA arrears, saving $12.6 million over three years. I am advised that the figures identified in the Portfolio Budget Statements and those identified in the financial impact statement in the explanatory memorandum to the bill differ because the financial impact statement, being concerned with the legislative measures only, does not take into account the savings from the review activity that I referred to. The member for Jagajaga asked for a rationale of the name change from 'family payment' to 'family allowance'. Quite simply, the change is being made because it will help customers to understand more easily the social security system and their entitlements. Many families still use the term 'family allowance'. I might say that I am often inclined to do that myself. Of course, the payment that was used to describe family entitlements from 1987 to the end of 1992 is one that we are very much familiar with. The amalgamation of sole parenting pension and parenting allowance into the new parenting payment---changing the name from family payment to family allowance-will also assist families to distinguish it from the new parenting payment. On the matter of the introduction of consistent hardship rules for ordinary waiting, liquid assets waiting and income maintenance periods, the member asked about the issue of expenses that a family might incur during a liquid assets waiting period or an income maintenance period. She referred especially to dental costs, costs of glasses and the costs of shoes for children. The legislation has been drafted in such a way as to specifically indicate expenses that would be reasonably considered to be unavoidable and essential. However, so as to ensure that there is sufficient flexibility, there is a discretion for other expenses to be determined as unavoidable and essential. In relation to the member's specific concerns, dental and optical expenses may well be classified as essential medical expenses. In any event, the secretary or his delegate may exercise a discretion to classify these expenses as unavoidable and essential if the circumstances warrant it. It should be noted that a person who is subject to a liquid assets waiting period or serving an income maintenance period would have significant funds to draw on. The costs of shoes are unlikely to put such a person into severe financial hardship. If the person incurred other expenditure that contributed to their financial hardship, the entirety of the expenditure would be considered in deciding whether it was unavoidable and essential. The last matter that the honourable member raised related to data matching, and I am advised that the Privacy Commission had no problems with the transfer of data by on-line computer connections.

194,Mr RONALDSON,NA TIONAL RESIDUE SURVEY,"Ballarat-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development) (9.32 p.m.)-On behalf of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson), I table the replacement explanatory memorandums to the following eight bills of the meat package: Buffalo Export Charge Bill, the Buffalo Slaughter Levy Bill, the Cattle (Producers) 1997 Export Charges Bill, the Live-stock (Exporters) Export Charge Bill, the Live-stock (Producers) Export Charges Bill, the National 1997 Residue Survey (Buffalo Slaughter) Levy Bill, the National Residue Survey (Cattle Export) Levy Bill and the National Residue Survey (Sheep, Lambs and Goats Export) Levy Bill.",110
195,Mr OKEEFE,NA TIONAL RESIDUE SURVEY,"The opposition will be supporting this package of legislation in the main, but I do foreshadow 1997 that I will be moving an amendment which calls on the government to defer final consideration of the Live-stock Transactions Levy Bill 1997 pending the receipt of a report from the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee which has begun an inquiry into matters related to this bill. We all share some concerns in part about the long delay in bringing forward this legislation. I do not believe I am being overly critical in making that point. While members of the government were campaigning in the lead-up to the 1996 election they had a lot to 1997 say about this particular industry and these reforms. The direction in which we are going with these reforms had previously been set in motion by the former government so it is not as if there was any great mystery about it. In coming to the finer detail of how the transformation encompassed in this legislation would be arrived at, the government set about an inquiry process which reported in October of last year. As I understand it, the recommendations from that inquiry were accepted and the reform package was approved in March of this year. We are now looking at a delay of almost seven months in the tabling of this legislation and all of a sudden we have to rush it on and get it through tonight. It is one of the largest blocks of legislation, certainly in the primary industries portfolio, which has been presented to the House. We have been given very little time in which to analyse it so I do not have any particular difficulty in saying to the government that I believe we should defer consideration of the bill pending a further opportunity to look at the the detail of it. I will go into some of the reasons for that in a moment. I would also like to comment on the process of a committee in the other house taking a reference for this bill before it has had passage through this chamber. If it were the Labor opposition taking up that strategy and demanding an inquiry then I would have to answer for that in this House. But that has been the case. We have had a legislative committee in the Senate, chaired by a member of the government, deciding to take a reference on itself to give a voice to the people who are beginning to complain quite vociferously that, despite the claims of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) that they have been properly consulted with and that they have fully understood what is embodied in this legislation, the consultation, in their view, has only been with the peak council members. In those circumstances, we have had the chairman of the Senate committee respond to that criticism by taking on a reference even before the bill has come from this House. I do not necessarily endorse that procedure, but it has taken place. I recognise that in my proposed amendment. I call for the consideration of this bill to be deferred pending our having a chance to look at that committee's report, but I would far rather have had this bill referred to a House of Representatives standing committee. The members of our own House committee could have more properly, in my view, done the analysis and given us a quick report back so that we could tease out some of these issues which are under question. Let me go to the general thrust of the legislation. The government has brought in legislation which carries on from decisions taken by the former Labor government that would have created a new institutional framework for the red meat and livestock industry. In 1995, the former government arranged for the Meat Industry Council, the Meat and Livestock Corporation and the Meat Research Corporation to continue with their functions until June next year and for a review to be commenced in July this year in order to best determine the structure that would flow from there. That process was changed by the incoming government-,something that they intended to do-and I do not have any qualms about that. That led to the operational task force that the minister set up which brought down, as I said, a report in October last year that led to not cabinet making a decision on an industry reform package in March this year. This is where we begin to differ from what may have been the path that we would have followed had we been looking at this. First of all, the government has chosen to transfer out of the statutory authorities into a producer owned structure by setting up a company-a normal corporate body-which will be funded by the producer sector and which will take over the statutory levies and the non-statutory contributions that have previously been raised for the statutory authorities through the levy process. Why I raise just a slight question mark about that is that in our own policy deliberations at the moment we are trying to think through the best structures for producer growers to take a controlling interest in their industry. It may not necessarily be, as we are finding out with the wheat industry restructure, in the form of a normal company structure. There may be difficulties associated with that which could be better tackled in another way. We have not chosen to nominate an alternative structure. That being the case, I am not signalling opposition to this proposal. I do not have anything specific to nominate as an alternative, but what I do say to the minister and the industry is that I would have liked to have looked at some other structures-for instance, a wholly owned grower cooperative-rather than simply adopting the corporate model. Associated with this set of bills is the winding up of the Meat Industry Council, the phasing out of the Meat and Livestock Corporation and the Meat Research Corporation and the establishment of a new Red Meat Advisory Council, which will be charged with preparing a meat industry strategic plan for the minister. Built in behind those is a raft of accompanying bills providing for the transition from what were compulsory levies across the industry for marketing, for research and, in some cases, for funding the councils in the peak authorities-those statutory levies are to be phased out-to voluntary levies via deeds of agreement between the minister and the various bodies with the intention of ensuring that the revenue streams are continued, albeit by a kind of voluntary process rather than a government mandated compulsory levy. I am not saying that I would necessarily have opposed or found a different way to do this. A lot of it is contingent-and I agree with this-on what the industry itself is prepared to do. But, as I foreshadowed earlier, what we are hearing from the industry, particularly the sheep meat industry, is that they are not willing participants in their particular fields in the new proposal for a transaction levy versus the former slaughter levy. I can understand why some parts of the industry take the view that, because in particular a sheep changes hands several times, different people will be paying a different burden or a different share of what might have been a cumulative levy in the old system taken at the point of slaughter. A very important point here is that these levies are separating the grower/producer from the processor or the exporter. To the extent that this leads to processors being able to move away from the same degree of commitment to research and development and to marketing expenditure; I think there needs to be some pretty serious and hard talking done by the minister as he negotiates his way through the trade-off of statutory levies for voluntary levies. He ought to be very firm about the fact. I know this is a bit of a sore point between him and me. He does not have the same commitment as I do to value adding and driving this product, no matter which part of the primary sector it is, as far as possible up the Australian value added tree. I put a big question mark over the minister's determination to ensure that people in the value adding and processing part of the industry play their full role and maintain the presence in the marketplace that is required for the industry. I am signalling very loudly to the minister in my contribution tonight that we on this side of the House are on about maximising the market value of the Australian grown product right up the value adding tree, whether it is the wool tree or the sheep meat tree. That being the case, there is a question mark over separating levies on producers from levies on processes. I noticed today that the Cattle Council of Australia put out a news release dated 23 October which anticipated that beef marketing programs would be slashed under these proposals. Mr John Wyld, President of the Cattle Council, says: Regardless of the outcome, cattle producers need to be made aware that major and valuable programs will be severely cut or dropped altogether, particularly in the area of beef promotion. I do not think that this warning should be taken lightly. It should be understood that we all concede that at the producer/grower end of the chain-at the start of the chain-the returns at the moment in primary industry are very tight. In some cases, I even have meat processors saying openly to me that they know they have to be able to pay more to the farmer. They know that they are not going to be able to guarantee the continuity of stock and quality unless they can get decent returns to the producer. That being the case, anything that raises the levy and the emphasis or the weighting of the levy at the producer end may lead to cost cutting and squeezing in the area where most work needs to be done-research, marketing and development. The minister needs to be aware that, as he goes through this convoluted negotiation process that is outlined in this legislation for the setting of levies, the spotlight will be on him, certainly from this side of the House, to ensure that the value adding end of the deal gets a fair go and gets the emphasis it needs. There is also another issue here that needs to be thought of. As we phase out the statutory marketing authorities-and again I am not saying that this is in itself a bad thingone ought to remember that the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation particularly, with the Meat Research Council and the Meat Industry Council, performed a significant role on behalf of the industry. To some extent, because of our negotiations on GATT and because of our agreements with the WTO, we in Australia have been very keen to show our bona fides in the trade agenda by agreeing to phase back, phase out or certainly wind down the SMAs. Let me make it clear that, under the GATT rules, provided the arrangements are transparent, it is not necessary to get rid of SMAs. Again, while I am not saying that we may not have done the same thing had it been our decision, I would certainly have given a lot more thought to the process-whether it was necessary to actually wind back or close down the AMLC. I refer to a speech by John Kerin, the former chairman of the AMLC, who obviously is well known to everyone in this House, which he made to the Victorian Farmers Federation in April 1995. At that time, as Chairman of the AMLC, he was under some criticism from the industry about what they were doing, where they were spending the producers' levies and how effective or otherwise their marketing program was. In his speech he outlined a number of reasons why an organisation like the AMLC existed, and I will quote just a couple of them: . .. the gaining of international market access where individual firms cannot penetrate and where foreign countries do not share our economic beliefs or culture and taking into account the reality of of markets, competitors and the policies of their governments. There are some doors that an SMA opens; there are certainly some doors that the sheer bulking up of a single desk opens. We have to understand that we are phasing these things out and replacing them with other bodies which may not have some of those marketplace strengths. He refers to the provision of an industry focus or leadership on industry issues. I was quite taken by the fact that, in the same speech, he also openly predicted that a shift to the kind of structure we are now adopting would lead to a winding back of expenditure on marketing for meat products--exactly the same reservations expressed by the President of the Cattle Council today in his press release. I accept the fact that, with the change of government and the time in which members opposite had to work up their new approach, this was always going to happen this way. Our proposal was that it would have continued until next year with a review beginning to operate now. Let me turn to the issue of the levies because, as I mentioned earlier, there is some disquiet around at the moment about the levy proposals. One of the key points that has been made to me by a number of the organisations is that at least six of the 12 levy principlesand bear in mind that the government did circulate a document headed 'General principles applying to proposals for new and changed primary industry levies' for various purposes which outlined 12 general principles-have not been fully carried through in this process with the industry. There are groups saying that they have not been consulted, even though the general principle was that levy payers have an opportunity to comment, for instance, on the proposed levy, estimates of how much the levy would be and whether it would be equitable. There is a range of principles here that have question marks over how honourably the government has carried through its levy proposals. In case anyone on the other side thinks that I am perhaps being a little overly concerned size about this, here is a wad of submissions that we have received in my office just in the last few days from a range of organisations on exactly these points. Again I counsel the minister that, whether it is real or not, there is a very considerable perception among participants in the industry that they have not been properly consulted, that this legislation has been rushed through and that even the government's own principles-the 12 principles associated with the raising of the levieshave not been honoured. I also foreshadow concern about a provision in the Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry (Repeals and Consequential Provisions) Bill 1997 which accompanies this legislation on the Australian meat and livestock industry reforms. In proposed section 45 of the repeals and consequential provisions bill, there is a section headed 'Certain staff members taken to have resigned'. As I understand this particular section, it relates to people who are at the moment employees of statutory corporations such as the AMLC and who, when those bodies are phased out, will obviously be without a job. The bill provides that those people will be offered an equivalent employment opportunity. But it also provides that, if they choose not to take it, they are deemed to have resigned. I can tell you now that, having had the opportunity of five sitting days to consider a bill of this nature and only finding out in the last 24 hours that it has all these little hooks in it, including one that the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) would be absolutely thrilled with, that may not be the sort of provision that Labor would be prepared to support. So I will indicate to the House now that we have not had an opportunity to consult about what essentially is a very nippy little industrial relations issue stuck way down in the back pages of the consequential provisions bill. It is a nice little one that says, 'Your boss will give you an offer that he thinks is an equivalent job opportunity, even if it's on the other side of A1.Jstralia, and if you don't take it you've just resigned your job.' That is not fair treatment of anybody and leaves very much of its fairness to the means by which it is applied. I am proposing to give this bill passage in the House whenever we vote on it, but I foreshadow very strongly that, in its present form, proposed section 45 of the repeals and consequential provisions is not acceptable to the opposition. In the other house, via either the committee process or some other way, we will be seeking to amend it to give some more certainty to those employees about their future. I expect that it will come back to this House from the Senate with some kind of amendment or reform. So I foreshadow that the minister will need to rethink that one. To sum up, I say that we would have been happy to give passage to the bill with the proper time to consider it. Given the substance of the legislation, to have brought given us the opportunity of five sitting days and then brought it on quickly tonight is not a fair go for the government's members, let alone the opposition. As evidenced by that little industrial relations hook stuck in the back of the repeals and consequential provisions bill, there may be other hooks in this that we are not aware of. There is certainly quite a bit of discontent flowing through from those who do not feel that they have been properly consulted. I do agree that this legislation should be referred to a standing committee for consideration, albeit an urgent reference, so that the House would be in a position to give it more detailed consideration. I have expressed my concern that a Senate committee has already taken it on itself to do that task before the bill has gone through this House. I would much prefer the government to agree to refer it to our own House committee, which I think would be more appropriate. Having said that, I again foreshadow that I will be moving an amendment to the Livestock (Producers) Export Charges Bill. I do indicate that the opposition will give passage to the legislation, with the reservation that the industrial relations provision will almost certainly be changed in the. other place and I expect the Senate standing committee will make a number of recommendations which may mean that the Senate will request the House to make changes to the legislation. I expect that process to take place. I would have much preferred to have referred the legislation to our own House committee because I do have reservations about this process that is beginning to emerge-a process which is in fact being led by disgruntled members of the government who are setting up their own standing committees in the Senate to inquire into their own legislation before it even gets there. Mr Martin Ferguson-That's not true, is it?",110
196,Mr OKEEFE,NA TIONAL RESIDUE SURVEY,"That is what is transpiring. It happened with the wheat bill; it has now happened with the meat bill. I think that is something the minister needs to do some work on. With those comments, I indicate that it in, we will support the legislation.",114
197,Mrs JOHNSTON,NA TIONAL RESIDUE SURVEY,"The involvement of my family in the Australian meat industry for the past 60 years gives me what I believe to be an informed position upon which to comment on the contents of the路 Australian Meat and Livestock Industry Bill 1997. The Australian meat industry has consistently remained a major contributor to Australia's foreign exchange earnings. The meat and livestock industry-as the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) made reference to when he made his second reading speech on this billis Australia's third single largest agricultural commodity export earner after wheat and wool. But more than that, it is not widely known that, through the industry's vast array of by-products, it represents a major employer of labour. The associated productions of hides, leather goods and apparel, smallgoods and restaurant catering are but some of the areas that are serviced through the meat industry. These side products are lucrative producers of wealth in their own right, which in tum provides enormous economic benefit for our country. I suggest that the meat industry is suffering financially and experiencing uneconomical rates of return at all levels. I am sure that nobody in this House would dispute those facts. As a matter of fact only tonight on the news we saw another problem with the live cattle industry in Western Australia which will have a huge impact on this country. This loss of market share has occurred essentially as a result of bad work practices, droughts, inefficiencies and the loss of our once highly competitive advantage. Customers from around the world have expressed their deep concern about the unreliability of our waterfront due to strikes and low productivity. Customers both internally and from the rest of the world have built up low expectations over many years in respect of suppliers delivering goods on time. This has further hindered the meat and livestock industry's progress on a global scale, as have unrealistic meat inspection charges which are still all too common. All of these factors that I have mentioned have in one way or another severely impeded the potential of the meat industry to move far beyond the $3 billion it currently earns Australia in export dollars each year. This bill serves to address some of the inefficiencies which have been apparent over many years and is a major step forwardalbeit not all the way, but it is certainly a start-to ensuring a brighter future for the industry. I am reminded of the remarks that were just made by the member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe). I thank him for indicating that the opposition will allow this bill to pass through the House relatively unscathed. However, he did raise some very valid points. One of the points he particularly made mention of is value adding to our products. Whilst I know the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has given some consideration to this, I also know he is a good listener and I urge him to take note of the points made by the member for Burke. There has been very broad agreement by the industry on the new arrangements foreshadowed in this bill. The reforms are imperative and, for simplicity's sake, I will attempt to summarise them into four broad measures. Firstly, this bill sets out arrangements for the introduction of a non-government, commercially based organisation to head up the industry's dealings. As a direct result, a secondary function of this bill will be to reduce government involvement, except in respect of the use of taxpayers' moneys, giving theindustry greater autonomy from legislative restriction. Thirdly, this autonomy will lead to a new approach for the redistribution of levy money at all levels. Finally, there will be a separation of bodies in respect of divisions of development and research and promotion within the industry. All this will take place while at the same time as we foster an overarching culture of cooperation. Through the implementation of this bill, there will principally be a movement away from statutory limitations to an environment which encourages increased commercialisation and self-determination. The reforms largely incorporate joint actions which cross current state-Commonwealth and industry responsibilities. Uniform legislation is an added advantage of these changes. Consultations with industry have served to expand on much needed reforms in aspects of quality assurance, food safety and quality market intelligence, as well as increasing market access and focusing on improving crisis management to deal with adverse circumstances both cooperatively and collectively. Advice to government on issues affecting the industry as a whole will be provided by the Red Meat Advisory Council. This body will act to channel representations of six peak industry councils and representatives of processors and livestock exporter companies back to government through an incorporated company. The conclusions identified by the joint industry and government meat and livestock industry reform task force in ed in the measures I am speaking in support of tonight. The task force's recommendations were essentially twofold: firstly, that the industry needed to become more self-regulated and market focused; and, secondly, it was agreed there should be a lesser role for government. Following on from these fundamentals, the task force suggested that substanthese tial savings could be made by changing the structures to levy funded operations. This would ensure a more transparent and contestable market in which stakeholders can compete at all levels. Other inefficiencies which the task force addressed included an acknowledgment of the crippling cost of processing livestock. This is due to an antiquateq tally system where the quota of livestock processed in a day can be completed in just two solid hours work. Developments of the current Australian Industrial Relations Commission test case, which addresses this anomaly, will, I am sure, be closely monitored by those in the industry. This bill covers a broad range of measures designed to address these recommendations. By forming a producer owned service company, the government is taking a huge step to convert the existing statutory authorities competitive commercial enterprises. The coalition deserves to be commended on the introduction of these measures. However, being able to spe.ak from first-hand experience, I acknowledge, as I said earlier, that further change is needed. There is a need for an expansion in consultation with some of the industry's smaller players, as wcll as, on the other end of the scale, with the peak bodies. The benefits from conferring with these groups would assist in analysing the positive effects of the new producer owned service structure and provide feedback from these groups which, of course, will be imperative for consideration of further needed reforms. Australia's economic future can be greatly assisted by making the meat and livestock industry viable and profitable. It can be restored to play a leading role in the global perspective, especially in the development of better, healthier meat products geared to the demand of the consumer, particularly those to 1996 are reflectwhom we export. I would like to make special mention of an industry niche which has for too long been suppressed; that is, the development of fledging innovative new concepts on meat processing. I specifically refer to such new ventures as emu and ostrich farming and, to a lesser degree, crocodile farming. It is important that new initiatives are recognised as future legitimate contributors to the Australian meat industry and that their place in the new arrangements is considered. Although many are currently in formal place in the existing system, they could further benefit from being guided by experienced experts. These offshoot industries can then grow and make substantial future contributions to this very diverse and complex industry. The loss of market share in almost every market that the export industry has been involved in is of great concern to every member of the parliament. This is especially true in specialised markets associated with the industry such as the leather commodity market. To address this, essential consideration will be necessary for the new producer owned service company to aggressively streamline the reasons for market failure and to implement innovative strategies to correct into and reverse this long-term decline. In effect, this bill will empower the meat and livestock industry to manage their own affairs. The benefit of this will be increased efficiency and competitiveness. We all know that, in the world today, without those two vital components all industries are doomed to fail. The coalition has a vision for the future not only for meat and livestock stakeholders but for the nation's industry as a whole. We must ensure that reforms left in the too-hard basket by Labor are put into place. Action is needed and action-as honourable members here today are witnessing-is being taken. As a member of this government, I am proud to support these historic initiatives which aim to secure the future prosperity of Australia's meat and livestock industry. I commend the bill to the House.",114
198,Mr CAMPBELL,NA TIONAL RESIDUE SURVEY,"I am grateful to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) for his second reading speech on what is now a cognate bill because, by definition, it must make the debate fairly wide ranging. We have to start from a couple of premises. I am very grateful to the member for Canning (Mrs Johnston) and the member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) for they demonstrate once more that neither the government nor the opposition have any real understanding of where this country is heading. The member for Canning suggests that the Australian Meat and Livestock Industry Bill 1997 is going to dramatically assist the meat industry. Of course it will do nothing of the sort. All it will do is shift the deckchairs on the Titanic. There are several things we must accept as priors. Firstly, growers are not well served peak bodies in Australia. There is not one peak body that can say it is truly representative of growers' interests. Peak bodies seldom consult with the rank and file. The other thing that must be acknowledged is that growers are very poorly served by research and development funds. They are badly targeted and invariably growers have no control over where they go. Let us have a look at a couple of examples. The Wool Corporation spent nigh on $20 million of wool growers' funds trying to develop mechanical shearing, but not because the wool industry needed mechanical shearing. Indeed, there was never any trouble in getting your sheep shorn, and in the final analysis you could get your robots from New Zealand. They were trying to develop a machine that had to work in close tolerances in about five separate planes and of course they failed because they could not, in a research laboratory, keep it free enough from dust. How on earth could they expect it to work in a shearing shed? They are topped, however, by the waste of funds for the meat industry contributed by beef producers, when $40 million of their funds was just frittered away on a nonsense called Fututech, where the meat industry set out to produce a robotic abattoir. Once again it was not because the industry needed it but because of the ideological preconceptions of the peak bodies and of the government-and in fact the opposition as well-because the present minister has gone to enormous lengths to protect the people responsible for this outrageous abuse of growers' funds. This money was frittered away when it became quite clear it was never going to work, but they kept the money pouring in. The research and development body kept putting out in its papers how successful they were and how everything was on track. After about 18 months, they said, 'We are having our teething troubles.' In the next issue there were more teething troubles, and then, phut$40 million of growers' money had been wasted. A lot of the initiatives do not come from grower funded research; they come from by industry itself. A classic example is that the British wool processing 'industry has come up with a new method of treating wool which makes 22-micron wool worsted weave basically totally crease resistant. It is a very significant breakthrough, not done by wool growers' research funds but done by the British industry at a time, I might add, when the wool industry decided to move its R&D from Britain to Italy. Perhaps that needs some rethinking. This has the potential to really benefit the vast majority of growers in Australia in the 22-micron category. We are told by the honourable member for Canning (Mrs Johnston) about the problems on the waterfront. Shipment of cattle from the north-west of my electorate has nothing to do with the waterfront. The waterfront has never provided any problem whatsoever. The problem there is almost always caused by tides or access to wharfage. You are talking about small ships-I,200 being a large load-and it is just not a fact that the waterfront workers are a problem. But the waterfront itself is indicative of what governments do when they are looking for scapegoats-'If we can only fix the waterfront, everything will be all right.' Of course, that is nonsense. It is quite clear is much more of a problem between the wharf and the warehouse than there is from the ship to the wharf. That is not being addressed, and no-one is suggesting the government does address that. It is ironic that the problems come from the industry itself and from the enormous charges imposed on the industry, not from the problems on the waterfront, not from the problems in the tally system. The big problem is the costs imposed by government. I put some questions on notice to the minister, which I will come to because they are all germane to this debate. The minister's answers are illuminating indeed. They demonstrate that the minister does not know what he is talking about, is being very badly advised or perhaps is simply obfuscating. But it is quite clear that AQIS charges are an enormous impost on the processing industry. Why does the government not have a look at AQIS charges? Why? Because the government runs the show. That is why. It is my belief we should have the American system, and the government should entirely pick up the AQIS charges. Then the government would have some incentive to fix the problem. We hear the front bench of the government continually attacking the waterfront. Under AQIS regulations, AQIS officers work for half an hour at a time, so you have to double the staff there. That is an enormous cost. There are abattoirs in the minister's own electorate which have closed down in which AQIS staff are still being paid. All this is an enormous cost on the industry. The government says, of course, 'Oh, but we're going to self-management.' Two things need to be said about that. Firstly, it is not my view nor is it a view widely supported in the industry that self-management is a good idea. I believe that where things are a national responsibility they should be done by the public sector but they should be done in an efficient way, which is clearly not the case now because the government can pass on all the costs to the growers, and of course it does. Secondly, if you go to self-management, if the system is going to work, you do not in there fact reduce costs to the processor at all, because he now has to put people on on quality control who would normally be involved in production, and they, of course, have to be paid. You would probably find that his actual costs go up, not down. I think that we could do an enormous amount to assist the industry in this country if we were to look at government entirely picking up the AQIS charges. That would then force government to make the system more efficient, because they would be bearing the cost and not, as in this case, in the final analysis, the producer. It should be realised that the benefit to Australia accrues when our processing plants are operating efficiently and at capacity. That is when the nation benefits, not with the stopgo operations and the close-downs we have now. When I got the answers to the questions I put on notice, I went out and consulted with the industry and asked them for their views on the minister's answers. The industry was generally scathing about the minister's answers. They said that in many cases they were simply inadequate. I had suggested that the charges to small abattoirs make it much more difficult for them to compete with large abattoirs which are mainly foreign owned. The minister said, 'Not so,' that in fact he had introduced a new category- 'small', 'medium' and 'large' instead of 'small' and 'large' - and that the charges would not rise substantially. What he did not say, of course, is that he is imposing a cost for doing an alJdit; a situation which amounts to $24,000 a year whether you are a big abattoir or a small abattoir. How can this possibly not impact on the cost structure of small abattoirs? If the minister does not understand that-and I think there is a very good chance he does not-then the problems that are facing the industry right now can be understood. The minister suggested, contrary to my question, that our export abattoirs are not largely foreign controlled. The truth is that three of our abattoirs-one American, one Japanese and one Chinese owned---count for a full 20 per cent of all our exports. A very significant number indeed. This is a very important industry not only for its foreign earnings but also for the number of people it employs in rural Australia. I believe this industry is not being well served by the present strategy, and it will not be well served by the new structure the minister is putting in place. Just as we saw with the wool industry, we see the same people going around, the same mates being looked after: the same faces, different names, but basically tJ1e same people. As they failed previously, so they will fail again, and I do not think that anyone who looks in depth at the industry thinks otherwise. I believe that the processing industry in this nation is being so badly treated that it is probably near revolt. If it is to survive it has to rebel against the treatment it is receiving the hand of government. That is not to suggest for one moment that it would be any different if the Labor Party were in power, for it would not. The support of the Labor Party for this bill simply indicates how out of touch they are .. I now want to mention the new funding arrangements. We are going to a transaction tax to raise the money for research and development and other costs. We are told the peak bodies want this, but the industry certainly does not want it. The industry, from one end to the othe- will tell you they were never consulted on this issue. It is just a nonsense. A transaction tax will be an enormous additional cost on wool producers, for instance, when many of the sheep that they are dealing in will simply never see an abattoir - piece of There is absolutely no doubt-and I know the government was told by the big processors-that the system could have been put in place to very quickly and easily collect the money on a kill basis or on a per kilo basisper head or per kilo would have been far more equitable. In answer to a question, the minister said that per kilo was inequitable. He did not explain how, and I certainly cannot see how, it can be. In fact, I believe it defies all logic. I will certainly be opposing this bill-not that that will make much difference-because bverwhelmingly the producers and processors I have spoken to do not like aspects of it. Certainly they are very strongly opposed to the transaction tax, the transaction levy. I believe that they have not been consulted and this in itself conflicts with the government's own policy in raising these sorts of charges. In terms. of the downstream processing or value adding, I think the meat industry has enormous potential. There is a process called 'pouch packaging', a high pressure, high temperature treatment of meat in plastic bags. This process gives the meat an indefinite shelf life and makes it ideal for the convenience meal industry. At present there is no convenience food for the fast-growing Islamic market. We know from our own research that the middle class in Japan is increasingly looking at for convenience foods, yet we ignore this market. Attempts have been made in Australia to put up these plants and they have received no assistance or support whatsoever. The minister himself has said he is opposed to downstream processing. He believes that we must be a primary producing country. There is a company in Indonesia-not surprisingly, it is connected to the Presidentthat produces something like 14 million hundred-gram packs of noodles a month. If you were to add 10 grams of protein to a pack, my calculations are that it would require something like 45,000 tonnes of beef to fill those 14 million packs a month. Forty-five thousand tonnes of beef a year is certainly a very substantial market. It is valuable because it would be the non-prime cuts-the trimmings. After all, it is not what is paid for a steak that interests the producer; it is what is paid for the overall beast. I believe this process should be considered. There is scope for several of these facilities in New South Wales, several in Queensland and at least two in my own state of Western Australia. Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania could also well use this type of facility. If there is to be any respite from the cost price pressure being imposed on rural producers, they must get some benefit from downstream processing. Debate interrupted. NA",117
199,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 10.30 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjoum. Tax Reform",120
200,Mr MOSSFIELD,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise in this adjournment debate to offer a few thoughts on the matter of tax reform that has been raised by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). The Prime Minister has described his proposals in a number of extraordinary cliches. He has said that this is a great adventure for Australians. What does he have in mind? Does he have in a mind a trip to the amusement park type of adventure where we will have a few rides on the merry-go-round and the big dipper, and maybe a ride on the ghost train, and then, after a few hours of adventure, we will leave the amusement park-as we will with the GST-with less money in our pockets than we had when we started? The Prime Minister has said that there is a change of mood in the community and that people now understand the issue of the GST. They certainly do, especially since 1993 when Dr Hewson was knocked back. The people have become very aware of the dangers facing them from a GST that once again puts all the financial responsibilities onto ordinary workers and lower paid people. The community will always remember the radio interview that the now Prime Minister gave during the 1993 election campaign when he said that the GST would not create any jobs, after his leader, Dr Hewson, had said on the same radio station on the same day that the GST would create an enormous number of jobs. We have been told that the proposed inquiry into the tax system has broad parameters and that this idea is not based on the increasing of tax. A matter of real concern is that on Thursday, 14 August, on the ABC radio program PM, the Prime Minister said that there would be no overall increase on the tax burden. This must send shivers of fear through the average and lower paid worker. It seems to be code for, 'GST may be high on everything, but in the tax collection system it won't mean more income for the government than is now collected. ' If the high paid and businesses are to have their alleged high taxes abolished or lowered and the responsibility for collecting the same amount of the present tax burden remains, what will be the result? The GST will need to be 20 per cent or more. Who will be hardest hit by this impost? It will be the average worker, the low-paid worker, the unemployed, the pensioner and the distressed of our community. According to research carried out by the Australian Consumers Association, single parents would pay 100 per cent more tax and a pensioner an extra 20 per cent under a simple switch from income tax to a consumption tax. If the Prime Minister thinks he can hide these facts from the people, he is absolutely wrong. The people, as he has said, understand this tax system much better than in 1993, and they are much more aware of the dangers they face from the imposition of a GST. Big businesses liked the idea initially. They have much to gain from the abolition of many taxes. They have most to win by transferring the tax burden to the ordinary people. Small businesses should be totally up in arms about this proposal as they would become the new tax collecting agency. Many of these people now spend their evenings at home doing their accounts, working out. their provisional tax payments and their sales tax obligations. The GST will mean that small businesses will have to spend many hours working on the sums to ensure that they pay the new GST tax to the tax commissioner. They will have to impose the tax. They will have to bear the criticism from their customers. They will have to do the work of sending in the returns, and all this for no return. The Prime Minister says that the ALP shows by its opposition to the proposal that it is made up of yesterday's people. Wrong! We are progressive enough to recognise mistakes and learn from them. We are progressive enough to understand that people are not dummies. We are progressive enough to recognise that the people understand the economics of the GST. They all know that the decision that they made in 1993 to kick out Fightback and the GST was the correct decision to make at the ballot box. I am confident that when the voters pick up that stubby little pencil in the polling booth at the next election, they will once again vote overwhelming against the GST and thus against the government. This change is important for the future of the unemployed, the low paid, average workers and small business. The present government has been a disaster for our nation, not just in economic terms but also in terms of simple issues like racism, aged care, child care and unemployment. It has vacillated on these issues, ummed and ahed, and then made very weak and lame statements. It is certainly well past its use-by date and I look forward to being a part of those who consign it back to where it belongs-in permanent opposition. Delegation to Laos and Thailand and to the AIPO General Assembly",120
201,Mrs SULLIVAN,ADJOURNMENT,"Moncrieff-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs) (10.35 p.m.)-I realise that it is unusual for a parliamentary secretary to seek the call on the adjournment. However, I wish to inform my colleagues that I shall be leaving Australia early tomorrow morning and the matter which I want to speak on tonight is something that I consider urgent and which cannot wait until my return. It relates to as bad a reporting of an item from parliament as I have ever been aware of in my 23 years in parliament. I refer to an ABC TV news item this evening which made the following statements: It's been revealed that a Federal Parliamentary delegation has been sent to Asia on a secret damage control exercise to try to counter the Pauline Hanson factor. In a report tabled delegation found that the Hanson impact was worse than anyone had thought and that New Zealand was now using the issue to its own advantage. Despite claims up until now by the Federal Government that the Hanson factor is over and that our neighbours in Asia recognise her policies do not reflect government views, confirmation today that our reputation is in tatters. A parliamentary delegation led by Alexander Downer's parliamentary secretary, Kathy Sullivan, has confirmed it, tabling a report following an extensive Asian tour. For the first time, confirmation this was no ordinary trip, it was a damage control exercise to repair problems caused by the Pauline Hanson-inspired race debate ... It also found that New Zealand officials were using the Hanson issue against Australia in Asian markets. The significance of the report today is that it proves once and for all the enormous impact of the Pauline Hanson debate is only getting worse. As I said, I could not imagine a worse misrepresentation of the report that I tabled today. Firstly, on the matter of the allegation that I led a delegation as Alexander Downer's parliamentary secretary on an extensive tour with a secret mission, at the beginning of my speech I made the following statement: At the time. I led this delegation I had no idea that I would later be appointed as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. It is of course appropriate for parliamentary secretaries to lead parliamentary delegations. However, I led this delegation in my capacity as a private member of the House of Representatives. In the preface to the report-and I would have thought that most reporters would at least have got as far as page I-I made this statement, and it is in my name: Australia has developed considerable reserves of goodwill in Laos and Thailand, as well as in the other ASEAN nations whose delegates we met at the AIPO conference. Our informal conversations with parliamentarians in the region indicated a relaxed understanding of Australia's position on issues affecting relations between our countries. There was even a degree of sympathy indicated with one of the delegation's tasks: that of reassuring our ASEAN counterparts that recent manifestations of xenophobia in Australia represented only a small portion of the general public and did not amount to a resurgence of attitudes associated with today, the the Australia of some decades ago. About the only correct statement in the news report I have just quoted is the fact that our neighbours in Asia recognise that her policies do not reflect government views. We make the point in the report and I have made the point with reporters who have sought to interview me on the subject, which ABC television certainly did not--,--I had no idea they were even interested in it until I was told about this news report-that the people we spoke to were relaxed about the subject and they did recognise that the views of the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) did not represent the Australian public. In fact, encounter a great deal of goodwill. The only concern they expressed was that those who did not know Australia so well could be misled, given that sort of disgraceful press reportage-the ABC of tonight includedmisrepresenting Australia and Australians in Asia. A section of the report dealt with what is called the dialogue between ASEAN countries and observer delegations. That refers to the discussions that we had and the explanations we made in relation to the member for Oxley. These appear under the subheading 'The Hanson phenomenon'. I point out that the other subheadings in that section are 'Economic matters', 'Development assistance' and 'Education and culture'. Close reading of the actual contents of the dialogue would show that several other subheadings could have been inserted. There were several other subjects actually covered, but as the author of the draft report I picked only the major ones for headings. The matter has been reported as though the report was all about Ms Hanson. In fact, it was only one subsection. It is as though that subsection is the entire report. It is a misrepresentation. I am also disturbed about the statements that are made about New Zealand. They can be checked from the report. (Time expired) Delegation to Laos and Thailand and to the AIPO General Assembly",121
202,Mr ADAMS,ADJOURNMENT,"I was a member of the delegation to Laos and Thailand which the member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) led. I cannot remember it being a secret mission. I spoke on the report today and, as the member for Moncrieff said, it certainly had a lot of other facets to it other than comments that we did receive and people seeking our views on what the Pauline Hanson phenomenon was about in this country. The issue of Radio Australia was raised quite constantly throughout the region. The loss of that is being felt by people who want to speak English, who want to improve their English and who teach English throughout the we did region. But that is another story. A particular issue I feel very strongly about that I was unable to address in my few minutes at the tabling of the report today is about the war graves and memorials at the bridge over the River Kwai, the actual cemetery and Hellfire Pass. We were fortunate to be taken to the bridge over the River Kwai. The river's real name is Khwae Yai, but the easier name has been adopted by English speakers. The delegation participated in a special plaque unveiling for 350 American war casualties along with other allied troops in this area-something that had been long overdue in its recognition. The bridge itself is now part of a bustling town-people walk up and down it mixed with the occasional trainvery different from the time when the area was surrounded by thick vegetation and where the heat and lack of food made the work extremely difficult. The bridge itself is the subject of many myths built up through the English-American film, after which the bridge is now called. However, some of the film material is historically questionable. We spent some time at the war graves, which were beautifully kept and very interesting. It was a very moving experience to walk through this lovely setting and read the gravestones of these brave and valiant men. We visited the almost mystical site of Hellfire Pass. Although tranquil and peaceful now, you could see that the horrors were only thinly disguised and much was still being discovered in the region. I am particularly impressed by the dedication of Rod Beattie on this site, his energies in searching the area for artefacts and his work on re-creating the line that cost so many Australian lives. The museum being built there to be opened soon will provide visitors with a better understanding of what the prisoners of war went through during that period. We walked down the remains of the railway line and laid a wreath at the site of the memorial plaque for Weary Dunlop and all the other prisoners of war. It is an experience I will never forget. All Australians should visit this part of our country's history. The reports do not give the feeling that one has when looking up at the sides of the pass and trying to imagine the terrible conditions that must have prevailed. It is very steep and rocky, and movement of materials was all done by manual labour, struggling up and down these cliffs. My concern not mentioned in the report is that there is still so much to be documented and to be found in this area. I believe there should be a full-time curator established there to ensure that the work can continue on the site and that it is properly cared for. A caretaker could not do that. Another point that was not mentioned was that this whole area has a special meaning for Australia and Australian families. There should be some approach to the Thai government to give it special status so that we can ensure access forever. A special reserve or some sort of park should be set aside so that, whatever happens in the future, Hellfire Pass becomes a memorial for all those who worked on the Thailand-Burma railway at one time or another-not only to remember those who died but also to pay tribute to those who survived and helped others to survive. The area is as important, if not more important than, as the memorial sites in France and in Gallipoli, yet there is no formal arrangement for the continual preservation of the site. It would be shortand sighted of this government if it were to cut back on the funding being allocated to the investigation of the site, the curation of materials and the setting up of displays for visitors. (Time expired) Chronic Fatigue Syndrome",122
203,Mrs ELIZABETH GRACE,ADJOURNMENT,"Judy Williams is a high achieving individual who successfully balanced work and family commitments. One morning she woke up feeling unwell. Now, instead of paying taxes, she relies on the generosity of the Australian taxpayer for a disability support pension. Isolation gripped Judy's life. No-one underthat stood what she was going through-not family, not friends, not even her former work colleagues in the medical industry. Sympathy was short on the ground and barbs like 'hysterical woman' and 'malingerer' cut extremely deep. She felt outlawed and ostracised by society and thoroughly misunderstood by doctors. Judy had been robbed of her financial and emotional independence and started to question her sanity. Her daughter even asked, 'Where has my mother gone?' Judy is afflicted with chronic fatigue syndrome. Despite the heartache of chronic fatigue, Judy Williams is fighting back in the most inspirational way. She has set up an organisation called Future Health Resources to facilitate education and disseminate information for medical practitioners. Because of an appalling lack of knowledge in the medical world, Judy hopes to be able to short-circuit some of the misinformation that exists. Future Health Resources has been set up with the help of another chronic fatigue syndrome victim. Her associate, like many other sufferers, was caught in the vicious circle of falling ill, returning to work and then falling ill again. She has not worked for two years and has been forced to move back home with her mother and sell her home and her car. To make matters worse, she has spent over $60,000 on treatment that has not been successful. In a letter to my office on 26 September 1997, they wrote: Future Health Resources was born out of frustration need by 2 individuals who have 22 years experience, collectively, with chronic fatigue syndrome. We function from a one bedroom unit with a loaned fax machine. Both of us have personally experienced the emotional and physical traumas that go hand-in-hand with this devastating health problem. Neither of us are able to work in our full-time careers and struggle on a day-today basis both financially and physically. We have witnessed and experienced mis-diagnosis and mis-treatment and all the side effects that flow on. Because of - ecided to address the desperate need for ed-ca颅 tlonal programs for health practitioners. I have since met both these ladies and have gained a deeper appreciation of the difficulties faced by chronic fatigue sufferers. Chronic f-tigue syndrome is a far more complex dIsorder than the commonly held perception that it is just a 'yuppie flu'. The symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome can be so severe as to keep a person bedridden, in a wheelchair or even forced to use a walking stick. There have been reported deaths from the complications of the syndrome. However, more common symptoms include debilitating fatigue, nausea, emotional distress or intolerable headaches. These symptoms are compounded by either insomnia or the need to sleep for up to 20 hours a day. Judy Williams is confident there is light at the end of a very long tunnel. Australia's - niversi-y of Newcastle has developed a diagnostIc tool and also believes there is a strong link between chronic fatigue and common bacterial infections. These eminent researchers are making real progress in unravelling the details of the syndrome and the University of Newcastle team has been buoyed with the news that a Swedish research team has independently duplicated its results. However, the University of Newcastle research team desperately needs research dollars to continue this vital work. This Saturday, 1 November, I will officially open a seminar entitled 'New developments in chronic fatigue syndrome', which is for the health industry. It will be held at the Powerhouse Boutique Hotel in Hamilton in Brisbane. The keynote speaker will be Associate Professor Tim Roberts, who is the head of the Newcastle research team into chronic fatigue syndrome. I would be happy to furnish any member with further information on chronic fatigue syndrome or the results of the seminar. I commend Judy Williams and the work of Future Health Resources to the House. City of Casey: Volunteer Transport",123
204,Mr WILTON,ADJOURNMENT,"The city of Casey is one of the largest and fastest growing municipalities in the entire country. this we Casey not only has more noughtto four-yearolds than any municipality in Australia but also has a significant aged population. T-e mu-icipal.ity's volunteer transport serVice, WhICh reimburses volunteer drivers who visit the elderly in their homes will finis- in .January unless additional gove-ment fundmg IS forthcoming. The service, which is already restricted to high priority clients, is a key component of the city of Casey's aged and disabled volunteer program. Volunteers visit the aged and disabled in their homes offerin- a smile and friendly conversation: and dnve them to the shops or medical appointments or wherever. Those volunteers a-e reimburse- at the rate of some 40c per kIlometre, which is the only payment that they receive. I u-derstand that the city of Casey has submitted an application for more than $19,000 from this year's home and community care budget, which is provided for jointly by federal and state governments. The volunteer transport service, which provides for some 25 permanent and some 34 occasional clients across the city of Casey, will be advised as to its future when funding arrangements are announced next month. The coordi-ator of the city of Casey's volunteer serVice, Ms Tania Malishev, said that this essential service had proved very popular since its inception in 1996. In fact, demand. for it h-s doubled over the past year. Ms Mahshev SaId that the service had proven so popular that $3,000 of this financial year's $8,000 budget was spent in its first two months. The restrictive nature of this funding has meant that occasional clients could not be visited and that the service was only provided to - hose who were regarded as high priority reSidents. . Mrs .Josie-Mary Maloney, who is aged 74, IS a tYPical member of the aged population in the suburb of Cranbourne North. She is alone in her son's house for much of the day and depends on the service for companionship and comfort. When Alison Roberts-a volunteer Service who visits Mrs Maloney every Tuesday for s.ome two hours-arrives this brightens and hghtens Mrs Maloney's life. It is a visit that she has come to depend on. The two get on particularly well and enjoy each other's company. It is because of this case and many similar cases that this system must be retained. To that end, I urge the minister to agree to the application made by the City of Casey for $19,000 in funding and I will be approaching him in that regard. I am sure that he will see reason and consider this most needed service to be at the front line or, to use another cliche, at the cutting edge of service delivery to people who are most in need especially those, such as Mrs Maloney of Cranbourne North, who live in what are basically isolated communities on the outer south-eastern growth fringe of the city of Melbourne. In addition, people like Mrs Maloney are most concerned about the imminent introduction of up-front nursing home fees in the form of a loosely termed accommodation bond. They have more than enough concerns to worry about without the concern that the funds of the volunteer service, which provides comfort and friendship to the elderly through the visits of these volunteers, Refugee Week",124
205,Mrs DRAPER,ADJOURNMENT,"Last Saturday week, I had the privilege to be the guest of honour at a Refugee Week event organised by the Baha'is of Tea Tree Gully. I would like to pay tribute to this very community minded group within my electorate and say a few words about the importance of Refugee Week. The Baha'is are a very tolerant group of people who are opposed to all forms of racism. They number people from all different ethnic and cultural backgrounds, all sharing a common religious philosophy. I was inspired by their genuine warmth and good humour and enjoyed the time. I spent with them. As guest of honour, I was asked to speak on matters relating to refugees. It is a tragedy that, as we move toward the end of the 20th century, there are still millions of people around the world who face persecution on a daily basis. Many of these people are forced to flee their country of birth and seek a better life elsewhere. Often, they are the lucky ones who can escape. It is unfortunate that some of these people who have come to Australia have had to suffer the poor manners and intolerance of some people who display their ignorance by their ill-chosen and often defamatory remarks. Such people are doing themselves and Australia a great disservice. I am very pleased to be part of a government that is taking a strong stand against racism and bigotry. This government is establishing an anti-racism campaign to better inform all people about the dangers of racism and the benefits of our truly tolerant multicultural society. Australia has a proud record in the area of refugees. Since 1945, more than 500,000 refugees and migrants have settled in Australia. My mother and father came to Australia from Europe at the end of the war-my father arriving on our shores with just two pounds in his pocket, the clothes on his back, a suit for church on Sunday and his much loved banjo. My father gained employment with the railways and, for two years, he lived in a tent at Islington in South Australia while he may well be cut. worked and saved. Like many refugees and migrants who came upon the shores of this great country, my father was determined to make the most of the opportunities that our country and system of government afforded. My mother and father were determined to create a better life for themselves and their family. As each wave of migration arrives in Australia, whether they be from Europe, South-East Asia or Latin America, similar such stories can be told. Australia today is only one of 10 countries in the world that has a planned refugee program. That is because we have recognised not only our duty to playa leading role in the world humanitarian effort but also the great benefits that accrue to this nation from the skills and will to work that many of the refugees and migrants possess. Earlier this year, I attended the New Year festivities organised by the Vietnamese community in South Australia and felt the same level of commitment and desire to achieve among our newest refugees and migrants as that possessed by my parents and their generation of arrivals. Refugee Week is a time for all of us to remember and to reflect on the role Australia has played on the world stage as a leader in accepting and assisting refugees from around the world. They have helped us to build this country, and we have helped them to live out their lives in safety and peace. Changi: Prisoners of War",125
206,Dr NELSON,ADJOURNMENT,"Bradfield) (10.57 p.m.)Tonight I would like to read to the House a couple of quotes from some men who were members of the 2/30th Battalion AIF and who were prisoners of war at Changi. Governments do not always finance things which I consider to be of the utmost value, but this is one. I am reading from a booklet entitled Getting on with it, which was a project undertaken by some long-term unemployed people. In particular, I urge the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) to take note of these quotes: ""The Chinese were of great assistance-they were wonderful. At times they just gave stuff away when they had so little themselves."" ""I think back to the times when some of the risks that some of the Malays and Chinese ran to help us. At different times we were working on jobs near them-before we went up north to Burmaand some of them would bring out a big container they used to carry rice in. They'd bring out extra and give to some of the fellows, you know. Those people had a good heart."" ""You might want to hate the Japanese for what they did. You might never be able to forget but I can't hate another human being, I can't. I need to forgive and it is the hardest test of all but it's worth it because I believe in myself and I value others."" ""Some people sort of live in their own little world. Quite self interested, self centred, and it's pretty hard to shake. Many people did change, particularly when they saw the people who came back from 'F' Force. Just a mess. Open wounds, skinny, pus-the whole lot of us just broke down and sobbed. Sort of drove home to them that there were people worse off than themselves."" This booklet is something which I commend to every Australian. I am embarrassed to say that the government at this stage has provided funding for the publication of a first run of 1,500 copies. I have been successful in securing some funding for another 5,000. Within this little booklet are contained the kinds of values which ought to be adopted by the next generation of young people and upon which they can build the foundation for the next millennium. The member for Oxley and those who subscribe to her views ought to learn a great deal from these men who suffered hardships that most of us will never begin to understand.",126

(See comments on Chapters 3 and 4) Also, it is not clear whether a 3 unit ANEI correction has been applied for comparison with the results of the NAL study. This should be clarified. (See comments on Chapter 6). The questionnaire used in the survey should have been presented and not the NAL one. The results should have been summarised and conclusions provided. The methodology used in the social survey and the resulting analysis and presentation of the findings should be critically examined by an expert in this field. I have talked to Dr Norman Carter, a psychologist experienced in the effects of noise, who would be prepared to examine these chapters if required. Presented in the following pages are detailed comments by NAL on the landakot Airport Noise and Social Survey Report. NA NA NA This does not say much about the outcomes of the study. The first four paragraphs provide background information. Only the last two paragraphs provide useful information on the outcomes of the study. The fifth paragraph says that noise levels measured were higher than predicted and the last paragraph says that community reaction was higher than that predicted from the NAL study. If the Executive Summary is not going to be more detailed than this then a chapter on CONCLUSIONS and RECOMMENDATIONS should be included in the report. NA 6.3.2 should read ""Other Variables"" 1. INTRODUCTION 1.1 Definition of Terms Good definitions may be found in Australian 3.4 Results Standard 1633-1985 Acoustics-Glossary of Table Terms and Related Symbols. Sound pressure level is not a measure of the variation in pressure, it is a measure of the sound pressure expressed as 20 times the logarithm to the base 10 of the ratio of the rms sound pressame sure to the reference sound pressure. Although ANEF, ANEI and ANEC represent energy concepts they do not show a cumulative On exposure but rather the exposure for an average day's movements for the period of interest. 2. AIRCRAFT NOISE EXPOSURE DESCRIPwith INM figures. NA 2.1 Australian Noise Exposure Forecast Para 4 line 2-delete ""to"" at the start of the line. Para 4--Although the NAL study energy noise indices were more highly correlated with community reaction than other types index, correlations were low for all noise indices. This indicates that noise alone does not much of community reaction to aircraft. Para 5-to clearly differentiate between the NAL findings and the findings of the landakot survey, should say ""The dose/response relationship found by NAL between aircraft ........... "". This should also be made clear in Figure 2.l. 3. AIRCRAFT NOISE MEASUREMENTS 3.1 Introduction It would have been useful to show the aircraft movements for each aircraft type and track as used in the INM program to produce the 1995 and 1996 ANEI contours. How accurate are the movement data and related tracks and what were the sources of information? Does the ERM Mitchell MCCotter report No. 26034, dated October 1996, containing the 1995 ANEI contours have more detailed information on aircraft movements and tracks? Is it available? Last paragraph on Page 3. I-This is a good point. The number of different types of fixed and variable pitch aircraft may not be important for larger commercial, airports, but could be significant if noise from some of these types differs from the types used in INM. Figure 3.1 The note should say"" .......... 33% of people together. will at least be moderately affected I would have expected from the high density of tracks over the Leeming residential area, as shown in Appendix B, that the area half way between these tracks and the airport would be quieter. As shown, the exposure is between 10 and 15 ANEI, that is, louder. 3.1 gives no indication of what each aircraft was doing nor its slant distance. Mean EPNLs don't mean anything if one aircraft was taking off rms and another of the same type was landing, nor if one was a different distance from the other for the operation. Individual aircraft operation, height and track are crucial for evaluating and optimising noise the contours produced by INM. page 3.1 it is stated that 5 aircraft model groups were used for the study. Only 3 groups were measured and subsequently used for comparison Do any small jet aircraft use landakot Airport? 4. COMPARISON OF MEASURED NOISE NA found that equal4.1 Introduction Nd and Nn are averages (per day or night) for the of noise period under consideration. account for 4.2 Validation of ANEI Contours It seems that the method used for validation is as follows: (i) record noise from aircraft activities for the major aircraft types at several locations (ii) analyse these recordings to produce EPNLs (iii) average the EPNLs at each location for each aircraft type (iv) using INM and updated flight paths, calculate EPNL at each measurement location for each aircraft type (v) average the EPNLs at each location for each aircraft type, for the INM figures (vi) subtract the measured and calculated means for each aircraft type for each location (vii) calculate the mean difference (viii) redo (iii) and (v) but for energy mean EPNLs (ix) repeat (vi) and (vii) The results of this procedure are路 that the (arithmetic) mean level is 1 EPN dB higher than that the calculated using INM and the energy mean level is noticeably 2.8 EPN dB higher. The problem with this method is that all measurements for all aircraft types have been lumped .......... "" A better procedure would be: (i) take several recordings of each aircraft type at each of several locations for each activity (take-off, landing, training circuit) (ii) obtain the track and slant distance for each measurement (iii) analyse these recordings to produce EPNLs (iv) using INM and updated flight paths, calculate EPNL at each measurement location for each aircraft type and activity (v) plot the measured and INM-calculated EPNL data pairs for each aircraft type and each activity. (vi) determine the corrections to be applied for each aircraft type and each activity (vii) calculate the 1996 ANEI using corrected noise data for each aircraft type and each activity and corrected flight paths. Note: it is important that measurements are of aircraft representative of each aircraft and activity and that sufficient measurements are taken to obtain reliable results. This has not been demonstrated. Note that a 2.8 EPN dB correction to the INM is a significant adjustment. It is important that such a relationship is accurately determined. Figure 4.1 shows radar tracks for Jandakot Airport. Are radar tracks for Perth Airport also included here? Do these radar tracks show all Jandakot Aircraft for the period or only those with transponders? A close up view of radar tracks in the area of interest around Jandakot would have been most useful. 5. SOCIAL SURVEY 5.4 Survey Methodology Pages 5.2 and 5.3-ANEI contour ranges should be shown as 25-30 ANEI, 20--25 ANEI etc for clarity, rather than-30 ANEI,-25 ANEI etc. 5.3 Survey Questionnaire The survey questionnaire presented in Appendix D is not the one used in the study, it is the NAL questionnaire. Consequently, it is difficult to find the appropriate question referred to in the report, since not all NAL questions were asked and the question numbers are not the same. 5.5 Response Rate Did the final breakdown of residents surveyed satisfy the original specification shown at the top of page 5.3? 6. SOCIAL SURVEY ANALYSIS 6.1 Determination of Noise Reaction Again, the actual questionnaire used should have been in the Appendix rather than the NAL questions. In this way the questions referred to in the text could be easily accessed. It is not clear that deleting the two NAL questions avoids obvious repetition. The first NAL question relates to the degree of dissatisfaction with the amount of aircraft noise and the second to the amount of annoyance felt overall because of activity disturbance caused by aircraft noise. Neither of these tow questions is covered by those questions used to construct the GR score. There will certainly be correlation between some of the questions but this can be accounted for in the GR relationship. 6.2 DoselResponse Analysis 6.2.1 Analysis Using the GR Scale Paragraph 2 states that the 3 dB correction for Jandakot was not used since a direct comparison with the results of the NAL survey was being made. However, it has not been established that the predominantly jet aircraft noise exposures calculated for the NAL survey are incorrect. That is, type although it appears that the noise exposure from general aviation aircraft is underestimated by INM, this is not necessarily the case for commercial jets. As such, the best estimate of noise exposure for Jandakot should have been used in the comparisons. Besides that it is essential that the actual dose/response relationship for Jandakot affected residents be known. Presumably if the 3 dB correction was included, then residents would be getting more noise exposure than originally estimated and their doselresponses would be closer to those of residents surveyed by NAL. The figure on page 6.6 should be 6.1. This figure refers to the corrected ANEI level. Is this corrected to reflect the 1996 ANEI over the 1995 ANEI originally used, or is it referring to the 3 dB adjustment to the original 1996 ANEI figures? On this figure, does 8 mean the range 8 to just below 9 and so on? If this is so, does the group 8-11 ANEI in the first paragraph mean ANEI values between 8 and 12 (including 8) and the group 12-15 mean values between 12 and 16 (including 12)? Also in paragraph 1 of page 6.6 why was this grouping chosen? Presumably this was to enable sufficient responses in each group. Paragraph 2 on page 6.6-what is the mean ANEI value? is 10 the mean for group 8-11 and 14 the mean for group 12-15 etc., or is it the energy mean of all the resident exposures in that group. 6.2.2 Analysis Using Proportion Affected or Annoyed Paragraph 3 says that the 3 unit correction has been made in the comparison with the NAL results, whereas paragraph 2 of 6.2.1 says the 3 dB correction has not been made. This needs to be clarified. Figure 6.3 on page 6.8 does not show the error bars for the 10 ANEI mean value. Using the (corrected/uncorrected?) results shown in figures 6.3 and 6.4 it would be useful to determine the number of residents at least moderately and seriously affected. What, for instance, are the numbers in the new and proposed residential areas affected by the airport? Figure 6.3 shows that at least 10% of residents are seriously affected for an aircraft noise exposure of 15 ANEI. The 15 ANEI contour encloses large parts of the residential areas in Leeming, Canning Vale, Jandakot, Banjup and South Lake. Similarly, figure 6.4 shows that at least 35% of residents are at least moderately affected for an aircraft noise exposure of 10 ANEI. The 10 ANEI contour encloses most of Leeming, Canning Vale, Jandakot, Banjup and South Lake. 6.3 Other Results 6.3.1 Reaction to Aircraft Noise in Comparison with Other Neighbourhood Features To clarify that the figures in brackets at the end of paragraph 2 relate to the NAL study and not the percentages in figure 6.6, the words ""which show"" should be added in front of ""approximately"". This also applies to paragraph 1 on page 6.12. Table 6.3 on page 6.12 is worth plotting against ANEI. The heading for 6.3.2 should be ""Other Variables"". The first paragraph of 6.3.2 says that the interview schedule did not provide information on sensitivity to noise in general and negative attitudes to the airport. I would have thought that these were important modifying variables. Paragraph 4 in section 2.1 says ""attitudes towards the aviation industry, personal sensitivity to noise. . . . . ... were found to be important in modifying the extent to which a person will be affected by a given amount of aircraft noise"". Table 6.4 on page 6.13 is worth plotting against ANEI to see if the response to this question depends on how exposed to noise are the residents. A conclusion based on the findings of the survey should be included. 7. ALTERNATIVE PROCEDURES To be supplied. NA APPENDIX A. NOISE MEASUREMENT EQUIPNA Are certificates included for all sound measuring equipment used? APPENDIX B. FLIGHT PATHS USED IN MODEL Presumably ""cross country"" refers to arrivals and departures. The display of separate arrival and departure tracks would have been more informative. Are all aircraft types included in these tracks and what is the source? Have they been verified? APPENDIX D. INTERVIEW SCHEDULE The study questionnaire should have been included here and not the NAL questionnaire. There are no questions about general aviation operations. For instance, the attitude of residents to training and circuits as opposed to normal arrivals and departures would have been useful. APPENDIX E. COMPARISON OF 1995 AND 1996 ANEI CONTOURS EXCLUDING 3dB NA Shown as Appendix D on the diagram. Is the difference between the two contours due to aircraft movements alone or does the 1996 contour include more accurate flight path data? Commonwealth Employment Service Staff: Electoral Division of Fremantle (Question No. 2074) Dr Lawrence asked the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, upon notice, on 25 August 1997: (1) Further to the answer to question No. 1627 (Hansard, 16 June 1997, page 5344), what was the average staffing level of (a) his department, including administration, (b) the Commonwealth Employment Service at Cockburn and Fremantle and (c) the Fremantle Youth Access Centre, in the electoral division of Fremantle in 1996-97.

(10) Has the size of the departmental Legal Group been reduced since March 1996. (11) Has an assessment been made on the value of using outside legal advice on this matter compared with using the Minister's Department's legal services branch; if so, what. Dr Kemp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No. (2) (a) Yes; (b) No; (c) No. (3) No. Barker Gosling, in conjunction with a number of other law firms, responded to the advertisement of July 1995 set out below. Barker Gosling, along with the other law firms, were give selected to provide legal services to the Department. Invitation to register interest Standing offer to provide Legal Services to the Department of Employment, Education and Training The Department of Employment, Education and Training is seeking, from suitably qualified law firms, expressions of interest in inclusion on a small panel of law firms from which, under a standing offer arrangement, the provision of some legal services to the Department during the period of three years after 1 July 1995 may be sought. The areas of the law in relation to which the Department may require legal services are: 路 Administrative Law 路 Agency 路 Bankruptcy 路 Civil and Political Rights 路 Conflict of Laws 路 Contract 路 Corporations 路 Education and Research 路 Employment 路 Guarantees and indemnities 路 Industrial Law 路 Insurance 路 Intellectual property 路 Leases and tenancies 路 Negligence 路 Partnerships and joint ventures 路 Public administration 路 Real property 路 Social welfare and services 路 Taxation and revenue The criteria for inclusion will be whether, in the opinion of the Department, firms can provide quality services, relative to other firms, as determined by reference to: ability to provide nationally integrated and coordinated legal services, including a significant presence in the Australian Capital Territory; demonstrated expertise in areas of the law relevant to the Department; resources and capacity to provide prompt, authoritative and appropriate legal services in all States and Territories; understanding of the operating environment within the Commonwealth public sector; cost and value for money; effective communication, feedback and accountability to senior management in the Department; appropriate mechanisms for avoiding conflicts of interest. The particular matters with which expressions of interest, if submitted, were expected to deal were set out in a document which also included: "" The General Counsel to the Department and the staff reporting to him provide in-house legal services to the Department and manage the relationship with the Attorney-General's Legal Practice which is the primary source of external legal services to the Department. After \ July \995, the Department is proposing to have a small panel of law finris, which is expected to include the Attorney-General's Legal Practice, from which may be sought, under a standing offer arrangement, legal services in those categories of legal services described as ""Charge/Choice"" in the Directions for the Provision of Legal Services to Government Departments and Agencies (l July 1995)(of which a copy is attached), and consistently with those Directions and with the Attorney-General's Guidelines (l July 1995) (of which a copy is also attached). Membership of the panel may not result in a regular allocation of work. Law firms selected for inclusion on the panel will be ranked on overall suitability for the anticipated work. If, however, a firm wishes to register interest in performing only a particular category of work by reason of expertise or interest, this will be taken into account. The Department in not committed contractually in any way to any firm which submits an expression of interest. The Department is not committed, by the issue of this document, to proceeding with all or any of the steps described in it. No contractual obligations will arise under the standing offer arrangement unless and until legal services are formally requested by the Department through the General Counselor staff reporting to him. The Department makes no guarantee or representation that any legal services will necessarily be sought under the standing offer arrangement. The Department reserves the right to engage legal services outside the panel, in exceptional circumstances."". (4) No. See the answer to Question 3 above. (5) No. (6) Legal Services covered under the heading User-Charging and User Choice-Charge/Choice in the Directions for the Provision of Legal Services to Government Departments and Agencies issued on 1 July 1995 by the then Attorney-General, being: (i) general legal advice, eg administrative law, most interpretation of legislation or determinations, advice on the powers of officers, advice on secrecy provisions, settling of minor claims, advice in specialised areas such as social welfare law and questions of statutory interpretation relating to the expenditure and receipt of public money (ii) all matters involving legal agreement or contracts other than those referred to in User-Charging and User-Choice-Charge/No External Choice. (7) (a) Nil as no such advice has been provided. (b) Since December 1996 Barker Gosling has provided leg""al services at a cost totalling approximately $164,600. (8) Mr MCMillan heads the Legal and Review Division of the Department which includes the Legal Group. In the financial year 199711998 to date the staffing level was 31.5. This figure is comprises legal and non-legal staff. (9) Yes. Determination of the actual costs for each item of advice would required detailed analysis of records, including the records of the Attorney-General's Department. It is considered that this would not be a justified diversion of resources. The following is an estimated cost based upon the estimated aggregate time of the officers involved in work in connection with the Bill: General Counsel: $25,000 Legal Officer Level 2: $34,826 Cost of advice from the Attorney-General's Department: $10,117 Total $69,943 (10) No. In September 1997 there were 21 lawyers attached to the Department's Legal Group. In March 1996 there were 18 lawyers attached to the Department's Legal Group. (11) No, as the need for such an assessment has not arisen: see answer to Q 7(a) above. Unemployment: Electoral Division of (Question No. 2237) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, upon notice, on 23 September 1997: Further to the answer to question No. 1281 (Hansard, 4 March 1997, page 1957), what were the unemployment (a) numbers and (b) rates in each of the local government areas of (i) Hurstville, (ii) Rockdale and (iii) Kogarah, NSW, at 30 June 1997. Dr Kemp--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The latest data available for these regions the December quarter 1996, as published in Small Area Labour Markets, Australia. These data are only available on an original basis-that is, they have not been adjusted to take account of seasonal or other factors. They can therefore exhibit irregular movements and are less reliable than the adjusted data published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. (a) The number of unemployed persons for the December quarter 1996 were: (i) Hurstville 2,241; (ii) Kogarah 1,550; and (iii) Rockdale 3,731. (b) The unemployment rates for the December quarter 1996 were: (i) Hurstville 6.2 per cent; (ii) Kogarah 6.0 per cent; and (iii) Rockdale 8.2 per cent. Aged Care: Bond Certification System (Question No. 2262) Mr Mossfield asked the Minister for Family Services, upon notice, on 24 September 1997: Is there to be a new certification to charge a bond system and will the associated benchmark rise each year; if so, what provisions will the Government make to assist older facilities to meet improvement requirements. Mr Warwick Smith-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: No. The Aged Care Act 1997 provides for the certification of aged care services which meet certain building and care standards to charge accommodation bonds and receive funding supplements for concessional (financially disadvantaged) residents. The physical standard of a facility is measured against a ""benchmark"" set by an instrument and methodology which has been developed for that Barton purpose. An evaluation of the assessment instrument and process will be undertaken in the near future. The steering group of consumer and provider representatives will use this information in making recommendations to the Minister of how the certification benchmark is to be increased over time in line with community expectations. Future benchmarks need to be set as soon as possible to enable future planning by the industry. Section 57-2 (n) of the Aged Care Act 1997 states that an approved provider must use the income derived from the accommodation bond and retention amount to meet capital works costs relating to residential care. Service providers all have access to income are for derived from accommodation bonds and concessional resident supplements to finance improvements to residential aged care facilities. It is expected that within four years up to $130 million will be available. Additionally the Commonwealth has made available $40 million over four years to assist in the building, re-building or upgrading of facilities that cater for a majority of concessional residents. Aged Care Industry: Senior Skilled Workers Resignations (Question No. 2277) Mr Mossfield asked the Minister for Family Services, upon notice, on 25 September 1997: (1) How many senior skilled workers in the aged care industry have resigned since March 1996. (2) Are resignations leading to a shortage of senior skilled workers in the industry. Mr Warwick Smith-The answer to the honourable member's questions is as follows: (1) The Department does not have data which would enable it to respond to this question. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) undertakes annual data collections based on a national minimum data set for all major registrable health professions. The most recent data from the AIHW for 19931994 reports broadly on nursing labour force issues but not specifically on gerontic nurses leaving the aged care industry. (2) A committee of experts from academia and the industry was established by the previous Minister for Family Services, the Hon J. Moylan MP, in October 1996 to oversee a review of the residential aged care workforce. The committee has been asked to focus, in the first instance, on identifying the barriers to recruiting and maintaining an appropriately skilled registered nurse workforce and the strategies that can be employed to address these barriers. The Committee is expected to report later this year. Australian Defence Force Airfields: Cost (Question No. 2283) Mr Bevis asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 25 September, 1997: What was the cost to his Department of the Review of the Location of ADF Airfields. Mr MCLachlan-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Salary costs of a Senior Officer Grade B for 10 months ($99,230) and a Wing Commander for 8 months full time ($109,976), and support from other Departmental and ADF elements. Direct costs are $48,473.46. This comprises two major components of $28,670.00 for data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics and $19,803.46 for travel and allowances for officers of the Department to conduct on site inspections and consult with operators. Commonwealth Employment Service Staff: Relocation Allowances (Question No. 2293) Mr Campbell asked the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, upon notice, on 29 September 1997: (1) What are the guidelines for payment of relocation allowances to Commonwealth Employment Service officers. (2) Are officers relocated to country areas denied allowances if jobs are available in cities. Dr Kemp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The guidelines 'for payment of relocation allowances to officers of the Commonwealth Employment Service are the same as for all officers of the Australian Public Service. An officer who is promoted or transferred from one locality to another locality under section 50, SODA or 50DB of the Public Service Act 1922 is classified as an eligible transferred officer under Public Service Determination 1983110 and, as such, is eligible for the payment of relocation allowances. (2) Officers relocated to country areas are not denied allowances if jobs are available in cities. If they are classified as an eligible transferred officer, all allowances that would normally be payable in the cities are paid. Department of Industry, Science and Tourism: Installations on the Georges River (Question No. 2301) of Review Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, upon notice, on 30 September 1997: (1) Does the Minister's Department have agencies, instrumentalities or installations bordering the Georges River, NSW; if so, do they use the river for disposal of waste, chemicals, debris or effluent. (2) How many persons are employed at each establishment identified in part 1. (3) Is action being taken by the Minister's Department to stop the instrumentalities, agencies or installations from polluting the Georges River, if so what. Mr Moore-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) There are no Departmental agencies, instrumentalities or installations bordering the Georges River. The only portfolio agency located near the Georges River is the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO), in the Sutherland Shire. The ANSTO site is close to Mill Creek, Bardens Creek, Forbes Creek and the Woronora River. These waterways feed into the Georges River. ANSTO does not use these waterways for the disposal of waste, chemicals, debris or effluent. (2) ANSTO employs around 800 people. (3) Though ANSTO does not use the waterways for disposal of waste, chemicals, debris or effluent, ANSTO regularly monitors radioactivity levels in Mill Creek, Bardens Creek, Forbes Creek, Woronora River and the surrounding areas. The 1996 Annual Environmental Survey published by ANSTO in June 1997 indicates no radioactivity above background levels. Telstra: Public Telephones (Question No. 2332) Mr Bevis asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts, upon notice, on 2 October 1997: (1) Does Telstra have a policy with respect to community service obligations; if so, (a) what is it and (b) does it"" encompass the provision of public telephones in urban areas where safety and security are a consideration. (2) Does Telstra maintain public payphones as part of its community service obligations; if so, where. Mr Warwick Smith-The Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) (a) Yes-Telstra has a policy with respect to community service obligations. Telstra is required to comply with its legislative requirements under the Telecommunications Act 1997 (the Act) in relation the Universal Service Obligation (USO). Under the Act, the main object of the universal service regime is to ensure that the standard telephone service (STS), payphones and prescribed carriage services are reasonably accessible to all people in Australia on an equitable basis, wherever they reside or carry on business. It is part of the USO to supply STS to people in Australia on request; to supply, install and maintain payphones in Australia; and to supply prescribed carriage services to people in Australia on request. A universal service provider must submit its draft plan setting out how it will progressively fulfil USO to the Minister within 90 days of being declared a provider for that area. A preliminary version of a draft plan must be made available for public comment. The Minister may formulate requirements for draft plans, including timetables for the supply of services in areas and performance standards relating to fulfilment of the USO. The Minister may seek the Australian Communications Authority's (ACA's) advice in deciding whether to approve a plan. Plans may be varied with the Minister's approval and the Minister may direct variation or replacement of a plan. The ACA will maintain a register of approved plans. Plans must be complied with. The ACA must also monitor and report to the Minister on adequacy of compliance with plans. In compliance with these requirements, Telstra as the current universal service provider submitted its Draft Universal Service Plan to the Minister on 29 September 1997 after consulting widely on the development of the plan. The Government's response is under consideration. (b) Yes. Telstra's Universal Service Obligation in relation to payphones is to ensure that payphones are reasonably accessible to all people in Australia on an equitable basis wherever they reside or carry on business. Telstra's obligation extends to the supply, installation and maintenance of payphones in Australia including the process for public consultation on the location of payphones, and the process for resolution of any complaints about the location of payphones. Telstra's Draft Universal Service Plan states that it will make all reasonable efforts to provide and maintain a payphone on an equitable basis considering financial and geographical implications. To meet the obligation to provide payphones, Telstra will: - accept, consider and respond to all requests from any person in Australia for the provision of a payphone service in a timely manner; - make a reasonable effort to assess the demand for payphone services from all sections of the community who are users of payphone services; and - as far as is practicable, consult with local communities and local government authorities on the location or potential removal of a payphone facility. (2) Yes-Telstra maintains public payphones as part of its Universal Service Obligation. Telstra's Draft Universal Service Plan ensures that public payphones supplied as part of its Universal Service Obligation, will perform accordits ing to a technical grade of service quality in line with appropriate standards or codes of practice on network end-to-end performance. The Draft Plan also states that Telstra will determine the precise location of a payphone facility based on one or more of the following criteria: - accessibility of the site to customers and maintenance (repair, cleaning, coin collection) - visibility of the facility to potential customers, - the availability of appropriate infrastructure (particularly for small remote sites), - the proximity and accessibility of other payphone services, including non Telstra payphones, - complexity of installation and potential site rental fees, technical constraints, - public safety and community consultation considerations, minimising environmental impact, - risk of damage to equipment from vandalism or the elements. Telstra will also be mindful of the needs of people with disabilities in the siting of payphones, design of equipment and booths, and installation standards. Consultation by Telstra regarding the provision of payphone services with groups representing people with disabilities will continue, particularly for TTY payphones.
