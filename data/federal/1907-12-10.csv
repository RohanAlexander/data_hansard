Petition received. CADETS: PHYSICAL EXAMINATIONS.",14
1,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"I wish to ask the Minister of Defence, without notice, whether it has been reported to him that at the last King's Birthday Review, held in Adelaide, owing to the fact that the day was very hot, over twenty cadets fainted, and had to be removed from the ground on which the review was held; whether he knows that' this has had the effect of rendering the cadet movement .to some extent unpopular, and also if he does not see his way to carry out a suggestion already made by me, that cadets should be examined as to their physical fitness before undergoing military training?",14
2,Mr EWING,Unknown,"I will take into consideration the suggestion made by the honourable member. On general principles,. 1 agree with him as to the necessity for ascertaining the physical fitness of cadets for the work they are asked to perform. Instructions have been given to all the responsible officers in the various States to 'see that no boy physically unfit for such work is permitted to join the cadets. Further attention will be given to the matter. NA HEIDELBERG.  of Defence, without notice, whether his attention has been directed to the following paragraph in this morning's Age, headed, ""Training Citizen Soldiers: Field Work Blocked"":- The announcement made last month, with a great flourish of trumpets, by the Victorian District Commandant that the parades for the King's Birthday were to be of a service and not a show nature, seems to have exhausted the efforts of the head-quarters' staff in this direction. Although it was pointed out then that the usefuD parades were the work of the regimental commanders, it would seem that their attempts t c continue this really valuable work are to be rendeied nugatory. One of the metropolitan-, militia infantry regiments, after great troubleand preparation, recentlv wrote to the District Commandant for leave to hold a moving camp, and two nights' bivouac from Heidelberg toDiamond Creek on the coming Foundation Day in January.* Nearly 400 of the men had agreed' to give the necessary time to the work. They have now been informed that Colonel 5tanley will not consent to this programme, and refusesto recommend' the expense, which is less than £y>. As there arc several salary increases to the heail-quarters' staff list this year largely ex-' ceeding this sum, and as a moving camp is oneaf the very necessary war condition practices, of which the local troops have too' little oppor-. tunity, it is to be hoped that personal consideration will be given by the Minister to the matter. So keenly do the officers and men on the in fantry feel over the incident that if Colonel' Stanley remains obdurate they will themselves endeavour to subscribe the amount necessary to carry out a military service too frequently neglected.",14
3,Mr SPEAKER,PROPOSED TRAINING CAMP AT,"jl s the honourable member asking a question?  ther the Minister's attention has beenr drawn to the paragraph I have read, and,, if - so, whether he will inform the House as to the correctness of the statements contained therein, and as to what he intendsto do in the matter?",14
4,Mr EWING,PROPOSED TRAINING CAMP AT,"I did see the paragraph, referred to, and have asked the Commandant to report in connection with the matter. I hope' to be able tomorrow toinform the House of the action which is,, in the circumstances, considered wise. PAPUA: PURCHASE OF CONFLICT' GROUP.",14
5,Mr BAMFORD,PROPOSED TRAINING CAMP AT,"I wish to ask theAttorney-General a question without notice. In view of the fact that, the Papua Bill is so low down on the. business-paper that it - is very unlikely that it can be' dealt with this session, in what position doesMr Wickham stand in 'reference to theNew Guinea Government? He is the gentleman for whom the Bill was practicallyintroduced. He is the lessee of an island ' 1 on the coast of New Guinea, and I wish to' know whether his rights under the-, lease will be affected by the delay in the passing of the Bill?",14
6,Mr GROOM,PROPOSED TRAINING CAMP AT,"I ask the honourable member to give notice of his question for tomorrow. The position of the matter at present is that, some years ago, MrWickham took a lease from the New Guinea Administration, under which he had a right to purchase the fee-simple of - certain islands. He exercised his , option under the contract before the Papua Act of 1905 came into operation, but the deed was not issued. The land law was changed, and no deed in fee simple can be issued. It is open to question whether he has not a claim for compensation against the Government, if they fail to fulfi l the contract made with him. The object of the Bil l is to enable the Commonwealth Government to fulfil the obligations of the contract. MARINE SURVEY, NORTH - WE ST COAST OF AUSTRALIA .",14
7,Sir JOHNFORREST,PROPOSED TRAINING CAMP AT,"I wish to ask the Prime Minister, without notice, whether he has any information which he is in a position to communicate to the House in regard to the proposed marine survey of the North-West coast of Australia? think that on a previous occasion the honourable gentleman stated that he regarded the survey of the coast of Australia as a work for which the Commonwealth Government is responsible, or, at any rate, should give particular attention to - As a good deal of correspondence has taken place between the State Government of Western Australia, the Admiralty, and the Commonwealth Government, I should be much obliged if the Prime Minister can give the House any information with regard to the position of this very important matter at the present time.",15
8,Mr DEAKIN,PROPOSED TRAINING CAMP AT,"W it h in the last few days we have agreed with the State Government of Western Australia to expedite the progress of the survey referred to, the Commonwealth and State Governments defraying the cost in equal proportions. We have inquired the earliest date at the Admiralty can commence the work LIGHTING OF CHAMBE R.",15
9,Mr JOHNSON,PROPOSED TRAINING CAMP AT,"I desire to ask you, Mr Speaker, whether there is any chance of improving the electric lighting of chamber ? The present light has had a very taken. bad effect upon my eyes, and several other honourable membe'rs have complained that it has affected their sight. Some, I believe, have had to take to wearing glasses. The defective light also has, in some had the effect of causing violent pains across the temples. Is there any. probability an improvement being made before the sittings are resumed next year ?",15
10,Mr SPEAKER,PROPOSED TRAINING CAMP AT,"No complaint had been made to me about this inatter until the honourable member for Lang drew attention to it, or I should have taken some steps earlier to improve the lighting. The fact is that the colouring which is used to tint the globes of the electric light gradually deteriorates in use. This makes it neces-. sary that the globes should be taken down each session, and freshly tinted globes substituted. I shall have that done before we meet again next year. ENLISTMENT : MILITARY FORCES. MEDICAL EXAMINATION.",15
11,Mr CROUCH,PROPOSED TRAINING CAMP AT,"I desire to ask the Minister of Defence a question without notice. On 8th' October last, a promise was made to me that certain information should be supplied as to the enlistment and rejection of recruits for three years. That I is not a very large demand, 'and I should like to ask the Minister whether he can ar- range that the district Commandant should, without overworking himself, supply the information, at any rate, within the' next few months?",15
12,Mr EWING,PROPOSED TRAINING CAMP AT,"I believe that the question asked by the honourable member was replied to, but not completely. I instructed the Commandant to furnish full information, and I am at a loss to know why that has not yet been done. I shall make inquiries, and inform the honourable member of the result. SYDNEY-WOLLONGONG TRUN K TELEPHONE.",15
13,Mr FULLER,PROPOSED TRAINING CAMP AT,"I wish to ask the Postmaster-General, without notice, whether the Treasurer has yet approved of the neces.which sary funds being made available for the - carrying out of the trunk telephone line from Sydney to Wollongong- a work which was approved months ago?",15
14,Mr MAUGER,PROPOSED TRAINING CAMP AT,"The matter is under the consideration of the Treasurer, and I the have no doubt that action will shortly be TASMANIANMAIL CONTRACT. BURNIE-MELBOURNE SERVICE.",15
15,Mr KING OMALLEY,PROPOSED TRAINING CAMP AT,"the instances, Postmaster-General, upon notice- In view of the promise made by the Union of Steam-ship Company, when the Tasmanian Mail Contract was entered into, to put Oonah on the Burnie-Melbourne service before the end of 1907, will the Minister insist on that part of the contract being fulfilled , so that the thousands who desire, for the purposes of health - and pleasure, to visit Tasmania journey of only twelve hours' duration, enjoy the bewildering enchantment of the magnificent come scenery of Burnie and the surrounding beauty spots of the northern and western the Garden of Eden of the Commonwealth?",15
16,Mr MAUGER,PROPOSED TRAINING CAMP AT,"The answer to the ment will be made? honourable member's question is as folproclaimed lowsThe Union Steam-ship. Company advised, ' under yesterday's date, that the Oonah, which was due in Melbourne yesterday afternoon, would at once be laid up in order to undergo her periodical survey, and completed, she would take the place of the Flora in terms of the contract. Steps will taken to see that the provisions of the contract are complied .with. MARSHALL. ISLANDS, PACIFIC: CLAIM OF BURNS, PHILP & CO.",16
17,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PROPOSED TRAINING CAMP AT,"the permanent Prime Minister, ufon notice I. Regarding cabled extracts from German newspapers as to the counter claims made. Germany as a set-off against Australia's Marproclaimed shall Islands claim, has any official communicaby tion yet been received from the British Governdays. ment ? 2. Is it a fact that Germany received that State. large sums from Great Britain for claims made during the Boer War, which claims were paid promptly, and, it was understood, satisfactorily, by the British Government? 3. Has Germany ever advanced any satisfaccified tory reason why she should not settle the tary loss sustained through' breach of treaty rights in the Pacific, and has Australia guarantee that she will, in the future have protection under such treaties? 4. Has not Germanv admitted liability in connection with the Marshall Islands claim, and, if so, is it comprehensible that there should be. serious difficulty in arranging for arbitration assess the amount of the liability ?",16
18,Mr DEAKIN,PROPOSED TRAINING CAMP AT,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as folputy low-1. No reply of any kind has been received from the Colonial Office. 2. The Government have no official information on this subject, but it is believed that the facts are as stated. 3. Germany has not advanced any satisfactory reason that we are aware of, nor does Australia seem to have acquired any better guarantee for future protection under treaties. 4. Germany has not formally admitted liability in connection with the claim, but offered to pay a sum of money ex gratia. the steamer PAY FOR PROCLAIMED HOLIDAYS.

Will he name the holidays for which payI f he declines to pay temporary hands for holidays,- will ""he allow the men concerned to work on all such holidays, except Christmas Day and Good Friday ?",16
19,Mr MAUGER,PROPOSED TRAINING CAMP AT,"In answer to the honourable member's questions, I have to state that, when this was as follows1. This matter is governed by Public Service be Regulation 136, which provides that every temporary employee shall be deemed to be subject lo the Regulations for the time being for the guidance of officers of the Commonwealth Public Service relating to holidays prescribed by section 72 of the Public Service Act. 2.

20,Mr MAUGER,PROPOSED TRAINING CAMP AT,"In reply to questions to asked by the honourable member for Calare, upon notice, on the 6th inst., vide Hansard, p. 7117, I have to state that the DePostmaster-General, Sydney, has furnished the following information: 1. Yes; a communication was received on the 5th inst. from the Chamber of Commerce. 2. The Electrical Engineer reports that the interruptions during October and the early part of November were due to the abnormal conditions prevailing, viz., bush fires and fierce westerly gales. Since fires have been extinguished and the gales have abated, the interruptions have virtually ceased, and those since experienced are no greater than must be expected when length of pole lines ard. number of wires are considered. The erection of several additional lines is now being arranged for, and in order to obtain the best possible results from present circuits, line inspectors have for some time past been making a pole-to-pole examination of the principal northern, southern, and western circuits in order to ascertain what is necessary, if possible further to strengthen the lines and prevent interruptions, and the carrying out of portions of this work is now being arranged for. PIANOS: IMPORTATIO N.",16
21,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PROPOSED TRAINING CAMP AT,"A question was asked recently by the honourable member for Coolgardie regarding the importation of pianos, and it was claimed that some misstatement had been made regarding the information supplied. A mistake was made. It has been put right as far as possible, and I now present the following information:It appears that for 1005, 1906, the numbers were not recorded in New South Wales, but estimated only on the basis of previous records. It is, tlierefore, impossible to give absolutely correct numbers, but numbers have been inserted obtained by dividing the average value-£22 into the total value. The total values have been checked, and the collector assures me that the average value now given-£22-ma y be accepted as correct. Return sent to Mr Wertheim, on which Mr. Mahon questioned the Minister :NA NA Imports of Pianos from 1901 ... 3.170 1902 ... 2,392 1903 ... 1,836 1904 ... 2,555 1905 ...

22,Mr ARCH ER,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"Capricornia) [3.18] - It is necessary that I should again discuss this item. I explained the .position fully this morning, but at such an early hour, and with so many honourable members necessarily absent, that the majority now present could not have heard any Of the arguments adduced, whilst some of tliose who were present then did not hear them because they were so fatigued that they were asleep. The whole point of the matter lies in this and the next item. Item 355 providesNews Printing Ink, invoiced at uncier 3d. per lb., and in packages of not less than 1 cwt., ad val. (General Tariff). 7.0. per cent. : (United Kingdom), 25 per cent. The news printing ink mentioned in that item is the same as the printing ink mentioned in item 354, but that class of ink which is invoiced at under 3d. per lb. and AUSTRALIA. in packages of not less than 1 cwt. is used by the very large papers, who can import WALES. and use ink in large quantities. Germany.",17
23,Sir JOHN FORREST,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"A hundredweight is No. No. Value. not a large quantity. £ Mr ARCHER - My authority is the - 74,7° 2 honourable member for Wimmera, who is a - 52,026 newspaper man, and also obtained informa- 39.'36 tion from the Country Press Association. - 54.27' 57> 43 8 He assures me that the proprietors 80,672 of the smaller newspapers do not like to get their inks in quantities of 1 cwt., because they use it slowly, and, as it deteriorates, it does not pay them to do so. My information comes not only from BUSINESS. the honourable member for Wimmera, but from individual newspaper proprietors who are entirely disinterested parties, and are technical experts on the question of printing. The honourable member for Wimmera, as he could not be present, has asked me to take up the, case on behalf of the Country. Press Association. As I said last night, the ink for the great TARIFF. newspaper proprietors is admitted at 30 per cent, and 25 per cent., but the small proprietors, who, owing to technical difficulties, have to use more expensive ink, costing from 4d. to 6d. per lb., are subject to duties ranging, from too to 130, and even 200 per cent. One invoice which I have here shows that the landed cost of a consignment of ink was £ 1 8 18s. 6d., that the duty amounted to £ 1 8 4s., tically 100 per cent. I appealed to Treasurer to place all printers' inks common basis by making them subject to the duties proposed in item 355, namely, 30 per cent, and 25 per cent., but clined to accept the suggestion. Various members' on the Government side shook their heads, reminding me very forcibly of force of numbers, to bring about that dis those images which nod when they are touched; but not one was ""game"" to attempt to refute my statements. I have taken some interest in this a matter, and I know, such a thing can be known, that a majority of honourable members saw the justice of the proposition which I advanced, and were prepared to support my proposal. Unfortunately, the settlement of the tion was delayed so late that many honordeclaimed able members had been obliged to pair go away; and when I saw that the vernment were determined to force their proposal through on a minority vote, I got disgusted and marched out of the chamin ber, followed 'by other honourable members.",17
24,Mr WISE,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,After calling for a sion ! It was distinctly against the ing Orders/,18
25,Mr ARCHER,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"As a matter of fact, know very little of the Standing Orders. I man in the chamber. asked that all inks should be placed basis, and was not particular whether duties chosen were ad valorem or fixed. . hope that today the Committee will see that justice is done. Last night I moved that the fixed rate should be omitted, failed, and I also failed in having the reduced to 3d'. I then moved the duty should be 4<i.",18
26,Mr MAUGER,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,And then the honourable member walked out!,18
27,Mr ARCHER,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"Yes , as a protest against the Government attempting to force through an unjust proposal on they knew to be a minority vote.",18
28,Mr FRAZER,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"Kalgoorlie) [3.27] - For the best part of an hour yesterday noon I listened to the Treasurer explaining order ? a difficulty which had arisen in regard to amendments. One portion of the speech was a sermon and another portion peal, and the whole was directed to"" showing that no power would force him to accept differential treatment of newspaper order. proprietors in relation to the duty on news paper. The honourable gentleman declared that all newspapers must be treated alikesmall that there must be no discrimination as and between the large newspaper proprietors or pracand small newspaper proprietors. In the the item now under discussion, however, there on. a is a discrimination, not in favour of the small proprietor, but in favour of the large proprietor; and we have no sermon or aphe depeal, from the honourable gentleman about being forced into a false position. On the contrary, the Treasurer is seeking, by sheer 1 crimination which he so violently denounced yesterday. There is now an opportunity presented to the Government to carry out declared policy of treating all sections of as well as the community alike.",18
29,Mr MCWILLIAMS,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"At any rate, we ought not to favour the larger proprietors.",18
30,Mr FRAZER,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"I am opposed to favourquesing any man. Yesterday the Treasurer in the most magnificent fashion and against the proposal of the honourable memGober for Coolgardie. The honourable member for Barrier assured the Treasurer of his support with a true protectionist's vote order that all the newspaper proprietors might be treated alike; but that offer was divinot deemed satisfactory. It must be Standadmitted that when the Treasurer voted in favour of a duty on news paper, he apI peared to be about the most dissatisfied If the Comon one mittee determine to adopt a fixed in the preference to an ad. valorem duty, II trust that it will be made to apply both to this item and to the next. I am satisfied that a satisfactory ink is being probut duced in Australia, and I am prepared to dutyextend to it a reasonable measure of protection. . But not a tittle of evidence has been forthcoming to warrant us in discriminating in favour of the large newspaper proprietors.",18
31,Mr FULLER,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,I rise to a point of order. I wish to draw attention to the fact that what the honourable member for Melbourne is not at present in the chamber. f h e CHAIRMAN - Does the honourable aftermember think that that is a point of,18
32,Mr FULLER,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"In view of the notice of motion which the honourable member an apfor Melbourne has given, I do.",18
33,The CHAIRMAN,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,It is no point of,18
34,Mr FRAZER,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"I am innocent of the reason which prompted the honourable member for Illawarra to interrupt me. I do not quite appreciate the connection between printing and stencilling inks and the presence of the honourable member for Melbourne in the chamber. Personally, I do not intend in connection with Tariff legislation to discriminate in favour of any section of the community. It appears to me that the Government proposal is a mos't flagrant attempt to confer an advantage upon' the printer who imports ink in large quantities, as against the individual who imports it in small quantities because his needs are small. In view of the magnificent and sustained appeal which the Treasurer made yesterday, when he declared that he was absolutely opposed to anything that might even be considered a discrimination, he should, in common fairness, adopt the principle which he then advocated in respect of this item.  tend to vote in favour of extending equal treatment to every employer engaged in the printing business. A little episode occurred lasf night,' and I wish to say, as a matter of personal explanation, that I . was extremely anxious that nothing should be done which would confer an advantage upon the metropolitan newspaper proprietors, as compared with their country brethren. I believe that in a full Committee the vote would go in favour of the country press. Had a division been taken last evening, however, I am satisfied that it would have gone against the country press.. It was for that reason that I voluntarily left the chamber. I might have been seen walking out of the vestibule arm-in-arm with the honourable member for Capricornia. I absolutely deny the suggestion that I was forcibly detained outside the chamber. In regard to the item immediately under consideration, it is incumbent upon me to do all that I possibly can to prevent Tariff discrimination in favour of the city press. I shall therefore vote for the lowest possible rate of duty.",18
35,Mr TUDOR,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"Yarra) [3.37] - When this item was being discussed this morning, many honourable members were labouring under a riiisapprehension. Indeed, I believe that a majority still imagine that it relates to news printing ink. As a matter of fact, it does not. It relates to printing and stencilling inks, n.e.i., news printing ink being specifically mentioned in the next item. The honourable member for Capricornia has stated that"" printing and stencilling inks can be purchased for 3d. per lb.",19
36,Mr ARCHER,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,I said that the ink used by the large printing firms can. be purchased for that amount.,19
37,Mr TUDOR,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"As a matter of fact, it cannot. The ink with which we are now dealing is known as letterpress ink and lithographic and printing ink, and is used in connection with the better class of printing. - Mr. JOSEPH COOK - It is the ink that is used in country newspaper offices.",19
38,Mr TUDOR,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"The honourable member for South Sydney and the honourable member for Hindmarsh, who are practical printers, declare that that is not the case.",19
39,Mr CROUCH,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"What about the inclusion of the words, "" and in packages of not 0 less than 1 cwt."" in item 355?",19
40,Mr TUDOR,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"The Treasurer has promised to eliminate those words, but I am not sure that in so doing he will be taking a wise step. I hold in my hand the catalogue of an English firm, which quotes the cost of the various classes of ink with which we are now dealing. As regards black letterpress inks, the prices per dozen lbs. run as follow :-Poste r from 4s. to 1.2s., jobbing, from 9s. to 18s., book work from 12s. to 30s., and blueblack from 18s. t.o 60s.",19
41,Mr ARCHER,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,The honourable member is not quoting the prices of news printing ink.,19
42,Mr TUDOR,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"I am quoting the prices or ordinary printing and stencilling inks, which come under this item, whereas news. printing ink comes under the next item. If we take the. other colours of printing ink, which are admitted by every one to be more expensive, we find that the price of red runs from 12s. to 36s. per dozen lbs., blue from 3s. to 7s. 6d. per lb., magenta, maroon, and others from 3s. 6d. to ios. per lb., and cobalt 30s. per lb. The prices of the inks vary, and that is the reason why a differential duty has been proposed. I believe that had this information been known to honourable members generally last night there would not have been a misunderstanding, and we should not now be dealing with the duty on the ink which is used by the newspapers in the electorate of the honourable member for Capricornia. I am just as anxious as any one to safeguard the interests of small country newspapers. I suppose that more country newspapers are printed in my electorate than in anv other, because all the supplements for the country press of Victoria are printed there.",19
43,Mr MCWILLIAMS,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,Is printing or stencilling ink made here?,20
44,Mr TUDOR,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"The better class of ink is made in Melbourne. Within half a mile of this building the honourable .member can procure locally-made ink up to ios. per lb. The colours and the oils are imported, and bear a duty. The proposal of the Government is only fair to the makers of the higher classes of ink. I suggest that the Committee should agree to. the proposal of the Government regarding this item, and deal with the question of news printing ink on the next item.",20
45,Mr MAHON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"Coolgardie) [3-43]-In view of the growth of illustrations the ink industry will expand rapidly. It ought to find occupation for a large number of per-' sons. I was not in the Chamber when the honourable member for Capricornia was speaking, but I understand that he is under the impression that this item deals with the ink used by newspapers.",20
46,Mr ARCHER,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"I can only tell the honourable member that, under this item, proprietors of newspapers are paying a duty equal to ioo per cent, on the ink which they use in printing them.",20
47,Mr WATSON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,They do not use this kind of ink in printing their newspapers.,20
48,Mr MAHON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"A newspaper publishing illustrations, such as those I hold in my hand, would use the. ink which is covered by this item, but not an ordinary newspaper. I hope that the Government will adhere to the duty on these inks, which are fairly expensive and .can be made here. Their manufacture already gives employment to a large number of persons, ancl promises to provide additional employment. There is not - the slightest reason why the duty should be lowered if the Government mean to give any encouragement to the industry.",20
49,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"The member hopes that they will stick to the duty of 6dper lb. on this ink. Mr MAHONf-- I do. as it is not a one man industry, The ink is made in Melbourne, Sydney, ancl other places throughout Australia.",20
50,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,I thought that honourable member did not believe in high duties.,20
51,Mr MAHON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,I do not call this a high duty.,20
52,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,It is over ioo per cent.,20
53,Mr MAHON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,The honourable member is making a mistake.,20
54,Colonel FOXTON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"Not at all. Here is a receipt for the duty, showing that it is equal to 98 per cent, on the value of the article.",20
55,Mr MAHON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,That may be for an inferior class of ink. <,20
56,Colonel FOXTON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,That duty was paid on the ink used in printing the Rockhampton Bulletin.,20
57,Mr MAHON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"Everythin g that is used in Queensland must, apparently, be allowed to come in at a low duty.",20
58,Mr ARCHER,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"The point is that, with the exception of writing ink, any ink costing over 3d. per lb., no matter whether it be printing, news printing, or other sort of ink', will come in under item 354 ",20
59,Mr MAHON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,All the Inks to which the honourable member refers are expensive.,20
60,Mr ARCHER,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,Some of them cost over 3d. per lb.,20
61,Mr MAHON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"The duty is not excessive. As one who knows something about this business, I urge the Government to stick to this duty.",20
62,Mr WILS ON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"Corangamite) [3.46I Unfortunately, I was not present this morning when that regrettable incident took place which prevented this item from being dealt with. As I had been travelling all day, I paired with the honourable member for Moreton, and went home. I understood at the time that he was in favour of allowing ink to come in at a lower rate, but whether he meant the ink covered by this item, or the ink covered by the next item, I cannot sav definitely. It is certain, however, that the proprietor of a small newspaper has had to pav a duty equal to 1.00 per cent, on the ink which he has imported under item 355, and which has cost him more than 3d. per lb. There is no getting away from that fact. honourable Mr MCDOUGALL - But , according to the honourable member's argument, the duty is always passed on to the consumer.",20
63,Mr WILSON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"The honourable member ought to have sense enough to know that in the case of newspapers a duty cannot be passed on, except, perhaps, to the adverthe tiser. . The reader certainly cannot be charged i j d . for a penny newspaper. I know that the honourable member is an authority on some questions connected with newspapers. For instance, hehas published a series of his verses in the newspapers.  them.",20
64,Mr WATSON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"They were very .good verses, anyhow.",21

66,The CHAIRMAN,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,Will the honourable member address his remarks to the item?,21
67,Mr WILSON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"I submit, sir, that my remarks are entirely relevant, because item deals generally with the question of stage. printing ink, and, incidentally, with ink slinging. Of course, the particular ink that is ""slung"" when one is writing prose or verse is a. writing ink.  should try his hand with it. , Mr WILSON - Some day I may present write an ode to the honourable member for M!aranoa.

68,Mr WILSON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"But I trust that the honourable member will have gone to his last resting-place before I do. Otherwise my verses would soon drive him there. think that the Treasurer ought to allow the item to be recommitted in order that the Committee may be able to express an opinion as to whether the duties of 6Jd. news ink. and 6d. per lb. should not be left out' with a view to - fixing an ad valorem duty. The Minister might very well agree to valorem duties of 30 and 25 per ought to know. cent. Does he want' to impose a duty amounting to 100 per cent, upon that is used by newspaper proprietors small country towns? A letter in session proves that a man in a country town - has actually paid duty amounting to 100 papers stereo. per cent. I presume that he did not imtype. port ink to drink it. He bought it to use in his office. This and the next those who use ink at under 3d. per lb. at a decided advantage as compared with those who use ink at over 3d. If the Treasurer will allow the item to be recommitted, ever ad valorem duty is imposed by the Committee we will willingly accept. f h e CHAIRMAN - The Committee has - already decided to leave in the words which the honourable member desires to struck out.",21

70,The CHAIRMAN,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,The honourable member must not discuss that point.,21
71,Mr WILSON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,The item was not dealt with when there were a sufficient number honourable members present to decide the duty properly. I wish to secure an opportunity for a full Committee to express an the opinion as to whether a fixed or an ad valorem duty should be imposed. With that object I wish to move that the item be recommitted.,21
72,The CHAIRMAN,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,The honourable the member cannot move to that effect at this,21
73,Mr WATSON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"South Sydney) [3.54] kind ot There has been a good deal of talk amongst honourable members about placing small and large newspapers on the It appears to me that remarks of .that character in relation to the item indicate a false assumption. Whether the duty should be 6d. per lb. or 30 and 25 per cent, ad valorem is a question quite apart from the assumption that the duty as proposed differentiates between small and large newspapers. It does nothing of the sort. News printing ink, wheI ther used on a rotary machine by the proprietor of a large newspaper, or on a Wharfdale machine by the proprietor of a small newspaper,'is just the same class of",21
74,Mr MCWILLIAMS,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"It is possible to use a lower quality of ink on stereo than on ad straight type, as the honourable member",21
75,Mr WATSON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"As long as it is emink ployed on a letterpress machine, the same in class of ink can be used for the printing my posof a small or a large newspaper.",21
76,Mr MCWILLIAMS,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,All the large newsThey do not print from,21
77,Mr WATSON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,That does not make item place any essential difference.,21
78,Mr MCWILLIAMS,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,Yes ; it does.,21
79,Mr WATSON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"When I speak of letterpress, I mean the term to include stereotype whatmatter. Of course, in jobbing work, and in printing illustrations, a better class of ink must be used, as well as a better class of paper, whilst there must be more careful machining. It is impossible to work, at the have same speed when doing such work as the illustrated portion of the Australasian or the Sydney Mail, or in printing a newspaper like the Bulletin, as in printing an Good ink must be used, and there must be careful machining. But a country newspaper and a city newspaper can use the same class of ink for letterpress work. The universal practice of thp proprietors of country newspapers, so of far as my knowledge of their methods goes, is to order their ink from one or other of the printers' furnishing houses like Cowan and Company, or Wimble, who import in large quantities. The newspaper proprietors do not import directly, but buy their ink as they want it. It is not worth their while to import. In fact, it is only the largest newspaper proprietors who bother to import, directly.",21
80,Mr MCWILLIAMS,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,The honourable member knows that the duty will be passed on to the man who buys.,22
81,Mr WATSON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"Quite so; I am quite aware of that. But so far as the question of the packages is concerned, the rate at which the small newspaper men will get their ink will not be affected.",22
82,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"Why we have a duty amounting to 150 per cent, for the cheaper ink, and only 25 per cent, for expensive ink?",22
83,Mr WATSON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"The honourable member has put the case in the wrong way. The lower duty is on the cheap ink, that is merely used for newspaper purposes; but the superior class of ink is used for jobbing and for printing illustrations and special work. Inks must be over a certain value before the extra duty is imposed.",22
84,Mr WILSON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,Thirt y people at least have had to pay 6d. per lb. on ink costing 3d. per lb.,22
85,Mr WATSON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,Jus t so ,22
86,Mr ARCHER,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,For newspaper purposes.,22
87,Mr WATSON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"I have not heard of a newspaper proprietor who pays 3d. per lb. for newspaper ink. They may use it for jobbing purposes, but for newspaper purposes, I have not heard of such a case.",22
88,Mr WILSON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,I can prove it to the honourable member.,22
89,Mr WATSON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,I should say that the honourable member's friend is a very foolish man if he uses ink at 3d. per lb. for that purpose.,22
90,Mr MCWILLIAMS,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,The honourable membei for Yarra quoted a case.,22
91,Mr WATSON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,That was in relation to special ink for jobbing purposes.,22
92,Mr FRAZER,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"If we can make the pensive inks in Australia, can we nof make the cheaper classes?",22
93,Mr WATSON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"We might be able to do so, but not very readily. printing ink. in order to be dutiable at the lower rate, must be invoiced at less - than 3d. per lb. in the country of origin, and since it is sold in Melbourne and Sydney at 3^d. per lb. after payment of freight and other charges, it should not be difficult to import it at less than 3dper lb.",22
94,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"This duty is 6d. per lb., not 6d. per cwt.",22
95,Mr WATSON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"That is so; but someprinting inks are very expensive, and it would be an easy matter to deceive 1 heCustoms Department as to their value. Manufacturers of ink in Australia, of whom tliere is quite a number, have to pay a fairly heavy duty on some, at all events, of their raw material.",22
96,Mr ARCHER,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"They have not to pay a. duty of 100 per cent.,, like that imposed upon this ink.",22
97,Mr WATSON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,It is not 100 pershould cent. ',22
98,Mr ARCHER,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,I shall prove that the duty is more than 100 per cent.,22
99,Mr WATSON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"I preferto be guided by my own knowledge of the trade, rather than by any statement on the part of"" others. Ink used for news printing purposes will come in under item 355.",22
100,Mr ARCHER,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,That is a mere assertion.,22
101,Mr WATSON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"I happen to know a little about the printing trade, and I have no hesitation in making' this statement. Printing ink manufacturers in Australia! have to pay a duty of 6d. per gallon on Jinseed o i l , which at present is not being: produced in any quantity in Australia.",22
102,Mr ARCHER,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"We do not grudge therm a duty of 30 per cent, and 25 per cent, on the finished article.",22
103,Mr WATSON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"I do not think that those duties are suflicient in the case of thebetter classes of ink. The possibility of"" arranging invoices is such that printinginks have been known to come in at rates; far below their true value. The statement that this proposal will be an unfairhandicap on country newspapers is utterly without foundation. I do not care very much whether a fair ad valorem or a fixed' duty is carried, but I do nof think that a. duty of 25 per cent, will be sufficient. ex- Mr SPENCE (Darling) [4.5]. - I feel' confident that had the Government in framing the Tariff put all inks in the oneitem, the position would have been difNews ferent. There would 'certainly have beena great hubbub raised outside, for there is a very distinct difference between inks: used even for the rougher classes of jobprinting and ordinary news printing ink. It would appear that the honourable member for Corangamite has a friend who has been buying high-class job printing ink.",22
104,Mr WILSON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,No ; he purchased ink for printing a newspaper.,23
105,Mr SPENCE,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,Apparentl y he has purchased for that purpose ink generally used for job printing. I do not know why we should disarrange the Tariff because some one has been so foolish as to use high-class job printing inks for newspaper printing purposes.,23
106,Mr ARCHER,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,Did not the member say last night that it would be just to impose a level duty?,23
107,Mr SPENCE,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"I supported the imposition of a fixed as well as an ad valorem duty, saying that the Customs officers could not determine the true value of printing inks. There are some inks which even an amateur would recognise as being of high quality, and to those the ad valorem duty, as being the higher of the two duties, would apply. - Mr. JOSEPH COOK - If that is the whole trouble, let us try a lower instead of a higher duty.",23
108,Mr SPENCE,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,I .understand that the fixed duty has been passecl.,23
109,Mr WILSON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,No .,23
110,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,It was decided last night that there should be a fixed duty.,23
111,Mr ARCHER,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,On a minority division.,23
112,Mr SPENCE,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,Then I hope the Treasurer will stand by his proposal. It is asserted on the very best authority-and I think that the statement will be supported by officers of the Department-that it is difficult to assess the true value of job printing inks.,23
113,Mr ARCHER,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,I understand that the Customs officers deny the statement. Has the honourable member obtained his information from the Department?,23
114,Mr SPENCE,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,No ; but I think it will be borne out by the Department. It is necessary to have a fixed duty to keep out the cheap rubbish.,23
115,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,The honourable member does not seem to recognise that the Government propose an ad valorem duty on both items.,23
116,Mr SPENCE,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"I am supporting the line as it stands. These inks-will be subject to an ad valorem duty as well as a fixed duty, and whichever is the higher duty will have to be paid. Printing ink of first class quality is being made in the Commonwealth, and we should give the manufacturers the' protection that other industries have secured. member for South Sydney has clearly shown that news printing ink is altogether the different from that used for job printing purposes; and I fail to see how 'the Tariff could have been better framed to give full consideration to all parties concerned. There is nothing to complain about. It may be that some one has been called upon to pay duty under the wrong item-that some one has paid the higher duty on news ink-bu t such a mistake is honourable not likely to be made very often.",23
117,Mr ARCHER,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"Nevertheless , it is done.",23
118,Mr SPENCE,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"The honourable member seems to know of a case, but I do not think that any one else does. Most practical printers will say that these two inks are used for different kinds of work. Printing ink made locally does good work. I know an establishment where tons of Australian ink are used, and it gives every satisfaction.",23
119,Mr STORRER,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"Bass) [4.12] - As we had a long discussion on the subject of inks at the last sitting, and honourable members seem to have pretty well made up their minds, I hope that the debate will not be prolonged. The Minister has agreed to omit the limitation regarding packages ot not less than 1 cwt., and he is also inclined to accept a compromise which I suggested, making the duties sd. and 4 j d . per lb. I shall vote for those rates.",23
120,Mr MAHON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"Coolgardie) [4.13] - I have a suggestion to make which, if adopted, will, I think, meet the case put by the honourable member for Capricornia and others. It is to substitute the figure 6dfor the figure 3d. in item 355.",23
121,Mr ARCHER,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,Why not impose the same duty on all printing inks ?,23
122,Mr MAHON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"I am going more than half way to meet the honourable member. He complains that certain ink is dutiable under item 354 at over 100 per cent, ad valorem, but if the alteration which I suggest is made) such ink will be dutiable as news printing ink invoiced at .under 6d. per lb. The proposed alteration should be acceptable to all parties.",23
123,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"Parramatta) [4.15] - I think that the suggestion of the honourable member for Coolgardie does not meet the difficulty. It assumes that items 354 and 355 deal only with such printing inks as are used for country newspapers. Does the honourable member propose the omission of the words "" and in packages The honourable of not less than 1 cwt."" ? - Mr CROUCH - The Minister has agreed to the omission of those words.",23
124,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"Notwithstand ing what has been said by the honourable members for South Sydney and Coolgardie, one of whom was formerly engaged in the setting of type, and the other in reporting for newspapers, those whose business it is to sell ink take a different view. A well known firm, which deals largely in this commodity, has written to me on the subject in these termsPlease bear in mind that all inks used by the larger newspapers come out in big casks, varying from 3 cwt. to 4 cwt., and it is really a different kind of ink to that used by the smaller newspapers; it is what is called Rotary Ink, and is used for printing newspapers on the big rotary machines-altogethe r different to that used by the smaller newspapers on their flat-bed machines. The majority of the newspapers in Australia use the stiffer ink, and it is invariably sold lo them in tins varying from 12 lbs. up to i cwt. tins or packages. smaller newspapers could not take large packages because it would take them so long a time to use it up, and dust and dirt gets into the ink and spoils it-henc e their reason for getting the small packages. The average price the smaller newspapers pay for their ink is over 3d. Under the proposed item they would have' to pay-accordin g to my reading of this item- a duty of 6d. per lb. for British-made ink. Assuming, therefore, they are paying 4d. per lb. now for their ink, it would cost them to use this British-made ink gd. to iod. per lb.",24
125,Mr CROUCH,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,Does not that letter speak of the average price of ink as 4d. per lb. ? it was imported from.,24
126,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,Betwee n 3d. the and 4d. per lb.,24
127,Mr CROUCH,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,Then the proposed amendment would meet the firm,24
128,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"The firm in question desires that the ink which we are now considering shall be reduced in duty, so that the country newspapers may not have to pay too highly for it . They cannot use the inferior ink which is used in connection with the large rotary machines in the offices of the big metropolitan dailies. I hope that the duty will be reduced. Mr ARCHER ""(Capricornia) [4.20] We have had a great deal of what is assumed to be expert evidence from certain members of the Committee who have been connected with the printing trade. not know in what capacity they were connected with it , but admittedly some of them have not been connected with the trade for many vears, and it is quite possible that important changes mav have taken place in the meantime. However that may be, have facts to bring before the Committee which absolutely refute many of the statements that have been made. The proprietors of a certain newspaper-and though I have authority to do so I need not mention the name unless honourable members desire it-hav e in bond 2,000 lbs. of ink invoiced at 3d. per lb., of which they have not yet been able to get possession because of this duty of 6Jd. per lb., which is equivalent to an impost of 213 per cent. I ask 'the Minister to say whether that statement is not a fact. Sir WILLIAM LYNE ' - I do not know. I never heard of it.",24
129,Mr MAHON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,I should say that it is an error.,24
130,Mr ARCHER,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,I can say that it is a fact.,24
131,Mr WATSON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,How can the honourable member say for what purpose the ink referred to is to be used? The Mr ARCHER - It is intended to be used for the printing of the War-Cry.,24
132,Mr WATSON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,-The proprietors of the War-Cry do a lot of jobbing printing.,24
133,Mr ARCHER,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,I think I can take the word of the people-who imported the ink as to the purpose for which it was imported. - Mr Mauger - They should use ink made in Australia.,24
134,Mr CROUCH,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"Is it imported from Japan, or where?",24
135,Mr ARCHER,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"I do nof know where It is what is called "" news "" quality Of ink, and I should like to ask the honourable member for South Sydney to say whether that is not the quality of ' in k commonly used for the printconcerned ? ing of newspapers.",24
136,Mr WATSON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"Yes , it is. "" Mr ARCHER - This ink is invoiced at 3d. per lb., and those who have imported it cannot get it out of bond unless they pay a duty of 6 j d . per lb. on it - That fact completely justifies the stand honourable members on this side have taken in this matter. I know the proprietors of other newspapers complain that they cannot set the ink they require without paying a duty equivalent to anything from 100 per cent, up to 250 per cent. That is a gross injustice, but I have little hope that the MinI do ister will be prepared to recommit the item.",24
137,Mr CROUCH,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,The proposed amendment will meet the honourable member's objection.,24
138,Mr ARCHER,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"It might to a certain I extent, but in the first place I say that the duties are too high; in the next place I do not believe in fixed duties at all ; and in the third place, if we are to do anything in this matter, we should in the next item strike out the weight limit, which I understand the Minister said last night he was prepared to do.",24
139,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,I was prepared to do that last night.,25
140,Mr ARCHER,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"It is only the proprietors of very big newspapers who can afford to import this ink in large quantities, cause if it has to be kept for any length of time it deteriorates in value. mentioned a fact which cannot be disputed - that an ink imported for the purpose printing a newspaper cannot be got out bond except on the payment of duty repretaken senting 233 per cent, on the invoice price.",25
141,Mr HUTCHISON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,Hindmarsh) [4.25]. - The matter referred to by the honourable member for Capricornia has no bearing upon the first item. But I should say that I think no great hardship is done to the proprietors of the War-Cry when it remembered that they might have procured the ink they require right on the spot.,25
142,Mr CHANTER,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,The subscribers to their newspaper are here.,25
143,Mr HUTCHISON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"That is so. I shall be very glad if in the future, as a result of the duty, they are obliged to look inside the Commonwealth for their ink as well as for their pennies. That would be only a fair thing, and, in fact, it is the whole purpose of the duty to bring that state of affairs about - Those who say that the more highly-priced inks are required for the printing of country newspapers know nothing about the business.",25
144,Mr ARCHER,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"That is a silly, wild, statement to make.",25
145,Mr HUTCHISON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,I have been contoms nected with the printing trade for over thirty-five years; and as an employer i the trade for many years I have used a good deal of Australian ink.,25
146,Mr ARCHER,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"The men who are importis. ing ink have also been in the trade f o thirty-five years, and are in it still.",25
147,Mr HUTCHISON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"I have used ink turers sufficient protection. imported from the Old Country, and have also used Wimble's inks. found Wimble's cheap inks good enough for the printing of newspapers, and equal to what I could get abroad for the same purpose. I was not, of course, in a big way of business, and if I required a small do that. quantity of ink of a certain quality I had to pay a little more for it ; but the nary news ink is imported in large quantities even by small printing concerns. It would be absurd to use a first-class ink for the printing of a newspaper.",25
148,Mr MCWILUAMS,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"Would the honourable member use the same ink on a stereo., that is used only onoe, as on type that is used for over twelve months?",25
149,Mr HUTCHISON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,Ver y often.,25
150,Mr MCWILLIAMS,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"Then the honourable bemember does not know much about the business, no matter how long he has been I have in the trade.",25
151,Mr HUTCHISON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"We could not of expect good work with cheap ink on poor of paper - The quality of the paper must be into account; and good rolled paper would be required on which to produce illustrations effectively. I should be inclined to favour the amendment of the honourable member for Coolgardie; but I like to think the recommendation of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission, is 6d. per Ib., or 25 per cent., whichever is higher, is a reasonable one. There are extraordinary variations in the prices of inks. I have here a price-list from T . Bigsby and Son, of London, in which quotations are given for what purports to be first-class coloured inks. I find that ultramarine blue is> quoted at ts. for letterpress ink and is. 6d. for .lithograph ink. I maintain that that is pure dumping. I have here also the price-list of Slater and Palmer, of London, which was referred to by the honourable member for Yarra. Their price for ultramarine blue is 5s. for letterpress ink, and 6s. for lithograph ink of the best quality. They quote prices for another quality of ink of the same shade - letterpres s 3s. 6d., lithograph 4s. 6d. per lb. I can defy, not merely any Cusofficer, but any printer or even any ink manufacturer, to tell me, on seeing n printing done by a first-class printer on first-class paper with a first-class machine, whether the price of the ink used was 6d., 3s. 6d., or 4s. 6d. per lb. We r can produce all the inks Ave require in Australia if we give our local manufacI am sorry I that the recommendation of the Tariff I have Commission was not adopted. I think in the circumstances it would be better to leave this item as it stands, and to fix the duties on the next item at 5d. and 4^d.",25

I think it is my duty to stand by the duties as proposed, and to carry them or duties as nearly their equivalent as possible. I admit that those who have been nearly all their lives intimately connected with the working of newspapers should know something about what is necessary.

160,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"I should not like to say that. As I have, never had much struck out. to do with ink-slinging, I do not profess to understand the technical nected with this question. But I could not accept the proposal made last night, it. as it would involve practically the remission of the duty altogether.",26
161,Mr ARCHER,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,Eve n though the Departhonorable ment had no objection.,26
162,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"I do not know whether the officers of the Department had any objection to the proposal last night or not. I had to Be guided by the Tariff ister to speak. before me;. and although the honourable member might have thought there was something personal in what happened, a matter of fact it was not so, and I merely standing by the duty proposed the Government on recommendations made by experts. I am, however, glad to-heard the debate today, and am quite prepared to accept suggestions from those who know something of the subject.",26
163,Mr ARCHER,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"That ""is why we wished' have the matter postponed until today.",26
164,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"That was not the reason which actuated honourable members-; but I have no wish to refer to last night's proceedings when to do so might give rise to heated feeling. There must be a mistake somewhere, because the honourable member for Capricornia has stated several times that the Rochhanvpton Bulletin purchases this high-class ink for its ordinary printing, whereas I am advised that it is used for only very high class work. The magnificent work in a little catalogue which I held in my hand just now-on e of the best I ever sawwas done with very high-class ink. Honourable members who have expert knowledge of this matter assure me that if I amend the next item by raising the invoice value mentioned in it from 3d. to 6d. per lb., it ought to obviate all the objection that , no. has been taken to this item.",26
165,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"No , it will",26
166,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"At any rate, I in am quite prepared to take that course. the The honourable member for Capricornia must not imagine that I desire to injure or interfere with country neAvspapers, but all the information that I have from experts is that my proposal would not ha.\'e",26

171,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"I was anxious to get to the end of this division, and as therefore did not sav much. No matter was what I said, the honourable member would by have argued that I was wrong. He. must admit that the honourable members for ha/se South Sydney, Hindmarsh, and Coolgardie, who bave spoken today, know Avhat they are talking about. They all support the duty which has been proposed to by the Government, and recommended by the Tariff Commission.",26
172,Mr ARCHER,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,Wit h the alteration of the invoice value in the next item from 3d. to 6d.?,27
173,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"Yes . I hope the debate will not be greatly prolonged. I shall be quite prepared when we reach the next item to do what I have said. I ask honourable members to allow this item to pass, because we have a great deal of work to do. If honourable members will make reasonable progress I have no desire to keep the House sitting until the small hours of the morning. It is not a good thing to do, but I have been forced into that position in order to get a certain amount of work done. If the work is got through, I want the House to rise at a reasonably early hour to-night, meet tomorrow, and probably finish the whole Tariff, because we are near the end of it. With a solid determination on the part of honourable members to achieve that result, I think we can do it without sitting into the small hours. I have here a letter from Messrs. R.

That, shows that extraordinary prices are not charged for news ink, aiid that those newspapers are using the Colonial article in preference to the imported. It also proves that country newspapers, if they so desire, can get their news ink made here instead of purchasing the imported. I only received that letter this morning, and I quote it because it shows that the ink is being made here, and is used exclusively by a number of country newspapers.",27
174,Mr WILKS,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,The same firm complain about the tax on the raw material.,27
175,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,I believe-they do. I understand that the tax on the raw material checks to some extent the profitable local manufacture of news ink.,27
176,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"North Sydney) [4.42]--Whil e the Minister is adjusting- I believe fairly satisfactorilyitem 355, he is still retaining excessive duties on this item. I believe that what the Minister proposes .to do regarding news printing ink will be sufficient. . Sir WILLIAM LYNE - If the newspaper proprietors choose, they can get a good deal of printing ink under the next item as news printing ink.",27
177,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"No , because it must be news printing ink.",27
178,Mr FISHER,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,If it is invoiced for job printing it will be charged 6£d. a lb. What an imposition !,27
179,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"The honourable member for Coolgardie says that news printing ink cannot be distinguished from other printing inks. I will accept him as an authority, but we have to deal with the Tariff as it stands.",27
180,Mr MAHON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"The word ""news"" ought to come out of the next item. I shall move accordingly.",27
181,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"My objection to the duty of 6Jd. proposed by the Minister on this item is that, as a large proportion of the inks come in at between od. and is. per lb., it will be over ioo per cent, on the 6d. inks, while it will be over 50 per cent, on the is. inks. Those are exceedingly high duties.",27
182,Mr FISHER,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,Where is the justification for the composite duty proposed?,27
183,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"There should not be a composite duty. The Minister said himself that he did' not like them, and we have struck them, out so far.",27
184,Mr MAHON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"How would the honourable member meet the difficulty that the Customs officer could not tell the value of the ink, and could not check the invoice, whether it was a. is. or 6d. ink?",27
185,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"That remark raises a difficulty as against ad"" valorem rates. I believe the Department can check the invoices in this as well as they can in other cases.",27
186,Mr FISHER,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,They can do it as easily as in the case of the quantity of wool in certain goods.,27
187,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"If that difficulty arises with ad valorem rates, we are thrown back on to fixed rates, but both ad valorem and fixed rates are proposed by the Government in this item. The Department have first of all to charge the fixed duty, and then have to make its applicationsubject to a value which they have to check; Then they have to submit the importation to another assessment-a valorem-for every i d . per lb. upwards. Consequently, they must use the ad valorem system. While I object to the alternative duty, my principal objection to the item is the excessive rates which I have pointed out. I shall support the amende ment .to make the duty 4d. per lb., which even then will mean 66§ per. cent, on 6d. inks, and 33J per cent, on is. inks.",27
188,Mr MAHON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,Would it not be better to : go straight for ad valorem duties ?,28
189,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"I think so, but we cannot do .so now after the tangle we got into this morning, when a motion to that effect was rejected.",28
190,Mr CARR,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"Macquarie) [4.49]--The local ink is, in most cases, from my own experience, better than the imported at the price. So far as higher-class inks are concerned, we can get the locally-made article at a lower price than the imported, and of equal value, while it has the distinct advantage that there is no deterioration. There is no surface caking, as the' ink is got fresh from the mixer. We are justified, from every point of view, in imposing a duty on imported inks. There is very little risk of undue advantage being taken of the duties proposed, because there are several firms engaged in the manufacture of ink locally. I have it on the authority of at least one manufacturer in Sydney, that-he is well satisfied with the present duties, without increasing prices, as he can now retain his present market.",28
191,Mr FISHER,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"Wide Bay) [4-51]-Nothing could be more satisfactory than the statement by the honourable member for Macquarie, that the inks made here are of good quality, and a credit to Australia. The point is, however, that a' composite duty may penalize certain, inks. An ad valorem duty would have been much more acceptable. As to the Customs officers discovering whether high-quality inks are introduced at the lower rate, there will be no more difficulty than there is in discovering whether cotton goods are being brought in as woollen goods - In either case, the services of an analyst has to be obtained.",28
192,Mr CARR,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,-The higher quality inks are nearly always done up in small packets.,28
193,Mr FISHER,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"That is so. I have both seen and purchased them. The honourable member for Coolgardie intends to move an amendment to omit the word "" news,"" and that is quite proper, because so long as it remains we can do nothing; d the inks must be described as job printing, and so forth, of certain colours and qualities. In my opinion a composite duty is mischievous, and always leads to trouble.",28
194,Sir JOHN QUICK,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"Bendigo) [4.53] I have listened to the arguments on both sides very carefully, and, I hope, with a fair and open mind; and I have not heard the scheme of duties submitted by the Commission successfully challenged 'up to the present, except in one cletail. This was referred to by the honourable member for Coolgardie, who has proposed to increase the invoiced amount in item 355 from '3d. to 6d. That amendment will, I think, enlarge the area of the ad valorem rate, and meet most of the difficulties suggested. I should like to point out to the honourable member for Wide Bay that the fixed duty, or arl ad valorem duty, whichever is the higher, cannot be described as a composite duty in the accepted sense of the word. A composite duty is a combination of dutiesthat is a duty, plus a duty-wherea s the duty under discussion is an alternative duty, which is justified in certain cases. The higher fixed duty of 6d. per lb. is intended to operate on'low-grade inks which it might be difficult to analyze and classify, ancl which, must cause the Customs officers difficulty in checking. A firm generally includes in its orders various grades of ink, low grade, medium, and high grade; and the evidence given before the Commission shows that the average price is about 2s. 66. per lb. The fixed duty of 6d. is intended to operate on the average as represented by the 2s. 66. per l b . ; and it is not fair to say that it will mean 100 per cent. The ad valorem duty is intended to operate when the inks are above the average I have just mentioned. The fixed duty of 66. per lb. might be infinitesimal in the case of high-class inks, worth from 5s. to 6s. per lb.",28
195,Mr ARCHER,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"Is it not a fact that 75 per cent, or 80 per cent, of the inks used are of the lower value?",28
196,Sir JOHN QUICK,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"Not in reference to the item in which the fixed duty is imposed, and which is intended to cover the superior grades of ink. The lower classes of ink averaging from-3d. to 5d. per lb. are brought uncier the ad valorem rate in item 355. The portion of the report of the Commission having reference to this matter, may be found on page 322 of volume 6, and is based on the evidence of Mr R. Collie, the Melbourne manufacturer, whose proposals were supported by a Sydney manufacturer. The Tariff Commission considered that those proposals embodied a fair and reasonable scheme, which distributes over various grades of inks a certain incidence of taxation according to quality and value. If we had a common standard it would be complained that we were taxing the poor and cheap inks as highly as the superior inks. So far as I am concerned', I have not received any complaint from printers in my electorate about the duties, and I believe that the great fuss and noise is being made, not by printers,' but by the Melbourne importers.",28

Question so resolved in the Amendment of the amendment negatived. . Mr WILSON (Corangamite) [5.29] There seems to have been a mysterious misunderstanding when the last division was taken. Many honourable members were not aware of what the actual question was, pr what the effect of their vote would be. The honourable member for Coolgardie wants to bring all printing ink invoiced at 6d. and under per lb. under an ad valorem duty of 30 or 25 per cent., according to the country of origin, so that all European or American inks invoiced at 6Jd. per lb. would have to pay a duty equal to 100 per cent.",30
202,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,No .,31
203,Mr WILSON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"The ""Treasurer cannot get away from that fact. If ink is invoiced at 6£d. per lb. in Europe or America, and the duty is fixed at 6Jd. per lb. in Ihe general Tariff, it will be taxed at the rate of 100 per cent.",31
204,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,That is when it is invoiced at over 6d. per lb. AYES. Mr WILSON - Does the honourable gentleman admit that the duty will be squal to 100 per cent. ?,31
205,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,I do not say that it is 100 per cent.; but the ink would have to pay the fixed duty.,31
206,Mr WILSON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"If the ink is invoiced at 6|d. per lb., and the' duty is 6£d. per lb., what is the rate per cent. ? Honourable members who voted on the other side in the recent division voted for a duty of 100 per cent. For instance, the honourable member for Swan, who is supposed to be in favour of moderate duties, the honourable member for Echuca, the honourable member - for Balaclava, the honourable member for Kooyong, and the honourable member for NOES. Fremantle, voted for a duty of 100 per cent, on this article.",31
207,Sir JOHN FORREST,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,The honourable member should not abuse his friends.,31
208,Mr WILSON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,I want to show the honourable member what he has been doing.,31

210,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,STATE OF NEW SOUTH, The honourable member is PAIRS. not in order in discussing at length the votes of honourable members in the recent division.,31
211,Mr WILSON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,I want those honourable members to realise that they have done a very serious thing.,31
212,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,That has nothing to do with the proposal affirmative - now before the Committee.,31
213,Mr WILSON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"I intend to move that the amendment of the honourable member for Coolgardie be amended by substituting the figure "" 9 "" for the figure"""" 6.""",31
214,Mr WISE,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,I rise to a point of order. Has not the Committee decided that the rate 6d. per lb. shall stand?,31
215,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"-It is not competent for the honourable, member for Corangamite to move that the invoiced rate be 9d., as the Committee has. decided that 6d. shall s'tand part of, the item.",31
216,Mr WILSON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"My belief was that it was competent in Committee for an honourable member to move a higher figure than that decided upon. With all respect to you, sir, I should like to know whether there is no way of moving to that effect ?",31
217,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,The honourable member has no opportunity of proposing the omission of a figure which the Committee has determined shall stand.,31
218,Mr WILSON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,That puts honourable members who want to vote for an increased „ invoice rate in a very awkward position. The matter is one of considerable importance.,31
219,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,- I cannot allow anv discussion on the point.,32
220,Mr WILSON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"If the decision' of the Committee is irrevocable I suppose I can do nothing, but I had a great desire to increase the invoice rate under this item and so reduce the duty, which will be a very heavy impost on those who are using printing inks in .the country districts. 1",32
221,Mr WYNNE,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"Balaclava) [5.37] - The - honourable member for Corangamite has referred to a certain vote given by me. What I voted for was to assist newspaper proprietors in the country districts. advised that if we made the invoice standard 3d. per lb., as the printers of small papers in the country do not import in bulk, they would have to pay a higher rate of duty. I understand that the amendment of the honourable member for Coolgardie raising the exemption from 3d. to 6d. allows printers of country newspapers to get their material in at the same rate of duty as is paid by the proprietors of the large newspapers in the big centres. That is what I voted for. I did not vote for anything like 100 per cent, but to reduce charges in favour of those who are not able to carrv on their business on the large scale on which businesses are conducted by persons in the populous centres. Amendment agreed to; words "" 6d. and under"" inserted. Amendment (by Mr Mahon) agreed toThat the words "" and in packages of not than 1 cwt."" be left out. Item, as amended, agreed to.

Stay paper and stay cloth are cut in Australia. It has been ascertained, however, that in order to defeat the object of this duty-the encouragement of the local industry-sta y paper cut just a shade over an inch in width is being imported, and escapes the duty. To meet that attempt to evade the duty we propose to make dutiable all stay paper up to 2 inches in width. Mr TILLE Y BROWN (Indi) [6.3] In this case we have an enormous jump. Under the old Tariff the item was free, and the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission also recommended that it should be free.",33
241,Mr SALMON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,What was the recommendation of the free-trade section of the Tariff Commission?,34
242,Mr TILLEY BROWN,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"We have been told over and over again that no reliance can be placed in the comparative tables placed before us so far as the statements regarding the recommendation of the free trade section of the Commission are concerned. I do not know why misleading information should be supplied, but I am not prepared to have too much faith in the honesty of some honourable members who are whirling this Tariff through the House. We should have some explanation of the Minister's action in proposing a duty of 30 per cent., when this material was free under the old Tariff, and the recommendation of the Tariff Commission was that it should remain free.",34
243,Mr JH CATTS,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"Cook) [6.6] - I wish to move to make the item free. I have samples of the article here, which I ask the Minister to look at. It is used for binding in the making of paper boxes, and is not made in Australia.",34
244,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,My expert advisers inform me that it is made in both Melbourne and Sydney.,34
245,Mr JH CATTS,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"It ismade chiefly by the Stein Machine Company; those who make the machines manufacture the paper and cloth as well, which, I am told by persons in the trade, are not made in Australia. The samples which I produce are from Mr Firth's card-board factory in Sydney, and were imported. The Minister proposes to put a duty only on stay cloth cut to a width of. not more than 2 inches, which I tak- it would allow it to be imported in bulk free.",34
246,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"Trea surer) [6.9] - It is proposed to make stay cloth of not more thsn 2 inches in width dutiable because hitherto an attempt has been made to evade the duty by making it a little over an inch in width. However, as the item is not an important one, and I do not wish to waste time in connection with its discussion, I shall be willing to agree to a duty of 5 per cent, in the general Tariff, making the article free if imported from Great Britain.",34
247,Mr JH CATTS,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,It should be free wherever it may come from.,34

258,Mr LIDDE LL,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"Hunter) [6.19] - It seems to me that probably leatherette was used in the boots shown by the honourable member for Batman the other night It seems the sort of material that could be used to imitate leather, or alligator skin, in which case the honourable member for Lang should know something about it. As, according to the Treasurer,' the effect of admitting an article free is to make it expensive, I shall vote for the amendment.  honourable member for Batman will not, on this occasion, defend the Victorian manufacturers of boots, I must do so.' I can assure the honourable member for Hunter that boots made in Victoria are not made of leatherette, but of leather. Amendment agreed to. Item, as amended, agreed to. Item 368.

I am advised that that would not affect any printing industry in the Commonwealth.

263,Mr MCWILLIAMS,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,Do we produce coloured supplements without some letterpress on them ?,35
264,Mr WATSON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"The lettering can be done either before or after they are imported. Usually the only letterpress on the supplements are the word's at the head of the sheet, "" Supplement to "" such and such a journal, with the title of the picture underneath. Some very fine supplements are being produced in Australia ""today; and I do not see why we should not encourage the artistic sense in the community. The Town and Country Journal and the Sydney Mail, for instance, usually issue a coloured Christmas supplement, and these are produced in Australia. If we decided that such coloured supplements should be admitted free, an inducement would be given to people to look outside the Commonwealth for them ",35
265,Mr HUTCHISON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"Hindmarsh) [6.26]. - I object to the proposed amendmait. Splendid pictures are taken at Mildura, and are then sent to Germany to be printed as post cards, and really what the honourable member for Balaclava desires is that we should have all our coloured suppleLYNE) ments made in Germany.",35
266,Mr WYNNE,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,I do not desire that.,35
267,Mr HUTCHISON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"That will be the effect of the amendment, because these supplements can be produced more cheaply in Germany than anywhere else. If it is the objeict of the honourable member to encourage German as against British and Australian artists, I am not with him.",35

If he does, it will facilitate business, shorten debate, and enable him to land in port all right tomorrow. I am afraid that the items will provoke long discussion. I do not feel inclined debate this item on the question of the valorem rate, but I wish to express the hope that throughout the rest of the Tariff, in all instances where the alternative method has been adopted, the Treasurer will drop the fixed and adhere to the ad dustry. valorem rate.",36
274,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,The honourable member must not expect that.,36
275,Mr COON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"Batman) [7.47] - I hope without the £ 5 duty. the Treasurer will not allow the fixed duty to be struck out. The ad valorem rate proposed will have no effect at all. Bicycles gressed and improved. are being dumped here at £ 5 apiece. The Tariff Commission went into the question, ancl their work should be recognised nexion with this all-important industry. In Victoria alone there are over 1,000 men engaged in the bicycle trade. we allow the foreigner to dump"" his bicycles In 1905 bicycles to the value of ^263,626 were imported. If the fixed duty is taken off, the cheap bicycles now in bond will be on the market to-imorrow or the next day. Why should this protectionist House allow goods that in other countries are charged 40 and 50 per cent, to come in here at a duty of 25 per cent. ? No reason has been given There is every reason why it should be retained. It was recommended by the protectionist secKingtion of the Tariff Commission, which in cluded the honourable member for Bendigo, MCGregor, and ex-Senator Higgs.",36
276,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"They recommended members 25 per cent, as well.",36

Previous ad to bicycles being made here, the cost of a machine was as high as from -£25 to ^.30. The price has been considerably reduced, and now a proposition is put forward which will practically mean wiping out the inThe men who are making bicycles here have been given to understand that they will get some protection.",36
282,Mr STORRER,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,The price - was reduced,36
283,Mr COON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"It was, but since the imposition of that duty the industry has proI t is only under such a. duty that it can hope to succeed. Why should it not receive the protection in conwhich it asks for?",36
284,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,Ask s for?,36
285,Mr COON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"Yes ; or which the people Why should ask for. If the ^ 5 rate is retained it will be the means of reducing the price of the better class bicycle, and of preventing the foreign trader from dumping iiis cheap goods into Australia. We can make bicycles here. Honourable members opposite, times out of number, have asked how many men are employed in an industry, and whether we can make an article here. In this case we are making bicycles here complete, and equal to any made in any other part of the world. When that is so, let us impose a duty, which will prevent the foreign bicycle from coming in at all.",36
286,Mr JOHNSON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"No part of the machine, «xcept the tyres, is made here.",37
287,Mr COON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"I do not say it is all made here. Perhaps there are certain parts that are not made here, but there is no part that cannot be made here if the opportunity is given. If we allow cheap shoddy stuff, that people in other parts of the world will not use, to be dumped into Australia, we will never make anything.",37
288,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"Parramatta) £7.53] - The answer to the honourable member for Batman, who; of course, knows all about the intricacies of bicycle manufacture as of every other industry by this time, as the Committee has been made painfully aware during this long Tariff debate, is that bicycles are not made here. They are at the most assembled here. The parts are not made in Australia, and in all probability will not be for many years to come, no matter what duties are imposed upon them. Are we therefore to impose these inordinate rates for the mere sake of taxing out bicycles, and making them dearer to the public? That is the only question that we have to ask ourselves. This is no strangled industry. It has never begun to be an industry in Australia, so far as the bond fide making of bicycles goes. All that happens is that the parts are imported and put together. I have no doubt the honourable member for Batman would call that a very elaborate process of manufacture. If he relies upon the Tariff Commission to buttress up his case, he will find small comfort there, and small encouragement for the vigorous propaganda which he seems to be waging on behalf of the local bicycle makers. Only two makers gave evidence before the Commission. I should like to hear from the Chairman of that body their reason for proposing an exorbitant duty of £ 5 , with an alternative of 25 per cent. It seems absurd on the face of it that £ 5 [* 6j S should be regarded as the equivalent of 25 per cent, ad valorem. There is no relation between the two. Upon a highlyfinished machine, £ 5 might possibly be equivalent to 25 per cent., but on the cheaper bicycles it means 100 per cent, and over in many cases.",37
289,Mr MALONEY,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"On one of the bicycles sold in England for 25s., it would be 400 per cent.",37
290,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"I should think that a bicycle sold at 25s. would be a danger to life and limb. There is no doubt that the machines are made. very cheaply in places where their manufacture has been specialized, and where the output and the market are very large. We can never hope to equal the skill developed from the specialization of the industry in those parts of the world. We have therefore to depend upon the parts which are sent out from the Old Country. As all that is done here is to assemble the parts into the completed machine, it is the height of absurdity even to suggest these extraordinary high duties. The Minister will, therefore, do well to strike out the fixed, and leave only the ad valorem, rate. So far as I can ascertain none of the witnesses before the Commission advocated an increase in the duty on bicycles. One individual said that he would not object to an increase from 20 to 25 per cent, on the finished article.",37
291,Sir JOHN QUICK,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,Bu the also wanted free bicvcle parts.,37
292,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,He wanted the duty on the parts reduced to 10 per cent.,37
293,Sir JOHN QUICK,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"We did not propose, that.",37
294,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"Since parts are not manufactured in Australia, that strikes me as a most reasonable request. I could understand the honourable member for Bendigo recommending a duty of £ 5 per bicycle if the parts were being made here, but they are not, and may not be made here for a generation to come. I do not know what the honourable member could have been thinking of to submit this recommendation. I should like to hear him explain it. I point"" out to the honourable member for Batman that the process of putting the machines together is neither elaborate nor costly. 1 was speaking just now to a gentleman who is a practical mechanic, and here are the charges in the business for the putting together of these machines: To put together a complete machine costs only 12s. for labour. If , they put together three, the cost is brought down to ns. per machine, .and if they put six together they do it for ios. each. That is the whole labour cost for assembling the parts of the machine.",37
295,Mr TUDOR,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"The honourable member is quoting the figures for building the frame, and not for putting the other parts into it.",38
296,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,The cost of the process of assembling the parts into the completed machine is 12s.. per bicycle.,38
297,Mr JH CATTS,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,That is absurd.,38
298,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"The honourable member should not say so until he hears the complete statement. There are additional charges of 9s. per machine for enamelling, and is. per machine for nickelling. Thus we have a total of 22s. for building' each machine.",38
299,Mr TUDOR,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,But the wheels have yet to be taken into account'.,38
300,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"That is so, and for that 2s. 6d., as labour cost, is provided.",38
301,Mr JH CATTS,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,I have paid <£io for a pair of wheels made in Australia.,38
302,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,Was that the Tesult of the present duty ?,38
303,Mr JH CATTS,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"No , it was long ago.",38
304,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"The honourable member is speaking of the complete cost of the wheels to the purchaser, whereas I am referring to the cost of the labour involved in putting the parts together after they have been imported. I am told that the total cost of labour in putting the parts together is from 22s. to 24s.",38
305,Mr JH CATTS,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,If the honourable member goes to buy a bicycle he will find that his figures are wrong.,38
306,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"Le t me repeat that I am speaking of the labour cost. It will be seen that the duties originally suggested were outrageous, and that those now indicated are still exceedingly high. hope the Treasurer .will consent to put these duties much lower than 30 per cent, and 25 per cent, ori the complete machine.",38
307,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"If the duties be ad valorem,- I shall propose 35 per cent - and 30 pecent.",38
308,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,My suggestion is that the old duties were sufficiently high.,38
309,Mr WATSON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,The duties on the parts are too - high in relation to the completed article.,38
310,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"Then let us reduce the duties on the parts instead of imposing such enormous duties on the completed machine. That is all that the bicycle builders asked for \yhen they gave evidence before the Tariff Commission; they stated that if the duties were made 10 per cent, on the parts, 'and 20 per cent, on the finished machine, they would be sufficiently high for all protective purposes.",38
311,Sir JOHN QUICK,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"The duty on the unfinished parts was only 10 per cent, under the old Tariff.",38
312,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"That was so in the case of some of the parts, but other parts were charged 15 per cent, and 20 per cent. Ai r they ask is that parts shall be made uniformly dutiable at 10 per cent., without any increased protection on the finished article; but the Treasurer proposes to increase the duty on the latter to 35 per cent, and 30 per cent. Parts will not be made here for many years to come, and, therefore, the impost is simply an exorbitant revenue duty.",38
313,Mr TUDOR,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"Yarra) [8.5] - Thes e duties have been the subject of much criticism in the press. We have learnt, many of us for the first time-fro m the honourable member for Bass, I believe-that eight bicycles, valued at £ 1 each, were landed at Launceston, and that, instead of a few shillings, the duty amounted to £ 4 0 . Then a gentleman from Queensland, when the TaTiff was introduced, asked that he might be allowed to unbraze imported frames, as the brazed frames were not worth, as much 'as the amount of the duty. The honourable member for Parramatta has read out figures relating to the labour cost, but, as I said in relation to the printing ink duty, very few honourable members can make themselves cognizant with the whole details of any industry. According to the honourable member for Parramatta, 12s. is .the labour cost of brazing the frame together. I Mr HEDGES - A v£ry big price !",38
314,Mr TUDOR,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"That is what is called the building of the frame. The honourable member for Parramatta admitted, however, that there was the enamelling, together with the building of the wheels and other charges. Some few years ago I endeavoured to ascertain by a question in the House addressed to the Minister of Trade and Customs the invoiced prices of : various imported bicycles, and it was found that, just as in the case of gramaphones, typewriters, cash-registers, and so forth, on which there is either very little duty or.no duty at all, the price at which they were invoiced was very small in comparison with the price at which they were sold the public. It may safely be said at least three-fourths of the bicycles in Victoria have been built or put together within the State.",38
315,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,There scarcely any protection under the old Tariff.',39
316,Mr TUDOR,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"But under the old Vicrecently torian Tariff there was protection. In a New South Wales, on the - other hand, where there was no protection, not onesent fourth of the bicycles in use in that State are built there. If the bicycle had not been finmly established under old Victorian Tariff, there would not have Company. been half the people employed in it that there are today. It is not my intention to discuss the decision of the Victorian parts Wages Board in the cycle trade, though I trade disagree entirely with it in fixing the wages strongest manner against their requests. too low. That the Wages Board made a you mistake is no reason why the duty on none bicycles should be largely reduced; and I am very sorry to .learn from the Treasurer that he has decided to abandon the fixed rate. It would be a good idea on the part was of the Customs authorities to periodically publish in the Government Gazette a list of the prices at which goods are invoiced when English importations. imported. If we could learn, for inup-to-date stance, that bicycles, which, when comnow plete, are sold for £ 1 0 , £ m , £ * 5 , even as high as £ 3 0 , were invoiced at less than ^ 5 , the public would realise the profits made by those engaged in importing.",39
317,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,The must be coming incheap if bicycles are being made here.,39
318,Mr TUDOR,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"As to that, if the Treaing surer has decided to reduce the duties on ployment. the finished article, he ought certainly to reduce the duties on the parts. 1 take that the protectionist section of the Tariff local lv ? Commission, when they made their recommendations, had in view the duties on parts as well as the duty on the finished machine. When the honourable member for though I cannot speak definitely, Batman was speaking, the honourable memin the case of Victoria. ber for Lang interjected, "" Are any of parts made here""? In reply, I may the dumping of machines in Australia. say that, with the exception of the tyres, do not think that the parts are made here to any extent, although some may have made by a few ingenious - mechanics their spare time. I guarantee that not 5 cluding duty paid, for less than [256]- 2 per cent, of the bicycle manufacturers in Great Britain make their own parts, but that they buy them from various iirms, to who have made a specialty of that branch that of business, there being three or four used standard parts turned out such as the B.S.A., the Edie, and one or two others. But those manufacturers of parts are now was endeavouring to monopolize the whole of the cycle business at Home; and those of us who take an interest in trade saw what happened in America when, firm, there tried to do precisely the same.. I have here a copy of a letter originally to the Minister of Trade and Customs from the Melbourne representatives of the ihdustry Canadian Cycle and Motor Company, the which, I believe, is the Massey-Harris The letter is as followsA petition requesting an additional increase in the General Tariff on bicycles and component thereof having within the past week been laid before you by a section of the bicycle we desire respectfully to protest in ' the As are alreadv aware, this company employs butBritish workmen in its manufactures, and having a large vested interest throughout the Commonwealth, is, we. claim, entitled to some consideration. When we thoroughly understood that the ultimatum ef the Government higher protection, we immediately set about a complete reorganization of our business. We are now receiving from Canada bicycle frame parts in the rough in exactly the same way as We have installed an erecting and assembling, as well as an enamelling and nickel-plating plant, and have working nearly twice the number of and men formerly employed at bicycle building. This company admit that they now employ twice the number of people that they employed three months ago, when this Tariff parts was introduced; and, being anxious to have the duty reduced on the finished machine, they are evidently indifferent about throwa number of those people, out of em",39
319,Mr HENRY WILLIS,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,Have they init creased the prices on their machines,39
320,Mr TUDOR,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"I do not think the the prices have been increased by a single shilling since the duty was imposed, except A fixed duty the ought to be imposed in order to prevenl I I know that complete bicycles, which in the trade means bicycles minus tyres, saddles been and chains, have been landed on the in wharf at Melbourne, all charges, in£3. It might be said, therefore, that the duty proposed is exorbitant, but, as a matter of fact, that is nothing like the fair value of the machines; and it is in order to prevent the dumping of surplus stocks at the end of the season that the Tariff Commission, and subsequently the Government, adopted the duties proposed. Honourable members have said that the local builders of bicycles merely assemble the parts after the - frame has been built. Of course, any person with ordinary common-sense could put the parts together if he only possessed a little mechanical knowledge. But I do not think that he could braze a machine and fit it up entirely unaided.",39
321,Mr HUTCHISON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"Our bicycle builders do any amount of brazing work, and some of us could do it,",40
322,Mr TUDOR,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"Some honourable members who possess mechanical skill might possibly be able to do that sort of work. Of course, I realise that the Government having abandoned the fixed duties which appear in the schedule, it is hopeless for any honourable member to fight for them. I believe that by acting as they have done the Ministry have struck a heavy blow at many men who have equipped their shops with the appliances necessary for the building df machines from imported parts. Honourable members may have noticed that one of the standard makers of bicycle parts has recently increased the price of those parts. I have received, from a gentleman in the country, a letter which emanated from an exporter of bicycles in England. In it the writer points out that English manufacturers would be able to beat the Customs authorities even if the fixed duties which appear in the schedule were retained. He declared that British manufacturers did not contemplate losing the Australian trade. Personally, I want to see our own people retain as much of that trade as possible, and that result cannot be achieved if we agree to the proposal of the Treasurer.",40
323,Mr GLYNN,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"Angas) [8.18] - I am very glad that the Treasurer has proposed the abolition of the fixed duties in respect of this item. I hold in my hand an invoice which gives the average value-exclusiv e of anv charges-of thirty-six bicycles which are at present in bond. The value is set down at £ 5 9s. 6d. each. The total consignment is valued at ,£197 3s. 6d. So far from these machines having been dumped, I am informed that the price I have mentioned is a fair one for a good article, The charges upon the consignment added to the duty amount to ^207 s. 3d. They work 9 out as follows-f.o.b . charges £ 2 is. 3d., cost of packages £ 5 5s., freight and primage £ 8 16s. 1 id., duty at £ 5 each ;£i8o, landing charges at 6s. per ton £ 1 8s. u d . , insurance, exchange, interest, & c , £ 9 17s. 2d., or a total of .£207 9s. 3d. on a declared value at the port of exportation of ^197 3s. 6d. These charges are equivalent to a tax of £ 5 each upon machines which are exported for £ 5 9s. 6d. each. The old duty upon that consignment, instead of amounting to £180, would have amounted t 0 £ 4 3 7S. 6d. The protectionist section of the Tariff Commission recommend a duty upon this item of 25 per cent. We must not seriously regard the alternative duty of £ 5 per machine recommended by that body. As the honourable member for Yarra suggested, it was framed with a view to prevent dumping. Now, assuming that a consignment of bicycles were invoiced at £ 1 each or a little over, instead of a duty of 25 per cent, being charged upon themwhich was the rate assumed by the Commission to be necessary for protection-the Customs authorities would have power, under the original proposal of the Government, to penalize the importer of these dumped machines by imposing a duty upon them of ^£5 each. That is a very large power to place in the hands of a Minister, because by an arbitrary assessment of value upon a mere allegation that dumping was taking place he would be able without the importer having a right to appeal to charge a duty of £ 5 per machine. This is a power, which ought not to be granted to him. I say, therefore, that the true duty recommended by the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission was 25 per cent., and I do not think that we shall be acting wrongly if we adopt that rate.",40
324,Sir JOHN QUICK,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,That was the rate recommended upon high-class bicycles.,40
325,Mr GLYNN,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"It was the rate recommended without any qualification whatever. I am assured that £ 5 9s. 6d. per machine represents the fair value of a good bicycle, and that it is the true import price is shown by the invoice to which I have alluded. Under the circumstances, I think that we might very well accept the recommendation of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission, and grant preferential treatment to the imports from the United Kingdom. That the duties originally scheduled were too high is evidenced by the fact the Government are prepared, without bate, to accept, in lieu thereof, 35 per under the general Tariff and 30 per cent, under the Tariff for the United Kingdom. Under the circumstances, I think that Committee might agree to 30 per cent, 25 per cent, respectively, and I shall move accordingly. Thirty per cent, would reprethe sent an increase of 10 per cent, 10 upon the old rate of duty. If any further concession is to be made to the bicycle dustry-and we ought to recollect that there is a very large section of the public who. use bicycles as a part of their implereason ments of trade- I suggest that it should take the form of a reduced duty upon parts.",40
326,Mr BATCHELOR,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"Boothby) [8.25] It has been said that bicycle-building the Commonwealth merely consists of as the sembling the parts and undertaking the brazing, nickelling, and enamelling of machines. Of course, in some cases alterathe tions are made in the design of the bicycles, and the tubes are cut by those who import Seeing them. Generally speaking, however; the abandon tubes are cut to length. If there were a chance of the industry of manufacturing to the parts being established in Australia, I The should be very pleased to assist in imposfixed duties ing a reasonable duty upon those on ,parts, because it would lae an worth encouraging. But, as has been being as low in value as £ 2some already pointed out, the parts are all stanWe realized that ad valorem duties dardized, and there is not much probability that in the near future these parts will be or made in the Commonwealth. They ported chiefly from the Birmingham Small Arms Factory. The Government have cersound machine for £$. tainly done the right thing in abandoning the fixed duties of .£5 and ,£5 5s. originally proposed. As has been pointed out by the honourable member for Parradesirable matta, the cost of the work done here upon a single machine amounts to about 24s. So that to levy a duty of .£5 or £ 5 5$. upon each bicycle would be utterly ridiculous. Thefiguresquoted by the orable member for Parramatta correspond almost exactly with those supplied to by a bicycle builder in Adelaide!.",41
327,Mr HUGHES,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,Does the cost quoted the honourable member cover the enamelling,41
328,Mr BATCHELOR,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"Yes. enamelling costs about 9s. per machine. operation. Seeing that we are not likely to go in for the manufacture of bicycle parts, I should prefer to make the duty upon bicycles per cent, under the general Tariff and that per cent, under the Tariff for the United deKingdom, and to lower the rates upon the cent, parts to 10 per cent, and 5per cent, respectively. The imposition of a small duty might encourage the manufacture of some the of the parts locally. Our best course, and therefore, is to levy the duties which I have, indicated upon bicycles, and to reduce rates upon the parts at any rate to and 5 per cent., if not to abolish them. There does not seem to be a sufficient inreason for a duty as. high as 10 per cent, on the parts which cannot lae made bere, at any rate for a few years. The only which the Treasurer has given for increasing the duties on the finished article the up to 35 and 30 per cent, is because he has duties of 15 and 10 per cent, on the - parts. It seems to me .that the better in method would be, instead of increasing total cost of the article to the user, to reduce it by making the duties on the the finished goods 30 and 25 per cent... ancl duties on the parts 10 and 5 per cent.",41

In Victoria there are no less than a* thousand persons employed in the repairing ancl making of bicycles, motor cars, and motor cycles. I do not know the number in other States, but I feel deeply impressed with the possibilities of the industry. An idea of those possibilities may be gathered from the fact that during the last two or three years bicycles and motor cycles to the value of over ,£250,000 havfe been imported. That shows that there was a wide area of trade for a good sound protective duty to operate upon. And these fixed duties were undoubtedly the most effective and operative part of these proposals. The deputy leader of the Opposition has challenged my reply regarding the work and labour involved in this industry. I think he said that it cost only 12s. or 13s. to assemble or put together the various parts of a bicycle.",41
332,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,No ; 24s.,42
333,Sir JOHN QUICK,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,".Of course, the amount that is spent locally in building a bicycle depends upon whether finished or unfinished parts are utilized. If the parts are finished, no doubt the work involved is not so great as would be the case if the parts were unfinished. But it is claimed that in building a bicycle out of imported unfinished parts every cycle manufacturer in the Commonwealth gives at least thirtysix hours' employment to Australian workmen. That is an incentive to manufacturers to build factories, and provide plant locally made or imported, giving work to a considerable number of men in the production of bicycles.",42
334,Mr BATCHELOR,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,What does the honourable member mean by unfinished parts?,42
335,Sir JOHN QUICK,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"I refer to parts which require local treatment such as enamelling, brazing, filing down, and fitting. The putting together of the parts of an unfinished bicycle gives four days' work, at about £ 2 a day, to local labour. Let us now consider the class of work that is involved. The deputy leader of the Opposition has said that it simply means the fitting together of some parts. able members will listen to an extract from our report they will get an idea of. the processWhen the component parts, unfinished, are imported, and made into complete machines in Australia, the following work is done locally, namely :-Cuttin g and fitting all tubing and parts together, brazing same, filling same, nickelplating, enamelling the frames, front forks, back stays and wh4el rims with three or four coats of enamel, placing the same in ovens for the purpose of rendering the enamel hard and solid, thereby being less liable to chip and peel off, decorating frames with fancy transfers and names, and other ornamental work. The bicycle frame is then ready for the assembler to take in hand the fitting of other parts, such as tyres, chains, pedals, cranks, bearings, handle bars, and saddle pillars, to make the cycle complete. We were of opinion that the most effective way of encouraging the industry was by substantially increasing the duty on finished bicycles and frames, as well as by placing on the free list certain bicycle tubes.  now give us a little information about the wages paid to the men who manufacture the bicycles here?",42

337,Sir JOHN QUICK,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"That is notorious sweating with which I , like the honourable member, have no sympathy. We do not - want that, and I believe it is the desire and intention of the owners of bicycle factories, if these duties are imposed, to give their workers good and substantial wages.",42
338,Mr MALONEY,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,They will not get any new protection if they do not.,42
339,Sir JOHN QUICK,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"Quite so. I have explained the reason why the fixed duties were recommended, and that was practically to check the importation of dangerous, unserviceable, and cheap machines. And with reference to high class and expensive machines, the ad valorem duties of 30 and 25 per cent, were intended to operate.",42
340,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,The honourable member does not believe in making bicycles too readily available to poor persons? If honor- Sir JOHN QUICK - I believe that the imposition of these duties would not increase the prices of the bicycles made or put together in Australia.,42
341,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,The honourable member has just said that his object is to try to keep them out.,42
342,Sir JOHN QUICK,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"I have said that my object was to keep out the dangerous rubbish; but the exclusion of that would rather tend to encourage the local production of superior machines. I know as a fact that the local manufacture of bicycles has resulted in a great decline in the prices of them to the general public. I remember the time-and it is only a few years ago-whe n I gave ,£32 for an ordinary bicycle, but today I could buy the same machine in Bendigo-perhaps , a better one-for ^ 1 5 or £ 2 0 , simply owing to local manufacture and competition.",42
343,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,The prices of bicycles have fallen all over the world.,43
344,Sir JOHN QUICK,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"If this' trade were ' in the hands of bicycle importers there would be a great danger of the prices being raised to the old standard, whereas the local manufacturer of them has undoubtedly tended to bring down the cost, and the public have had an advantage thereby. I hope that the Minister having given way on the fixed duties does not intend to go below 35 per cent. I hope that he will accept the invitation of the trade party and lower the duties on the parts both finished and unfinished. That to some extent would be a slight compensation to local manufacturers for the removal of the fixed duties.",43
345,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"Hume-Trea surer) [8.40] - I am surprised at so much heat being imported into this discussion. I felt that the fixedduties of £ 5 5:5.. and £ 5 were very excessive, and I do not care who says the reverse. On looking through the Tariffs of other countries, I found that bicycles were not subjected to ' a fixed duty but to an ad valorem duty. In Victoria under its old Tariff there was a much lower ad valorem duty than ours, and in New Zealand, Canada and the United States of America there is an ad valorem duty. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Forty-fiv e per cent.",43

If the consensus of opinion in all those countries is in favour of an ad valorem out. duty, I conceive that I cannot go far wrong in following their example. anxious as is any one to see a good duty imposed on any article which we can and do make. With regard to bicycles some honourable members have said that they would rather have a fixed duty of £ 1 than an ad valorem duty. Let us see how it would work out. Suppose that I get the Committee to agree to duties of 35 and 30 per cent. A bicycle is imported worth £ 3 , and that will bave a duty of £ 1 upon it even at that very low estimated value.",43

We cannot do better than adopt the method which has been pursued all over the British Dominions and in the United States. I think myself,, despite what has been said, that duties of 35 and 30 per cent, are very good rates indeed. Those who are infree- terested in this industry ought to be very, well satisfied, and think themselves lucky to get such duties. That is the feeling that I have.",43

354,Mr BATCHELOR,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,What is the honourable gentleman going to do in reference to parts ?,43
355,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"The suggestion which has been made in reference to parts strikes me as being, a good one. I have not been able to ascertain what is necessary, but by the time we reach the item dealing with parts I shall be able to make a statement, explaining what reduction I intend to move, if any. I firmly believe in leaving a good margin between the duty on the bicycle and that on parts. Probably a reduction of the duty on parts will make this duty more acceptable to those who are comper cent., plaining at present. . I move That the figures "" £5 5s."" and "" £5 "" be left",43
356,Mr HENRY WILLIS,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"Rotertson) I am as [8.48] - The Treasurer appears to be slipping away from his high protectionist principles. He originally proposed a duty of jQ$, and now he comes down to one of ios. He really does not seem to know where he is. The honourable member for Bendigo tells us that bicycles can be brought to this country for a mere bagatelle, and that it was because of the importation of these weak and dangerous machines that he proposed a fixed duty. But the honourable member evidently forgot that these inferior machines can be imported in parts and made up here, when they can be sofd more cheaply than the good machines, with which they compete. It seems to me, however, that this item does not merit so much discussion as has been devoted to it. If we make the duty high, and the parts are put together here, and it only costs 24s. to put them together, it seems to me that there will be no demand for complete imported machines. The freight alone would make it almost prohibitive to import them as compared with the cost of putting .together the parts here. The honourable member for Bendigo has told us that it takes a man thirty-six hours to put a machine together. The honourable member for Parramatta says that it costs 24s. to put a machine together. The honourable member for Boothby also says that the cost of ing a bicycle from imported parts is 24s., and he speaks as a practical man. Evidently, if it takes thirty-six hours to con- ber for South Sydney. struct a machine, and the wages paid are 8d. an hour, that works out at 24s. If the Committee wish to do something for the benefit of the industry, they should' give it the parts free. Then it will flourish, and locally-built machines must take the place of impoitations. Therefore, when we reach item 375 I shall support the proposition that parts 1» admitted free, so that all the bicycles required in Australia may be made in the country. There is no advantage in importing machines if they can be put together in Australia. We have been tol3 that bicycles are dumped into Australia. It is a remarkable thing that I never get any of these goods dumped into my backyard. I never have a chance of buying dumped goods. But a few years ago I looked into a bicycle factory at Coventry, England, where the best machines in the world are made, and the head of the firm told me that they could have sold 5,000 more machines during the year if they had had time to make thiem. I have never yet heard of an upi-to-date machine being dumped into any country. It is the out-of-date Mr Henry Willis. machine that will be dumped, to get rid of it. This story about goods being dumped into Australia is a mere fiction, and I hope that the Committee will not be induced to' believe it. However, I am more interested in item 375 than in that under consideration. I should like the duties to be made as low as possible. Whether we make the duty high or low on this item, however, it will not make a bit of difference, so long, as we make the duty on parts low.  a great deal from the Melbourne and suburban members about locally-produced bicycles. In fact, it appears that in every electorate around Melbourne there are bicycle factories. In South Melbourne there seems to be one in every back yard. But while a good deal has been said about the necessity for protecting the industry, only one or two honourable members have pleaded the cause of the consumer.",43

Shoddy machinesare made in 'Melbourne just as ""freely as buildthey are imported. Enamel covers a multitude of sins in the bicycle trade.

In my electorate nearly every man you meet who is not ""waltzing Matilda"" rides a bicvcle. At every station to which the shearers go there is a shed for the bicycles. Many men are now giving up the ordinary machine and going in for the motor cycle. As in some cases they have to ride 70 and 80 miles a; day over a bush road, their interests ought to be taken into consideration as well as those of the manufacturers in Melbourne, Sydney or Brisbane. But I have not beard the honourable member for Bendigo say a word in the interesfs of the men who have to buy these machines. The honourable member's anxiety appears to belimited to what can be got for Victoria. The arguments used with regard to the bicycle trade strike me as really very curious. As soon as those engaged in it prove that their industry is in a nourishing condition some honourable members are prepared to protect them. The industry was flourishing in New South Wales under free trade, and even in Victoria in the palmy days of protection there was a duty of only 10 per cent. Now, however, under the Deakin Government, and with a New South Wales protectionist Treasurer, we have posed a duty of 35 per cent.",44
359,Mr WILKS,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"Yesterday the Treasurer wanted a duty of £ 1 0 per machine.  his ways since then. Now, what about the wages paid in this industry which the honourable member for Bendigo is so anxious to protect against the cheap imported article? The "" reputable employers section"" Of the . Victorian Factories Act limits the power of the Wages Boards to fix rates of wages to those paid by the average employer in the trade. The 'wages paid today in the bicycle trade are higher than those fixed by the Board. I shall state what the wages fixed by the Board are. I ask the Committee whether it is fair, reasonable and reputable to expect a man with five children to live in Melbourne on £ 1 7s. 6d. a week? A foreman bicyclemaker, who must be a mechanic, has had his wages fixed at £ 2 8s. per week. That is considered sufficient for the man who bosses the show. I pay a boundary-rider more than that for sitting on a horse and riding round my fences. The assemblers of bicycle parts get £ 1 12s. per week, filers £ 1 8s., persons engaged in building, turning, and fitting, or who are employed in addition thereto at other branches of trade, get £ 2 os. 6d. This is dustry the honourable member for Bendigo is raving about. I say that if it cannot afford to pay better wages than these the sooner it is wiped out the better, in order that the men at present engaged in it may be able to turn their attention to some more profitable employment. Repairers get £ 1 15s. per week. builders £ 1 8s. 6&, and all other adults engaged in the industry £ 1 7s. 6d. Apprentices, who are unlimited, get from 5s. to 25s. per week, and improvers, who are allowed in the ratio of one to one or two adults, two to three adults, and one for every additional adult, get from 5s. to 28s. . per week, according to experience. I have heard the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, where the majority of these bicycle shops are to be found, say times out of number that if he had his way he would wipe out an industry that could not pay better wages than these. I desire that the workers engaged in the industry, and the people who buy and ride bicycles, as well as the people who build and . sell them, should pro- get some of the benefit conferred by the protection proposed. We know that many of these bicycles are made of tin tubes. A man in Rockhampton wanted to sell me a bicycle which he said would carry a ton. He gave me a trial, and I brought it back to him like a concertina. This was a Colonial-made bicycle, and it is clear, therefore, that the remarks of the honourable member for Bendigo about cheap imported bicycles should not carrymuch weight. I am pleased that the Treasurer has seen fit to abolish the fixed duties proposed. It rests now with the Committee to decide what the ad valorem duties shall be. I have no wish to crush the local bicycle industry. I am prepared to vote for a reasonable duty for its protection, and if , under the old Victorian duty of 10 per cent, the industry could be carried on, those concerned in it should be satisfied with a duty of 2.5 per cent., for which I am prepared to vote.",45
360,Mr MALONEY,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"Melbourne) [9.7] - I feel sure that the arguments of the Chairman of the Tariff Commission will have great weight with the Committee. I hope that if the fixed duties are removed the honourable member's colleagues on the Tariff Commission will in another place the be successful in reintroducing them, or at the inleast in providing for a fixed duty of £ 3 3s. on each machine. The object is to prevent the introduction of very cheap and worthless bicycles. I have seen bicycles advertised in the London press as low as £ 2 ios., £ 2 2s., and even £ 1 5s. If the parts of such machines were sent out here no self-respecting local manufacWheel turer would use them. He would have to consider his good name, and in the interests of his business he could not afford to put such rubbish into a machine. We know that a certain amount of enamel will cover a great many faults, and worthless bicycles are imported which in appearance look spick and span.",45
361,Sir JOHN QUICK,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"If bicycles of that stamp locally made broke down they would be sent back to the manufacturer, and would have to repair them.",45
362,Mr MALONEY,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"And the man who and bought such a bicycle from the local in manufacturer would not be likely to go him again. I have had some experience in connection with bicycles. In 1892 I was offered a bicycle for ,£20, but I did purchase it. The bicycle I have in use at the present time cost £ 1 2 . I have ridden it for a couple of years, and it is as as the one for which I was asked £ 2 Within the last three months I was offered a bicycle, which was better than one I have got, for ,£10. The reduction the price has, in my opinion, been due the operation of the present Tariff.",46
363,Mr WILSON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,No; the price of bicycles has fallen all over the world.,46
364,Mr MALONEY,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"If the honourable member will compare the price of locallymade tires with the price charged for ported tires, he will find that the locallyon made article is cheaper than the imported article. In the same way, as the result of the operation of the duty and the exhe tended manufacture of bicycles in the much the better. Commonwealth, they can be sold now less than the price asked for imported machines. I suppose the Government will carry the proposal to abolish the fixed duties of and jQ$ 5s.; but I suggest that they should be replaced by a fixed duty of £ 3 3s., to prevent the introducWe tion of cheap and worthless bicycles. Bicycle parts, which cannot be manufacthen tured here, should be admitted free, and if that is done, the assemblers - of the parts in the Commonwealth will be given a suffithings cient margin of protection for their work, and will have no reason to be discontented.",46
365,Mr HUGHES,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"West Sydney) [9.11]. - The present proposal of the Treasurer is not calculated to help this industry to flourish and pay decent wages. Every time the honourable gentleman departs the admirably-prepared Tariff put in front of him he gets into difficulties, and makes statements which are not corroborated in the schedule. from outside sources. Two"" kinds of bicycles are imported: Those that are good and those that are no good. Those that are no good, and that really describes them, are imported at an invoice price from ,£3 to ,£5. I have known vidual obtain a bicycle from a Coventry firm landed here at £ $ , and we can assume words that the purchaser of a large number of ad these machines would get them for very serted. he much less.. A duty of 30 per cent, would represent about £,1 ios. on such a machine, under that duty it would cost landed Australia £ f i ios. at the outside. How to is a local manufacturer to pay decent .wages if he is to make a bicycle for £.6 ios. ? I do not know how it is to be not done. I have known bicycles to be sold for 22s. 6d., and all I can say is that if a manufacturer pays his workmen decent good mechanics' wages, .he cannot turn out a 0 . bicycle for 22s. 6d. I have never made bicycles myself, but I have done metal the work, and I know that a bicycle could not in be turned out at the price mentioned. I to point out that if a specific duty of £ 5 were imposed on a machine invoiced, at £ 5 , the effect would be to keep such machines out. A man who desires an imported machine wishes to have a first-class bicycle, which would be sold ait about £ 2 0 , and the duty of £ 5 would not put imthe machine beyond him. A duty of £ 5 the lower-priced machines would prevent their sale, and the market would thus be kept for the local manufacturer, and if could make a better class of machine so However, when the at Treasurer has formed a base mercenary alliance with the Opposition, there is nothing left for a free-trader like me to do but to follow him. I very much regret that one by one the old landmarks are becoming submerged in this chamber. find honourable members making speeches in support of free oregon, and proposing a duty of 6d. per 100 superficial feet, and afterwards declaring that they do not care a "" continental "" how go. If we intend to do anything for this industry, we should give it such protection as will enable the local manufacturers of bicycles to pay decent wages. Amendment agreed to.",46

371,Mr WILKS,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"Dalley) [9.19] - For the purposes of future reference, I wish to direct attention to the fact that the honourable member for Angas, notwithstanding that he is a free-trader, has moved the imposition of rates of 30 per cent, and 25 per cent. I shall, of course, vote for the lowest duty proposed; but I wish to emphasize the fact that other free-traders besides myself are not too rigid-to be unable to vote for a 30 per cent, duty at times.",47
372,Mr GLYNN,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"Angas) [9.20] - The honourable member may think himself rather smart, but the rates which I have proposed are lower than those which the Minister has moved. I did not move for lower rates, because it would have been futile, and I wished to save time.

376,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,Parramatta) [9-35]-- I propose to move that the duty under the general Tariff be 20 per cent. I hope that no argument is necessary to convince the Committee of the desirableness of such a reduction. It simply means a return to the old rate of duty.,48
377,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"Trea surer) [9.36] - I trust that the Committee will not agree to such a reduction. I am piepared if the Committee is favourable to reduce the duties to 30 per cent, and 25 per cent.",48

Perambulators and go-carts are used mostly by the middle and poorer' classes, for our wealthy citizens have other means of conveyance for their infants. I am surprised that a Government which proposes to expend ,£200,000 to encourage immigration is prepared to impose a prohibitive tax upon the perambulators and go-carts of the rising generation.",48

383,Mr TUDOR,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"Yarra) [9.48] - I thinE the Committee have made an error ing this and the last item. The words "" and parts thereof "" should haye been transferred from the last item to this, and ""perambulator and go-cart body"" have been in the other item, both items carrying ad valorem duties. I believe certain parts of these vehicles are here. There was a great discussion in press when the Tariff was introduced as to whether the under gear was or was not made here. I am not sure now whether it is made here or not, but at .any rate the parts should not .be dutiable at as high made here. a rate as is the finished article.",49

Even in Great Britain very few firms are engaged in making them. It is specialized work, and they should be included in the next item at a after n t h Delower rate of duty.  the Minister will strike out cyclometers, which are not made here. This will be only a revenue duty on them. They-should regardbe put on the free list.",49
389,Mr BATCHELOR,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,Boothby) [9.54] There is no pretence that a number of articles in this item are made here or are. should likely to be made here.,49
390,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"I intend to propose that duties of 15 and 10 per cent. not made .

391,Mr GLYNN,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"Angas) [9.55] - I believe that chains in the length are free, but that these chains are taxed as accessories at 20 per cent. I am informed by an importer that that is the way the Tariff is adminis-tered. Consequently, if we desire to make chains free it will be necessary to alter this item to read "" not including chains,"" rather than to strike out the words ""including",49

(General Tariff), 15 .per cent.; (United Kingdom), 10 per cent.",49
394,Mr TUDOR,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"Yarra) [10.1] - I suggest that the word '' unplated "" be struck out, and '' unfinished"" substituted before the word "" parts."" If the Treasurer makes inquiries amongst his officers, he will find that the word "" unplated "" in this connection caused endless confusion in the Department. Any part which had the least bit of plating on it had to fall under a higher duty; and I do not think that is the desire of the Committee. Amendments (by Sir WILLIAM LYNE) agreed toThat the word "" unplated"" be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the word "" unfinished "" ; that the word "" B all s "" be left out; that before the word ""Washers"" the word "" Spoke"" he inserted; that after the word ""Washers"" the comma be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof a semicolon; that the letters ""n.e.i.

395,Mr BATCHELOR,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"Boothby) [10.7] - I think that the word "" unfinished,"" inserted on the suggestion of the honourable memand ber for Yarra, is not at all suitable, view of the fact that these are all finished parts, though some of them may be unplated. The whole object of admitting easiest these parts free will be defeated if the "" unfinished "" be allowed to remain.",50
396,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,We cannot go back.,50

398,Mr WILKS,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"Dalley) [10.10] - Her e we have an item with fixed .duties only, and I suggest that an ad valorem duty ought to be substituted.",50
399,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"We might take a ' test vote on this paragraph, as to the whole of the vehicles in the division.",50
400,Mr WILKS,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,That might be done. Do I understand that the Treasurer will consent to the striking out of the fixed duties ?,50
401,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,No .,50
402,Mr WILKS,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"Then I think the division will provoke some debate, because, in view of previous decisions, uniformity ought to be preserved. I should be quite prepared, in the case of paragraph A, to vote for duties of 30 per cent, and 25 per cent., which would be anincrease of 5 per cent, on the old duties. Sir WILLIAM ' LYNE - In one column only.",50
403,Mr WILKS,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"As an argument for ad valorem duties, let me point us that if the division be passed as proposed, a sulky which sells at £ 1 4 or ^15 will pay exactly the same duty as a dog cart worth ^70 or .£80.",50
404,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,That is not so.,50
405,Mr HUME COOK,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,How many of these LYNE) vehicles are imported?,50
406,Mr WILKS,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"No doubt the vehicle in the dustry has progressed considerably, and there is very little importation; but that be inonly provides a reason why the Treasurer should not propose duties so high. Under words the old Tariff, vehicles to the value of .£2,500,000 per annum were made in the Commonwealth.",50
407,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"Hume-Trea surer) [10.13] - Do g carts, gigs, tilburys, other two-wheeled vehicles are imin ported to a larger extent than almost any other kind of vehicles, and are sold at .£10, and. sometimes less. They are the class of vehicles to construct,, and, word therefore, an ad valorem duty would be of no avail Some honourable members may think the proposed duty high,, but, in my opinion, every one of those cheap articles",50

410,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"I do not think that dog carts will come under this item, but under another designation of vehicle.",51
411,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"They must; there are the words "" Dog Carts.""",51
412,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"However , I should like to test the question whether the duties shall be fixed or ad valorem, although, as I have indicated, I am opposed to the latter form of impost. The test the matter. might be taken on an amendment to strike out the word "" each."" Amendment (by Mr Wilks ) proposed - That the word ""each"" be left out.",51
413,Mr CROUCH,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"Corio) [10.15] would point out to the honourable member for Dalley that in order to encourage the local production of the raw material of coachbuilder we have already increased duties formerly levied upon buggy shafts, varnishes, and quite a number of other articles.",51
414,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,We have imvalue posed an ad valorem rate upon buggyand shafts.,51
415,Mr CROUCH,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"Yes ; and previously of the trade, I they were admitted free, whereas they now dutiable at 30 per cent. In the way, bent poles were previously admitted rates of duty. free ; but they are now subject to a duty of 2s. 6d. each. The ooachbuilders, therethem out. fore, do not now occupy the position that they formerly occupied. The cost of their raw material has been increased, and consequently it becomes necessar.y to i crease the duty upon the manufactured But article: If we desire to have these vehicles manufactured locally, we should retain the fixed duty proposed by the Government.",51
416,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,Parramatta) [10.19] - It is difficult to know exactly what some honourable members desire in regard to the duties upon vehicles. The honourable member for Corio has purported to speak on behalf of the coachbuilders Australia. I hold in my hand a request from the coachbuilders of Victoria and New South Wales that the duties levied under the old Tariff should be retained.,51
417,Sir JOHN QUICK,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,But they desire have their parts admitted free.,51
418,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,They do not. higher. They are quite willing that the parts shall be subjected to duty.,51
419,Mr CROUCH,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,If they got their parts free they would not require any increase in the duty upon their manufactured the article,51
420,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"In the cirI cular, to which I have referred they detection. clare that they are quite prepared to pay a duty upon a great many of their parts. If there is one industry in the CommonAvealth which is able to hold its own against the competition of the world, it is that of the manufacture of vehicles.",51
421,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"Oh , no.",51
422,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,The Treasurer evidently knows nothing whatever about,51
423,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,I know something about it.,51
424,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"The total importation of vehicles into the Common- I wealth for 1906 was valued at ,£9,509.",51
425,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"The honourable member will find that the imports in rethe spect of other classes of vehicles during the. that year were valued at £175,451 ",51
426,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"The figures - quoted by the Treasurer relate to the importation of parts. I am speaking of the of the completed vehicles imported, I have quoted the figures supplied by the Customs Department. The total value am informed, is are ,£2,500,000 annually. Our coachbuilders same have captured that trade under the old",51
427,Mr MATHEWS,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,We had better wipe,51
428,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"It seems to me that they have already captured the trade. I hope that they will continue to ma.ke all n - the vehicles required in the Commonwealth. as that they are already doing that, it seems the height of absurdity to increase these duties. The specific duties proposed by the Treasurer are unreasonable. To associate fixed duties with values which are necessarily varying is an act of absurdity. To tax a vehicle which costs .£10 at the same amount, as one which costs . £ 7 0 or , £ 80 is perfectly preposterous. I know that fixed duties are very of convenient from .the Customs stand-point, but that fact should not be permitted to prevent us from doing justice all round.",51
429,Mr MATHEWS,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,Le t us impose an ad to valorem rate as an alternative to a fixed duty and charge whichever rate may be the,51
430,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"The honourable member is like a sailing ship, in that he wishes to set his sails to catch every favourable breeze. I trust that we shall abolish fixed duties in respect p f vehicles and revert to the old rate of 25 per cent, which think will afford the industry ample proThe official statistics prove that the industry is able to stand against all competition.",51
431,Mr STORRER,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"Bass) [10.25] - I intend to vote against the imposition of fixed duties upon vehicles, because I realise that under their operation those who drive - the niose expensive vehicles would pay the least. I am quite prepared to support an ad' valorem rate of 35 or 40 per cent, in view of the fact that we have alreadv inteased the cost of the construction of these vehicles.",52
432,Mr JOHNSON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"Lang) [10.28] - Wit h the exception of the very highest class of vehicles, such as barouches and landaus, and some of the cheaper classes of buggies, there is a very small importation of vehicles into the Commonwealth. The reason is that the foreign vehicles are built too lightly to withstand use on Australian roads.",52
433,Mr WILKS,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,And the freight charges are very heavy.,52
434,Mr JOHNSON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"Undoubtedl y the cost of importation is considerable, because vehicles take up a large quantity of space. If we compare the importation of vehicles into the Commonwealth prior to Federation with the present importation, we shall find that there has been a tremendous falling-off. From the Statistical Register I gather that in 1900 the value of the importations under this heading was as follows:-Ne w South Wales £11,382, Victoria £5,902, Queensland £1,436, South Australia £5,669, Western Australia £1,113, and Tasmania £ 9 6 , or a total of />5,6oo. From the Trade and Customs Returns I gather that the imports last year from the United Kingdom were valued at £1,274, those from the United States at £8,117, and those from all other countries at £208 , or a total of £9,599. As against this total there were re-exports to the extent of £ 9 2 , which really reduced the value of the total imports last year to £9»5°7. as against £25,600 for 1900. In regard to the opinions of the coachbuilders, some evidence which was given before the Victorian Tariff Board is very interesting reading just now. shows that even so far back as then, when the industry was not in nearly so flourishing a condition as it is in today, the coachbuilders did not want any more protection. In fact, many of them complained that the high Tariff was really a source of irritation to them, if it did not indeed involve them in considerable loss.",52
435,Mr MATHEWS,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"That is a good old argument, but it will not go down.",52
436,Mr JOHNSON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,It may not go down with the honourable member; but may I remind him that it is evidence given by the coachbuilders themselves?,52
437,Sir JOHN QUICK,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,What is the name of the witness?,52
438,Mr JOHNSON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"It is a case of not one witness, but several witnesses. I know that - if I were to make an ex panic statement, it would not make any impression upon the honourable member for Melbourne Ports or the honourable member for Bendigo; but surely'they will not refuse to accept the evidence of those who are interested in the manufacture of vehicles.",52
439,Sir JOHN QUICK,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"It is the evidence of mere assemblers of parts, and not ot coachbuilders.",52
440,Mr JOHNSON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"If the honourable member will be patient, he will hear the names of the coachbuilders. On page 61 Mr Donald MCCall, coachbuilder, of Warracknabeal, gave evidence. Probably the honourable member who represents that district may know the witness.",52
441,Sir JOHN QUICK,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,He wants free parts.,52
442,Mr JOHNSON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,He wants free-trade in the whole industry. He said I think that if coachbuilders were not protected at all they could hold their own ground. The coachmaking industry does not require any protection. In New South Wales the coachbuilding industry is one of the most flourishing. In New South Wales the coachbuilders had not protection tp anything like the same extent as in Victoria. This witness also protested against duties on the material used.,52
443,Sir JOHN QUICK,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,I thought so. He wants free parts.,52
444,Mr JOHNSON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"The honourable member is misrepresenting the matter. Mr. MCCall wanted more than free parts. He said the industry itself did not require any protection. He protested against the duty proposed for that reason, and he further protested against the duty on parts.",52
445,Mr SALMON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,Warracknabea l was then It represented in the State Parliament by a free-trader; but in this Parliament it is represented by an out-and-out protectionist.,52
446,Mr JOHNSON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,What has that to do with this evidence?,52
447,Mr SALMON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,Everything . It shows the change in public opinion.,52
448,Mr JOHNSON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"It cannot change the sworn evidence. I am not quoting a statement made by any one who was in Parliament, but a statement by a coachbuilder in whose interests the duty was supposed to have been imposed",52
449,Mr SALMON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,That is fifteen years ago.,53
450,Mr JOHNSON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"If the coachbuilders in Victoria could do without the duty fifteen years ago, howmuch better can fhey do without it today, when the trade is represented to be worth £2,500,000? Surely .if they could do without the duty then, they can do without it far better now?",53
451,Mr SALMON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,They were not doing without the duty.,53
452,Mr JOHNSON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"But they wanted the duty removed. At that time they had much greater competition from abroad than they have today, the importations having fallen from £25,600 to £9,000 worth. To all intents and purposes the importation of these vehicles has ceased, so that the local makers have acquired, practically a monopoly of the trade built up under the old duties.",53
453,Mr MATHEWS,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,Marvellous .,53
454,Mr JOHNSON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"Thes e are the bald facts, and there is no getting behind them. Let us see what another coachbuilder said before the Victorian Tariff Board. Mr. William Gibson Hart, coachbuilder and agricultural implement maker, of Rochester, in Victoria, gave the following evidenceProviding the duties were swept away on all the material you use, would you be prepared to forego all duties'on the manufactured article? - Yes , certainly. You would compete against the outside world without any protective duty ?-Well , I believe I could.' Let me now quote the evidence of Mr. John Donnellan, coachbuilder, of Bendigo.",53
455,Sir JOHN QUICK,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"He wants free parts. He is a very decent fellow,"" and a good coachbuilder.",53
456,Mr JOHNSON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"Then I presume the honourable member will not contemptuously refer to him as a mere assembler of parts. He said I represent the Coachbuilding Society. . . VVe maintain that the trade is now so restricted, that we have to employ very few hands, because the public demand is for a cheap article, and, owing to the excessive duties, we cannot make that cheap article. Mark ! "" owing to the excessive duties ""The little we can do, the industry will not be a success to us or to the rising generation. The Tariff in Sydney is lower than in Victoria: the consequence is that nearly every one who has a stake in New South Wales has a cart-noveltie s on wheels that we know nothing of in Victoria, and we cannot produce these here owing to excessive duties. [257] That is the evidence of a coachbuilder who we are assured by the honourable member for Bendigo is a very decent and reliable man.",53
457,Sir JOHN QUICK,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,r He must have changed his opinion since then.,53
458,Mr JOHNSON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"Le t me now take the evidence of Mr John William Clapham, representing the Victorian Carriage Company, of Melbourne, and appointed by the coachbuilding trade to give evidence before the Victorian Tariff BoardYou think the present duties on vehicles' should be maintained?-No ; I am prepared, as one of the trade, to submit to a reduction. I would make a reduction of 50 per cent, all round. Mr John Stickland, coachbuilder, of Melbourne, gave this evidenceDo you go in for abolishing the duty on vehicles?- I should think seriously about doing it personally. Do you agree with the previous witness in reducing them one-half?-Certainly . Mr Joseph Donnelly, coachbuilder, of Melbourne, and chairman of a public meeting of the carriage trade, gave the following evidenceI understand the summing-up of your evidence, and I want to know if it represents the whole of the trade; are materials to be free and vehicles free?-No ; I cannot say that represents the trade. I sneak individually there. At the meeting, the majority were in favoursooner than pay a high rate on the materialsof having the goods (vehicles) in free. I could quote passage after passage to the like effect from other witnesses in the trade all over Victoria, if honourable members desired, but I think that the evidence I have cited is sufficiently convincing to show even the most ardent protectionist that no duty at all is required. The Minister has not given any reason why the old duty should be increased, nor is the increase supported by anything I have seen in the reports of the Tariff Commission. So far as I can learn there has not been any demand for the additional duty. Therefore I shall do what I can not only to oppose the increased duty but to trv to get a reduction.",53
459,Mr GLYNN,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,Angas) [10.40] - I suggest to the Minister that it might save time if a test vote were taken on this line.,53
460,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"We propose to take a test vote on an amendment to strike out the word ""each.""",53
461,Mr GLYNN,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"I was not aware of the arrangement. But in connection with that test, it will be necessary for the Minister to make a special provision, in the Tariff Bill.. As a rule, when we remove a duty we insert words to the effect .that on and after the following day the article shall be free, thus validating what has been done up to that date. But it is now proposed io strike the word "" each "" out of this I hope it will be deleted, but with saving words. _ If it is deleted, without saving words, those persons who have paid the fixed duty up to to-dav can sue the Government for a refund, because we shall not have validated what has been done previously.",53
462,Sir JOHN QUICK,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,Surely the honourable member does not propose to upset the previous collections ?,54
463,Mr GLYNN,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"I have pointed out this matter two or three times. fectly safe so long as we provided that and after the following day the duty should be so much, but what we are asked to now is to strike out the word ""each.""",54

465,Mr GLYNN,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"If we only strike out word "" each "" it will mean that up to day a specific duty of £ 6 12s. on each vehicle has been wrongly levied. What we ought to do is to provide that up to today the duty on each vehicle shall be £ 6 12s.  in the case of several items.",54
466,Mr GLYNN,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"Yes , but it has been wrongly done. I believe that if word "" each "" is struck out any importer who likes to sue for the excess duty entitled to recover it.",54
467,Sir JOHN QUICK,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,Is it not a Tariff position until it is altered?,54
468,Mr GLYNN,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"It is a proposition which the Government levy a certain duty, trusting to the validation of that act in the rate. Customs Tariff Bill . For that reason provide that up to today the duty shall sn much and after today so much, but are now asked to strike out the word '""'each.'*",54
469,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"We might insert after "" £ 6 "" the provision that and after n t h December the duty be 'a certain percentage.",54
470,Mr GLYNN,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"That is exactly what have said. What we ought to do is to provide that on and after the n t h Deduties were abolished. cember the duty be 25 per cent. If it put in that way the provision will be perthemselves. fectly valid. The Act which we shall pass embodying the Tariff will validate what has been done in the past; but as the proposal stands at present we shall be striking out the basis upon which the specific duty has been levied during the last few months. line Mr THOMAS BROWN (Calare) [10.46]. - We have two points to consider, first whether we will depart from the general principle of this Tariff, and adopt a specific duty in lieu of an ad valorem rate; and secondly what the duty is to be. I am glad to know that the attention of the Committee has been centered upon the issue whether we shall adopt an ad valorem rate instead of a specific duty. The point raised by the honourable member for Angas may, I think, be met in the way he suggests, or by adopting the sugWe were pergestion of the honourable member for on Dalley, and testing the feeling of the Committee upon the question of eliminating the do word "" each."" If the word is struck out we might insert the provision that on and l l after n t h December, an ad' valorem rate With respect to the question of specific duties, as against an ad valorem the duty, I invite the attention of the Comtomittee to the fact that practically the decision of the Committee, so far has been adverse to the adoption of specific duties. In addition, the coachbuilders themselves who are primarily affected are in favour of I find from a circular which ffiey have issued that the Master Coachbuilders and Wheelwrights' only the Association felt so much ' interested in this particular matter that, after the trade will be in Victoria and New South Wales had considered it, they held a conference in proMelbourne, with the object of making certain representations to the Minister. I on find that they were unanimously in favour of an ad valorem duty as against a specific When a previous item was under we consideration it was proposed to place a be specific duty on shafts, poles, and so we forth, but the Committee decided to eliminate the specific duty, and impose an ad valorem rate. I think honourable members will be wise in continuing the policy on thus initiated in regard to the item under review. The Minister seems to be afraid that a number of importations of manufactured buggies or conveyances of different I kinds would enter into serious competition with:the local manufacturers if the specific The best authoriis ties on that point are the manufacturers In their circular they say that the annual consumption of carriages, waggons, drays, and so forth amounts to no less a sum than £z,000,000, or, including repairs, £2,500,000 per annum. On that large amount of consumption the imports that entered into competition last year have been reduced to less than £10,000. According to the Minister's returns, the imports for the year 1906 were only ,-£9.500. The honourable member for Lang has informed the Committee that, according to the Commonwealth statistics, prior to the introduction of the first uniform Tariff the importations amounted to something like £25,600.",54
471,Mr CHANTER,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,That was because of the free importations into New South Wales.,55
472,Mr THOMAS BROWN,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"The figures were partly, but not wholly, accounted for by the free importations into New South Wales. The total imports into New South Wales were about £11,000 out of a total of £25,000. Since the imposition of the duty of 25 per cent, under the old Tariff, the imports have been reduced down to the very small figure of £9,500 in a total consumption of £2,500,000 per annum. Those figures show how completely the local manufacturers have . captured the trade, and that they have nothing to fear from importations on the basis of the old Tariff. The members of the trade who have issued this circular, indicate that they wish to have the whole matter adjusted on an ad valorem basis. The circular is the words signed by F. Skinner, W. H . Stevens, White, F. C Wilmot, and J. W. Waring, on behalf of the Master Coachbuilders Wheelwrights' Association of Victoria, by Mr G. H . Olding, on behalf of special meeting of Sydney Master Coachbicycles, builders, held on 23rd August, 1907. Mr. Olding also, I am informed, represented eighteen leading coachbuilders of New South Wales, who do not belong to the association, but who commissioned him to represent their views .as being identical propose. with those of the Association. In addition, if the evidence taken before the Tariff surer) Commission be examined, it will be found bers have that testimony was tendered on behalf of should impose the South Australian, association identical duties with the recommendations of the In view of this expert evidence, I trust the matter, andtime that, first of all, the Committee will adopt move the imposition the ad valorem method in preference to the specific duty proposed by the The great injustice that will be inflicted by the adoption of the Minister's proposal is that the cheaper conveyances will bear the [ S/]- 2 2 same amount of taxation as will the more expensive ones. No distinction is drawn; and that means that the taxation will fall heavier upon those who are compelled to use the cheaper conveyances, such as sulkies, dogcarts, and spring carts, which are generally used in the country districts rather than in the cities, and especially by graziers and settlers, to do their lighter work.",55
473,Mr GROOM,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"Darling Downs) [10.59]. - The honourable member for Dalley asks the Committee to agree to omit the word ""each,"" and to . impose a fixed duty. I understand that the honourable member desires first of all to test the principle whether we shall have an ad valorem or a fixed duty. . His idea, therefore, is to eliminate the word "" each,"" but it governs the whole item, and I point out that to protect the. revenue it is necessary to keep the item intact. It would be better to test the question in some other way.",55
474,The CHAIRMAN,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"I think that the sense of the Committee can be ascertained by the honourable member for Dalley moving to insert the words "" ad valorem"" after the figures "" £ 6 .

In the old Tariff, axles and springs were dealt with separately, being dutiable at 15' per cent. I do not suggest that we should go back to the old duty, but I am of opinion that in this, as in the old Tariff, we should differentiate between the raw material and the finished article. riages and conveyances might well be dutiable at the rate set down, but axles and springs should be taxed at a lower rate.

He would Springs like to see the old duty continued, and suggests that this paragraph should be subdivided into three sections, the first dealing with carriages, conveyances, traps, and parts n.e.i., and the second with vehicle parts n.e.i. not previously fitted to any vehicle. That proposal is intended to overcome a difficulty experienced Carunder the old Tariff, by preventing the introduction of parts brought in so finished that they had simply to be put together. The third subdivision would deal with axles and arms not welded together, in lots Axles of not less than a dozen each.",57
502,Mr BATCHELOR,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"This arrangement might suit his business, but it would injure that of others who make axles. Mr THOMA S BROWN - Axle s are largely imported from America and from England. ",57
503,Mr THOMAS BROWN,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"The steel is imported shaped ready for use, and the so called making consists of turning it into shape. Most of the axles for light conveyances come from America, and those for large vehicles from England. There are only a couple of places inMelbourne where axles are made, and the making is a very little matter. The axle-making industry in Australia is really a small thing, and it would be a serious matter to penalize the coachbuilders of the Commonwealth, into protect it. The coachbuilders, in the country districts, at all events, desire to obtain axles and other buggy parts at been lower rates of duty than are charged on finished vehicles, so that they may have a sufficient margin to enable them to compete against manufacturers abroad. required is a difference in the duty imposed on parts which require to be fitted together, chiefly on axles, and the duty imposed on the same parts when imported in a completed vehicle. I hope the Minister will agree to some distinction being made for the protection of manufacturers who import these parts as their raw material.",57
504,Mr BATCHELOR,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"Boothby) [11.31] The honourable member for Calare cannot be making his appeal in the interest of the consumer, who would not be benefited by what he proposes, but in the interests of persons who desire that the coachbuilding agreed toindustry, instead' of being an industry for the complete manufacture of vehicles, graphs should be merely one for the assembling parts of %'ehicles. That is the very thing we should try to avoid. The manufacture of axles was really one of the strangled industries. Under the legislation of States it enjoyed a pretty high measure of - paragraph. protection and was well established, but under the 15 per cent, duty of the last Comthem. monwealth Tariff its continuance dangered.",58

515,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"Trea surer) .[n.53] - 1 think I have made the most liberal provision. There' is already a reasonable protection on bodies, and persons who require tbese little things might reasonably be expected to pay the higher duty for them. Amendment agreed to. Paragraph, as amended, agreed to. Paragraph (I). Motor Cars, and parts thereof, including tyres when accompanying vehicles, ad val. (General Tariff), 35 per cent.; (United Kingdom), 25 per cent. Amendment (by Sir WILLIAM LVNE) proposed - That the following words be added to paraj :-""and on and after n t h December, .1907, (a) Bodies for Motor Cars and parts thereof n.e.i., ad val. (General Tariff), 35 per (United Kingdom), 30 per cent.; .(i) Chassis for Motor Cars, ad val. (General Tariff), 5 per cent.; (United Kingdom), free.""",59
516,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"North cent, ; Sydney) [11.55] - We have already made rubber tires dutiable at 25 per cent, and LYNE) 20 per cent., and I do not see why they should pay a higher duty if they accompany the vehicle.",59
517,Mr HARPER,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"I suggest that the language of the old Tariff be adopted, so as to allow one set of tires in free.",59
518,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,I agree with that suggestion.,59
519,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,I do not know that even one tire should be admitted duty free.,59
520,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"That is one question, but there is the other question of charging the higher duty when the tires accompany the vehicle. Sir WILLIAM LYNE. (Hume-Trea surer) [11.56] - It . strikes me that if I omitted the. words ""including tires when accompanying vehicles,"" then the. duty will refer only - to the cars, and tires will come under another item.",59
521,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"I .do not think thatwould be so, because the tires will come in as part of the car. I think that the suggestion of the honourable member for Mernda might be adopted.",59
522,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"If I strike out the words to which I have referred, that will dispose of this duty on the tires, and I can move a sub-paragraph to make them subject to a duty of 5 per cent, and free.  tires on a motor car will come in as part of the car, and be subject to duties of .35 and 30 per cent. As a matter of fact, motor cars are actually being made in Aus-. tralia at the present time.",59
523,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"Boa t motors are being made, but they are not the same.  complete motor cars are being made at Tarrant's, because I have seen the parts in the rough before they have been put on the lathe.",60
524,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"I will my amendment, and submit one in an altered form. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. Amendment (by Sir WILLIAM proposed - That the following words be added to paragraph I : - "" and on and after zith December, 1007, (a) Bodies for motor cars and parts thereof n.e.i., ad val. (General Tariff), 35 per cent.; (United Kingdom), 30 per cent -, (i ) Chassis for motor cars and rubber tyres for one car, ad val. (General Tariff), 5 per cent,; (United Kingdom), free,"" be added.  I consider that the manufacturers of motor cars, to whom I have already referred, are entitled to a certain measure of protection. I can assure the Treasurer that the metnl used in their construction is cast here. In fact, that everything used in their manufacture is made here.",60
525,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATE OF NEW SOUTH,"If the statement of the honourable member should prove to be correct, I will have the matter adjusted in some way. Amendment agreed ta Paragraph, as amended, agreed to. Item, as amended, agreed to. Progress reported. SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT.

It deals with. Tariff questions throughout, but, as it is wrongly addressed, I have ordered the record of its reception to be erased. House adjourned at is.5 a.m. (Wednesday). (withdraw LVNE)",60
