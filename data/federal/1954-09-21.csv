1,Mr WENTWORTH,PROCLAMATION,"MackeUar) j|l'0.65 J - In the few minutes that remain : for this debate, I wish to associate myself with the remarks of the honourable membei for Angas (Mr Downer) and the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr . EJ.am-es Harrison) about the necessity to complete swiftly the short standard .guage rail link between Broken Hill and Port. Pirie. At present, the 4-ft. 8£-in. standard gauge Commonwealth line which goes, from Port Pirie to Kalgoorlie, and also from' Port Augusta up towards Leigh Greek, is isolated from the rest of the standard gauge transport system. If we could provide the small link that is missing, we? would be able' to move rolling-stock on and off that line in case of emergency, and that is important. Let mesay also that we should, concurrently, do something about providing a standard .gauge line from Port PirietoAdelaide. I think that eould be done by converting - one of die two 5-ft 3-in. lines which at present run down virtually in parallel. It would not be a very difficult matter to arrange. As the committee knows, the line running northwards from Port AjUgns&L fio Eeigh Creek, is at present being converted from 3 f t 6 in. to 4 f t S i in. to permit coal traffic to be handled', with, greater economy. If , as I say, we had a standard gauge line from Port Pirie to Adelaide, that would give us a clear flow of coal traffic from Leigh Creek to Adelaide. It would also allow the. rocket range at Woomera to be connected, directly with the workshops at '-Salisbury wiiich service it . Then if we - completed the link, as I have suggested, from Broken Hill to Port Pirie, we would ""be also able to run standard gauge trains from Brisbane and Sydney right to Adelaide. I know these are matters which. require money, but I do not believe they require an exorbitant, amount of money. I - believe that' the works I sugr gest' are economically desirable and stand by themselves as commercial propositions, bnt far addition, they would add considerably'to the defence potential of Australia. There is just one other' point that I sbould like to make in the couple of minutes' that remain. I agree with the honourable member for Blaxland that one - of the great featuresin the operation of upon notice-the Commonwealth railways has been tbo ""-introduction of. diesel-electric: locomotives. B-155 1 There is a. g&odl story to. bee toW is that regard, aad I believe i£at the Government and the Commonwealth, BailwaysCommissioner have something to beproud of.. The: lessons learned should be applied more generally ta the railway systems., of the various States. There is one other factor:. The trans-Australian railway is a long through ran, and the railways should be concentrated much more on the long through runs, rather than on the short hauls. It is probable that, for short hauls, other forms of transport can operate effectively. It is particularly on the long uninterrupted runs that the railway comes into its own, and we should be concentrating on that aspect. Proposed votes agreed to. Progress reported: 1 PAPERS.

2,Mr BBYSOW,PROCLAMATION,"the Prime' Minister, On how many occasions has {a), the ""guillotine."" and (a) the. closure been mased by the Oovernment in the lifetime of eaoh ot the following Parliaments-the nineteenth, twentieth and the twenty-first!",11
3,Mr MKNZIKB,PROCLAMATION,"The information requested by the honourable member is aa undei - 1 Nineteenth Parliament (22nd February, I960, to 19th March, 1951) - "" Guillotine "" moved by Oovernment, five occasions; closure moved by Government,. 41 occasions; closure moved by Opposition, one occasion.

4,Mr COUTTS,PROCLAMATION,"the Minister for Social Services, upon notice- r 1. Whnt is the system of payment to builders of war service homes for work performed, e.g., initial payment, second advance and final payment? 2. How long after completion of tha.job does the builder have to wait for final payment? 3. How many inspections are made of the work performed and at what stages are they made? . 4. What is the ratio of homes built through the division to existing homes An as eed by that body!",12
5,Mr MOMAHON,PROCLAMATION,"The answers to the honourable member's questions axe as' increase follows 1. Payments up to 90 per cent, of the value of increase work completed efficiently are made to builders of as they desire, providing there is a reasonable value of work completed. In some cases, payments are made weekly, in others fortnightly, having regard to the rate of progress builder. No payment would be made, of follows:course, until the foundations were laid, but after that there is no' set period and the builder the 1.price can obtain progress payments frequently if he of State control so desires, providing his progress is satisauthority lifted factory. In special advance cases, i.e., where manufactures in May the applicant enters into the contract the builder and an outside architect is employed, the London metal market asinisconformity the only inspections by the division are when other metals such as lead and tin. the builder requests a progress payment and the applicant's architect certifies that has been done. Payments by the applicant the builder or other value contributed direct the applicant with the division's approval taken into consideration in the 90 per cent. 2. If the builder completes the. work factorily and-does not leave outstanding items, the payment is made immediately the final ' inspection report is received, and the builder submits documents and invoices re prime cost items, &c, as required by his contract. ' This payment covers all amounts except the maintenance retention money, which is £30 unless, as stated, there are outstanding items. 3. The essential stages at which inspections are required are-(a ) when the' foundation trenches, Sc., have been dug and if concrete foundations are involved, then during, the pouring of the concrete foundations; (b) when the skeleton of the structure has been erected, before the floor .is laid or the walls are sheathed; (o) wben the roof framing is erected, before the covering is attached; (d)* during the installation of tha services and the 6nish-' ing; and (e) on completion. The procedure is for regular supervision and in those cases in which the home is being erected in the metropolitan area, this ie performed by officers of the division by visits at least once a week wben the. progress is such that weekly visits are necessary,' and in other circumstances, once a fortnight. In countiy districts, where the Department of Works supervises on behalf of HOUSING. the division, it is not always possible to make the same number of visits. . 4. During 1952-53, 5,848 homes were built by the division and' 6,574 were financed. During 1953-54, 6,290 bomes were built by the division and 6,109 were financed. ZINO.",12
6,Mr FITZGERALD,PROCLAMATION,"the Minister for Supply, upon notice I. Is it a fact that sine dust manufactured in Tasmania has increased in price throughout New Sonth Walee from £86 to £168 a. ton to bring, it to the average price of zinc on the London market? 2. If so, and, keeping in mind the huge that will occur Tn building costs, will the Oovernment take action to offset the prioe of zinc, zinc oxide, steel and galvanized iron to the English price plus the. addition the exchange rate?",12
7,Mr BEAU,PROCLAMATION,"The - answers to ' the by the honourable member's questions are as The Commonwealth Oovernment vacated, field some years ago in favour governments. The State prices all controls on zinc and zinc last since when the with local prices havefluctuated with the case with The sole Australian producer of zinc dust is Electrolytic the workZinc Company of Australasia Limited, who to advise that the current price of zinc dust if hy £144 15s. a ton f.o.b. Bisdon in 10-ton lots. are Tbis would roughly be equivalent to £168 in New South Wales depending on the margin satisadded by distributors. When price control was lifted in May lost, the f.o.b. Risdon price for zinc duet was £116 a ton. It is many years since this price was so low as to allow distributors in New South Wales to sell at £86 a ton. 2. Zinc dust is not used in the production of zinc oxide or galvanized iron, only a few hundred tons being used annually and for euch purposes as bleaches in cyanide plants and the manufacture of zinc saltsThe price of. zinc dust therefore has no effect on building costs. MANUS ISLAND.",12
8,Mr KEON,PROCLAMATION,"the Prime Minister, upon noticeWill he lay on the table of the Library relevant documents involved in the negotiations with the TJnited States of America regarding the retention of Manus Island as - i base by the United States forces?",13
9,Mr MENZIES,PROCLAMATION,"The documents which the honourable member refers; which relate principally to the period of the previous Government, could not be published without disclosing secret communications of otber governments. Before any publication of the views of these governments, their consent would have to be obtained and, in the circumstances, it is not reasonable to expect such concurrence to be given. I therefore regret that it will not be possible to meet the wishes of the honourable member, and accordingly I am unable to table any documents on this matter just now. COMMONWEALTH AKBITRATTON COUBT.",13
10,Mr MENZIES,PROCLAMATION,"On the 8th September, the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr Ward) asked the following question :Can the Prime Minister say whether it is a fact that the travelling allowances payable to the judges of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court were increased and made retrospective, with effect from the 1st December. 1953? Are these the same gentlemen who refused the application of certain unions for the adjustments of margins for skill in their respective awards on the ground thsit the state of the national economy did not justify the granting of such increases? If so, will the right honourable gentleman say whether this factor was taken into account by the Government when .considering the adjustment of the judges' travelling allowances! Finally, have any of the judges declined the increased payment on the ground that, having regard to the state of the national economy, such increases should not be approved? I promised the honourable member that I would ascertain the facts and make tbem available. I now find that full details of the action taken were conveyed to the honourable member by the Attorney General on the 29th March, 1954. There has been no variation in the position paper mills, gold since that date. EDUCATION. On the 7th September, the honourable member for Kingston (Mr Galvin) asked the following question:Will the Prime Minister cause inquiries to all be made into the recent stipulation - of the authorities which control Commonwealth scholarships, that these arc not to be paid unless they reach a m minium of £10? Is he aware that the decision permits of payments of fees of part-time students who are attending to the universities in New South Wales and Victoria to study one or two subjects but the students who are doing the same subjects at the university in South Australia, where fees are being kept low, are deprived of their scholarships? Will the right honourable gentleman ensure that South Australian students shall not he penalized merely because they happen to live in South Australia?",13
11,Mr MENZIES,PROCLAMATION,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Universities Commission has decided not to award benents under the Commonwealth scholarship scheme to students undertaking a part-time course in any year in which the benefits are less than £10. As a result of this decision scholarships which would he taken up by sueh students may now he awarded to students who can derive substantial benefits from the scholarship as, for instance, full-time students entitled to a living allowance. Generally, the type of student who is excluded from benefits under this decision is a part-time student who either has private means or is in employment. The Universities Commission, however, has discretion in this mitter and is prepared to ' consider, with the students' interests in mind, the case of able students whose studies are being prejudiced because of nnanciai hardship. This would include cases in which a student is in employment and is having financial difficulty in meeting his commitments. Such cases may he referred to the Universities Commission by the Education Departments who are responsible for the detailed administration of the scheme. The honourable member can be assured that South Australian students arc not penalized by the operation of the minimum benefits rule. Tn general, students at the University of Adelaide are required to pay more than £10 in fees whether their courses are on a full-time or a part-time basis. Tf, however, there are special circumstances which result in students being required to \>ay less than £10 in any one year, students concerned should, if they feel that their studies are prejudiced through nnanciai difficulties, raise the matter with the Education Deparfnrcnt of South Australia who may,, after examination-, refer it to the Universities Commission. AMMUNITION..",13
12,Mr WIGHT,PROCLAMATION,"the Minister for the Army, upon notice I. Is it a fact that the Army is regularly dumping in the oca ammunition and scifip metal worth thousands of pounds? 2. Were 500 tons of old and. obsolete ammunition, dumped off Sydney Heads last month? 3. If.' so, is this only one of a number of instances in which, valuable metals, mostly brass, arcdumped when they could, be. reclaimed? 4. If this is correct, will he investigate methods employed in the United. Kingdom for recovery of. valuable, metals from obsolete wartime equipment and ammunition with a view to saving the Commonwealth. Government, many thousands of. pounds?",14
13,Mr FRANCIS,PROCLAMATION,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows : 1. All surplus' stocks of ammunition, explosives, and empty ammunition components aro declared, for disposal to the Department of Supply. An inter-departmental committee'considers all such items issued hy disposal, and recommends the method of disposal. The policy followed is that no item, dangerous to public safety or security, is permitted to reach the hands of the public; as much material as. possible is diverted to useful channels, and as much metal' as economically possible is recovered for sale as scrap. In general, all cartridges, powder filled fuzes, and large calibre shell are hrofcen down or boiled out and the metal recovered for sale as scrap. Filled shell of small calibres are normally sentenced for destruction. Explosive items, which are. found to be in a dangerous condition, arc disposed of by demolition or by dumping in deep seas. 2. Yes. The 500 tons of ammunition dumped off Sydney at the end of Augustcontained no brass or other valuable metals, the salvage of which would have been an' economical proposition, having regard to practicability of recovery and public safety. 3'. The quantity of all scrap metale recovered from break-down operations for the year 1953-54 was G03.5 tons valued at £47,253. The quantify and - value of brass, mixed me .nl (brass and lead), lead, copper and cupro nickel recovered in the same period was 2S0. tons and £43,062 respectively. 4. The Departments of the Navy, Arm y and Defence Production arc fully aware of all methods used in the United Kingdom for recovery of ammunition components and valuable metals, and officers of these departments are continually studying any new m?tnod<*, which may be devised. The most modern methods are employed in Australia where applicable in the recovering, of ammunition residues hy Departments of Navy and Armv. f",14
