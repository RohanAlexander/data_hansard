2,Mr CREAN,Unknown,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to provide for a single Act imposing levies on coarse grains for the purpose of funding research. The Bill incorporates the existing barley and triticale levies and extends the coverage of coarse grains to oats and cereal rye. The levies will attract matching Commonwealth contributions as provided for under the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989. These arrangements are being implemented at the request of the Grains Council of Australia on behalf of coarse grain producers after consultations with other relevant industry bodies, including the Triticale Grain Association of Australia, which is the representative industry body under the Triticale Levy Act 1988. The GCA is currently the representative industry body for barley and has been nominated as such for oats and cereal rye. To date, barley and triticale research levies have been imposed under separate Acts which in the main are only differentiated by product specific provisions.",10
3,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! The right honourable member for New England and the honourable member for Gwydir might resume their seats.,10
4,Mr CREAN,Unknown,"The oats and cereal rye levy arrangements will be similar. Consequently, omnibus levy legislation has been developed covering these grains with provision for other coarse grains to be added by regulation having regard to any recommendation of the relevant growers' organisation. The Barley Research Levy Act 1980 and the Triticale Levy Act 1988 will be repealed under the related Coarse Grains Levy (Consequential Provisions) Bil11992, which includes provisions to ensure continuity of current levy arrangements for these grains. Implementing research levies for oats and cereal rye represents an extension of the Government's policy of encouraging increased contributions by primary industry for rural research, which was established in 1985. The Government made a commitment then to continue matching expenditure of approved industry levies on a dollar for dollar basis up to 0.5 per cent of the gross value of production of the relevant industry. This policy was reaffmned in the May 1989 Government statement 'Research, Innovation and Competitiveness' . With regard to the new crops to be levied, oats production has, in recent seasons, varied between 1.4 and 1.6 million tonnes per year with the gross value of production averaging $ 172m in the three years to 1991-92. Production is centred mainly in Western Australia, estimated at 32 per cent in 1991-92; New South Wales, 28 per cent; Victoria, 19 per cent; and South Australia, 19 per cent. The greater proportion of the oats crop-an estimated 72 per cent in 1991-92-is used on the domestic market where oats have long been an important supplement to the successful operation of grazing enterprises involving sheep and cattle. Oats are used either as a grazing supplement and for fodder reserves, or for the production of hay and silage. Export sales of grain, which average around 220,000 tonnes annual1y, are also an important outlet which is expected to earn around $32m in 1991-92. In addition to these benefits, the production and consumption of milling oats, used for human consumption, have been expanding as a result of increased demand for health products which has created an opportunity to expand oats markets both in Australia and overseas. The cereal rye industry is small but has the capacity to expand its domestic market, particularly in the health food market where more research and promotion is desirable. Australian production of approximately 20,000 tonnes per annum is concentrated in the mallee regions of Victoria and South Australia. Although production is small, it plays an important role in overall farm management. Cereal rye is one of the few cropping alternatives for the mallee sandhills, not only allowing producers to obtain an economic return from land that may otherwise be left idle but also preventing erosion and stabilising these soils. The demand for cereal rye in Australia has centred around the consumption of rye-based bread, biscuits and breakfast cereals. The recent upsurge in food and lifestyle awareness has resulted in a major upswing in the interest in, and demand for, health foods. Overall demand for rye has not always been satisfied from domestic production, which has necessitated imports in recent years which peaked at 10,000 tonnes in 1989-90. Research funding for oats and cereal rye has in the past been obtained from a combination of Commonwealth and State government and industry sources such as the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation, and its predecessor the Australian Special Rural Research Council, CSIRO, State agriculture departments and universities. However, funding under these programs has not been sufficient to allow these industries to address adequately the range of research and development issues confronting them. The establishment of joint Commonwealthindustry research schemes for oats and cereal rye will broaden the research funding base for these industries and assist in enabling them to achieve their full potential not only on the domestic front but also from an export perspective. The operative levy rates for barley and triticale will remain unchanged at $0.75 per tonne and $1 per tonne respectively. However, with the agreement of the prescribed grower organisations, the Bill provides for these rates to be increased by regulation up to a maximum of $5 per tonne. Initially, the operative levy rates for oats and cereal rye will be 0.5 per cent of the value of the grain with provision for these to be increased by regulation up to a maximum of 5 per cent of the value of the grain. The manner in which the sales value of the grain will be ascertained for levy purposes will be set out in regulations, following further consultations with industry. The introduction of value based levies for oats and cereal rye at the request of the Grains Council of Australia reflects the Council's policy of relating the amount of levy payable more directly to the return received by the producer. A value based levy has applied to wheat since 1989. For all coarse grains, operative rates of levies may be increased by regulation only after consideration of any recommendations to the Minister by relevant grower organisations. The levies relating to each of the coarse grains involved will be payable by the producer of that grain and collected in accordance with the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991. Administrative and organisational arrangements for the research schemes will be the responsibility of the Grains Research and Development Corporation. Amounts equal to the individual levies and the Commonwealth's matching contributions will be paid into separate accounts under the management of the Grains Research and Development Corporation. The Corporation is required under its enabling legislation to account separately for expenditure of levy revenue derived from each type of grain. Additional expenditure resulting from the extension of matching Commonwealth funding to oats and cereal rye will not commence before 1993-94. At the proposed levy rate of 0.5 per cent of the value of the grain, matching Commonwealth contributions for 1993-94 are estimated at approximately $250,000 for oats and $20,000 for cereal rye. The cost to the Budget of the Commonwealth matching contributions for the existing barley and triticale schemes is estimated at $3.1m and $90,000 respectively for 1992-93. Similar outlays are expected in 1993-94. The Bill will commence on 1 October 1992 to coincide with the commencement of the crop year for all grains involved. I commend the Bill to honourable members and present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. Debate (on motion by Dr Kemp) adjourned. NA (CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) First Reading . Bill presented by Mr Crean, and read a first time. Second Reading",10
5,Mr CREAN,COARSE GRAINS LEVY,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill is complementary to the Coarse Grains Levy Bill 1992, which I have just introduced. Its purpose is to enact certain consequential amendments to related legislation, to repeal two existing levy Acts and to provide for other necessary transitional arrangements to enable the continuing collection of industry levies to fund barley and triticale research. The levies to be imposed by the Coarse Grains Levy Bill 1992 will be collected under the provisions of the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991. This Bill extends the definition in that Act of 'producer', which presently applies to producers of barley and triticale, to producers of other leviable coarse grain. Provision is also made for the Coarse Grains Levy Bi111992, when enacted, to be included as an associated Act listed in the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991. As the levies for barley and triticale research will in future be imposed under a new single Act, this Bill provides for the repeal of the existing Acts imposing levies on these grains. A transitional provision ensures the continuing collection of these levies. I commend the Bill to honourable members and present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. Debate (on motion by Dr Kemp) adjourned. DEER SLAUGHTER LEVY BILL 1992 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Crean, and read a first time. Second Reading BILL 1992 Mr CREAN (Hotham-Minister for Primary Industries and Energy) (10.12 a.m.)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill forms part of a package of five Bills to institute levies and charges on the deer industry in order to fund a research and development program. The proposed levies and charges have been requested by the Deer Farmers Federation of Australia, which represents the majority of deer fanners in Australia. The purpose of this Bill is to provide for the imposition of a levy on the slaughter of deer in Australia. Three other Bills in this package provide for: a charge on the export of deer produced in Australia; levy on the sale of deer velvet produced and sold in Australia, or used in the production of other goods in Australia; and a charge on the export of deer velvet produced in Australia. The fifth Bill in this package makes provision for consequential amendments to the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991. The Australian deer industry is an emerging industry moving from a rapidly expanding phase with heavy dependence on breeding stock sales, to a more mature situation where venison and velvet are the principal income sources. The deer herd has been growing at about 25 per cent per annum on average in recent years. It is estimated that there were about 155,000 deer on over 1,000 farms at the end of 1991. The main species are fallow deer and red deer, which make up 50 per cent and 40 per cent of the herd respectively. The remaining 10 per cent comprises mainly tropical species. Velvet production offers producers an additional source of income from deer farming, with most velvet being destined for medicinal use in Asia. There is also a small by-product industry producing leather. The approximate value of industry production is estimated at $6m at present. This is expected to double in three years with a herd of 200,000. If the downstream sectors of the industry such as abattoirs, tanneries, wholesale, retail, and exporters are considered, total outputs are predicted to be around $50m. The Government is strongly committed to building competitiveness and expanding the productive capacity in industries, particularly the primary industries whose contribution to exports underpin our economy. The Government's rural research and development policy is central to building competitiveness and expanding productive capacity in rural industries. The Commonwealth provides funding to match industry levies up to 0.5 per cent of the annual gross value of production, encouraging increased rural productivity and profitability through research and the commercialisation of research findings. The Government has to date been funding research and development in the deer industry through the Australian Special Rural Research Fund which is administered by the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation. The deer industry is determined to establish itself as a long term viable rural industry. A deer industry action plan has been jointly developed by the Deer Farmers Federation of Australia and the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation and has been welcomed by deer producers. This plan is the result of analysis of the strategic options in the marketing, processing, and production sectors of the Australian deer industry. The implementation of this plan by the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation is being funded in 1991-92 from the Australian special rural research fund. This is currently augmented by voluntary levies, being collected by the Deer Farmers Federation of Australia, on deer numbers behind wire and on deer slaughtered. In order to raise sufficient funds to implement an effective research and development program in production, processing and marketing aspects of the deer industry, the industry has now chosen to have a statutory levy on all producers. Industry contributions are expected to be $100,000 in 1992-93, compared with an estimated $25,000 under voluntary levies in 1991-92, and will increase as industry output grows. In providing matching funding the Commonwealth will outlay about $30,000 in 1992-93 rising to approximately $60,000 in 1994-95. The levies and charges paid by the producer will be collected in accordance with the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991. The producer levies and charges and Commonwealth contribution will be paid into a separate sub-account under the administration of the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation. Further Commonwealth funding may also be provided by the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation through the Australian special rural research fund. This particular Bill relates to the imposition of a levy on the slaughter of deer to take effect from 1 July 1992. The operative rate of levy is to be set at 18c per kilogram on the hot dressed carcass weight with the maximum rate of levy to be set at 30c per kilogram on the hot dressed carcass weight. The Bill provides for changes to the operative rate of levy to be set by regulation. Prior to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy making any recommendation to the Governor General on the operative rate of levy, the Minister is to take into consideration any relevant advice from the Deer Farmers Federation of Australia and any other prescribed organisation. Any future operative rates must fall within the legislated maximum rate. Mr Speaker, it is pleasing to be able to bring these Bills before the House. They mark the emergence of another viable rural industry which will further broaden the economic base of agriculture, replacing imports and expanding into the export market. At the far m level, the establishment of a viable deer industry in Australia offers the opportunity to diversify income sources and reduce exposure to individual commodity downturns. I commend the Bill to honourable members. I present the explanatory memorandum to the Deer Slaughter Levy Bill, the Deer Export Charge Bill, the Deer Velvet Levy Bill, the Deer Velvet Export Charge Bill and the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Bill. Debate (on motion by Dr Kemp) adjourned. DEER EXPORT CHARGE BILL 1992 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Crean, and read a first time. Second Reading",12
6,Mr CREAN,COARSE GRAINS LEVY,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to provide for imposition of a charge on the export of deer produced in Australia. The Bill provides for changes to the operative rate of charge to be set by regulation. Prior to the Minister making any recommendations to the Governor General on the operative rate of charge, the Minister is to take into consideration any relevant advice from the Deer Farmers Federation of Australia and any other prescribed organisation. Any, future operative rates must fall within the legislated maximum rate. The operative rate of charge will be set at $10 per head of deer exported while the maximum rate will be set at $20 per head of deer exported. I commend the Bill to honourable members. Debate (on motion by Dr Kemp) adjourned. DEER VELVET LEVY BILL 1992 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Crean, and read a first time. Second Reading",14
7,Mr CREAN,COARSE GRAINS LEVY,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to provide for the imposition of a levy on the sale of deer velvet produced and sold in Australia. This Bill also provides for the imposition of a levy on deer velvet used in the production of other goods where, at the time that velvet is used in the production of other goods, that velvet had not been previously sold. The operative rate of levy is to be set at 5 per cent of the sale value of velvet, and 5 per cent of the declared value of velvet used in the production of other goods, with the maximum rate of levy in both circumstances to be set at 7 per cent. While it may have been easier to administer a levy and export charge on velvet based on a set rate per unit weight, industry has requested an ad valorem rate of levy and export charge to give greater producer equity as the velvet can be highly variable in quality and consequently highly variable in value. The Bill provides for changes to the operative rate of levy to be set by regulation. Prior to the Minister making any recommendation to the Governor General on the operative rate of levy, the Minister is to take into consideration any relevant advice from the Deer Farmers Federation of Australia and any other prescribed organisation. Any future operative rates must fall within the legislated maximum rate. I commend the Bill to honourable members. Debate (on motion by Dr Kemp) adjourned.

8,Mr CREAN,DEER VELVET EXPORT CHARGE,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to provide for the imposition of a charge on the export of deer velvet produced in Australia. The operative rate of charge is to be set at 5 per cent of the declared value of the velvet exported with the maximum rate to be set at 7 per cent. An ad valorem rate of charge has been applied for grower equity reasons as velvet is highly variable in quality and value. The Bill provides for changes to the operative rate of charge to be set by regulation. Prior to the Minister making any recommendation to the Governor General on the operative rate of charge, the Minister is to take into consideration any relevant advice from the Deer Farmers Federation of Australia and any other prescribed organisation. Any future operative rates must fall within the legislated maximum rate. I commend the Bill to honourable members. Debate (on motion by Dr Kemp) adjourned.

9,Mr CREAN,CHARGES COLLECTION,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill amends the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991, allowing the deer industry levy and charge Bills to be attached to this Act which provides an administrative infrastructure for the collection of the levies and charges. I commend the Bill to honoura.ble members. Debate (on motion by Dr Kemp) adjourned. NA REGULATION BILL 1992 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Duncan, and read a first time. Second Reading",15
10,Mr DUNCAN,MUTUAL ASSISTANCE IN BUSINESS,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. In recent times we have seen the rapid internationalisation of financial markets. In practice, geographic and political boundaries are becoming more and more irrelevant to the way in which the world goes about its business. This trend towards internationalisation has led in turn to world markets becoming increasingly interdependent. Trends in one national market have immediate effects on other markets throughout the world. No better example of this interdependence can be found than in the stock market crash of 1987 which spread almost simultaneously through the world's established and emerging securities markets. This process of internationalisation creates administrative, jurisdictional, detection and enforcement difficulties not only for the international aspect of trading but also for the regulation of domestic markets. This in tum increases the scope for the pursuit of undesirable market practices across national boundaries and the penetration of domestic markets by undesirable operators. Integral to the maintenance of investor confidence in, and the efficiency of, national financial markets must be the development of effective international cooperation between the national business regulatory agencies responsible for administering and monitoring those markets. This cooperation involves the capacity to seek from, and provide to, such agencies in other countries flexible, speedy and effective assistance. This need for increased cooperation and assistance has been recognised in a number of international forums. The International Organisation of Securities Commissions has called upon its member organisations to provide reciprocal assistance in obtaining information in respect of market oversight and prevention of fraud. At the Commonwealth Law Ministers meeting in Auckland in 1990, Ministers identified the need for mutual assistance in the area of business regulation. That meeting noted that voluntary cooperation between agencies needed to be reinforced by legislative provisions to enable powers of compulsion to be exercised in the fulfilment of requests in appropriate cases. Similarly, the OECD, in its review of the impact of internationalisation on financial markets, noted the need to achieve worldwide regulatory coverage of international conglomerates. The OECD recommended the development of arrangements for exchanges of information between national regulators which supervise different parts of financial conglomerates as one way of ensuring appropriate regulation of these bodies. ill answer to these international calls for closer cooperation, this Bill sets work for Australian agencies, such as the Australian Securities Commission and the Trade Practices Commission, to provide assistance to their overseas counterparts. As a result of the legislation, these agencies will be better placed to seek assistance in their own investigations from their foreign counterparts. ill short, the proposed legislation would enable prescribed Australian agencies, with the Attorney-General's consent, to compel the provision of information documents and sworn testimony in aid of requests from foreign agencies. The scheme established by this Bill will complement the obtaining and exchange of information between countries for the purposes of criminal prosecutions which is established by the' Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act. Under the proposed scheme for mutual assistance between business regulators, applications by the foreign agency will be made to the Australian agency in the first instance, which will make an initial assessment of the application and either reject or pass it on to the Attorney-General. ill making this initial decision, the prescribed agency will take into account amongst other things: . the resource cost to the Australian agency; the availability of the same information to the foreign agency from other sources; the likelihood of the Australian agency successfully obtaining the information sought in the application; the extent to which the foreign agency has corresponding functions and responds to or is likely to respond to a similar request from an Australian agency, including the existence of any memorandum of understanding between the applicant and the prescribed agency relating to mutual assistance. If the Australian agency does not reject the application, the Attorney-General may decide whether to authorise the collection of the information sought by taking the following up the frame- matters into account: national interest considerations; intemationallaw and comity including whether the overseas agency has a corresponding facility to provide mutual assistance; whether the information sought is likely to be used for the purpose of punishing a person for an offence of a political nature or punishing or prejudicing a person on account of a person's race, sex, religion, nationality or political characteristics; whether the information is sought for the purposes of the administration or enforcement of business regulatory laws as opposed to an investigation of indictable criminal offences such as organised crime, in which case recourse should ordinarily be had to the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act. Where the Attorney-General has authorised the Australian agency to act on a request, the agency will be able to require a person to: provide specified information, evidence or documents relating to the subject of a request contained in the application; attend before the agency or a member of the agency to provide information on oath or affirmation; otherwise assist the Australian agency in responding to the request contained in the application. The Bill will also contain extensive safeguards to ensure that persons who are required to provide assistance are appropriately protected. First, hearings will be held in private, with attendance being limited to persons whose presence is requested by the witness or whose presence is authorised by the Commonwealth agency taking the information and representatives of the foreign regulator. Witnesses will be able to be represented by a lawyer or by any other person with relevant expertise, such as an accountant or an expert of the law of the requesting agency's country. Witnesses will be eligible to be paid travelling and other expenses. While self-incrimination will not be a reasonable excuse for failing to answer a request by the Commonwealth agency, selfincriminatory evidence or information, as opposed to documents, will not be able to be used for criminal proceedings against that person. In addition, foreign agencies which request assistance in obtaining information or evidence will be required to provide undertakings that any such evidence provided by a person that incriminates that person will not be used by that agency in criminal proceedings against that person. The level of protection against self-incrimiunderstand nation which is provided by this Bill corresponds with the level of protection which will be available to persons required to provide assistance to the Australian Securities Commission in its domestic investigations as a result of the amendments contained in the Corporations Legislation (Evidence) Amendment Bill 1992. Similarly, the Bill preserves to an appropriate degree legal professional privilege. In addition to these safeguards, the provisions of the Privacy Act will continue to apply to Commonwealth agencies when gathering information under this legislation. Persons required to provide assistance will have the benefit of the comprehensive protection in that Act relating to the collection and use of personal information. During 1991, Parliament passed three important corporations law measures. A fourth reform Bill was exposed for public comment earlier this month. This Bill complements those corporate law reforms by ensuring that Australian agencies play an integral role in international business regulation. I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Costello) adjourned. NA (EVIDENCE) AMENDMENT BILL 1992 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Duncan, and read a first time. Second Reading",15
11,Mr DUNCAN,CORPORATIONS LEGISLATION,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to remove certain immunities available to witnesses under the Australian Securities Commission, ASC, law and the corporations law. The need for the legislation arises from difficulties encountered by the Australian Securities Commission in investigating complex corporate frauds, to which I shall refer shortly. At the outset, however, it is necessary to the background against which the issues addressed in this Bill arise. It has been an established rule of the common law, since the seventeenth century, that a person cannot be compelled to incriminate himself, and may refuse to answer any question, or produce any document or thing, which may put hi- at risk of conviction. This rule arose out of the principle, fundamental to our system of justice, that the Crown must prove the gUilt of accused persons, rather than allow the Executive to require suspects to convict themselves out of their own mouths. In various circumstances, however, legislatures have recognised that the intende.d purpose of a statute may only be achieved by either limiting or abrogating this privilege against self-incrimination. The superseded cooperative scheme companies legislation, which preceded the current national scheme legislation, was such a case. Under that scheme the National Companies and Securities Commission could conduct examinations in which the common law privilege against self-incrimination was excluded by legislation. In return, the legislation provided an immunity, known as the 'use immunity' which prevented answers which tended to be selfincriminatory from later being used in evidence against a person in criminal proceedings or proceedings for the imposition of a penalty. In 1983, the then Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia, in the decision Sorby v. The Commonwealth (1983) 152 CLR 281, criticised a narrow application of such use immunities, stating that evidence obtained through, or derived from, the evidence protected by the use immunity should also be inadmissible in proceedings against the person-the so-called 'derivative use immunity'. This suggestion was taken up by the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, when in its 1984 report on the National Crime Authority Bill 1983 it advocated that where the privilege against selfincrimination was abolished by Parliament, the prosecution should be unable to use in evidence either the actual incriminating words and documents produced under compulsion, or any evidence discovered as a result of those words and documents. This 'use/derivative use immunity' is now applied by the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. In reporting on the Australian Securities Commission Bill, however, the Joint Select Committee on Corporations Legislation stated, at paragraph 4.60, its belief that: Subclause 68(3) [drafted in compliance with the Scrutiny of Bills Committee's policy of 'use/derivative use immunity'] will not unnecessariquite ly or unacceptably act to abrogate the privilege against self-incrimination if it were amended to apply only to statements made by a person and not to any information, document or any other thing obtained as a direct or indirect consequence of the person making the statement. Though suggesting that removal of the derivative use immunity would be appropriate, the Committee did not include a recommendation to that effect in its report. Subsection 68(3) of the ASC law therefore provides a use/derivative use immunity in respect of information obtained by the ASC in investigations. The Australian Securities Commission and the Director of Public Prosecutions, the agencies responsible respectively for investigating and prosecuting corporate fraud, have been experiencing serious problems in bringing effective prosecutions as the 'use immunity' prevents the admission of evidence of the fact that a particular person produced a particular document, and the 'derivative use immunity' protects evidence gained as a result of answers to questions. The problems being experienced may be understood from a hypothetical example. To protect shareholders and creditors of a corporation under investigation, the ASC may consider that its assets should be frozen and its dealings restrained. To do this, evidence may need to be obtained under compulsion from a key person. However, as any incriminating information gained, together with any evidence derived from that information, would attract immunity, that person could not subsequently be prosecuted. To avoid this, the ASC may try to obtain the evidence without questioning major suspects. While it does so, assets may be concealed or dissipated, disadvantaging creditors and shareholders. Thus, pursuit of remedies for the protection of shareholders and creditors may prevent successful criminal prosecutions, while major suspects whose evidence could uncover other serious offences calling for wider inquiries tend to be questioned narrowly, if at all, because the derivative use immunity provisions would allow them to escape conviction and punishment. It is also possible for persons to exploit, consciously, the immunity provisions by claiming that answers may tend to be selfincriminating, then making a full confession, thereby ensuring that no evidence will be admissible against them in criminal proceedings. Another problem arising from the application of the provisions is that complex cases involve the admission into evidence of hundreds, even thousands, of documents, all or many of which may be challenged by the defence on the grounds of derivative use immunity. This has the potential to make cases extremely lengthy and costly. Finally, because the fact that a person has produced a document is not admissible against the person, the link between the person's original possession of the document and its introduction into evidence against the person is broken. This may mean that the person escapes conviction because an essential link in the chain of evidence is missing. In developing the new corporations and securities legislation the aim was to balance the conflicting interests of efficient business, shareholders and creditors, civil liberties and effective law enforcement, so as to achieve a workable result. The law as it stands at present fails to take adequate account of the difficulties faced by the ASC and the DPP, the bodies responsible for effectively investigating and prosecuting corporate crime. The practical position is that the ASC cannot use its powers to investigate certain suspected criminal activity. The problems of proof created by the derivative use immunity and the immunity for the fact of a person signing a record or producing a document are affecting its role in corporate law enforcement. The issue was recently re-examined by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities which, in its report tabled on 15 November 1991, recommended the removal of the derivative use immunity from the national scheme, together with the use immunity with regard to the fact that a person has produced a document. It also recommended that corporations be expressly excluded from claiming the privilege against selfincrimination. These recommendations followed the recognition that the availability of full use-derivative use immunity is threatening to defeat the purpose of significant portions of the corporations legislation. This Bill adopts these recommendations by removing the derivative use immunity from subsection 68(3) of the Australian Securities Commission Act 1989 and from subsection 597(12) of the corporations law contained in section 82 of the Corporations Act 1989. It removes the immunity in respect of the fact that a person had produced a document from subsection 68(3) of the Australian Securities Commission Act 1989, and confines the availability of the remaining use immunity to natural persons. Under proposed section 1316A of the corporations law, a body corporate will not be entitled to claim the privilege against selfincrimination, nor claim that it may make itself liable to a penalty in any corporations law criminal proceedings. Nor may it claim privilege or acquire any immunity under proposed subsections 68(3) or 597(12) and (12A). The removal of the right to claim the privilege against self-incrimination from bodies corporate in the legislation is to overcome the uncertainty resulting from the decision of the High Court of Australia in Pyneboard Pty Ltd v. Trade Practices Commission, 1983, 152 CLR 328 where it was assumed, but not decided, that the common law privilege against self-incrimination applied to corporations. In that case Mr Justice Murphy, at page 346, expressed the view that: The privilege is personal, so that one required to produce documents cannot resist production on the ground that this would tend to incriminate another. The history and reasons for the privilege do not justify its extension to artificial persons such as corporations or political entities... The Government endorses this view, and that of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities, which, at paragraph 4.5 of its report, said: Companies are artificial legal entities occupying a privileged position in that· all companies are protected by limited liability and public companies may seek investment from the public ... This privileged position carries with it obligations of accountability which may require the restriction of the rights of those participating in the corporate sector, including the right to remain silent. The Bill does not, however, adopt a further recommendation of the Committee that there be a five-year sunset clause on these amendments. The reason for not following that recommendation is that serious problems could arise in the prosecution of matters which may have been under investigation for some time. Investigators in complex cases would be hampered by the uncertainty of not knowing which rule of evidence would apply at the time of trial, and prosecutions not completed when the immunities revive would be jeopardised by the inadmissibility of crucial evidence. This would not only involve considerable expense in wasted resources over a long period of time but would also significantly detract from the Government's public commitment to more effective law enforcement in the corporate area. A preferable alternative is to ensure that the operation of the amendments is reviewed within a specified period. The Cabinet has decided that an appropriate period is five years. Thus, in accordance with that decision, the operation of these amendments will be reviewed after five years of operation. However, I give my commitment now that their operation will be monitored and an interim review will take place after twelve months. The Government is committed to the objective of ensuring that the law cannot be used to protect from prosecution those individuals who direct corporate activity and who have breached the law. I believe that the solution represented by the Bill appropriately balances the competing interests of civil liberties inherited from centuries of the common law and fundamental to our system of criminal justice, with the responsibility of the Government to ensure that the laws of the Parliament are properly enforceable. Effective corporate regulation in Australia requires legislation with teeth, in the form of criminal provisions which can be enforced. The Australian community expects corporate malfeasors to be exposed to the full ambit of the criminal justice system, not shielded from it by legislation, and that is the intention of the amendments contained in this Bill. The proposals put forward in this Bill do not have an impact on Government expenditure. I present the explanatory memorandum for the Bill and I commend the Bill to the House.

12,Mr DUNCAN,LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION,"I move: That this Bill be now read a second time. The Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) 1992 will amend several Acts within the Attorney-General's portfolio. The Bill contains amendments of a minor policy nature or which correct existing legislation. None of the amendments concern major new policy proposals or sensitive policy issues. Only the proposed amendments to the Judges' Pensions Act will have any financial impact. The amendments to that Act are expected to have a minor revenue impact, as pensions which would have ceased to be payable will now be payable. It is expected that the number of additional pensions payable will be small. The proposed amendments are explained in the explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill. The Bill contains amendments to the Judges' Pensions Act to provide that surviving spouse pensions will continue to be payable after remarriage. Provision is also made for the reinstatement in certain circumstances of a widow's or widower's pension which has ceased to be payable under current law. The proposed amendment to the Defence Force Discipline Appeals Act 1955 will simplify the process of approving leave of absence for members of the Defence Force Discipline Appeals Tribunal by providing that the Minister, rather than the Governor General, may approve leave. The Bill also makes a number of minor amendments to the Family Law Act. It will amend the definition of 'order under this Act' in section 112AA. The amendment will make clear that the sanctions available to the Family Court for dealing with breaches of its orders will be available when a person fails to comply with a subpoena. The Bill will repeal sections 116A and 116B of the Family Law Act which provide for payments to States and Territories for financial assistance in family law matters. These sections were made redundant by new legal aid funding arrangements between the Commonwealth and the States and Territories. The Bill will also amend section 123 of the Family Law Act to update the maximum penalty that may be set for breaches of Family Court rules. The rules impose penalties for failure to comply with a summons, for failure to comply with a garnishee order and for making false or misleading statements to the Court. Substantial penalties are required to deter breaches of the rules. I table the explanatory memorandum for the Bill and commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Dr Kemp) adjourned. NA Public Works Committee: Air Traffic Service Centres, Brisbane and Melbourne",20
13,Mr BEDDALL,COMMITTEE REFERENCE,"I move: That, in accordance with the provisions Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Air Traffic Service Centres, Brisbane and Melbourne. My colleague the Minister for Shipping and Aviation (Senator Collins) has endorsed a proposal by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to construct two air traffic service centres as part of the Australian advanced air traffic system (TAAATS). The strategy for the development of TAAATS is based on a far-reaching reorganisation of aerospace categorisation, resectorisation and air traffic service procedures, starting structures and facilities. The CAA will change air space categorisation to bring Australia into line with international practice and international civil aviation organisations standards. Such an approach is considered the most cost-effective way for the CAA to provide air traffic services to the Australian aviation industry into the next century. TAAATS will replace existing air traffic service networks with an integrated system of computer and communications elements, enabling high operator productivity through the use of proven automation and support technology. The system will be commissioned by late 1995. The proposal being referred to the Committee will provide the necessary floor space to accommodate TAAATS. The proposal is for two new air traffic service centres of similar design, one in Brisbane and the other in Melbourne. Both will be to a maximum of 6,000 square metres on two levels comprising an operational area of approximately 2,000 square kilometres-which also includes the operations centre, which is the heart of the total facility, with all other areas and support functions performed in this zone-an equipment area of approximately 1,800 square metres where the technical services are housed, maintained and supported; a service area of approximately 1,200 square metres which contains all electrical and mechanical equipment, including a standby power generator and air conditioning plant; and, finally, an administration facility of approxiof the mately 1,200 square metres, which will accommodate amenities, including staff dining and recreation facilities as well as housing and administration support, and which will be the focal point for public access to the building. The CAA estimate for the proposal is $5Om. The CAA will maximise the use of existing buildings and this may ultimately reduce the size of the building as the projects proceed. Signing of the prime TAAATS contract, of which these works are part, is scheduled for June 1992. To facilitate this program the proposals are being referred to the Committee at the schematic design stage. I now table the drawings of the proposal and commend the motion to the House.",21
14,Mr JULL,COMMITTEE REFERENCE," Mr Deputy Speaker, as a Western Australian you would be aware that it has been one of the most controversial decisions of the Civil Aviation Authority to go ahead with this particular process in terms of establishing air traffic service centres in Brisbane and Melbourne. However, the Opposition welcomes' this move and the recommendation that the Public Works Committee investigate it straight away. As the Minister said in his preamble, what will actually be happening is that Australian aviation will be moving into the twenty-first century and we should see a great number of reductions in the cost of being able to provide air traffic control services not only to the airlines and the aviators of Australia, but also to the travelling public. The Opposition welcomes this motion and trusts that the Public Works Committee will investigate and undertake this work as fast as it possibly can. I am sure we all look forward to seeing exactly what happens in the tendering procedures and the issuing of contracts for the provision of equipment, which the Minister has indicated will come in 1992. I sincerely hope there will be a fair Australian component in that contract. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA",22
15,Mr BEDDALL,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"Rankin-Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs)(10.58 a.m.)- I move: Customs Tariff proposals Nos 1 and 2 (1992) The Tariff Proposals I have just tabled contain alterations to the Customs Tariff Act 1987. Customs Tariff proposal No. 1 (1992) formally places before Parliament, as required by law, tariff alterations made by notice published in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette during the recent adjournment of the Parliament. This proposal, which is operative on and from the first day of January 1992, amends the tariff treatment of motor vehicles by removing anomalies relating to passengercarrying vans and goods-carrying vans. All passenger-carrying vans, other than amphibious and off-road vehicles, will now attract the prevailing passenger motor vehicle rate of duty of 35 per cent while goods-carrying vans will continue to be dutiable at the commercial vehicle rate of 15 per cent. Customs Tariff Proposal No.2 (1992) is new and will operate on and from the first day of March 1992. Honourable members will recall that in the last sitting this Government withdrew from Yugoslavia concessions afforded by the Australian System of Tariff Preferences because of aggressive actions taken by Yugoslavian defence forces against the Croatian minorities. The benefits of the ASTP were then given to the co-operating republics of Bosnia, Croatia, Macedonia and Slovenia. Following the latest events in central Europe, this Government has decided to extend the benefits of the ASTP to the Republic of Montenegro, a former republic of Yugoslavia. Item 40G was created to overcome legal changes to chapter 90 in schedule 3 made by the Customs Co-operation Council in Brussels in 1991. This item allows the duty free importation of certain textile orthopaedic goods excluded from chapter 90 by the CCC changes. For technical reasons, item 40G encompassed more goods than was intended and is now being reworded to include only those goods which were originally intended. Item 57 allows the duty free importation of a limited range of goods under strict end usage provisions to enhance the international competitiveness of Australian manufacturing industry. This Government has now decided to extend the range of raw materials and intermediate goods of chemicals, plastics and paper covered by this item. This initiative will significantly reduce input costs for associated manufacturers. Summaries of the alterations contained in these proposals have been prepared and are being circulated for the information of honourable members. I commend the proposals to the House. Debate (on motion by Dr Kemp) adjourned. NA NA First Reading Bill presented by Mr Beddall, and read a first time. Second Reading",22
16,Mr BEDDALL,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill is an omnibus measure proposing a series of amendments to the Customs Act 1901 and the Excise Act 1901. The main proposals contained in the Bill relate to: 1) Amendments to the Customs Act 1901 to provide the legislative framework for the electronic transmission to the Australian Customs Service of information concerning imported goods, and the electronic lodgement of import entries in respect of such goods; 2) Amendments to the Customs Act 1901 provisions relating to the advance reporting regime for ships and aircraft and their cargo, passengers and crew, to enhance the operation of that scheme; and 3) Amendments to the Customs Act 1901 and the Excise Act 1901 to improve the accountability and administration of the diesel fuel rebate scheme in response to the audit report by the Australian National Audit Office, No. 27 of 1990-91, tabled in Parliament on 16 May 1991. I will now refer briefly to each of those proposals. Electronic Lodgment In response to activity worldwide in the area of electronic technology and its application to international trade, the Australian Customs Service has developed and is continuing to develop a number of electronic initiatives. Both public and private sectors seeking to standardise industry procedures by pursuing the benefits of electronic data interchange, EDl, with the formation of a national communications network. The proposed amendments in this Bill for the electronic communication and lodgement 1992 of import information are a continuation of the improvements and updating of entry facilities which were initiated by the exit amendments for export information, introduced into the Customs Act by Act No. 111 of 1990. Similar to the exit scheme, the electronic lodgement system for imports, known as Compile, will operate on the basis of legislative amendments and contractual arrangements between the Customs Service and users of the system. The proposed principal Act legislative amendments are in a similar format and styIe to the successful exit amendments passed by this Parliament in the 1990 Budget sittings, and will essentially introduce an electronic computer option for the communication to Customs of information concerning imported goods, to complement the current documentary manual entry facilities. The Compile system includes a sophisticated regime of profiles designed to identify consignments as 'high risk', 'potential risk' or 'low risk' for both revenue and community protection issues. These profiles can be altered by Customs to target specific types of goods or destinations and can be further refined on the basis of intelligence and data relating to importing practices. Such intelligence is received from a wide variety of sources, both national and international. The profiles may also be amended on national and regional levels and therefore are sufficiently flexible to be able to address local issues. Compile has been programmed to ask the user a series of questions to determine the exact nature of the goods being imported. In essence the information required under both the new electronic and the existing manual regimes is similar. When the full particulars of the goods have been keyed in, the Compile are system has the facility to react to that information and make any necessary adjustment to the risk rating which applies to the goods. Immediately after transmission of an electronic entry, Compile will advise the user that the entry is available for any payment of duties which might be owing, or it will require the user to present documentation relating to the transaction if a risk has been identified. The potential savings for users in costs and time are significant. The majority of cargo is expected to be available for payment and Customs clearance in a matter of minutes after arrival in Australia. Savings in resources, staff and storage charges should be passed on to consumers in the form of cheaper commodity prices on imported goods. The proposed amendments are intended to provide not only a more formal link between the principal Act and the user agreement but also to deal with other important issues which flow from the entry requirements; in particular, providing a facility to make electronic payments under protest in section 167, amendments in respect of liability for false or misleading statements, and Customs control over imported goods. The electronic lodgement amendments are dealt with principally in clauses 13 and 16 of the Bill, and are explained in greater detail in the explanatory memorandum accompanying this Bill. Cargo Reporting The amendments contained in clauses 8 to 12 of the Bill propose minor amendments to the advance reporting regime for ships and aircraft and their cargo and crew, which was introduced by Act No. 111 of 1990. The proposed amendments will enhance Customs' ability to fully risk assess incoming cargo, crew and passengers for the detection of narcotics and other prohibited imports by ensuring that all advance reports are communicated to Customs at each port or airport of call in Australia rather than only at the first port or airport of arrival. This will ensure that Customs has the opportunity to coordinate its barrier enforcement needs whilst generally streamlining the reporting process, particularly with respect to those ships, aircraft, cargo, passengers and crew not considered to pose a high risk. Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme Amendments The amendments relating to the diesel fuel rebate scheme are designed to streamline the present claims procedures and improve the accountability and administration of the scheme. The diesel fuel' rebate scheme provides for varying levels of rebate of either customs or excise duties to persons who purchase diesel fuel for certain prescribed offroad uses. Categories of eligible use which are defined in the legislation include mining operations, primary production and diesel fuel for residential premises and medical institutions. Following an efficiency audit of the diesel fuel rebate scheme conducted earlier this year by the Australian National Audit Office, Audit Report No. 27 of 1990-91 was tabled in this Parliament on 16 May 1991. That report identified certain deficiencies in the current administration of the scheme. While some of the ANAO's recommendations are still the subject of consideration by this Government, those elements in the report which are capable of immediate implementation are included in this Bill. Clauses 28 and 46 of the Bill remove from the customs and excise Acts the requirement to lodge original purchase invoices with each claim. It is considered that there is no need to provide in the principal Acts the exact documentation required to accompany claims, as this type of mechanical provision is more appropriately dealt with by regulations. During the course of 1992, the Government expects to present new regulations to enable invoices to be replaced by a schedule of fuel purchases prepared by the claimant. This is broadly in accordance with recommendation 32 of the ANAO report. Other amendments contained in this part of the Bill are in accord with the Government's philosophy that rebate payments be based on self-assessment by claimants and that claims and claimants be subject to periodic audit. Other Amendments In addition to the amendments outlined above, the Bill proposes a number of minor amendments to both the Customs Act 1901 and the Excise Act 1901, which are explained in greater detail in the explanatory memorandum. Financial Impact Statement The cost of implementing the electronic lodgement system, including development, implementation, maintenance and operational costs, has been estimated over the last financial year and the next three financial years in present dollar values as follows: $0.863m in financial year 1990/91 $0.326m in financial year 1991/92 $0.314m in financial year 1992/93 $0.380m in financial year 1993/94* $1.883m total for financial years 1990/94 *The increase in this year over the previous two years is to account for modifications planned to the electronic lodgement system to further integrate it with an enhanced version of electronic data interchange. The other proposed amendments in this Bill have no direct financial implications. I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill.  journed.

17,Mr DUNCAN,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill is an omnibus Bill amending three Acts administered within the transport and communications portfolio. While none of the proposed amendments involve significant policy changes, they are important for the general administration of the transport and communications portfolio. Details of the amendments are as follows. Air Navigation Act 1920 Part 2 of this Bill proposes a number of miscellaneous amendments to the Air Navigation Act 1920. Many of these changes make the law in relation to international aircraft movements clearer to the aviation industry both in Australia and overseas. They provide for consistency in the area of aircraft operations and clarity in relation to offences committed under the Act. The changes also remove ambiguities which exist at the moment between provisions in the Act and provisions in the regulations. These changes do not impact adversely on industry as there is no proposed tightening of regulatory powers in this area. The amendments do, however: replace the existing general offence provision with specific offence provisions and penalties; clarify the provisions relating to international airline licences, permissions and approvals; and enable regulations to be made providing for on-the-spot fines for specific offences and remove the power to prescribe a term of imprisonment in regulations. I will address each of these amendments in tum. Section 22 of the Act currently contains a general offence provision which sets a single penalty in respect of each of the offences contained in the Act. General offence provisions of this kind have been criticised by the courts for failing to provide any indication of the relative seriousness of each of the offences contained in the Act and therefore providing no guidance in the exercise of the discretion of a sentencing court. They have also been criticised as being unhelpful in determining whether an offence has actually been committed, that is, determining whether a particular provision creates an obligation with criminal sanctions or is purely administrative. The offences are now stated in the Act itself. That is, the amendments contained in the present Bill describe each of the offences in the Act and allocate an appropriate penalty. Section 22 is repealed. The second group of amendments concerns the licensing provisions of the Act. At present, the Act deals specifically with the grant of international airline licences, permissions and approvals to foreign aircraft. Complementary provisions in relation to Australian aircraft are contained mostly in the regulations. The amendments will transfer and amalgamate these provisions into the Act so that powers for the regulation of Australian aircraft operating scheduled and nonscheduled flights are co-located and provide similarly to those for foreign aircraft. Finally, the Bill amends the power to make regulations in section 26 of the Act. In accordance with Commonwealth criminal law policy, serious offences warranting a penalty of imprisonment will be contained in the Act rather than the regulations. Secondly; the regulations will enable a person who is alleged to have contravened a specified provision of the regulations to pay an on the spot fine as an alternative to prosecution. The level of the fine would not exceed one-fifth of the maximum penalty payable by a person who is prosecuted for a breach of the specified regulation. I emphasise that the payment of an on the spot fine is an alternative to prosecution which is not intended to deprive a person from seeking to defend the matter should he or she choose to do so. Except in the provision of a stronger deterrent for unlicensed scheduled operations, the Bill does not introduce any new regulatory powers. The new provisions of subsections 13A(3), 14(3A), 15(2C) and 17(lB) specify certain categories of flights which may be exempt from the requirement to obtain prior permission. This Government has deregulated many areas of the aviation industry as part of its micro-economic reform program. This Bill introduces, in a small way, some further opportunities for administrative savings for both the industry and the Department. I am advised by the Department that it has already begun to exempt certain categories of flights in accordance with guidelines issued by the Government for certain categories of charter flights. The provisions in this Bill make the legislative base for doing this very clear. Such measures mean less contact by aircraft operators with government bureaucracy and reduced public service surveillance and expenditure. Broadcasting Act 1942 Part 3 of the Bill contains measures to correct drafting anomalies arising from amendments to the Broadcasting Act 1942 contained in the Broadcasting Amendment Act (No.2) 1991. Firstly, the Bill will make minor changes to the definitions of 'AM commercial radio licence' and 'nonmetropolitan FM commercial radio licence' contained in the Broadcasting Act. Subsection 89D(5A) of the Broadcasting Act enables the holder of a non-metropolitan AM commercial radio licence to seek to convert to FM by applying to vary the technical conditions of the licence warrant. However, the existing definition of an AM commercial radio licence excludes those licences where the warrant includes an FM translator, even though the main service may be on AM. The amendment will clarify that the Minister may convert such non-metropolitan AM commercial radio licences to FM by changing the technical conditions of the licence warrant. Secondly, the Bill will amend subsection 80B(2) of the Broadcasting Act to clarify a minor drafting inconsistency between paragraph (a) and paragraph (b) of that subsection. Radio Licence Fees Act 1964 Part 4 of the Bill corrects a drafting oversight in the Radio Licence Fees Amendment Act 1991. This concerns the level of licence fees to be paid under paragraph 6(2A)(e) of the Radio Licence Fees Act 1964. The current licence fee ceiling of 6.5 per cent for licensees with revenues greater than $lOm contained in paragraph 6(2A)(e) should have been reduced by 50 per cent by the 1991 Amendment Act. The current 6.5 per cent licence fee ceiling will be reduced to 3.25 per cent by this Bill to give effect to the original intention of the 1991 amendments. The reduced ceiling of 3.25 per cent will take effect retrospectively from 1 January 1992. The amendment is retrospective in effect as it is beneficial to affected licensees and ensures that the changes in fees apply to all fees payable in 1992. A mechanism has been includ.ed to require the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal to refund the difference between the amount of licence fees paid by affected licensees as calculated under the existing formula-with the 6.5 per cent ceiling-and the amount that would have been payable under the amended fOimula. 1\'10 commercial radio licences are in force under the Broadcasting and Television Act 1942, as in force immediately before 1 January 1986, and are known as old system licences. Old system licences are subject to licence fees under the Broadcasting Stations Licence Fees Act 1964, which has continued application by virtue of section 11 of the Broadcasting Stations Licence Fees Amendment Act 1985. Transitional provisions have been included in this Bill to apply the 50 per cent licence fee reduction in the Radio Licence Fees Amendment Act 1991 to those two remaining commercial radio licensees operating under old system licences. Financial Impact The amendments to the Broadcasting Act 1942 and the Radio Licence Fees Act 1964 correct anomalies arising from amendments in the Broadcasting Amendment Act (No.2) 1991 and the Radio Licence Fees Amendment Act 1991. Accordingly, the amendments will ensure that the financial impact identified for those Bills will be achieved. In particular, the amendments to the Radio Licence Fees Act will ensure that the expected financial impact-a decrease in Commonwealth revenue of $8m in the 1991-92 financial year-for the halving of annual licence fees for commercial, supplementary and remote licences occurs. The other amendments will have no significant effect on Commonwealth expenditure or revenue. I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill and commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Smith) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1992 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Duncan for Mr Beazley, and read a first time. Second Reading",25
18,Mr DUNCAN,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The Defence Legislation Amendment Bill makes various amendments to revise provisions concerning conscription and conscientious objection; enable the appointment of the Assistant Chief of the Defence Force (personnel) to the Defence Housing Authority; tidy up legislation providing for Defence retirement benefits and home loans assistance schemes; and repeal obsolete retirement benefits provisions. In this speech I will concentrate on the revision of the conscription and conscientious objection provisions. The other matters are straightforward and are sufficiently covered by the explanatory memorandum. The only legislation currently in force which provides for conscription and conscientious objection is contained in part IV of the Defence Act, which limits compulsory military service to a time of war. In this context, it is important to note that 'time of war' has a defined and limited meaning: a period of actual or apprehended enemy invasion of, or attack on, Australia. I would like to assure the House that the current amendments do not alter this fundamental threshold. The Government's view continues to be that conscription could be justified where Australia is directly threatened but not otherwise. The amendments now proposed stem from the Government's decision, announced in the Senate by Senator Gareth Evans on 5 December 1986, to accept recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs. The essential changes would add recognition of conscientious objection to particular conflicts, as distinct from war in general, and require prior parliamentary approval of conscription. I doubt that anyone would argue these days against the requirement for prior parliamentary approval of conscription. The desirability of providing for conscientious objection to particular conflicts might not be quite so self evident. However, the Government was persuaded by the view of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs that, in some cases, an individual's sense of personal integrity could be violated by compulsion to participate in a particular military conflict but not in other conflicts. An important element of the new provisions is definition of a person's conscientious as one that involves a fundamental conviction of what is morally right and morally wrong, whether or not based on religious considerations; is so compelling in character for that person that he or she is duty bound to espouse it; and is likely to be of a long standing nature. This definition would give clear guidance to tribunals considering claims of conscientious belief but is sufficiently broad to ensure coverage of any genuine case. Although Australian legislation has recognised conscientious objection to compulsory military service for more than 80 years, the nature of the conscientious belief required has been determined largely by judicial decisions on claims. In this most significant area, the Government believes that the Parliament by legislation should set out the key characteristics of conscientious belief to ensure that there is clear and consistent guidance for future decisions. Another important innovation is provision for establishment of special conscientious objection tribunals. Of course, such tribunals would be established only in the most unlikely event of conscription to meet a threat to Australia. The old model, of traditional adversarial proceedings before a magistrate, has been abandoned as inappropriate. New tribunals would be established for the specific purpose of determining claims of conscientious beliefs. They would be composed of a presiding member who had at least seven years experience as a legal practitioner, and two other members who were capable of ascertaining facts other than by adversarial procedures. The legislation specifically requires conscientious objection tribunals to adopt quick, fair, just and economical procedures. They are also required to act according to substantial justice and the merits of the case, and are not bound by technicalities, legal forms or rules of evidence. Although the tribunals are clearly expected to operate as informally as possible, they are given sufficient formal powers, such as the capacity to summon witnesses, to exercise their functions. Conscientious objection tribunals would belief normally take oral evidence in public but would have a discretion to take evidence in private or to take written evidence. A person claiming exemption from service because of a conscientious belief would bear the onus of proof, on the balance of probabilities. The right of appeal from conscientious objection tribunals would be to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Further appeal to the Federal Court would be allowed on a question of law or, with the leave of the Court, on any other ground. In the review of the current legislation, the opportunity has been taken to remove discriminatory provisions, for example, where obligations depend on whether a person is a 'male person', a 'British subject' or an 'Aboriginal native'. These amendments are quite clearly well overdue. I am particularly pleased that this Bill proposes the repeal of the National Service Act 1951. It is, of course, true that this Act has for all practical purposes been defunct since 1972. The Whittam Government disbanded the national service scheme in December 1972 and the National Service Termination Act 1973 removed any legal obligation to register for or render national service. The National Service Act was not repealed at that time because some national servicemen continued voluntarily in the Army. The Act has remained on the statute books, even though defunct. Repeal of the Act will remove this last vestige of an unhappy and divisive episode in our history. Despite the repeal, any entitlements that may have accrued to individuals through rendering national service have been explicitly preserved, where necessary. This outline has necessarily been condensed. However, I trust that it has indicated the substantial improvements that would be in place if ever there was a requirement to introduce conscription and to hear claims for exemption based on conscientious belief. The Government's aim has been to preserve the capacity to introduce conscription for the protection of Australia, but to ensure that those claiming exemption would receive a rapid and fair hearing. I commend the Bill to the House. I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Smith) adjourned. NA Suspension of Standing and Sessional Motion (by Mr Beazley) proposed: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Prime Minister making a statement at 7.30 p.m. this day.",27
19,Mr FIFE,HOUR OF MEETING,"The Opposition will not oppose this motion. As a matter of fact, we are looking forward with a tremendous amount of interest to what the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) will say this evening.",29
20,Mr BEAZLEY,HOUR OF MEETING,So are we.,29
21,Mr FIFE,HOUR OF MEETING,"lam interested to pick up the interjection of the Leader of the House. It indicates that Government members are not fully informed as to what is going to be said tonight, and it is clear from what we have read and what we have seen in the House in the last 24 hours that the statement the Prime Minister is going to deliver has been put together with great haste. We will certainly facilitate the debate, and we look forward to listening to the Prime Minister this evening. I seek such an assurance again from the Leader of the House that tomorrow he will move a similar motion to provide an opportunity for the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) to respond to the Prime Minister's statement at 7.30 p.m. tomorrow. The reason that I seek the assurance for the second time is that the Prime Minister has been reluctant to debate the economy of this country with the Leader of the Opposition and, initially, the Government was going to prevent the Leader of the Opposition from responding tomorrow evening. Therefore, I seek the assurance that tomorrow the Leader of the House will move a similar motion to afford the Leader of the Opposition a similar opportunity tomorrow evening.",29
22,Mr BEAZLEY,HOUR OF MEETING," I can give those assurances to the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Fife). We will move the necessary motions. There will need to be additional motions to enable the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) to respond to the statement at 7.30 p.m. As the Manager of Opposition Business rightly said, we on this side of the House look forward to the statement enormously, not necessarily because we do not Orders know what is in it. Large numbers of us do not, and that is because the statement has been arrived at through the Cabinet committee process. Nevertheless, it is well prepared. It will be a document of very great importance to this country. As the Manager of Opposition Business said, initially it was the Government's intention to provide the Leader of the Opposition with an opportunity to respond to this statement in about a week or so from now when the enormous public focus that will accompany the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) tonight and again tomorrow when he is speaking at the National Press Club will have abated somewhat and given the Leader of the Opposition a clear field. The Opposition was reluctant to pursue that course and wanted to respond immediately, so we have changed our minds and have accommodated it. As I said, we will certainly move the appropriate motions to allow the Leader of the Opposition to respond to the statement tomorrow night at 7.30. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA Select Committee on the Print Media",29
23,Mr BEAZLEY,COMMITTEES,"I move: That the time for bringing up the report. of the Select Committee on the Print Media be extended to 26 March 1992. I do this with a fair bit of reluctance. The case has been put to me strongly by the Chairman of the Committee. I was initially approached when I was wearing another portfolio hat. I suppose I need care less about it now than I did then. It was our intention to have timely advice on this matter in case things of a legislative character needed to emerge from it. Therefore, it would have been most helpful for the Government to have had what will, no doubt, be an excellent report on this very important matter in time for us to consider it with great deliberation in this sitting of the Parliament. That may well still be possible with the reporting date of 26 March 1992, though it will be harder. However, I am advised that the Committee has effectively completed its work but that, essentially, time is needed for writing it. Therefore, I am moving for the extension of time.",30
24,Mr SMITH,COMMITTEES,"The Opposition will support the motion, although I also would have to say very reluctantly. I am a member of the Select Committee on the Print Media and I was absolutely disturbed to see a report today that the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) tonight will make decisions about competition policy, which was a central issue in the print media inquiry. The report goes on to say that the recent Cooney inquiry-the inquiry of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs Mergers of monopolies and acquisitions: Adequacy of existing legislative controls-will, in fact, be superseded before it is responded to by the Government in some new broader based inquiry on competition policy that will be announced tonight. It makes redundant a lot of the work of the print media inquiry even before it reports. In some senses I am a wee bit of the view that the inquiry is now of the status that we always said it would end up being: the wrong inquiry for the wrong reasons at the wrong time. It was born out of a political deal in a different environment at the Australian Labor Party National Conference in Hobart. That is not to gainsay that the good work done by staff and the extensive submissions that have been made to the inquiry will be useful; they certainly will be. But the underlying reasons for the inquiry now are seen to be false. I think it is somewhat ironic that the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley), who argued against the inquiry at the conference, and the now Prime Minister, who was not in favour of it, are stuck with an inquiry that was given as a concession to the Left. Now that the former Prime Minister has gone, the whole matter is somewhat of an acute embarrassment. I can understand why the Minister has just said he is reluctant to grant the extension. Be that as it may, the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee) is obviously a very persuasive member and has put much time into the report and, therefore, I suppose the report ought to see the light of day. However, I cannot l«t the matter go forward without expressing those views from the Opposition's point of view. Question resolved in the affirmative. ARTS, SPORT, ENVIRONMENT AND NA AMENDMENT BILL 1991 Second Reading Debate resumed from 28 November 1991, on motion by Mrs Kelly: That the Bill be now read a second time.",30
25,Mr JOHNS,TERRITORIES LEGISLATION,"Petrie-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services) (11.36 a.m.)-The House is debating the Arts, Sport, Environment and Territories Legislation Amendment Bill. Perhaps one of the more interesting areas under the environment palt of this portfolio has been the conflict over the use of native forests in Australia. I have tracked this debate in the Parliament for some years and I began to realise that often the conflict between the Commonwealth and the States over the use of forests arose simply because neither group knew exactly what was out there. Often when the Commonwealth was given advice by the Australian Heritage Commission about the importance of the need to conserve certain areas of native environment, we could not sit down with a State government, whether from New South Wales, Victoria or Western Australia, and agree upon the values that we could measure in respect of a certain forest. In other words, the groups at State Government level which managed the native forests were often seeking to preserve things other than those which were important to the Commonwealth. Often at no stage did the Commonwealth and the States talk the same language about the need to conserve the central and essential values of our native forests. What has often occurred is that, where conservation groups have sought to save areas from logging in native forests, they have come to the Commonwealth as a means of appeal and sought to use the Australian Heritage Commission Act to force the Commonwealth to put a stopper on the logging of native forests. They would list the forest under what we call a National Estate listing. That would cause the Commonwealth, literally, to become involved in a fight over the future use of Australian forests. The Government has moved in any manner of ways to resolve that sort of conflict. In fact, later we will be debating a Bill about resource security. I am not pre-empting that debate by any means, but there has been a terrific and really positive process worked in the past couple of months, which I want to relay to this Parliament. It will obviate this need for conflict between the State and Commonwealth governments, between conservationists and foresters. We finally have a process between the Commonwealth, through the Australian Heritage Commission, and a State land management authority-in this case, in Western Australia-in which they can sit down, survey a whole region of forest and agree on those areas which ought to be preserved for all time and those areas which should decently be logged under proper and careful management. There is no need for us to go through this process of cat and mouse, of playing off one set of statistics and data against another. I refer to a recent joint proposal between the Department of Conservation and Land Management' in Western Australia and the Australian Heritage Commission. Those two bodies have taken a very large region of south-west Western Australia and have now agreed jointly about the key values of forests in that region. When we list forests on what we call the National Estate, we are speaking the same language as that used by the Department of Conservation and Land Management, which has a responsibility to manage, often for forestry purposes, those same forests. We have now struck upon a means of operating together, and I predict that in this area of south-west Western Australia the Commonwealth will no longer be used as a sort of second court of appeal on behalf of conservationists to see whether we can put a stop on foresters. In a sense, we have already done that work; there has been an agreement about what should or should not be logged. I will describe some of that process which I think will be a turning point in the debilitating forest issues. The model was the culmination of more than a year's work between the Department of Conservation and Land Management and the Australian Heritage Commission. It is the very first systematic regional study of National Estate forests ever undertaken jointly by the Commonwealth and a State government department. We are hoping that it will become a model for similar out agreements in the future between the Commission and other State agencies. In that process the two organisations have carried out an exhaustive analysis of the National Estate significance of no less than 1.2 million hectares of forests in the southern forest regions of Western Australia and 134 individual values in forests were identified and assessed. Talking about values, of course, if one were to talk to a forester about what is valuable in a native forest and then talk to someone who is concerned about the conservation of a forest, obviously the things they measure are quite different. Often-perhaps always-that was the source of conflict between conservationists and foresters: what are we seeking to achieve with our native forests? Under this legislation, the experts could get together and sort it out before we got into a major bunfight between two sides which often become political forces. The report entitled National Estate Values in the Southern Forest Region, South-west Western Australia is an important advance in the identification of forests which are worthy of being included in the list of our most important heritage places-that is, the Register of the National Estate. I believe this will help the climate of investment in the forest industry because it will now bring some certainty as to what areas can be logged and what areas cannot. Unfortunately, in the past a State department of forestry would release forests for the purposes of logging, but some conservation groups in an area would object and run to the Commonwealth to see whether we could have that area listed on the National Estate; that would start a very longwinded process whereby we would, effectively, put a stop to logging for that period. The Commonwealth and the States would then get into a fight over the use of those forests. In the past, places were listed on the Registhrough: ter of the National Estate in this ad hoc way as a dispute arose. Environmental groups have used this nomination process successfully to try to stop or delay proposed logging activities in listed forests in places such as East Gippsland, the Eden region and Tasmania. It was the apparent open-endedness of listings that created an uncertainty in the industry about future access to timber in places that were not currently listed in the Register but which could have been listed in the future, as well as uncertainty about future access to places which were listed already. In the past, Commonwealth-State decisions not to allow logging in some National Estate areas also created an industry fear that timber resources will be reduced in the future by similar decisions. I know that the National Association of Forest Industries has cited that sort of uncertainty as a major reason for the industry's unwillingness to invest in new development proposals. The advantage of this new regional assessment-we have seen the first in Western Australia-is that it will result in all major forest areas of National Estate significance being identified and listed in the Register. That, of itself, will remove uncertainty about future listings. Furthermore, the regional assessment will provide a publicly stated framework for the way in which the Commission will provide advice about logging in forest areas. Again, this will reduce industry uncertainty about possible Commonwealth decisions about logging of the National Estate forests. We predict that as a consequence of this new regional assessment process there will be a great reduction in conflict about logging in the National Estate. I think there is a wide public perception-promoted by the industry and by environmentalists-that National Estate places are, or should be, treated like national parks. In fact, the two are quite different. National parks are established almost entirely by State governments for their own purposes and according to their own values. They sometimes cover National Estate forests; sometimes they do not. That is the sort of historical legacy we are now working getting the National Estate lined up with the sorts of values according to which the State management authorities would like to manage those areas. This has been a major source of conflict in forests in south-eastern New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania. It is one reason why the Commonwealth has been drawn into expensive agreements with the States over forest issues. Some examples have been the Joint Scientific Committee in south-eastern New South Wales and financial packages to Tasmania and Victoria. From long debate in this place-specifically about the south-eastern New South Wales forests area - I know that, if a scientific study about the values of various forests in south-eastern New South Wales were undertaken, neither the Commonwealth, under advice from the Australian Heritage Commission, nor the New South Wales authority at the time would agree with it. We would have whole maps of areas which the Commonwealth would say ought to be saved and which the State would say ought to be saved and there would be barely an intersection between the two. There would be no decent basis upon which we could do other than see a fight between the Commonwealth and the State over the future management of forests. We have now found a means--a very obvious one; sitting down and working through the facts-by which we can obviate the need for that conflict. The advantage is that the regional assessment report provides a clear framework for the protection of National Estate values within a region, which includes listed areas occurring both in national parks and in multiple-use State forests-in other words, forests that might be logged. Where a State government is supporting a forest industry that affects National Estate areas, the reports clearly indicate that protection in national parks is only one aspect of protecting National Estate values within a region. It provides guidelines for the protection of National Estate values in multiple-use forests where logging will continue to take place. The beauty of this process is that at the of the day foresters will know how much resource they can use. As seems to be the case in Western Australia, foresters will not be denied the resource; but, at the same time, the Commonwealth can be assured and reassured that its National Estate forests will not decline in the values for which we listed them. The regional perspective of where values are located, their abundance, their representation within nature conservation reserves and measures to protect values outside reserves provide a framework for government decision making which is far more likely to provide lasting solutions to National Estate forest issues than has been the case in the past. One of the mechanisms that the Commonwealth and State have used to bring celtainty to this area in the past has been what we call a memorandum of understanding. It has usually been a fairly complex arrangement between the Commonwealth and State, not based in legislation, where we have hoped to minimise conflict. Now, with this ability to regionally assess an area all up-perhaps not once and for all, but at one point in time-we may obviate the need for this pretty difficult process of the memorandum of understanding. The memorandum between the Commonwealth and the Tasmanian Government, for instance, provides the framework for protecting National Estate forests in Tasmania during forestry operations, but we have found that the MOD process is unwieldy. It requires, for instance, referrals for each forest activity proposed; for example, putting in a road or logging in a particular coop, an area of the forest. It involves very complex liaison between the industry, the Australian Heritage Commission, the Department of Primary Industries and Energy and various other State and Commonwealth agencies. The Australian Heritage Commission's advice, without any context, has meant that often there were some difficult relations between one Commonwealth Minister and another-for instance, between the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories. In other words, we had set up end within the Commonwealth itself a certain amount of conflict which had to be sorted out. The MOU has most often resulted in fairly lengthy delays before Commonwealth approval is given, for instance, for logging to go ahead or for a road to be put in. Naturally, when we get those sorts of delays, the timber industry becomes somewhat agitated. Now, hopefully, when the regional assessment is applied in forests other than in Western Australia, we will find a comprehensive framework for Commonwealth decisions. There will be no need for these memorandum of understanding referrals. The costly delays in proceeding with logging will be avoided and the overall protection of National Estate values will be in a regional context, specifically to take into account the nature of conservation reserves. There are some further points that we believe will improve the debate about the Australian Heritage Commission itself. The Commission and its powers have come under an enormous amount of criticism from the forestry industry in the last couple of years, because it has been seen as the beast that stops forestry. It has not been; it is an important body that gives advice to the Commonwealth when we are unsure about the future use of native forests. I guess it is only reasonable and obvious that some would focus on the role of the Australian Heritage Commission. Here I think the Commission has got itself out from under that criticism. It has a way by which both sides, State and Commonwealth, can agree on the terms on which we will sort out which areas are to be forested or harvested and which areas are to be saved for all time. The Commonwealth Minister for Resources has obligations under the Australian Heritage Commission Act to consult the Commission about the impact of logging on National Estate places for the renewal of current woodchip export licences; for instance, in Tasmania, Western Australia and New South Wales. We now hope to find that the regional assessment will provide a comprehensive regional framework for the consideration of the impacts of logging, for feasible and prudent alternatives to logging, and measures to minimise the adverse impact of logging on National Estate places. I believe this will greatly speed the referral process between the Department of Primary Industries and Energy and the Commission and remove delays in the renewal of licences, such as has happened in the past. In Western Australia the MOU between the Commission and the Department of Conservation and Land Management provides the basis for ongoing cooperation for forestry operations related to export licence renewals. The other great pay-off is that there should be an improvement in discussions between the Commonwealth and States on those forestry issues. Again, the advantage of regional assessments, based on the experience in Western Australia, is that the cooperative approach to the regional assessment work will result in better relations between a range of State government departments, the Commission and, of course, Commonwealth departments. It should reinforce the improvements flowing from the intergovernmental agreement on the environment arising from the Special Premiers Conference. The regional assessment work provides a comprehensive, scientifically accurate view of a wide range of conservation values in any region. This knowledge base will assist in government decision-making in a range of areas; for example, biodiversity, endangered species, old growth forests and the development of representative conservation reserve systems. I congratulate both the Australian Heritage Commission and the Department of Conservation and Land Management in Western Australia for their excellent work. (nme expired)",30
26,Mr JULL,TERRITORIES LEGISLATION,"The Arts, Sport, Environment and Territories Legislation Amendment Bill seeks to amend some seven Acts. Last night my colleague the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney) covered the amendments to six of those Acts. Today I will concentrate my remarks on the amendments to the Australian Sports Drug Agency Act 1990. The amendments are fairly minor and deal principally with reporting procedures for those competitors who undertake drug tests in sport. Proposed new subsection 65A(1), (2) and (3) provide the Agency with the standard taxation exemptions under the Commonwealth, State and Territory law. It seems absolutely incredible to me that when the Government first drew up this Act nearly two years ago it failed to take that into consideration. Once again, we are cleaning up some sloppy drafting that should not have happened. I will make some comments about the operations of the Australian Sports Drug Agency Act and what has happened in its short history. I pay a special tribute to its Chairman, Professor Peter Baume, a former senator and Minister, to members of his board, and to the chief executive officer of the Agency, Mr Steven Haines, for the tremendous work they have done in this area over the last year or two. I do not think any Senate inquiry in my time in this Parliament drew more interest, and in some ways more anger and more consternation, than the inquiry into drugs in sport that was headed by former Senator John Black and Senator Noel Crichton-Browne. I think a number of people in Australia were absolutely horrified when they learned how prevalent drugs in sport had become, not only in this country but around the world. My mind goes back to the debate a couple of years ago when this legislation was first introduced. It was said then that Australia was breaking new ground in this area and there was an opportunity for Australia to take the lead in world sport in trying to get rid of the problem of drugs in sport. Frankly, I think Australia has done very well in being at the forefront of the move around the world to get rid of drugs in sport. For those reasons, I congratulate the Chairman, the chief executive officer and the members of the board of the Drug Agency. It has been quite fascinating to see that Australia has very much taken the lead in getting international focus on the scourge of drugs in sport and international action to try to eliminate drugs in sport. In the debate a couple of years ago it was suggested that one of the things that should happen was that sports should be responsible for their own drug testing. Not only was it argued that a number of sports could not afford such a commitment; it was also argued that it was important to have an independent agency who could fairly test it and would gain recognition as an independent organisation. That has happened. It is good to see that the international working group on drugs in sport, which in fact is working on the international anti-dope charter in sport, includes the chief executive of the Australian Sports Drug Agency. Australia has also been in the lead in providing advice to the International Olympic Committee. In some 50 international events Australia has been very much involved in providing drug testing. Even those former Iron Curtain countries which tended to move towards drug use in some areas have acknowledged the tremendous work that the Agency has done. One of the comments that came out of a recent international meet was that Australia was like a warm light to the people of these areas as it was leading the way in trying to get rid of the scourge of drugs in sport. The independence of the Agency has meant that in a number of parts of the world Australia is being looked to as providing the lead in the establishment of similar agencies and in the eradication of drugs in sport, and that is good. It costs the taxpayers of Australia a relatively small amount to keep this particular Agency in place. The Agency is to be congratulated on already starting to earn some funds of its own through its testing programs. This has resulted from arrangements being made with organisations such as the Rugby League and the Australian Football League, which make some payments for these tests. The Agency is looking towards the international provision of services as another means of raising income. So in that respect there are also some great advantages for Australia. There are a number of programs promoted by the Agency which are probably not heard of tenibly often but which give great justification for the Commonwealth continuing to support the Australian Sports Drug Agency. The programs provided for schools and individual sporting organisations should be commended. We should look particularly towards the arrangements the Agency has made with organisations such as the Australian Rugby League, the Federation of Police and Citizens Youth Clubs, the MLC Junior Sports Foundation and the ACT Sports Foundation as being fine examples of what can be achieved in the education of our young athletes in terms of their futures and in terms of keeping them drug free. Obviously, there is tremendous pressure on athletes to go out and win. In today's sporting environment winning often means the difference between making a lot of money and no money at all. I suppose the temptations are there, but the down side of drug taking associated with sport is horrendous. These educational programs, along with the school based programs, certainly should be commended. The whole idea of this program is to take the cheats out of sport and to provide the way ahead for genuine athletes. For that reason, we should cqntinue our support for the Australian Sports Drug Agency. The amendments in the Bill before us today are quite minor. They result in some tightening up of compliance in reporting the drug tests that have been happening. I support the amendments to the Australian Sports Drug Agency Act as outlined in this Bill.",34
27,Ms CRAWFORD,TERRITORIES LEGISLATION,"In speaking on the Arts, Sport, Environment and Territories Legislation Amendment Bill 1991, I wish to address the issue of sport and in particular those changes to the Australian Sports Drug Agency Act talked about by the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull). I am happy to see that these changes will mean that we have a much more positive attitude to sport and the way in which people participate in sport within our country. It is through processes such as the inquiry by the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts into drugs in sport and the consciousness which has been raised' within the community through the education programs which the inquiry generated that we have seen a considerable resurgence of research into sport and the kind of effect which sport has upon the Australian community. While all of us hcre would recognise that sport generally has played a very important part in the lives of many Australians, 54 per cent of our female population have been denied active participation in sport. Some of the facts relevant to women's participation, particularly that of girls, are very important. When we are looking at ways to ensure that sport is fairly treated and that the drugs in SpOlt issue is acknowledged, we need also to look at encouraging all people to participate in sport. Some research has been done relathave ing to sports participation of girls which has thrown up some very frightening statistics: there are more unfit girls than there are unfit boys; the aerobic fitness of girls on average declines after the age of 12 or the onset of puberty; and prepubescent girls on average tend to be inferior to those of boys of same age in various perfOlmance measures fitness, except in the area of flexibility. at this early age there are no significant physical differences to explain these different performances. We also have to ask why there are more obese girls than boys. It was found that girls in general have a lower self-esteem and more negative self-concept than boys, but that women and girls who are involved in physical activity have a higher level of self-esteem than others. So the active campaign of sports for girls is very important: it is not simply an issue of sport; it is also an issue of selfesteem and of developing self-concept, leading to a whole range of other abilities. One of the most interesting programs at present is the women in engineering program which is attempting to attract women into undertaking engineering courses at our universities. Some of the research done there has found that our girls are conditioned in years one to three of primary school into thinking that jobs such as engineering are a bit dirty and that they really should not do these sorts of things. If this is reinforced with the negative concept of self-esteem through their lack of sporting ability and lack of access to facilities, we are creating not simply a society with a large number of unfit obese girls and young women, and girls and young women who may be a little too fat, but a society more than half the members of which have low self-esteem and self-concept and are not pursuing the kind of courses and trades which will enable them to have employment into the year 2001. As most of us know and understand, the major employment issues for us into the year 2001 are going to be in the information and technological spheres which require abilities in maths, sciences and so on. In order to maintain gender equity in those areas, we to make sure that all our young students, irrespective of gender, have a high self-concept and a high sport involvement. While we see changes happening to the Sports Drug Agency and are concerned to make sure that all aspects of sport are fair, we must also look at a whole range of ways in the which we tend to treat sport within our of community. Adult sport participation can be Yet, traced back to childhood reinforcements of parental interest, encouragement and participation in organised sport as youths. It is quite obvious that the behaviour of parents influences that of their daughters. It has been found that parents who play sport tend to have daughters who play. A recent US report states that 70 per cent of daughters who currently participate have parents who also engage in sports or fitness activities. We have no reason to believe that that would be any different in Australia. In this report, factors which pressure girls out of sport are listed as lack of opportunity, 30 per cent; skill, 49 per cent; time, 59 per cent; interest ""in other activities, 89 per cent; and, of course, boys are said to distract girls from sport. The figures for the time factor and the interest in other activities are interesting. We need to ensure that sport is given equal status with some of the other interests in our community so that we can use some of the very good things about sport, such as the development of self-concept, self-esteem and confidence, as well as learning to work together as a team and so on. Our community as a whole has not always recognised the value of sporting women to us. Indeed, only 2.5 per cent of total sports reporting space is devoted to women's sport. This trend has not changed significantly in eight years. In space devoted to reporting all sporting results, women's sport occupies only eight per cent of the total. Even with photographs we get 12 to one, men as to women. It seems to be quite an extraordinary difference. Many people in this House would recognise that in sporting terms we have one million women on any weekend playing netball. Women bowlers make up a large group in our community. So women participating in sport provide huge photographic opportunities. One wonders why women only deserve one-twelfth of the photographs. I might add that television is not much different: we only get 1.3 per cent of the total sport time. I must put a little plug in here for the ABC. Its coverage of the world netball championships showed the rest of Australia that our women are international champions. It also showed the rest of Australia that this is an exciting game-a game of skill, teamwork, self-esteem and self-confidence. So those women have been recognised. Women at the Olympic Games very often do not get recognised. The other day at the Mint, Mrs Keating talked of women's contributions to sport at the Olympic Games. Women have won 24 of the 57 gold medals at the Olympic Games, which is 42 per cent. This is a remarkable achievement when one considers that only 22 per cent of the events are available to women, but only 19 per cent of the participants are women. One would think that we should at least get 42 per cent of the photographs in the paper, but we do not even seem to get that. In 1988 the Australian women's hockey team won at the Seoul Olympics. My colleague in the Senate, Senator Crowley, has a very keen interest in women's sport in a range of activities. She is a doctor by profession and is interested in the health and fitness process. Senator Crowley had a cartoon which showed the Australian men's hockey team slinking off in 1988 with somebody saying, 'They played like girls'. Somebody said, 'They did not, because the girls won the gold medal and they were unable to do so'. There have always been those sorts of elements, I guess. This very small piece of legislation deals with a whole range of issues-quality of life, town planning, national heritage and so on. Let us contemplate for a moment the role of sport. In the 1990 Commonwealth Games women's performances were quite considerable. Women made up 38 per cent of the Australian team and again won 42 per cent of the medals; that is, 68 out of 162. It is not a fact that women who achieve peak status and achieve very well at home do not achieve well in international fields; in fact, they achieve very well but do not get recognised. One has to ask, quite simply: why are they not recognised? Why does the Australian public not buy their achievements? Those kinds of things point to the concerns many of us have for our girls in primary school. Community and cultural pressures are such that we are creating fat little girls who are lacking in self-esteem and self-confidence. That is a real problem. One way this problem has been addressed is through the community cultural, recreation and sporting facilities program which was announced in last year's Budget with an allocation of $30m. Madam Deputy Speaker, I am sure your electorate will be participating in this program. It has provided real money for sporting grants within the community so the local netball association, the local softball association, the local croquet players, bowlers or whatever will get some sporting facilities for themselves. I think most of us know that the local town councils are very quick to put in footy fields and they give the boys toilets and showers. Most girls who play netball change in their cars if they are lucky and, if they are really lucky, they may have a tree to sit under. These cultural grants are not gender based; they are wide ranging. A soccer group, and others, in my electorate have had an opportunity to participate in these grants through this program. The program provides the opportunity for smaller sporting groups in the community to make sport real, accessible and equitable for people. We must do that, and we must continue to raise the consciousness of the community. The educative process of sport, sports development, and all the side issues, which are very important when people are making choices about what courses to follow and about career paths which we hope will be available, becomes a very central and key issue. We would hope that sport in fact will help to develop the self-esteem and selfconfidence which is needed. It has given me pleasure to be able to look at this legislation. Whilst it is very far ing, and I admit that my discussion has been quite far ranging, it is also important, if we are to look at quality of life issues, that we look at issues that reflect on members of our community and the way they want to live. Our children are, after all, our most important asset; they are our future. It is important that their quality of life and the activities which are available for them, which will enhance their development in the future, be addressed. I recommend the Bill to the House.",36
28,Mr DUBOIS,TERRITORIES LEGISLATION,"St George) (12.17 p.m.)Like the speakers before me, I am happy to support the Arts, Sport, Environment and Territories Legislation Amendment Bill before the House. The amendments to the seven Acts administered by the Department of the Arts, Sport, Environment and Territories will make the administration of various programs more efficient. The amendments are not controversial and are supported by both sides of the House. The first amendment is to the Australian Capital Territory (planning and Land Management Act) 1988. It gives the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly) some powers to ovet1um continued objections from the Territory to draft plans prepared by the National Capital Planning Authority. Despite the results of two referenda when the people of Canberra clearly rejected the idea of self-government, we did impose it on them. I am not quite sure whether it was the right decision, but the decision has been made, home rule has been established, and the people of Canberra now have the responsibility of meeting the costs of their administration and running the local show. It is interesting to observe that the people of Canberra clearly preferred a central bureaucracy, the NCDC, headed by a Minister who was usually resident in some other part of Australia, to run Canberra. When this is contrasted with the recent events in the old Soviet Union where the people rejected a central bureaucracy and opted instead for a popularly elected parliament, it makes one wonder whether we have it right or whether they have it right. Another aspect of this Bill will allow the Authority to charge fees. This rang- is merely what happens in other parts of Australia, so there is nothing very controversial about that. The Australian Sports Drug Agency Act 1990 is also slightly amended. It will enhance the measures designed to eliminate the use of drugs to artificially enhance the performance of athletes. This is a sensible step and one that is. supported by everyone. I guess the only good news in this amendment is that the Agency will be granted the standard tax exemption conditions common to all Commonwealth statutory authorities. The Environment Protection (Sea Dumping) Act 1981 and the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1982 are also amended. Minor changes here are intended to overcome any potential gap in evidence in judicial proceedings. I understand that it will make it easier to obtain a conviction for any breaches of these Acts. Given Australian maritime ecology, we must be ever vigilant against dumping of any matters at sea which would threaten the extensive and largely unattended border that we have. The next Act amended is the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975. It introduces the definition of a botanic garden. It will allow the Norfolk Island and Australian National Botanic Gardens, as well as other parks and reserves, to be managed as botanic gardens. It is a seemingly minor amendment but certainly a step in the right direction. Also, three international agreements relating to migratory birds are to be added to the schedule of the Act. This is of particular interest to me as a number of these birds fly all the way from Japan and Siberia to the Wolli Valley, which is in my electorate. It is probably the last remaining bit of bushland in that part of Sydney. It is like an oasis in an otherwise built up area. It would be a shame if this rather tranquil area were to be destroyed and if it were no longer the destination for these migratory birds. These birds are also to be found in nearby Botany Bay, a popular recreation area for the people who live in that part of southern Sydney. The next Act to be amended is the Norfolk Island Act 1979. The amendment will allow the Acting Administrator and Deputy Administrator to exercise the powers of Administrator when the Administrator is on leave but still on the island. Norfolk Island is beautiful. I can understand that the Administrator would want to take his recreation leave there. As a child I lived on Norfolk Island for four years. It is a great place. If any honourable member has not yet been there, I can certainly recommend it. It is a great tourist destination. There are no local newspapers and no annoying telephone calls from people back home. The only television is by satellite dish, so one does not have to put up with the crass soapies one is subjected to here in Australia. Historically it is an interesting island. Despite its savage origin as a penal settlement, it was later given by Queen Victoria to the Pitcairn Islanders, themselves descendants of the Bounty mutineers. It is also a duty free port. My wife can attest to the fact that some great bargains are to be had there. There is certainly a good range of products at reasonable prices. The people are very easygoing and charmingcharacteristics seldom found elsewhere. Honourable members certainly should put this place on their agenda. I returned to Norfolk Island a few years ago. Despite an absence of some 37 years, I was still able to understand the local dialect, which is a blend of the west country English of 200 years ago and Tahitian. The Pitcairn Islanders themselves were descendants of the sailors who came from that part of England and their Tahitian wives. I will take the opportunity to mention one sad aspect of the beautiful environment of Norfolk Island. A spectacular row of Norfolk Island pines were cut down during the second world war to make way for an aerodrome. This is still lamented by the old timers on the island who remember it. Unfortunately, it had to happen. There was no choice; it was wartime. An aerodrome had to be built. It is a price paid for progress. But the locals are still upset that the pines were cut down by the mainlanders, Australians, and that a lovely part of their environment was so compromised. The next Act to be amended is the Protection of Movable Cultural Heritage Act 1986. This will merely facilitate the administration of the Act. Given the distances in Australia, it is more sensible-with the use of telephones and facsimile machines-to allow members of committees to communicate with each other without having to be physically present in the same location. This is something that we will all have to move towards in the years ahead. These amendments are not controversial. They will make the administration of various programs more efficient. 111ese improvements are supported by both sides of the House. We support these because we are all concerned about the protection of the environment and related matters. There is a perception in the community that we in the Parliament consider environmental issues only because of pressure from certain lobby groups in our electorates. I reject that view and the view of the environmental fundamentalists, whose insatiable appetite will see the closure of many industries and a serious decline in our standard of living. Some months ago a representative from Greenpeace went door-knocking in my electorate and managed to alarm a number of people, all in the name of protecting the environment. I had to reassure a number of people who wrote to me and telephoned me that we were not making nuclear weapons grade material at Lucas Heights, that we were not about to abolish the need to have environmental impact studies into major projects and that we were not about allowing the resource industry open slather without due regard to our environmental laws. I had to reassure these people that the person from Greenpeace was talking a lot of rubbish. Mr Nehl-Irresponsible.",38
29,Mr DUBOIS,TERRITORIES LEGISLATION,"He was irresponsible. I watched with interest-I would be happy to provide this to any honourable member who would like a copy-an interview on the Sunday program on 29 September 1991, when Graham Davis, the journalist from that program, interviewed a number of people from  Gilding, who is one of the Greenpeace franchise holders. Greenpeace is a company very much like Kentucky Fried Chicken or MCDonalds. These people buy the franchise. They own the marketing rights to the name of Greenpeace in Australia. They make a fair bit of money out of it; it is a money making venture. Believe me, they do very well out of it. I also point out to honourable members and people in the gallery that when these people go round collecting in the name of the environment, 40 per cent of what is given to them goes into the pockets of the collectors. They are totally different from other collections such as those for the Red Shield Appeal or other reputable charities-charities to whom all the money is given. Of the money given to Greenpeace, 40 per cent goes into the pocket of the collectors and the rest goes into the running of Greenpeace, which of course has to pay an international franchise right as well. I was particularly alarmed at one section in the interview. Greenpeace was opposed to a company in Victoria called Nufarm. Greenpeace's hypocrisy was exposed on the program when the following question was asked by Graham Davis: Greenpeace did a job on Nufann, all right, and there've been others, too. As we'll see, economy with the truth is matched by a conviction that the Greenpeace crusade is above the law. Paul Gilding'S reply was: We're not here to win popularity stakes-we're here to change the world. We should be concerned about these alarming views by these zealots. These people who claim to have a monopoly on environmental issues have to be seen for what they are: they use it as a vehicle to make money or promote a different agenda altogether. This legislation before the House amending these Acts shows that members of parliament and members of the community are clearly concerned about environment issues and that we are prepared to take sensible and balanced measures to protect the environment. But the environment can best be protected by countries who can afford to protect it. The environmental standards in some Third World countries are absolutely appalling. It is only affluent countries such as Australia, North America and Europe that provide protection for the environment. It is interesting to compare the standard uf the environment in the old western Germany and eastern Germany. There were similar people under two different regimes: one affluent, able to introduce laws to control vehicle and plant emissions; and the other, eastem Germany, not as affluent because of the system under which it suffered for so long and a place in which vehicle and plant emissions were so bad that the rest of Europe was contaminated. To have really adequate environmental protection, one has to have a society that is sufficiently affluent to be able to afford it. In Australia we have to guard against those vocal pressure groups that would close down our industries in the name of the environment. They are now talking about aircraft emitting certain substances that are damaging the ozone layer. I think it is probably a signal that they will put the aviation industry on their agenda and take steps either to compromise it or close it down altogether, just as they have done with the mining industry. Of course environmental protection is supported by a wide range of people, including those in resource industries; it is our resources and tourism that will regenerate the wealth that will allow us to protect our environment. Quite frankly if we do not have a wealth that can be taxed, we certainly will not have the means to protect our environment as we all want to do. lt is interesting to note that minerals and energy exports grew by 173 per cent to nearly $28 billion over the past seven years. The prospects for the years ahead are even more promising. These are industries that have due regard for the environment; they are not the savage predators who want to lay waste to our landscape, but sometimes when resource companies are critical of activities of the environmental movements, people get the impression that the resource sector wants to have open slather. That is certainly not true. The mining industry, which makes such a valuable contribution to the balance of payments, accepts the need for environmental regulation. While we are putting in place legislation that protects our environment, let us put into some perspective the need to provide long term security to this industry. The objections of noisy minority groups cannot be allowed to drown out the views of the majority who want a sensible balance that we can all live with. Mining can be compatistands ble with other land use and the industry demonstrated that it can rehabilitate old mine sites and other areas where mining has taken place, to blend in with the surrounding landdirect scape. However, these are success stories they get very little publicity at all, because they are positive good news stories and the sensationalist news which tends to domiCommonwealth nate the headlines. Another example of extreme steps taken by so-called environmental groups in the name of protecting the environment is their unreasonable stand on the environmental impact study done on the third runway at Sydney Airport recently. The third runway will in fact reduce the number of people who will be subject to aircraft noise, but some people will experience aircraft noise for the first time. Some will get more noise but the majority will get less noise. There are also those who believe their property values will somehow be adversely affected by overflying aircraft. I do not have to remind the House that it is these people who objected so strongly to the proposal to build the third runway. As I started my contribution, I am certainly very happy to support the amendments before the House. They are not controversial and they are a clear demonstration that we in this Parliament on both sides do protect our environment and will always do so, despite the bleating of some people outside this chamber who think we are nothing more than Philistines and vandals who would lay waste to the environment without their intervention. Quite frankly I think we do the job better than they do and we should put these noisy people on this issue, and on many other issues, into their perspective and let us get on with the job we were sent here to do. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee The Bill.",40
30,Mr CHANEY,TERRITORIES LEGISLATION,"In the second reading debate on this Bill I indicated that the Opposition would move an amendment to that part of the Bill that relates to the ACT planning ministry. The Bill as it amends the Australian Capital Territory has Planning and Land Management Act and the proposal was to insert a section which would provide that the Commonwealth Minister may the relevant authority to disregard a and direction or alter a draft plan. The Opposition has suggested that this not should be modified by requiring the Minister to consult with the relevant ACT Minister. Since the ACT has self-government we thought it was appropriate that there should be that degree of involvemade ment. I foreshadowed an amendment in terms of moving that certain words be inserted. I grateful to the Minister at the table that suggestion was examined over night. There has been consultation between my office and that of Senator Parer, the relevant shadow Minister in the Opposition, and the office the Minister. The Minister has suggested alternative wording, which is satisfactory to the Opposition. I now move the amendment in the form that was suggested to us by the Minister. I am sure she will speak for herself but the Opposition believes this achieves its move: purpose in different words. Therefore I move the amendment, which is to page 2, proposed new subsection 20A of the Bill: Schedule, page 2, proposed subsection 20A(2) of the Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Act 1988, omit ""the Minister must, in writing, direct the Authority:"", substitute ""Minister, after consultation with the Executive, must give a written direction to the Authority."" Our objective was to get the Minister in consultation with the appropriate member of the ACT Executive Government. The point has been made to us that if we leave it in form, it could become complex if the ACT administrative arrangements change, so this puts a requirement on the Minister to consult with the ACT Executive, which is, I think, more stable proposal to put forward.",41

We do not consider that it substantially alters the existing situation where the ACT Executive already has the statutory right to be consulted about any objections raised at an earlier stage of the preparation of the plan. The Opposition's amendment will merely require that the Commonwealth Minister should give the Executive a chance to state or restate its objections to the National Capital Planning Authority draft before the Minister decides the dispute.

It was always intended that they should be payable regardless of whether the approval is ultimately granted, granted only in part, or refused.

34,Mr CHANEY,TERRITORIES LEGISLATION,"On the face of the explanation given by the Minister for the Arts and Territories, that seems reasonable.

Clearly the Bill will go to the Senate and there will be an opportunity for the Opposition to examine that a little more closely. I just do not wish the Minister to feel that she has been put in a false position if at a later time we find that there is some technical reason or other reason that we would wish to mise about that amendment. I do not oppose it, but that is on the basis that it should be further considered by us and, if we have a difficulty with it, it can always be raised in the Senate. Amendments agreed to.

44,Dr HEWSON,PRIME MINISTER,"I move: That this House censures the Prime Minister for deliberately misleading the House on the effect of the Coalition's Fightback package. Might I begin by saying that as we have just seen the handkerchief passed across the table, as it was yesterday, the leopard never changes its spots. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) sticks to the old ideas and the old arguments. There has been nothing new out of this man in the last nine years. Might I also point out that it is a white handkerchief today, which I take to be surrender; yesterday it was a blue handkerchief. Yesterday we sought to show that this Prime Minister cannot be believed, that he has zero credibility when it comes to matters of economic management and economic policy. He has deliberately and knowingly misrepresented our economic circumstances during his entire period in government. Orders Yesterday we gave you dozens of examples of how he had misrepresented the state of the economy, whether or not there would be a recession, the nature of the recovery and the - successes , of his so-called economic management. If our questions did not clearly establish that point yesterday, his answers certainly did because, again, he failed to live up to the pledge he made the day he became Prime Minister. To remind the Prime Minister what he said at that time, the day he became Prime Minister he put down three pledges. The second pledge was: ... to deal honestly with the people and tell them the truth. He went on to say: In tough times, of course, the temptation is always to gild the lily. I'll be resisting that temptation as much as it's humanly possible. I'll speak honestly with them, to them, and realistically... At the first opportunity that this Prime Minister has had to do precisely that, and to honour that pledge-which was given yesterday in this Parliament in Question Time-he fell over at that hurdle. He failed to - ive up to the pledge to tell the truth. In fact, he deliberately and knowingly misrepresented the work of a respected academic economist and now business economist, an ex-Treasury officer, whose work has been fundamental to the development of modelling in Treasury, apart from a number of other places. He deliberately and knowingly misrepresented that person's views. Yesterday was a day, of course, when the Prime Minister was under a lot of pressure. He had to prove that he could really do it, and that he really still had it. He was worried about the image that would be created in the gallery: was he still the same tough old performer? So, as is typical of this person, as is characteristic of his career, he will say anything or do anything-he will lie, he will cheat, he will misrepresent; he will do anything, he will deal with anybody",43

49,Mr SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,Even in a censure motion one does not make that point.,44
50,Dr HEWSON,PRIME MINISTER,"Might I use the words 'grossly misrepresent', 'deliberately misrepresent' or 'knowingly misrepresent'? He will deliberately misrepresent anything, he will do anything, he will say anything, he will deal with anybody to save his political skin. That is characteristic of the way he treated the Murphy analysis yesterday. Let us look at what he actually said in those answers to the questions yesterday and how he deliberately and knowingly misrepresented the circumstances. There are about 20-odd misrepresentations in the context of his answers yesterday, but let me just pick the three big ones. The first one-am I allowed to say, 'a big lie' or 'the biggest lie'?",44
51,Mr SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,Order! The Leader of the Opposition knows the rules about using that word and he will not use it.,44
52,Dr HEWSON,PRIME MINISTER,"The boldest misrepresentation of all was the statement that our package will actually make the economy smaller. I ask the Prime Minister, 'Who believes that?' Nobody in Treasury believes that. Murphy certainly does not believe that and certainly did not say that. I ask the Prime Minister, 'Who says that our package will make the economy smaller?' That is a total and deliberate misrepresentation of the facts. He also went on to say that Murphy was the economist who had simulated our package, he was the econometrician who had put our package together-a rather novel claim, given that Murphy joined Access Economics a few weeks before the Fightback package was delivered and he had only done a technical piece of analysis, which is included as an appendix. He did not design the Fightback package.",44

54,Mr SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,Order! There is far too much noise.,44
55,Dr HEWSON,PRIME MINISTER,"In the paper that was referred to, he did not model the package, and the Prime Minister knows this. The Prime Minister knows that he did not model the package; he modelled just a small part of the package. He only modelled a switch to a goods and services tax, the proceeds being spent in income tax. He did not model the wholesale sales tax abolition, he did not model the payroll tax abolition, he did not model the petrol excise abolition, he did not model the 20 to 50 per cent reduction in costs and improvements in inefficiency that will come from our infrastructure reform package, he did not model the industrial relations reform, he did not model the cuts in immigration-he did not model any of those things in the package that you have referred to. So he did not model the package; he did a technical, academic exercise, as he has said. I am fascinated by some of the statements that the Prime Minister made. For example, he must have known that Murphy's results did not show a 4 per cent reduction in GDP as he claimed. He must know that. Mr Beazley interjecting",44
56,Dr HEWSON,PRIME MINISTER,"Yes, but you cannot read the table, can you? What Murphy actually shows is that there are changes in GDP between minus 0.4 and plus 0.3-not 4 per cent - over the period that he modelled. He showed-and this should be made clearinfinitesimal deviations of a trend and a long term gain arising from a small part of the package, a deliberate misrepresentation of the facts as they were embodied in that paper and as has subsequently been made clear by the author of that paper.",45

58,Mr SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,Order! The House will come to order.,45
59,Dr HEWSON,PRIME MINISTER,"The Prime Minister deliberately and knowingly misrepresented the circumstances in the Parliament yesterday. Even in respect of his own recession he got the numbers wrong. For example, he claimed that the recession only cost 3 per cent in GDP, which was less than the claim he said would flow from the Fightback package, which has been proved to be wrong. The overall cost of the recession so far is 7 per cent-and I say 'so far'; he claims 3 per cent on his own recession. He deliberately and knowingly understated the effect of that change. It is not just how much GDP falls, it is how much it would have otherwise risen in the course of the period that is being modelled.",45

As honourable members might have noticed yesterday, he did not hold up the Murphy paper; he held up a couple of articles from a newspaper that were dated last Friday-Hartcher articles, in particular, from the Sydney Morning Herald. And does that not beg the question of where Hartcher got the story from? Do honourable members believe Hartcher has the capacity to have thought of this himself? It begs the question, does it not, as to whether the story was given to him. It was given to him so that the Government could base its attack on it this week.",45

65,Dr HEWSON,PRIME MINISTER,"The Prime Minister knew yesterday that he was misrepresenting that situation, because last Friday, after the publication of these articles, Murphy went onto a Sydney radio program compered by Alan Jones and denied the accuracy of those claims. Does this not beg the question whether this is not going to be a pattern with this Government? It begs the question whether there is not a pattern to what this Prime Minister is doing; to leak a story, to push that story at the start of the week and to run that story through the Parliament.",45

68,Mr SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,"lam trying with great difficulty to hear the Leader of the Opposition, and I cannot do so with his colleagues interjecting. Honourable members on both sides will cease interjecting and the Leader of the Opposition should be heard in silence.",45
69,Dr HEWSON,PRIME MINISTER,"Just as it begs the question as to whether Hartcher was fed that story as a basis for the political attack this week, it begs the question as to whether next week's Four Corners program is to be used as the basis for the same sort of attack next week. Mr Robert Brown interjecting",45
70,Mr SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,Order! The Minister for Land Transport!,45
71,Dr HEWSON,PRIME MINISTER,"When we find that the author or one of the principal architects of that program is a mate of the Prime Minister's press secretary, we start to wonder whether this is not gqing to be a pattern. It begs the question whether we are not seeing a pattern where they ignore the facts, ignore the truth, ignore what is said, and just get on and manufacture circumstances in which they can run during the following week. So against that background I ask the Prime Minister whether he is going to draw on the resources of his staff in that way. Presumably they were the ones who made these miscalculations on the impact on GDP of his own recession that were referred to yesterday. I ask him why he did not look at the work of one of his other advisers, his principal economic adviser, John Edwards, who has actually assessed the Fightback package and who has actually made some very important statements about the substance of the Fightback package. For example, he said: It is certainly the boldest and most detailed proposal to change the Federal budget for a very long time. You do not like this, do you-one of your advisers being quoted back to you? Secondly he said: I don't think it is worth arguing that a goods and services tax will cause inflation as distinct from a one time increase in the price level or recession. might, but in reasonable circumstances it will not. Re says: At the worse a substitution of a goods and services tax for a payroll tax will do no harm and may actually do a lot of good. Another comment on the package is: Its strength is the fact that the plan proposes to eliminate payroll tax which is a very good idea indeed and both the compensation package and the income tax cuts proposed appear to be reasonably fair. So on most aspects of the package the Government's own principal economic adviser has actually given us a clean bill of health and says it is worth doing. The particular element that he focused on in some of those quotes, payroll tax, represents a very important challenge to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is bringing down a statement tonight which is designed to create jobs. He himself said back in 1977 that the abolition of payroll tax at that time would create 200,000 jobs. Let us look at how many jobs he will create tonight and whether he has the courage of his convictions to actually deliver a substantial change in payroll tax that will bring about those sorts of results. We now know that the Prime Minister has deliberately and knowingly misrepresented the work of Dr Murphy, and Dr Murphy has responded by describing the Prime Minister's parliamentary perfonnance as false, inaccurate, a significant misrepresentation, heavily distorted and 'he got it wrong'. If you do not want to believe me, you can believe the author of the paper who has made those comments about you. There are two central issues to this censure motion. One is to pose a direct and deliberate question to the Prime Minister: did he deliberately misrepresent a respected academic's research to suit his own political ends? If he did, is he man enough to say that he did? Is he man enough to say that he was wrong? Is he man enough to apologise to the academic economist concerned? Secondly, there is the broader issue about whether this Prime Minister can be believed in anything he says. Can this Prime Minister be believed? That is the significant issue that should be an essential It background to tonight's economic statement. This statement is supposed to bring a fresh start to this country. We have seen so many fresh starts before from this Prime Minister. Let us just go back and run over a few of the claims that this man has made in the past about his economic management. We will not go all the way; we will just start back in 1987 when he said in the May statement: Tonight I can report that Australia is winning. In September 1987, following the Budget of that year, he said-and you want to wait and focus on this one because it is worth bottling: This is the great coming of age of Australia. This is the golden age of economic change. I am sure the one million unemployed are going to be delighted to hear that. The golden age! Then in 1988 he was getting carried away with his rhetoric, which, as honourable members know, is not characteristic of this man. Re said in terms of the Budget: This is the one which brings home the bacon. That was not anywhere near as far as he went on that occasion. I know that one has had a lot of publicity. He actually said quite a lot more. He said: . . . without a doubt the crowning glory of anything the Australian Treasury and any government have ever produced. A modest understatement, of course! Then in 1989 when circumstances were running against him he said: Australia will emerge from the recent high level of spending without a recession and with its economic and social structure improving. I would like the Prime Minister to go down to some of the unemployment lines in Coburg and ask the people in them whether they think the social structure is improving and how deep the recession has actually gone. In August 1990 he capped it all when he said: These are definitely the golden years of change. Of course they are the golden years of change. Everyone was getting a bit worried by 1990 that what he had been saying for several years was not happening; but he kept reassuring everyone. Remember all those other statements: 'There will be no recession', 'There did not need to be any recession', 'We won't let there be a recession' and, 'The economy is recovering'. There is a whole string of these on the subject of the economy recovering from late 1989 or early 1990 right through 1991, and always the economy is just about to recover. I am sure we will hear again tonight that the economy is just about to recover. It has been just about to recover under this man for a couple of years as it presently stands. So there are two questions to the Prime Minister: is he man enough to admit he was wrong, to admit that he deliberately misrepresented the facts, and is he man enough then to apologise to Dr Murphy? Secondly, what is he going to do tonight to set aside nine years of gross misrepresentation and distortion, a characteristic of which we saw yesterday on his first attempt in this Parliament. He does not worry about facts; they get in the way of his political career. He abuses them, twists them, contorts them and does whatever he wants to do in order to tum his circumstances around. The real issue tonight is whether this man can face our problems and can deliver the economic package that this country needs. We will scrutinise this package from two points of view: first, in economic terms, we will see whether this is an attempt to be more honest about our economic, circumstances. Will the Prime Minister admit-as Access Economics has estimated and others are now confirming-that our Budget deficit this year is blowing out? Access Economics has said that it could be as high as $9m and, when you exclude the asset sales, as high as $12 billion. Will he be prepared to admit that? Will he be prepared to go with genuine labour market reform? Will he be prepared to go with genuine infrastructure reform? We have talked about micro reform. The Prime Minister has talked about micro reform for years. He has claimed that there is nothing more to reform. The only people who talked about micro reform were the galahs in the pet shop. Do you remember those statements? The Prime Minister had done it all years ago. It will be interesting to see whether he comes back tonight and admits that he has not done it all and that there is quite a lot to be done in infrastructure reform. Will he be prepared to face the issue of tax reform? One of the interesting and most telling points against this man and his attack on us, our package and the GST, is that he was the strongest advocate of this package back in 1985. I will just remind you of what he said in 1985. He said that this would result in a manifestly fairer tax system and would create the foundations for a more efficient system to promote stronger economic growth and higher living standards. That is what this man said in 1985 when he was advocating tax reform and a broad based goods and services tax. Yet now, when it suits his attempt to save his political hide, he distorts, misrepresents and takes the opposite side of an issue that he says he believed in in 1985. Secondly, tonight we will assess his package as a kickback package. We will look for the extent of the kickbacks, the political deals that have been done with Joan Kirner, John Bannon, Wally Curran and the ACro, and all the factions on the other side.

Then in the most petulant, brittle and glass jaw manner, he hops into me for being a liar, a cheat, a misrepresenter and a distorter. He blames the story written in the Sydney Morning Herald on my press secretary, who had nothing whatsoever to do with it. He pres- impugns Mr Hartcher-and it would not matter if he did. The fact is that the Sydney Morning Herald and now the Australian Broadcasting Corporation are part of the witch-hunt. He is witch-hunting on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation for next week's Four Corners program. They are going to be shocking and terrible, too-and maybe a question will be asked about the GST. Two and a half months of easy riding is not enough for him.

If we look at the 20 quarters in that modelling-that is, the five-year modelling-under any scenario, real gross domestic product goes down and unemployment goes up. On the base case, real GDP declines by 0.2 per cent. On the wages up case, as it is called-that is where the GST cannot be kept out of wages-GDP declines by 4 per cent, as I said yesterday. Unemployment rises by 0.2 per cent under the best case and by 2 per cent under the worse case.

If you want more than that, I will quote Dr Murphy. When asked by Alan Jones, 'What about unemployment?', Dr Murphy said: The actual shift in the tax mix from an increase in indirect taxes financed by a cut in income taxes, that actual part of the Opposition's package, would not have much effect on unemployment one way or the other. The results I am presenting show a very marginal increase over five years. What is the point of the package? If unemployment goes up over five years, what is the point of the package? I am a simple person; I will listen to the answer, but I have never heard an answer. He said, 'The fact is, under the GST switch, GDP and unemployment suffer'. So says your econometric modeller. There is the print-out of his work. Do not blackguard Hartcher, the ABC or my press secretary. There is your work; it is not worth a bean. After we doubled GDP in the 1980s from your miserable 1.8 per cent per year to 4.2 per cent and took GDP from $171 billion to $405 billion, you bring in a package which will attack the way of life of every Australian person and family and which will put 15 per cent on everything people put into their mouths and onto their backs, every service they undertakeMr Sharp interjecting",49

Yesterday the at the seminar there was another major paper about why the surge in prices could not be locked out of wages and why it would go into ongoing inflation. So not only do you reduce GDP and increase unemployment, but also you massively increase inflation. You would do nothing about it and could do nothing about it. That is why in 1985 when we looked at a consumption tax I said, 'If we cannot get the wage discounts, we won't vandalise the economy'. We could not and we did not. You cannot get the wage discounts, but you want to press ahead with a surge in inflation. The Leader of the Opposition, on his own admission, will double the inflation rate. According to the figures in his own Fightback package, he will double the inflation rate. Is it not shocking of me to say, 'This academic's work says that GDP goes down and unemployment goes up. '?

The quote continued, 'the Government has given up on inflation control' and there are more and more of these extravagant claims by the Leader of the Opposition. 1le fact is that the Leader of the Opposition did not engage in a policy which was better for Australia. The GST and the Fightback program were not designed to be better because Australia needed a better policy; they were designed principally to make the Leader of the Opposition look different from the Government. He did not say, 'What does this country need?'. He said, 'I have been in the job for three months. I somehow have to look different. What can I do that the Govenunent is not doing? What can I do that makes me look different? Maybe I could take on the GST-the consumption tax'. That is what motivated him; not any decent public purpose, but the need to look after his own miserable political hide. That is where Fightback! came from. He then turned it over to a stack of private accountants to work out of it. Then, on top of that, we actually get some focus by the academics. What do the academics say at a conference? They say that you will not knock the surge increase out of wages and you will vandalise the national inflation rate. Even the person who has the most regard for the Leader of the Opposition-that is the. person of whom the Leader of the Opposition is a client-Dr Murphy, says that, under any scenario, the base case is minus 2 per cent; the wages up case, minus 4 per cent; unemployment, up 0.2 per cent; and, under the wages up case, a plus 2 per cent rise in unemployment. How could you ever have the gall to look anybody in the eye and suggest Fightback! as a panacea for Australia's problems of growth, employment, jobs, inflation, recovery and, of course, investment, the current account and the rest? Fightback! is an economic sham. This computer print-out, this model, proves it. The Leader of the Opposition, in proposing a censure motion, shows just how sensitive, brittle and unprepared he is for the kind of political discussion that the Fightback program necessarily brings.",50

122,Mr REITH,PRIME MINISTER," Mr Speaker, it is amazing: the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) still has not got the point. After four days, penny is still to drop on the world's greatest Treasurer. Did you hear him: 'The package will contract the size of the economy.'? Murphy did not say that; he never said anything like it. Yet this mug, with all the Treasury advice and all of the economists from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, still does not have the point. Maybe we got it wrong; we said that he deliberately misrepresented the situation. But even after that perfonnance he still does not have the point. I say to the Prime Minister: I have the table before me. It is not a hard thing to do: go to the top left-hand corner, read the first line and when you have done that you will get the point. You should then read the second line, which states, 'Deviations from baseline'. You should read the second line. You have to get the point. Murphy did not say that GOP would reduce under the coalition's package; he was talking about deviations from a baseline. The second point which the Prime Minister still fails to grasp-and it is a very simple point-is that Murphy did not attempt to simulate the whole of Fightback!. As the Prime Minister sees it, all of this debate is about the totality of what we are doing: unemployment is going up, inflation is going up, interest rates are going up, the economy will contract, and all hell will break loose if people vote for the coalition. Murphy did not simulate the totality of the package. When Murphy went on air this morning, and when he issued his press release last night, in one stroke he completely demolished this man, this great pretender, this arrogant, abrasive, insulting Prime Minister. The truth of the matter is that Murphy looked at one small part of the package and came up with some results on a very technical basis against a deviation line. If we ask Murphy, 'What is the bottom line?', even if we look at the little bit that the Prime Minister is so excited about, the bottom line is that it is good news for the economy, a benefit over time. One can look at the deviations. He reckons our package is of tenth order significance-a classic prime ministerial statement. He, of the course, was one of the keenest advocates of this sort of change years ago. He came up with the figure of 4 per cent, but the Murphy figure was actually 0.04 per cent. We are in the worse recession in 60 years and this bloke is out by a multiplier of 10. No wonder we have a prediction that the Budget deficit is heading towards $9 billion and he is still on $5 billion. It is incredible. The only grace I can provide to the Prime Minister is that he does not even understand the significance of what ought to be a very simple point. There is no pressure on us. Was it not a classic line when he said, 'This Opposition, it is on the back foot' - the classic Keating line? He is on the back foot. The best form of defence is offence, and very offensive he is. Yesterday we went through the Prime Minister's answer to the question that was put to him in respect of the Murphy modelling, to analyse what the Prime Minister was saying about the Murphy model in the closest possible way. I will make these observations available to those who want to scrutinise them more carefully. We came up with over 20 clear misrepresentations of the coalition's package. From start to finish, in about 10 minutes, he failed to tell the Australian people the truth about the one set of economic policies that really do provide this country with an alternative vision and a chance finally to get out of the recession that this bloke deliberately engineered and has the gall to boast about. He starts with, 'The headlines show Academics are a bit crook on the /I GST./1 I tell you what-by God they are'. Even that is not true. Murphy, in fact, reports that the great majority of support at the conference was for the indirect tax reform package, which essentially is what the GST is about. That is no surprise, because anybody who sits down and looks at the issue objectively will come to the same conclusion. He goes on to say: Dr Chris Murphy-the econometrician who put together the model on which the GST was based and tested. Murphy is a very good bloke, but as a matter of fact he did not receive from us a consultancy to use his model and to base and test the GST on that. That work was done by Dr Neil Warren, Australia's expert on indirect taxes, which I am sure Dr Murphy would be happy to acknowledge. I am sure that Dr Warren can look forward to a bucket of distortions next week following Four Corners. He went on to say: · .. saying in a paper that GDP would be reduced for at least five years as a result of the consumption tax ... That is simply not true. He said: · .. unemployment would be higher for at least five years. As I have demonstrated, that is simply not true. He said: · .. we find that the econometrician most associated with it says that it will actually reduce GDP. The Prime Minister was wrong again. He said: The recession has cost us 3 per cent of GDP. That is wrong. On Murphy's calculations it is nearly 7 per cent of GDP. He said: Dr Murphy says that GDP would be reduced by 4 per cent as a result of the Hewson consumption taxwhich is simply wrong. One of the bases upon which the Prime Minister builds his insubstantial case is the worse case scenario that Murphy modelled for the sake of, in his words, 'logical completeness'-an absolute distortion of what Murphy says. I am pleased that Dr Murphy has crushed the Prime Minister on that point. I quote again from the Prime Minister's two answers in Question Time yesterday: . . . in other words, a reduction greater than the impact of the recession on the GDP. That is wrong again on two counts: it was 7 per cent on Murphy's calculations, not 3 per cent, and of course his 4 per cent was wrong in the first place-a double score. We ought to call that a double lie. He said: This is the product of the Liberal Party. Thank you very much, but let us not forget the strength of the coalition and our National Party colleagues. That was another lie. He said: ... a package which actually makes the economy smaller... That is simply not true. It is not the truth. It is another lie.",51
123,Mr SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will withdraw that remark.,53
124,Mr REITH,PRIME MINISTER,I withdraw No.9. I have over 20. I am happy to pull back a couple.,53
125,Mr SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will withdraw the remark that he made.,53
126,Mr REITH,PRIME MINISTER,"I withdraw the remark. No. 10: · .. when you look at the Opposition's micro policy you see that it is micro by name and micro by nature. What a ripper that was. Sixty billion dollarsthat is micro! I suppose if one had brought on a recession like this man has, anything would pale into insignificance. He said: · .. the econometrician that actually put the Fightback model together and test- it. . . Wrong, as I have said. He continued: · . . there will be a reduction in GDP as a result of the GST. He really could not help himself. He was wrong again. No. 13: This is the plan for Australia-a plan to go backwards. For heaven's sake, he is the one taking us backwards! We in the Opposition are the only ones with a plan to go forwards. No. 14: Australia has an inflation rate of 1.5 per centonly half an untruth. That might be the headline rate, but Treasury would tell him if he asked that Australia's underlying rate is close to 3 per cent and the expectations are that it will go higher. He said: · . . the second lowest by a decimal point in the world. That is probably right, but again only half right, simply because it refers to the headline figure. He said: The nation has succeeded in breaking the back of the most pernicious economic disease in a quarter of a century-we have achieved low inflation. So the Prime Minister told Parliament yesterday. Well, that is not right. That is simply not true. We have not broken the back of inflationary expectations in this country. One does not need to be an economist or the Prime Minister to know that-just go out and talk to ordinary Australians about their expectations for inflation, or look at the bond market, or take some advice from some of these Treasury experts. We have a long way to go in this country if we are to break the back of inflation. To achieve that, we need some structural reforms, about which I will speak in a moment. On that important issue, this Government has no commitment to the medium term price stability goal of 0 to 2 per cent that the Opposition has properly put in the policy debate. It shows that these people claim to have a campaign against inflation but are not prepared publicly to target inflation and make the big changes that are necessary to achieve that rate. The Prime Minister said: And now, with a 1.5 per cent inflation rateanother quote, wrong again, as I have explained. He said: · . . when the author of the model which produces it, Dr Murphy, has issued this warning about itreferring to the package. That is wrong again-not Murphy and not the package. He was wrong twice. That ought to take me to No. 20 already. He said: The author of your econometric modelwrong again. He said: · . . the Opposition have no wage arrangement between themselves. That was not a bad one, was it? He just slipped that one in. He said that we have no wages policy. We have a wages policy. He attacks it every second day. He is the one who does not have a wages policy. He is waiting for the unions to meet on Friday to tell him what his wages policy is. No. 21: · . . if one is on the low end, of course, one gets much less than people on the higher end of the income scale. This is the Government's distribution argument. This is a favourite Labor Party argument: 'If you vote for the coalition, it will change the system and the poor people will be poorer and the rich will be richer'. If we look at his last income tax cut, we see that the rich are the ones who got richer and the poor did not do so well. Secondly, and most importantly, one of the great things about our tax package, the entirety of Fightback!, is that we provide the greatest support to those in the greatest need. This debate about the Prime Minister's misrepresentations is ironical because he uses Murphy, who worked for Access, who worked for us, to attack us-and he distorts and misrepresents Murphy-yet his own principal economic adviser, the top honcho in his office, has publicly acknowledged the progressiveness of our Fightback program. In other words, this man comes in here, with the advice of Treasury and his senior economist, knowing that our package does look after those who are needy in our society and has the gall to say exactly the opposite. ought to be hauled before the court of public opinion and declared guilty of that constant misrepresentation. He said: Of course they will claim it in wages! I say that is a misrepresentation as well. have quotes as long as my arm of the Prime Minister saying exactly the opposite back 1985. There is to my knowledge not one reputable economist in the country who would really do otherwise than accept a simple proposition which is based on international experience. Subject to having a sensible package-which we do-inflation is not a them, problem. A GST is not inherently inflationary. That fact is well known amongst those who have studied this issue or who have seen its application internationally. In misrepresentathis tion No. 23 he says: ... we are about preserving low inlIation. I have dealt with that point. It reminds me 'We're bringing home the bacon', which hear every year from this bloke. The Prime Minister said in 1987, 'This is of economic change'; in 1988, that he was bringing home the bacon; and in 1990, won't let there be a recession'. Then when got one he said that we had to have one the first place. After that he said, 'I knew had to have one, but I did not want to tell that we had to have one'. Tonight he will say, 'Don't worry; it is all going to be well. You vote for me. You support me. The recovery will be with us now'. That is simply not the truth. The truth for this country is that we have a lot to do by way of fundamental reforms to our economy. Sure, the economists are brought into the debate about what ought to be done but, quite frankly, most of the things that have to be done to improve our economic circumstances are obvious and are common sense. In most cases, our competitors made the changes which we now propose many years ago. Two symbols of our problem strike me as being as important as any. One is our massive debt to the rest of the world, which is $133 billion. No-one should have any doubts about the gravity of our circumstances. It has gone from $23 billion under Mr Recession to $133 I think he billion today.",53
127,Mr SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will refer to members by their titles.,54
128,Mr REITH,PRIME MINISTER,"I take your point, Mr SpeakI er. The second symbol is the number of unemployed in our community: around one in million people are unemployed, including nearly one-third of our young people. We could do something about that. If those opposite stopped their silly political games and misrepresentations and honestly referred to the issues and honestly attempted to change first, they would have our support and, secondly, we could say to the young people of Australia, 'There is hope. There is a chance. There is opportunity in the future of country if you support the changes which we recommend'. Misrepresentation such as we saw in the dishonesty that was exhibited of, in this House yesterday-a dishonesty which we we are now used to in this place-is no answer and does no justice to the unemthe golden age ployed. (Time expired)",54
129,Mr DAWKINS,PRIME MINISTER,"I guess the most interesting we revelation from this particular debate is the in gross sensitivity of the Opposition to any we criticism. Members of the Opposition are the you ones who promised to have a sensible debate about political and economic alternatives in this country but, at the slightest suggestion of criticism from anybody-not just from usthey do not argue the point; they attack their critics; they demean their critics; and they question the motives of their critics. That is what we have seen here today. We have seen two of the most paltry speeches ever associated with a censure motion in this House. A censure motion is a very serious device used by an Opposition about very serious matters. It is usually accompanied by serious minded speeches which actually go to the point of the political debate. But what was this censure motion about? This censure motion was actually about the fact that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) had grasped some criticism of the Opposition's package-criticism which actually came from some of those who were associated with its description and who were responsible for looking at its effects on the economy-picked up on some of the results bf this work and revealed to perhaps a surprised nation that the actual effect of a switch from income tax to consumption tax would actually have a depressing effect on GDP, a depressing effect on employment and an escalating effect on unemployment. After that simple point was made, the Opposition came in here, used one of the most serious of devices and then supported it with two of the worse speeches I have ever heard associated with a censure motion. ",54
130,Mr SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,Order! The honourable member for Kooyong will cease interjecting. ,55
131,Mr SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,Order! I warn the honourable member for Kooyong.,55
132,Mr DAWKINS,PRIME MINISTER,"I have heard one or two censure motions. I have even heard a couple from the honourable member for Kooyong but at least he had the decency to put a bit of substance into his speeches and, I might say, a bit of flair. I might say they were mainly composed of flair and only slightly of substance; nevertheless he made an effort. He understood what a censure motion was; he understood there was a tradition to be followed; and, of course, he knew something about it. This political apprentice who now leads the coalition on the Laws show the other day lamented that there was far too much politics in the political system. What he wanted was a bit more leadership-whatever that might represent. But what the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) displayed here today was the antithesis of leadership. If he wants to be a leader, if he wants to set himself up as the author of an alternative package, he has to be prepared to support it; he has to be prepared to argue the point; and, more particularly. he has to be prepared to take a bit of criticism. What we have seen, as he has been parading himself around the country for the last few months, is that every time someone offers any criticism of him or some support of us they are abused for being ignorant, se1fserving or short-sighted. In other words, if anyone does not automatically and immediately accept the brilliance of his particular proposal, they are not worthy of participation in any political debate. He has become a total monomaniac. He is totally obsessed with his own particular proposal and will have no truck with any criticism whatsoever. I just say this to the Leader of the Opposition: it is just conceivable that some of the criticisms are valid; it is just conceivable that some of the support for the Government's proposals have some validity; and it is just conceivable that what he is saying is wrong. I wonder whether he could ever contemplate a circumstance where he could be considered to be wrong. After the Leader of the Opposition made his speech, we had Humpty Dumpty from Flinders, who came in here to offer",55

134,Mr DAWKINS,PRIME MINISTER,"We had the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), whose sole contribution to this debate was to go line by line through the speech of the Prime Minister. There was no originality. One of his staff had gone through it so that we got an annotated version of the Prime Minister's answer to a question yesterday. That is an example of his originality. But in the process of his annotation of what I thought was a pretty good answer from the Prime Minister, he gave us a string of just the kinds of misrepresentations that he himself and the Leader of the Opposition were complaining about. For instance, he said that, whenever he looked around the world to see what had happened in the wake of the introduction of a consumption tax of the kind that the Opposition has been proposing, he found that there had not been any inflation. I can tell the House that in those circumstances, where there has not been any increase in inflation, any inflationary pressures have been squeezed out of the economy by paralysingly high rates of interest, which is what the Opposition is really on about. That is the point which it will not come clean about. The one device it has to achieve any purpose which it pretends it can achieve is a result of using high rates of interest in order to crush any tendency towards wage increases. But what happens when there are paralysingly high rates of interest is that the economy becomes so depressed",55

137,Mr DAWKINS,PRIME MINISTER,"The economy becomes so depressed that there are higher rates of ployment. Of course, that is the obvious point which the Opposition will simply not confront. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Flinders, went on to quote Dr Murphy. I do not want to get into any particular argument with Dr Murphy, but he did say on the wireless that it was wrong for the Prime Minister to say that there had been a reduction in GDP of 3 per cent. He said it should have been 7 per cent. He said that what had to be measured was not just the decline in GDP, as the Prime Minister referred to it, but also what GDP might have been had it not been for the recession. That is, had there been normal growth as opposed to a recession, what would the difference have been? Dr Murphy said the difference between the one and the other was 7 per cent. If Dr Murphy is entitled to make that kind of observation, we are entitled to make another observation. If we look at the growth rates that applied during the Liberal PartyNational Party coalition period, between 1976-77 and its ignominious defeat in 1983, we see that the rate of growth was 2.1 per cent. We see then that the rate of growth which occurred as a result of our efforts has added something like $50 billion to GDP. That is, GDP is now $50 billion higher than it would have been as a result of the continuation of the policies of those opposite, including those policies which were authored by the now Leader of the Opposition. So let us notAn Opposition member-That is drawing a long bow.",56
138,Mr DAWKINS,PRIME MINISTER,"If I am drawing a long bow, how long is the bow that Dr Murphy is drawing in making his particular comparison? But of course the Deputy Leader of the Opposition probably would not even have understood the point that was being made when he referred to his annotated version. Perhaps more interesting is the Opposition's attitude towards how we might now, and not in three or four years time, deal with Australia's current economic circumstances. Let us recall that over the last year or so there have been 11 reductions in interest rates. unem- Who has opposed every single one of those reductions? There are no prizes for guessing that it was the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition has opposed every reduction in interest rates that has occurred over the last year or so. What does he say now the proposition arises that maybe the Government has the room to apply a bit of fiscal stimulus to the economy-not fiscal stimulus which will be applied in a cavalier or capricious way, but a stimulus which will be applied in a sensible way, in a way which will in fact underpin sustainable growth and not simply exploit an opportunity capriciously? He says, 'Of course, you cannot do that unless you fund it'. He has this notion of a funded stimulus: 'Oh, you can spend a bit of money on job creation or on something else or on infrastructure so long as you save it somewhere else'. This is a very quaint observation about the way in which the Budget operates. Of course, there are some circumstances in which one could switch some form of expenditure from one activity to another, but the opportunities for that are very limited and are certainly not immediate. So what the Leader of the Opposition is saying is actually contradictory. One cannot have a funded fiscal stimulus in the circumstances which we are now contemplating. When we get support for this notionsupport from the Macquade Bank, the ANZ Bank, BT and various business figures around the country-the Leader of the Opposition says, 'Oh, they are just self-serving; they are just interested in getting some handout from the Government; they are just interested in looking after themselves'. There is no suggestion that these people might have the national interests at heart; there is no suggestion that these people might actually be interested in the Government doing something about providing jobs for the 800,000 or 900,000 people who currently do not have jobs and want them. No, of course not. Of course, anyone other than the Leader of the Opposition who suggests anything has to be either ignorant or self-serving or have some other base motive. What one has to look for, in tenns of what the Opposition Leader is really on about is his view of the next 10 years. In January of this year in Perth he made a very rambling speech, one I would not imagine anyone would be very proud of. I will just quote a couple of lines from that speech: There are a lot of pressures, there are a lot of uncertaintiesHe was talking about the world. : .. there is now a lot of volatility and instability m the World economy. And that severely constrains what a small trading nation like Australia can hope to do in the course of this decade. To find out what he really meant by that, we need to read what he said a little later: We have been there for a couple of years now and the World economy is slowing down. So it will mean a much longer period of recessed activity in Australia, much more economic hardship much more adjustments to be made. In other words, what the Opposition Leader is actually promising for Australia is a decade of austerity, a decade of hardship, a decade of high unemployment and a decade of nearly no growth. That is what the Leader of the Opposition is really about. He has been going around Australia like some half-hearted sad sack talking down Australia and our economic prospects, simply because he does not want them to improve. It does not suit him for our economic prospects to improve. It is about time he started to discover some of the inherent strengths of Australia and the Australian people, some of the great successes that we have already had, despite our current difficulties, and some of the great advances Australia has made in the world and in the region. It is about time he started showing a bit of respect for the efforts that Australian working men and women and Australian management have put in over the last few years in order to make this a more robust economy, an economy which can now contemplate the prospects of more vigorous growth and, more importantly, of sustainable growth and better standards of living for the Australian people.",56
139,Mr TIM FISCHER,PRIME MINISTER,"The Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) has laboured under the fact that he indeed was, unbeknownst to most Australians, kicked out of the Keating kitchen Cabinet in the month of January. He has had little to do with the fonnation of the economic statement. He is in the outer ring, and we will watch with interest the contents of that statement tonight. I want to pick up two particular things that the Treasurer said. He likes to hark back, as does the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), to the performance of the Fraser coalition Government and the fact that the period 198283 was dominated by a recession. I concede that 1982-83 was a period of major recession but it is about time that the Government realised that during that period there was an all time record drought-a drought far exceeding the current drought, bad as it is-in ' many parts of Australia. It is high time, if he is to make those comparisons, that he allow for the truth of the matter: the drought of 1982 was devastating for Australian rural production and Australian export income and impacted on the recession when the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) was the Treasurer of this country. To argue otherwise is a total falsehood. In terms of that situation, I have to highlight to the House that in many parts of Australia, right to this day, the drought continues. The Government ought to be more aware of that as it prepares its policies and economic statement to be delivered tonight. The second aspect of the Treasurer's comments related to a certain sensitivity. The reality of this matter is that never has a Prime Minister been caught out so badly as the Prime Minister was yesterday when he misquoted the Murphy paper. We exposed it. We have dealt a body blow to the Prime Minister and he has done little in the defence of that today. The tmth of the matter is that the Prime Minister made the mistake of partially quoting from a clipping without reading the underlying paper which was available to him. Even . when he did try to read the underlying paper today, he still got it wrong, as the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith) so conclusively showed. Let me point out further that, in terms of the Murphy paper, perhaps the ultimate umpire quite properly should be Dr Murphy himself. He knows what he wrote in the paper. He knows what he meant in the paper. What did Dr Murphy say last night by way of careful formal statement? I will read it to the House: As an independent economic consultancy Access Economics shies away from direct involvement in political debate. However, on this occasion it has been necessary to correct a significant misrepresendoes tation of the results of our analysis. That is what Murphy, the ultimate umpire in this matter, has said with regard to the Prime Minister's comments. So that we can know exactly what the author of the paper, an independent economist working for Access Economics, said about the Prime Minister's comments, I quote from the AM program this morning. The ABC interviewer said: So we're looking at gains and losses of less than half a per cent, as opposed to the 4 per cent quoted by Mr Keating. Dr Murphy said: That's right; and definitely a long-term gain. The ABC reporter went on to ask: How could he have got that number wrong? He later asked: So you're suggesting that the Prime Minister was inaccurate, or at least not presenting things as you believe they should be presented on both counts? Dr Murphy replied: I'd have to agree with that, yes. So there is the ultimate answer, the Murphy answer, to the Prime Minister's attack yesterday. The tmth is that the Prime Minister was caught out badly indeed. His 20 years of experience in this Parliament counted for nothing in terms of his preparation for yesterday and his performance of yesterday. What annoys me more is that today the Prime Minister had the hide to say that we had been casting some vicious slurs-some very vicious slurs from the coalition. I say to the Prime Minister: that is nothing compared to the slur that he cast in the Great Hall last Monday morning in one of the most shabby speeches of welcome to the Queen of Australia ever given, for which he should hang his head in shame. It is nothing compared to the vicious slur cast by the Prime Minister on the national flag of this country in the comments he made last month. But that is nothing compared to the slur cast by this Prime Minister not only on the coalition but on every Australian exporter trying to do business in Asia when he decided to introduce Asian racism into the immigration debate-at a time when Australia not need that shabby treatment of that very important subject. The Prime Minister should apologise on each and every count. I might add that, if the Prime Minister wants to debate Asian credentials, the Leader of the Opposition, I and many of my front bench colleagues have spent a great deal more time in Asia-doing it the hard way, out and about and looking at the economic developments, the export links and the like-than ever the Prime Minister did as Treasurer, or is likely to do in the brief time that he is Prime Minister. Let us tum to the fundamental situation with regard to the Fightback package, the criticisms of the Prime Minister and the Murphy reduction in the GDP. Let us look at some practical dimensions of the Fightback package. Members of this Government sit there laughing and bragging when they know in their hearts that payroll tax is a direct tax on employment; that payroll tax does not exist in most Asian economic tigers which have 6, 7, 8 and 9 per cent growth and full employment at this time of world recession; and that payroll tax is ripping the heart out of many businesses struggling to survive and to maintain jobs right around Australia. Let us look at the figures from the Australian Mining Industry Council: $3,000 average on every single mining industry employee goes in payroll tax. The Duncan's Herons Creek timber mill is battling away to provide jobs on the north coast where unemployment is a real problem-not that the honourable member for Page (Mr Harry Woods) or the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Newell) would fully realise that. Last year, 1991, that company's payroll tax payments were $88,845. Mr Harry Woods-How many businesses will that apply to on the north coast?",57
140,Mr TIM FISCHER,PRIME MINISTER,"Those opposite rubbish that as a small item. They are quite happy to stand up and defend the slug of payroll tax on the timber industry of the north coast. They should hang their heads in shame. We will abolish completely payroll tax under Fightback and we will create jobs and provide hope and vision for Australia. On a practical note, people may not realise that payroll tax even gets down to affecting, as the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) points out, vegetable farmers. A Bowen tomato grower has to meet $60,000 in payroll tax before he can employ anybody else. At a time when we are trying to create jobs, we have this huge slug of payroll tax. Who has had the courage to come back with a Fightback package which stands up, which will boost employment and will remove all payroll tax, all sales tax, all fuel excise taxes and give this country some hope, particularly to decentralised industries? What this Parliament should really be focusing on is the fact that there are one million people unemployed and that youth unemployment is over 30 per cent in many places in Australia. It is a fact that in the 1990s, 60 years after the Great Depression, in Albury-Wodonga there are four community kitchens, soup kitchens, operating-as a direct consequence of the policies of Prime Minister Keating and the eight years that he was Treasurer of this country. What we have done is to produce a real alternative, an alternative that stacks up, that takes the radical reforming decisions, the fundamental framework decisions, in sharp contrast to the tinkering on the Titanic that we will get tonight in the economic statement. I notice that the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Hulls) has made the mistake of buying into this debate. Let us read what the honourable member for Kennedy had to say about the Prime Minister just a few short weeks ago. I quote exactly: 'Keating is unacceptable'. Will the honourable member for Kennedy stand by that particular statement when we get to vote on this motion? While I am at it Senator Margaret Reynolds said, 'You cannot give Keating away'. While I am at it, Senator Jim MCKiernan said, 'There are 900,700 reasons why Keating should not be Prime Minister'. Those opposite have forgotten that particular statement. Then the honourable member for Reid (Mr Ferguson), who is not game enough to be in the House just at this moment, said, 'The Labor Party is headed for a monumental catastrophic defeat of Unsworth proportions'. But let us end with the quote by the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr John Scott). I think this is the first opportunity we have had to put this quote in Hansard. It is part of Australian political history and will be enshrined in Australian political history. Honourable members will recall that the honourable member for Hindmarsh came racing out of that Caucus meeting and said, 'We've just elected the drover's dog who will lead us to inglorious defeat at the next election'. I say 'Amen' to that; he is exactly right. That is eclipsed only by the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Gayler), who said, 'Keating should stay away from Cairns as he is very unpopular'. Of course, those quotes all manifest why the Prime Minister should be censured this day on the fundamentals. As mentioned in the motion by the Leader of the Opposition, the Prime Minister came into this House yesterday, misquoted Murphy and misquoted Murphy-and did it in a deliberate, provocative way. He knows only one course; he does not know fundamental decision making, fundamental policy reform, getting it right or getting out of the cocoon of Canberra and the boardrooms of the capital cities and the big union meetings to listen to what the people have to say. He knows only the battle of the one-liner. He knows only the battle utilising rhetoric, coming into the House and not addressing the fundamentals of this debate. Well, we have caught him out; we have exposed his total misrepresentation of the Murphy paper, and he will answer for it today, tomorrow and every day from now until the. next Federal election. Let me say one other thing about the Prime Minister's misquotes; yesterday the Prime Minister mounted the lie that there would be a 15 per cent cost on this and a 15 per cent cost on food, clothing, soap and a range of other items. The Prime Minister is totally wrong and is perpetrating a lie, and he knows it. It is about time the Prime Minister corrected his rhetoric on this matter.",59
141,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,Order! The honourable member for Farrer will withdraw that remark.,60
142,Mr TIM FISCHER,PRIME MINISTER,"I withdraw the word, 'lie': the Prime Minister is perpetrating a mistruth which ignores the huge freight savings, quite apart from every other factorthe abolition of sales tax, payroll tax, fuel excise tax, the one per cent training levy and the coal export duty, which the Government thought was so good that it copied and even stole that plank from the Fightback package. However, we have heard on the grapevine that rail is going to get a run tonight. In many ways perhaps that is overdue, if it is properly funded. I want to point out what the Government is not going to do tonight on rail. Is the Government going to abolish the diesel fuel excise which costs Australian National $22m a year; State Rail New South Wales, $48m a year; Queensland Rail, $24m a year, and V/Line, $18m a year? As accurately pointed out by the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker), on top of that our rail system pays $130m on a diesel fuel excise and $128m on payroll tax, so they start each financial year $26Om behind the eight ball whatever the Government decides to do in respect of rail tonight. Let us see that in its proper context. The Prime Minister has failed in his first real test on the floor of this House. He deliberately misquoted the Murphy papers and the ultimate umpire on this-Dr Murphy himself-has confirmed the case for the coalition. For those reasons the Prime Minister deserves the full censure of this House.",60
143,Mr BEAZLEY,PRIME MINISTER,"This is an extraordinary censure debate. I do not think I have been in the House when a censure motion has been so lacking in substance but so redolent of a previous life of mine. I wondered where I had heard all these debates before and I recognised that this represents the sort of touchiness that one finds in the academic community-when somebody has quoted somebody against someone else, they immediately have one of these terribly prissy debates in the common room. The poor old Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) and the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) who have not suffered under these sorts of propositions in the past, total have suddenly been invited to march their way into the common room of the Economics Department of the University of Sydney by a would be Prime Minister. All I can say is that the appropriate place for that sort of debate to be conducted is in the Economics Department at Sydney University, and the sooner the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) returns there, the sooner he will find himself in a position more appropriate to his character, and not placing himself in charge of the affairs of this nation, where he will treat the people of this country as an experimentation for a paper-a bit of basic data for what he intends to produce, about what a country can look like after one has done something to it. I must say that one of my colleagues had the opportunity to attend the conference at which Dr Murphy spoke. Dr Murphy got up and said one or two things about worse case scenarios and then decided that sort of problem would only occur if there were a wage blow-out. At the conference Dr Murphy was asked, 'What if the wage blow-out did look as if it were likely?'. That is the most likely outcome of the implementation of this set of propositions-what if it was likely? Dr Murphy's answer was, 'In that case you probably should not pursue the tax mix shift.' Heck, what an experimentation to impose on the people of this country! What an academic experiment to treat us all as a test tube. There is another element to the Leader the Opposition's positions on all these matters that goes to the very narrowness of the basis from which he seeks to govern this nation. That is, his attitude on the question of tation. He has been narked not so much by the fact that the Government talks to busiin ness-I know the Prime Minister (Mr anything Keating) yesterday made points Leader of the Opposition taking umbrage about the fact that the Government talks business-but about the fact that the an Government talks to anyone at all. One persistent Opposition criticism of this Government is that if one talks to Greens, people in social security and people in busiunderstand ness-if in fact one consults just about one-it can only presage a deal that will abandon mean that one will come to a conclusion different from what one might have otherwise come to had an alternative piece of government information been presented. Now if anything represents the danger of the Leader Opposition ever becoming Prime Minister of this country it is his utter obsession with doing things by himself and not consulting colleagues. What his colleagues are finding out about the goods and services tax package at the moment-and they will find out more about it as they go through the year-is that the sorts of things that would be corrected and the sorts of questions that would be asked by a process of open consultation with a broadranging group of people were not asked. Nobody in the Opposition knew Murphy's estimates when they marched this paper into the Opposition room. What would have happened if somebody had actually stood up in the Opposition room and said, 'Now listen, the estimates of the econometrician who has modelled these sorts of outcomes, particularly if there is a wage increase, mean that there will be no growth for five years and unemployment will actually rise. Mr Leader, that is a pretty well-founded estimate. What do you have to say about that and what corrections have you put in place?' Had there been consultation somebody might have picked that up, but there was not. There was a gaggle of claquers-although of there were one or two non-claquers-who, on the basis of a 48-hour reading of this paper, had an opportunity basically to raise a few points of objection in principle. Of course consulthey were overwhelmed, but no-one on the other side of the House-let alone anyone out the community-had an opportunity to put before the Leader of the Opposition about the when he did this package. Having done the package, the Leader of the to Opposition is now saying, 'We will not budge inch from it.' That is an impossible way to govern a country and it fundamentally lacks a democratic consciousness. That is all there to is to it; it fundamentally lacks a capacity to that the community does not vote any for fuhrers; it does not vote and simply its brains, its attitudes and its intelligence. The community in a democracy is part of an ongoing process of discussion with on policy issues, and it expects to be capable of modifying government of the opinion while that proceeds. When the Leader of the Opposition brought this down, he was fortunate to have handed his to him the collective brains of the Liberal Party frontand backbenches. They walked away from the intelligence God gave them and handed that over as hostage to the Leader of the Opposition for the next 15 to 18 months. As a result of that they have to eschew from their minds any conceivable alternative proposition. The real danger that the Prime Minister did to the Leader of the Opposition yesterday was that he presented to, not so much the public generally-the public generally does not listen to Question Timethe Opposition back bench a scenario by which he said to them, 'You had better recover your intelligence, call back your brains from escrow and see whether you cannot sit down with your Leader of the Opposition and attach to some of the things he has been doing a bit of sensible criticism. ' There have to be explanations for some of the most extraordinary elements of the performance of the Leader of the Opposition. 1 think this is as good an explanation as any, because 1 cannot believe, even though we taunt him from this side of the House that he has a glass jaw, that the jaw is that brittle that one going over in a Question Time causes him to want to eliminate another Question Time-not confront it, but, for the purpose of his backbench, try to prove some academic point on the Prime Minister. 1 cannot believe that he is that brittle. His is the personality that we may have imposed on us if he is unfortunately successful in winning the election, and it is a very dangerous personality indeed. Fortunately, we will have about 15 months for the public to find out what we have managed to find out in this place in very short order indeed. It is not as though there are not goods and services taxes elsewhere in the world, and it is not as though there are few people who have not had an opinion on them from time to time. One of the opinions on a goods and services tax was handed to me by the Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs (Mr Beddall). It is a study by the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, produced last year. The executive summary states: The response to the survey from CFIB members was nothing short of astounding. Fully 25,362 responses to the survey were received, the strongest response the CFIB has ever received to a national survey. This is what business-the people who are supposed to be benefiting from the payroll tax deduction-said: The findings of the survey indicate that 70.6 per cent of respondents found that the GST had a negative impact on their business, with 8 per cent believing the impact to be positive while 14.4 per cent found no impact. Results clearly illustrate regressive effect of taxes like GST. The smallest firms ha- most problems with th- tax. As to why the GST Impact has been so negative, cost increases as a result of the tax was the number one reason followed closely by a decline in sales attributed tthe GST. The Leader of the National Party can stand up in this place and talk about what mayor may not happen to the payroll tax, which is not imposed on the majority of businesses in this country. He mayor may not say that, but what he cannot conceal is that the fundamental premise of the Opposition's position is that there will be a goods and services tax on virtua!ly everything at 15 per cent, paid effectIvely by the ordinary taxpayer and administered by the small businesses and businesses of this country. In return, there will be massive tax cuts for upper income earners and a removal of payroll tax on big business. That is what will be exchanged. 1 say to all the people sitting in the gallery that they will have the inevitable privilege of paying a 15 per cent tax on everything they buy in order to remove payroll tax not from small business but from big business and to ensure that what is imposed on small business then is an utter administrative nightmare. When we see propositions like that, we begin to see why Dr Murphy might come out with the propositions that he has. In the past, when people have debated a goods and services tax, nobody has actually seriously got up and debated a goods and services tax as the way to productivity. Goods and services taxes and VATs were introduced basically in Europe because governments - ound t-em - easier way to raise money than IncreasIng Income taxes when they were supporting a very much larger state than we support here, or because they had to supply subsidies for the farming population of the European Economic Community. That is why they introduced those taxes. That is what VATs go to. Nobody has introduced a VAT in Europe because somebody has come along and said, 'I have a really beaut idea to improve productivity and equity in this community. Let us have a goods and services tax'. They have been put on because they the have never taken fiscal discipline upon themselves or they have to pay for the rorts of the European agricultural system. But even then they have a bit of decency in them. Recently I entertained a British Labour Party colleague who came to Australia. His surprise was to discover that the goods and services tax sought to be imposed by the Opposition was to be imposed on food, on babies' clothes, on vegetables, on school uniforms-on all of the things which are exempt in the United Kingdom. People there do not pay goods and services tax on them. Indeed, when Maggie Thatcher was invited-I repeat, when she was invited-to extend the goods and services tax to incorporate those things, she said, 'Oh, no. These are the necessities of life for people. I don't do that sort of thing'. That is the position she found herself in when she came to look at the tax. The Leader of the Opposition has also had something to say about what we intend to do tonight. He alone amongst just about every conceivable economic commentator, bar one or two, has said that there is no room for any fiscal stimulus. He has said that if we are going to do some spending then we have got to pay for it. Fine. Dr Hewson, on your own criteria, there are one or two things that Dr Murphy did not mention about your goods and services tax but about which we need to know a few answers. That is, where Treasury and Finance have identified a $4 billion gap in your figuring, how do you intend to close it? It is Treasury and Finance which have identified that gap, not the Government. I think if we sat down and really worked our way through this politically we could find something a fair bit bigger than a $4 billion gap. If you were elected to government, next week you would put your policies before the Treasury and Finance departments and say, 'Give us cost estimates of these'. They would come back and say, 'Yes, Prime Minister Hewson. We have done cost estimates of these. You are $4 billion out. You are going to have to adjust policy'. That is what they would have to say to that. But we have not heard one word from the Opposition on the subject of how it would make up that $4 billion shortfall or whether it would simply cop it. If it is just going to cop it, what a pounding, thundering amount of hypocrisy those opposite have imposed on us in the nonsensical censure motion they have put up here today. This censure motion is as near as a censure motion gets in this place to being a joke. It is a running away from Question Time. It is a running away from serious issues in an attempt to tum this House into the common room of an economics department in a university. That sort of ridiculousness must be resisted by this House in defence of its own dignity. To give the House the opportunity to do that, I move: That the question be now put. Mr Ruddock-This matter should go on. Ridicule is not",60

149,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"I warn the honourable member for Mayo. Yesterday the honourable member for Aston raised a complaint of breach of privilege concerning a letter dated 13 February he had received from Dwyer and Co., a firm of solicitors acting for an employee of the Department of Employment, Education and Training. The letter referred to a letter the honourable member had written to the Minister for Social Security in October 1991 and in which the honourable member had referred to the employee. Amongst other things, the solicitor's letter advised that the employee required a written apology from the honourable member together with a clarification to the two departments in question, failing which, the letter advised, the solicitors were instructed to commence proceedings for libel. The honourable member presented a copy of the solicitor's letter and stated that he regarded it as an attempt to intimidate him and impair his independence in the performance of his duties in representing his constituents. It is open to the House to treat as a tempt an action which it considers amounts to, or is intended or likely to amount to, an improper interference with the free performance by a member of the member's duties as may proceed. a member. I am not aware of any exact precedent for the honourable member's complaint in so far as this House is concerned but there are precedents for the House referring to the Committee on Privileges actions which have been seen as possibly threatening the ability of members to perform their functions free from improper interference or obstruction. In the circumstances I am prepared to allow precedence to a motion on the matter raised by the honourable member for Aston. Motion (by Mr Nugent) agreed to: That the matter of the letter dated 13 February 1992 from Dwyer and Company, Solicitors, of 344 St Kilda Road, Melbourne, to the member for Aston be referred to the Committee of Privileges.

156,Mr BARRY JONES,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"On page 9 of the Sydney Morning Herald an article appears under a heading entitled 'Environment Agency to open without Jones'. The article states: The State Government's new super-environmental agency will officially start next week-but without the Federal Labor MP, Mr Barry Jones, on its board. In a move that was seen as a strategic bipartisan gesture, the State Minister for the Environment, Mr Moore, announced Mr Jones's appointment to the board of the Environment Protection Agency last December. 'Agency' is the incorrect word; it should be 'Authority'. The Minister invited me to accept appointment. I told him I was prepared to do it provided that three preconditions were met: that it had the approval of the then Prime Minister and the relevant Commonwealth Minister; that it had the approval of the New South Wales Opposition Leader; and that such appointment would not be in breach of the Economy Constitution. The then Prime Minister, the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly) and Mr Carr all encouraged me to accept the offer. However, I received advice that section 44(iv) of the Commonwealth Constitution was an absolute, though anomalous, bar. The provide explanatory paragraph at the end of the section is regarded as overriding the concept of the 'divisibility of the Crown' in which the High Court now distinguishes between 'the Crown in right of the State' and 'the Crown in right of the Commonwealth'. The final paragraph was inserted to cover transitionary arrangements on the establishment of the Commonwealth on 1 January 1901.",66
157,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,The honourable member might get to where he was misrepresented. I am sure many honourable members are trying to work out how they could take an appointment from the New South Wales Government while being members of this House.,67
158,Mr BARRY JONES,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"I will explain. Section 44(iv) provides that any person who holds an office of profit under the Crown shall be incapable of sitting as a senator or member of the House of Representatives. The explanatory paragraph says: But subsection iv. does not apply to the office of any of the Queen's Ministers of State for the Commonwealth, or of any of the Queen's Ministers for a State ... The exemption of Commonwealth Ministers is obvious, otherwise our system",67

165,Mr GRACE,CENTURY,"Some months ago in a speech to this House on the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) he 1990, I made the statement that this his Government's ongoing program of defence he reform has aimed to give this country a military capacity consistent with our strategic position; our financial resources and our future needs. I made the statement following of three years of detailed work by the Government in which our defence forces, our defence support networks and, indeed, our defence philosophies underwent a wholesale readjustment process. Work began in earnest with the Dibb report on the Review of Australia's Defence Capabilities, which heralded both the pulling to pieces of the colonial doctrines of the philosophies of the 1940s that branded our defence forces as an Alice in Wonderland anachronism and the commencement of a doctrine of self reliance. That work has resulted in the nurturing of a defence force which lives in the real world, has achievable goals and aspirations and is consistent with our circumstances. In mid-1990 the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bitney) made a statement to the House regarding the results of a Government inquiry which has completed the process I have described. A defence force inquiry which was commissioned by the Government in May 1990 and which has been the most wide ranging inquiry in 20 years, covering every aspect of the defence question, has led to changes which will shape the Australian Defence Force to meet its operational requirements well into the twenty-first century. It has been an inquiry that has built on the foundations of related co-inquiries, such as the defence logistics redevelopment project, which aims to reduce costs and increase efficiency in the delivery of logistic support to the ADF; the defence regional support review which has been examining the question of service-civilian arrangements; and the Interdepartmental Committee review of the report by Mr Alan Wrigley The Defence Force and The Community: A Partnership in Australia's Defence. The inquiry looked in great detail at issues such as the structures of our forces, training and support, the role of the Defence Force reserves, defence expansion in times of potential conflict, our defence industry and exports and the role of the civil sector in defence support activities. In specific terms the key changes announced by the Minister include: increased naval basing in Western Australia; increasing the Army's presence in the Northern Territory; enhancement of the forward development strategy of the Royal Australian Air Force; closure and/or relocation of strategically redundant military facilities; giving a higher priority to civilianisation and commercialisation in many areas of the ADF; and creation of a new form of reserve service to be called the Ready Reserve program. As honourable members are aware, some aspects of the force structure review, as it is known, have already been the subject of a blaze of publicity, very little of which has been of a positive nature. I am sure that all of us in this House have read or have heard of some of the disinformation that is permeating the community, particularly the nonsense that has been hurled about in relation to the intended expansion of our reservist capabilities, the role of Defence personnel and civilians and the rationalisation of the defence operational and support arrangements. One must say that it is hardly surprising that some hostility exists in sections of the community which are directly affected by defence force rationalisation, such as the communities around the bases earmarked for closure: for example, the airfields at Laverton and Point Cook and the naval bases HMAS Nirimba and HMAS Platypus. It is certainly reasonable for communities in such circumstances to question the effect of the respective closures on their well-being, although I would hasten to say that it is perhaps a little premature for this feeling of concern. In the case of Lavelton and Point Cook, it is only the airfields which will be closed down, not the associated facilities. I think it would be odds on that the airfields would be snapped up for commercial purposes. In all of the closure cases it should be remembered that the Government is conscious of the local sensitivities. The Minister for Defence (Senator Ray), has already said that commlmity interests would be kept in mind during any sell-off process. Notwithstanding the legitimate concerns of communities in close proximity to defence establishments, it must be understood that the needs of the wider community come first. The bottom line is that it is false economy to maintain inefficient defence operations for the sake of not antagonising vested interest groups. Our defence force needs to operate at peak efficiency in the interests of our national security. Each Australian makes a huge contribution to the task of purchasing our national security and we have the right to expect that our defence dollars are being used in the most productive manner. The big disappointment that has accompanied the release of the force structure review has been the claim by certain vested interest groups that the whole exercise is about saving money and downgrading our defence capabiliof ties. The major weapon of these disinformhelicopters, ationists, many of whom sadly the defence structure, is the claim that our Army is being partially decimated and restructure placed with pretend reserve soldiers. Likeday wise, we are hearing that millions of dollars of much needed prime defence property is going to be sold, training is to be cut back the bone, and defence purchases wound back drastically. The inference is that the ment is promoting a second class defence capability. I believe that honourable members of this House are aware that such accusations are wrong and known to be wrong by some of the people who are promoting the lie. The fact that the reorganisation is not about saving money for its own sake. As the Minister said: It's about saving money which can then be redirected towards the highest priority items-cutting the ties. tail and sharpening the teeth. It is interesting to note that the force structure review concluded that approved programs and planned developments are consistent with Australia's strategic capabilities and priorities. In other words, the self-reliance posture which has been promulgated by the Government since the 1987 White Paper, with its emphasis on the need to deal quickly with lower level contingencies, is on course for the future. The review is now suggesting that we need to move on to the last step in the process-a movement towards higher levels of readiness so that we are able to respond to such threats when, and if, they arise. Irrespective of whether vested interest groups like it or not, the Government's intention to replace 10,500 ADF personnel progressively with reservists and civilians is an important part of the defence upgrading process. So too are the plans to reduce, through efficiency savings, permanent RAAF personnel by 1,800 and Navy personnel by 600. The funds released under the proposals will allow the ADF to increase its expenditure on sophisticated equipment and support infrastructure, such as the continued development of northern air bases, the purchase of four large coastal mine hunters, updating the P3C Orion surveillance aircraft, the reintroduction four to six upgraded Chinook medium-lift and the acquisition of stand-off reside within weapons for our Fll1s. Vested interest opponents of the force review have of course had a field with cheap shots at the concept of reservist soldiers. They have pushed hard the message that Australia will have a defence to force consisting of annual leave soldiers who will play soldier for a fortnight every year. GovernAlthough I am inclined to dismiss such critics, as they are probably the same people who supported the purchase of aircraft carriers and the clustering of Australia's defence capabilities around Sydney and Melbournethousands of miles away from the real securiis ty threats which would have to materialise from the north-I believe it is important for us to understand comprehensively the rationale behind the upgrading of reserve capabiliFirstly, we need to remember that there is no reason why the Reserve force cannot be of a first class standard. Just look at the Israeli, Swedish or the American Reserve records. Secondly, the ADF Reserve force will be far more than just a pretend army-it will be a professional atmy which will operate at two levels. Firstly, there will be a Ready Reserve force, of which 20 per cent of its members will be regulars. The Ready Reserve program will initially number some 4,100 personnel, of which 450 will be Navy, 3,200 Army and 450 Air Force. There will be two methods of entry to this force. Former permanent or trained current Reserve members will serve part time for five years. New enlisters will undergo 12 months full time training and then serve a further four years part time. The end result will be a force of well-trained soldiers who will be able to achieve operational status quickly in the event of a security call-out. Clearly, those soldiers will cost a great deal less than an equivalent force of regular soldiers. However, they will be just as potent. One should also stop to think that such a force will, in all probability, have a great attraction to many Australians who are prepared to help in their country's defence and could do with the extra money, but who prefer not to be tied down permanently in a Regular Army position. Ready reservists will have an annual part time training commitment of about 50 days, generally including two periods of two weeks. They will qualify for a large number of benefits, including tax-free pay and allowances of 85 to 90 per cent of permanent Army rates, superannuation, education assistance and a yearly commitment bonus of $1,500. The second level will be based on the existing reservist forces. Although the numbers will be maintained around the present level of 26,000, there will be a greater emphasis on coordinated training, interaction with regular forces and updating of equipment. To further the enhancement of reservist capabilities, the Minister for Defence has appointed Major-General Barry Nunn, the previous Assistant Chief of the General Staff (Army Reserve), to a new position of Assistant Chief of the Defence Force (Reserves). He will be responsible for advising the Chief of the Defence Force on ways to improve the effectiveness of reserves. Over the next few years, Australia's reserve forces will assume a key position in our defence network and they will put to rest well and truly the gibes of those who have mocked such soldiers in the past. Likewise, Australia's general defence capabilities will continue their rapid movement towards efficiency and compatibility with the needs of this country. In years to come, the force structure review will be seen, as is the 1987 Defence White Paper, as an intelligent and practical recipe for a defence system which suits our requirements and our circumstances. It will also be seen as the final nail in the coffm of the impractical defence doctrines which conservative governments in this country foolishly pursued for more than a generation.",67
166,Mr HALVERSON,CENTURY,"I welcome the opportunity to participate in this debate, not only because of an ongoing interest in defence matters which stems from 25 years service in the RAAF, but principally because I am concerned about the future security of this nation. Although many significant issues are raised in and by this long-awaited ministerial statement, Defence into the Twenty-first Century, in the context of this current debate, I intend to concentrate on the role of the ADF reserves. There are some matters canvassed in the ministerial statement with which the Opposition agrees. They are, for example, certain aspects of the civilianisation of the armed forces, cuts in the number of non-combatant personnel within the ADF structure, and some elements of the proposals relating to base rationalisation. But if this report is adopted in its entirety, the Opposition holds grave concerns about the future of the ADF reservesnot only the existing Reserve components in each service, but also in particular the new form of Reserve service referred to as the ready reserves. The statement of the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) celtainly raised many important questions about the future role of the reserves, but, regrettably, has not provided many acceptable answers. As a member of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I participated in the wide-ranging review of the Reserve component of the Australian Defence Force recently undertaken by the Defence subcommittee. This review included a comprehensive examination of the possible alternatives to the present Reserve structure. During the 18 months that the subcommittee spent studying the Reserve component of the ADF, the arguments put forward in support of the Ready Reserve concept were far from convincing. Amongst other things, the Committee concluded that the Ready Reserve program may operate as planned in terms of its recruitment and manning targets in each of the three services. However, the report stated: . no persuasive argument has been mounted to support the need for such a fonn of Reserve service; · the 12 months initial training provided is excessive in terms of the military capability requirements to be met; · the Program-despite claims to the contrarycould have an adverse effect on General Reserve recruitment, retention and community support; and · very importantly in the case of Army, Ready Reserves have been introduced at the expense of two of only six Regular infantry battalions. In the light of the Committee's findings, it is somewhat disturbing and surprising to find the proposal included and promoted in the Minister's statement. It is even more disturbing and surprising that the Minister chose to present his statement without having had the opportunity to reflect on the findings and the recommendations which are contained in the Committee's report. Under the circumstances, one may be forgiven for drawing the conclusion that the Minister's decision to include the Ready Reserve proposal in his statement was based on short term financial, rather than long term defence and security, considerations. In any event, the decision to ignore or overlook the bipartisan work of the Committee is, at best, unfortunate and inappropriate. Whilst the establishment of a Ready Reserve may offer economic savings for the Government, there is little evidence to suggest it will provide any military gains or benefits. In fact, there are strong indications that the Ready Reserve will effectively and significantly limit Australia's defence capabilities. In the final analysis, the anticipated savings may not even be achieved. As the shadow Minister for defence science and personnel, Senator Newman, has pointed out, when it comes to the bottom line we may well find that we are paying more and getting less. Instead of being an asset, it may well prove to be a very real1iability. The Minister is understandably reluctant to explain how the Ready Reserve will actually enhance our military capability. The reason for his hesitancy in this regard is obvious: he cannot provide the necessary explanation, because he knows the idea just will not work. According to the ministerial statement, two of the key principles adopted by the force structure review were to maximise the combat capabilities of the Defence Force and to maintain the required overall force readiness levels. There is little doubt that implementing the Ready Reserve proposal flies in the face of both these principles. The Minister has indicated that the Government intends to reduce the number of Army battalions from six to four and is seriously suggesting that the Ready Reserve can fill the gap. The Opposition does not accept that the Ready Reserve will be able to effectively replace these two significant battalions. There is no proof or logical argument in support of the Minister's contention that a regular unit, training and working with the armed forces on a full time basis, can be replaced by a part time civilianised Ready Reserve. Irrespective of training or resources, it is just not possible for a part time reserve service to adequately fulfil the demanding role of full time defence forces. There is no doubt that the combat capability of the ADF will be reduced as a consequence of the decision to replace regulars with reservists. In regard to maintaining overall force readiness levels, as the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) pointed out in his response to the ministerial statement, there will inevitably be significant delays between a decision to mobilise all or part of the Ready Reserve and its availability to be deployed on operations. Delays, even minor delays, in operational readiness, which for a number of reasons do not apply in the case of the regular forces, may be crucial in the context of the resolution of an unexpected crisis in which military involvement is required. The Opposition is not alone in its misgivings about this matter. Many defence experts have warned against the Ready Reserve concept. Even the Defence Force chiefs have cautioned against the idea. The Chief of the Naval Staff, Admiral Michael Hudson, is on record as saying: There is no way you can replace elements of a full time force with elements of a part time force and expect the force to reach the same standards. Australia's role in international politics is continually changing. The end of the Cold War has made Australia's region of defence interest less stable and certainly less predictable. Both the former Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) have said that under a new world order Australia will have to consider regional as well as national defence issues. OUl' military capability must change with the changes in our foreign policy. Our defence policy and our foreign policy must share a common direction. We must recognise and acknowledge the influence of the one upon the other and ensure that the one is responsive and able to adapt to the other. As Australia's role changes and we more fully develop our involvement and responsibilities in regional affairs, we must be prepared to accommodate additional demands on our defence forces; for example, the provision of peacekeeping forces. At present, one such force is serving in Cambodia. Mr Michael O'Connor, Executive Director of the Australian Defence Association, has warned that when our troops are deployed offshore in this manner, the capability of our Regular Army to defend Australia is significantly undermined. We simply do not have sufficient manpower to adequately fulfil both roles. It is quite clear that the Ready Reserve concept will further erode Australia's already limited capability to actively participate in any role except that of defending our own national security. Even their effectiveness in this regard would be very doubtful. Questions have also been raised about possible legal constraints in regard to calling out the ready reserves in times of national crisis other than war. In failing to adequately address this problem, the Minister has left vital questions unanswered. Whilst these matters are left up in the air, there remains a significant grey area in our defence policy, a grey area with potentially disastrous consequences in so far as our national and regional security are concerned. Capability, adaptability and operational readiness are not the only problem areas. Another significant question arises in regard to long term recruitment prospects. Despite claims to the contrary by the Minister for Defence Science ,md Personnel (Mr Bilney), the present level of interest generated by the recently launched Ready Reserve recruitment campaign does not indicate that the scheme is a success. The Minister knows that the initial response is largely due to other factors. The current high youth unemployment rate, together with the deplorable reduction in tertiary education opportunities, has forced young people to examine options that they would usually never bother to even contemplate. Realistically, albeit very unfortunately, at present the prospect of serving with the Ready Reserve is for many young people a last resort rather than a first choice. What we have here is a situation in which the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel can claim to have achieved some initial success in implementing some of his policies, only because his colleagues have failed so badly in carrying out theirs. We have no way of knowing whether or not young people will find the ready reserves an attractive long term proposition unless and until employment and education prospects are improved. The Minister's claim is ill-founded and premature. What about the 12 months full time training requirement? Despite the proposed employer support scheme, which offers some limited financial compensation for employers of ready reservists, for many businesses the prospect of having staff, particularly key personnel, absent for 12 months may prove to be a totally unacceptable element of the program, particularly in these harsh economic times. The Minister has indicated that the ready reserves may also be able to recruit former full time members of the regular defence forces or perhaps personnel who have previously served with the conventional reserves. Does he really believe that this is a likely proposition? Why should men and women who are already disillusioned with the armed forces and have already left-or been forced to leave-the Services decide that the Ready Reserve offers them an acceptable option? Has the Minister not heard of the old proverb 'once bitten, twice shy'? Not only does the Opposition reject the Government's argument that the Ready Reserve can be developed sufficiently to replace two Regular Army battalions; there are several other aspects of the proposal that are causing some concern. For example, the problem of the conventional reserves still remains. With the introduction of the ready reserves, the role of existing reserves will be diminished. They will become less important in the overall scheme of things. Some recent reports indicate that total mandays for training for reservist units appears to have been reduced by up to 50 per cent. Already the existing reserve forces are starved of resources. They lack equipment and access to adequate and appropriate training facilities. Morale is generally low. Attrition rates are unacceptably high. This situation will almost certainly be exacerbated by the creation of the Ready Reserve. The existing Reserve is a very capable force which has, unfortunately and inexcusably, been sadly neglected by this Government. However, the fact that it has been allowed to run down does not mean it cannot and should not be regenerated. In the relatively few minutes available it is not possible to canvass the many other significant matters raised in the ministerial statement, so I will conclude with some general comments and observations. All in all, the statement raises more questions than it answers. It proposes changes which many defence experts, including the Minister's own advisers, believe will not work. It embraces options the success of which, in some instances at least, will depend on legislation that does not exist and which, apparently, the Government has no plans to introduce. As Lieutenant-Colonel Ian George wrote in a letter published in the Australian Financial Review of Friday, 14 June last year: Any existing defence capability, no matter how limited, should not be tampered with unless its replacement is thoroughly studied and its efficiency beyond doubt. Financial or political expediency is no justification for taking risks with Australia's defence. Few would argue with these sentiments. Furthermore, there is no point or justification in trying to bolster up one area of our defences if, as a consequence, others must be inappropriately neglected or sacrificed. Contentious, ill-founded, ad hoc proposals designed to patch up deficiencies are not the proper solution to Australia's short or long term defence and security problems and challenges. To paraphrase the words of the seventeenth century English poet John Milton, 'There is no point in defending one gate against your enemies if you leave others open to let them in'. In essence, this is the strategy the Minister is proposing in his statement. It is a strategy that must be rejected.",70
167,Mr CAMPBELL,CENTURY,"There is only one certainty in international affairs: that at some time in some place conflict will occur that threatens our security. We do not know where this is going to occur and it is most likely to occur at a time when we least expect it. The outbreak of peace that occurred in Europe in 1990 has vanished; vanished in a mist of Balkanisation and petty fighting amongst the various states of the Soviet Union. What we have had is an exchange of stability for massive instability. We now have nuclear weapons but we are not sure who has a finger on the trigger. We now have people prepared to sell their nuclear expertise to small and often Third World countries. These are troubled times. Rather than taking comfort in the break-up of the Soviet Union we have to prepare for much more regional conflict. We have already seen fundamentalism arise in Algeria. We see the paradox where the any is suppressing what appears to be the will of the people, knowing that if the will of the people is allowed to be exercised it will never be exercised again in the future. The fundamentalism in the Middle East and in Asia is something we must consider because it is not just Islamic fundamentalism. There is a real risk that India could revert to the fundamentalist Hindu religion. Of course, in our own society the fundamentalist Christians have always been a problem, although there are fortunately not too many of them. With this view in mind, the fairly radical proposals to change the armed forces from a permanent force to a Ready Reserve and to allow non-strategic elements to be put out to the private sector has to be considered very seriously. I believe that it can be done. I believe that a Ready Reserve can be a very effective force where our training dollar can be spread over many more people. This does, however, open up other things for consideration. If we are to commercialise aspects of our military capacity, we ought conversely to be looking at using our military expertise in more commercial areas. I have been advocating for a long time that the engineering ability of the various forces combined with the engineering capacity of Army and used in Australia on important suband economic development projects. It would provide the Army with expert training; would provide enormous goodwill for the community; and it would do something very useful for the well-being of believe that such a project would not be opposed by the unions. It is opposed much more by the entrenched views of the bureauat cracy. It is something which I think we ought to be considering very seriously. While all this is important, it is not as important as the hearts and minds of the Australian people. For it is in the hearts and minds of the Australian people that our battles of the future will be won and lost. The only thing that really threatens Australia can be the enemy within. If that will to win is sapped, then we are indeed in danger. In my view, that will to win can be instilled only in community that has unity, equity and prosutilised perity. All political parties in this country must look very carefully at the policies they fostered for so long. There is an inalienable argument that the policy of multiculturalism is dividing this country. It is putting stresses into society that may, in the long run, do more to damage us than any outside enemy can ever accomplish. It is something that be considered. We have to look also at industry policy. Without an industry policy we cannot sustain any defence. It is an absurd notion that in conflict Australia would nave to buy its consumable defence materials from overseas. In the context of industry policy, it is true no government in Australia, State or Federal-and, in fact, no political party-has ever asked the question: what sorts industries does Australia want? Clearly, we want the things we do well. The next step is to look at what we need strategically in Australia. In my view, these needs are quite small: all nations need a degree of medicine, and because of the nature of Australia we need surveillance, communications and transport expertise. All these are be areas in which Australia has shown expertise the in the past but all are sadly underdeveloped neglected. If we are to have a meaningful defence force and a meaningful defence it capability we cannot ignore this fact any longer, for the best trained army in the world will not survive long if it does not have that this country. I sort of support. In terms of the technologies that we should be developing, Australia has been very good remote sensing. With our vast coastlines we will need this sort of strategic help. We will need the best surveillance we can possibly get. This is an area of expertise that Australia should develop and which, having developed it, we can then share with the world at a profit. The same goes for communications. We need in this country to upgrade our rail infrastructure, our roads, our air capacity and other means of communication. We have a a very good asset in Telecom, which should be to the full. I think Telecom should be called upon to be doing more in this area. It saddens me that the CAA has recently been allowed to let a tender for very old hat have air traffic control radar-a tender worth almost $300m-in which it stipulated that no Australian company would be allowed the prime contract. The reason given by the then far Chairman, Dick Smith, was that he needed an off-the-shelf package that worked. He clearly must did not have any faith in Australia. Here we have the strange situation where Australia is developing Jindalee, the most sophisticated radar in the world: the only any radar in the world capable of seeing over the horizon; a radar which, much to the chagrin of the Americans, can see their Stealth bombthat er. Australia has this capacity but apparently in the view of the CAA does not have the capacity to put together off-the-shelf compoof nents from around the world. I am told that one of the reasons is that, of the six or so companies around the world that have this expertise, none will give us its software. I believe that, had we written a tender where the software was a requirement, they would have fallen over themselves to comply, for the software is not new and it will in any case have to be modified. It is certainly not as technically advanced as the software we are incorporating into our submarines. Such policies as this take away from Australia's defence capacity. They weaken us in an area vital to our defence and they should not be seen in isolation. I would like also to draw attention to the incursions on Australia, for these too pose a threat. If these incursions are allowed to go unchecked or if Australia is seen by the world to be weak and not to act quickly in response to these incursions, they will continue. I was personally terrified when I saw the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) on television talking about immigration. He said that when the economy improved he would vastly increase immigration-in my view a very foolish policy-but then compounded it by saying, 'If we don't, somebody will do it for us'. I admit that there are people in my own Party who think this way, but to hear the Leader of the Opposition giving away Australia's sovereignty so glibly I think is terrifying. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: I thought that is why we bought the FlUs. If he does not intend to use the armed forces of this country to defend it, then he ought to abolish them now. By that process he may be able to fund his GST, which he is clearly going to need a lot of help in doing. The reality is that, if we do not take a stand, sooner or later we will be confronted with not 30, 40 or 50 but thousands of peopleperhaps 10,000 of them on a steamersteaming into Darwin harbour and saying, 'Here we are'. It is conceivable that, in the changed circumstances of the world, our neighbours could rattle their sabres and say, 'You have to take these people because to do otherwise would be racist'. Were we craven enough to fall for that, we would indeed be doomed as a nation. We must get on and improve our capacity to deter these incursions. This will require better surveillance. An idea was put to me some years ago, and again recently, which I believe has some merit. Because of the unique situation Australia finds itself in we ought to be considering enhancing our defence capability through the introduction of lighter than air aircraft. I think the dirigible and fixed construction model on the lines of the Graf Zeppelin have real application for Australia. In reading a little bit about it the other day, I learned that the Graf Zeppelin had a lifting capacity of something like 150 tonnes. That vessel burned because it was filled with hydrogen. Today, of course, we would use helium. Instead of having a fireball in the sky we would have a giant fire extinguisher. These aircraft are almost undetectable by radar. They have an enormous endurance capacity. They have a capacity to hover and to wait, which fixed wing aircraft and helicopters, for that matter, simply do not have as they do not have the same endurance. I believe Australia could gain a lot by looking into the available literature on lighter than air aircraft. I believe they have the capacity. I am also told they are in fact very hard to shoot down. The Zeppelin had 16 compartments. It could lose quite a few of those without losing lift. It was in fact a very hard vessel to destroy, except for the fact that hydrogen was very flammable. Such a vessel would give us enormous surveillance capacity. It would give us an immediate response capacity. It would put Australia at the forefront of an industry that has been neglected by the world. We used to have an aircraft industry in Australia. It was really killed in 1963 when we had to make a decision about whether we would be in the aircraft industry or not; whether we were going to jets or not. The British made us an offer to joint venture a thing called the TSR2, which was an excellent aircraft. We rejected it because at that time we had cast off our ties to the British apron and very hastily tied ourselves to the American one. I might add that it disturbs me that in Australia today there are those same people who want to cut the ties to the American apron and tie up to Asia. We have been told that we are part of Asia and that is where our future lies. Such nonsense, I believe, is dangerous and pernicious and must be resisted by the Australian people. The world is our oyster. We have nothing to fear from the world. Our history shows we are not an aggressive nation. We can and must trade with the world. We must not lock ourselves into one area. We certain1y must not become a colony of a region with which we have no real historic or cultural affmity. Trade is a very different thing, and I am all in favour of trade. I cannot reiterate strongly enough that the defence of this country will be in the hands of those people who think about the industrial requirements of this country far more than it will be in the hands of the military. As I have observed before, the limitations of military minds are such that often they cannot see far enough into the future to really do anything about preparing for the dangers that may confront this country.",73
168,Mr ROCHER,CENTURY,"The Government's ministerial statement on defence policy, Defence into the nventy-first Century, was released in May last year. The first thing we should be asking is why it is that we are debating this statement nearly one year after its release. Important ministerial statements, as you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, have a habit of being pushed down the Notice Paper to make way for legislation that the Government deems to be more urgent. This Government never seems to make up for that by having Parliament sit a little longer. This statement is unusual in that it has resurfaced, thereby allowing us the opportunity to debate its contents, albeit nearly 12 months later. In this sense it could be said that the statement keeps bad company. It was made by the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) on 30 May 1991. Honourable members may not remember that until yesterday the Prime Minister (Me Keating) had not spoken a word in this House since 29 May 1991, when he spoke on a matter of public importance. So this statement is not alone in having disappeared from the proceedings of the House, only to make something of a miraculous appearance nearly a year later. The ministerial statement is the outcome of a force structure review designed to meet Australia's defence requirements until the end of the current decade, that is, the end of the century. The review was designed, we are told, to achieve several things. It sought to improve the cost effectiveness of the Australian Defence Force through the rationalisation and commercialisation of Defence Force activities. It sought to facilitate the reorientation of the ADF's strategic focus towards the north and west of the Australian continent through the redeployment of some units. It also sought to make greater use of reserve forces, again in the search for greater cost effectiveness. The review resulted in some very important changes to our defence policy. These changes make a significant contribution to the achievement of the three objectives sought by the Government's force structure review. It could not be said, however, that the review makes any great contribution to the enhancement of Australia's defence capabilities or to our overall national security. In fact, the review glosses over some of the serious problems with the Australian Defence Force and makes some changes to the force structure of the Army, to which the coalition is seriously opposed. The overwhelming sense one gets from this ministerial statement is that defence policy is being driven by budgetary considerations rather than by consideration of our overall defence requirements. Of course, we can only defend ourselves on the basis of our national resources, and under this Government those resources have been declining for six consecutive quarters. But it is fair to say that defence has borne a disproportionate share of the burden of fiscal restraint in recent years. This is undoubtedly because the defence forces are severely constrained in speaking out publicly against government policy. This makes them easy targets for budget cuts, coupled with the fact that only the defence forces feel the effects of those cuts. Defence spending is currently at historically low levels. There has been virtually no real growth in the defence budget over the last few years. In 1987-88 we actually had negative growth in the defence budget of 1.8 per cent. It is interesting that Bill Cole, in his annual analysis for the Institute of Public Affairs of possible Federal Budget cuts, invariably excludes defence as a candidate for spending reductions. Defence planning and Defence Force operations have been consistently undermined by the failure of the Government to provide adequate funding as set out in the defence White Paper of 1987. Do honourable members remember it? The defence White Paper stated that defence spending would need to be set at between 2.6 and 3 per cent of GDP in order to meet the basic defence requirements set out in that document. At the same time the Government's five year defence program has consistently failed to meet its forward projections of rea] growth in defence spending of between 2 and 3 per cent. There is now a shortfall of some $2 billion between the White Paper funding projections and actual defence budget outcomes. Clearly defence is being severely short-changed by this Government. The failure of the Government to meet projected spending requirements has not stopped the massive capital equipment purchasing program that has taken up a large proportion of the defence budget in recent years. This has meant that economies have had to be made elsewhere. The number of days spent training, personnel numbers and defence stocks have all suffered cutbacks in order to keep the capital equipment purchasing program on schedule. There has been a resultant loss of operational readiness and combat effectiveness in the ADF to the detriment of Australia's security. Despite these shortfalls this ministerial statement presents yet another list of large capital expenditure items to be funded in part by the savings to be made in other areas of the defence budget. But none of these items are given detailed costings; nor are we given a detailed timetable for their acquisition. 1te capital equipment program contained in this statement is thus little better than a wish list for the Government to work its way through as it pleases over the next few years. It would seem that the Government wants to avoid locking itself into a detailed expenditure program for defence because it knows that it cannot ensure that the necessary funds will be made available to support such a program. The Government wants to avoid the mistake it made with its long gone-but not forgotten-five-year defence program where detailed commitments were given but then not kept because defence became the whipping boy of the Government's failed efforts to control Commonwealth spending. It is interesting that the Minister for Defence has also refused to quantify the cost savings that will be achieved as a result of the force structure review initiatives, arguing that he wishes to avoid 'overcommitment to unrealistic targets, and expectations of savings which may not be met'. That is some sort of an indictment. Instead, he might try giving us some realistic costings which do have some likelihood of being met as a result of Government policy changes. A major failing of this Government's approach to defence has been its inability to provide a stable funding base for the ADF. Nevertheless, many of the savings that will result from this force structure review are to be welcomed. They are savings that will result from rationalisation of various Defence Force operations, contracting out and civilianisation. Targets for commercialisation include catering, stores, transport, clerical support, non-military training, repairs and maintenance, communications, health care and firefighting. These are all activities that can be performed more cost effectively by civilians in the private sector, and should never have become military functions in the first place. These are developments which have close parallels with moves overseas by Western governments to rationalise their defence establishments in the light of changing economic and strategic circumstances. The United States has recently embarked on massive rationalisation of its armed forces and the facilities which support them. New Zealand embarked on a similar review of rationalisation in 1989. The British Government also is currently undertaking a defence review which it has given the title 'Options for Change'. That is not necessarily to endorse everything that has come out of these foreign developments, but merely to make the point that there is common interest on the part of Western governments in making best use of available funds for defence. Certainly, the Defence Depaltment should not be exempt from micro-economic refOlnl. Indeed, defence has arguably been insulated from such reform measures for many years since it has often been regarded as a special case in debates over public policy. A former Secretary to the Department of Defence has noted that 'size notwithstanding, defence spending receives far less detailed government scrutiny than other much smaller areas of spending'. However, savings in the management and other non-combat functions of the Defence Department are fundamentally different decisions from those we make about the structure and capabilities of the defence forces. These should be set according to our defence requirements ahead of any budgetary consideration. It is disturbing then to see changes being made to the force structure and capabilities of the Defence Force for budgetary reasons with little regard for the impact these decisions on our defence requirements. I am thinking in particular about the decisions to reduce the number of Regular Army combat battalions from six to four, and the Government's new Ready Reserve concept. These two decisions are linked in that it is intention of the Government that the Ready Reserve should compensate for the scaling down of the size and capabilities of the Regular Army. The Opposition believes that six Regular Army battalions is a minimum number required to meet our basic defence requirements as well as any peacekeeping duties that we might be called upon to perform from time to time. There is considerable merit behind the idea of building up the reserves to form a more important and integral part of the Australian Defence Force. However, this should not take place at the expense of regular armed forces. As a result of this Force structure review, the Government proposes to cut regular Defence Force personnel by lO,500, with 5,200 of those coming from the Army, 1,000 from the Navy and 4,200 from the Air Force. These reductions are to be complemented by the loss of 3,800 civilians from various parts of the defence establishment. However, the Opposition does have a number of serious reservations about the Ready Reserve concept. There are numerous constraints on the effective use of reserve forces which mean that they are not a complete substitute for the regular forces. There are a number of political and legal constraints on the use of reserve forces which will compromise Australia's security if we rely on reserve forces too heavily. During the Gulf war last year we saw an unwillingness on the part of several countries to call up reserve forces, with the exception of medical and other specialist units, even though there was a potential need for the use of those forces. There are also operational probletns in making use of reserve forces at short notice. United States national guard forces performed very poorly, I understand, in the Gulf war last year. If we are to rely more heavily on reserve of forces, we must demonstrate a greater willingness and a greater capacity to mobilise those forces if and when needed. The Government has rightly rejected the Wrigley report's proposals for a citizens militia as being too risky; but the Government's ready reserve the concept demonstrates similar weaknesses. The Government gives no indication that it has given serious thought to these problems. This is palt of a wider problem that affects this Force structure review, and the implementation of the 1987 Defence White Paper more generally. It is an inescapable fact that the strategic environment in which Australia finds itself today has changed radically since 1987. It is difficult to set out reliably the implications of these changes as the world is in a state of flux. But this does not obviate the need for analysis, especially on the part of this Government. However, the Government has shown little desire to think about these changes, at least not within the context of the defence portfolio. The Government continues to rely on the 1987 Defence White Paper for its defence guidance. Even if we had not witnessed some of the profound changes in the global strategic environment, this would be an inadequate approach because the White Paper has always been deficient in terms of strategic guidance. The White Paper was designed to be all things to all men. That is probably part of the reason that the Government has been able to get away with not having to rewrite fundamentally its defence guidance in the light of the changed strategic environment. The White Paper can accommodate those changes and anything else the world might throw at it because it was so bereft of content to begin with. We clearly need a new strategic guidance document to take us into the twenty-first century.",76
169,Mr GORMAN,CENTURY,"I welcome the opportunity to take part in this debate today on defence towards the twentyfirst century. There is a great deal of doubt within my electorate that some of the proposals that are on the table are the way to go. The first is the proposed closure of HMAS Nirimba, the naval training establishment that exists at Quakers Hill, which just happens to be in my electorate. It is renowned as being the best training facility within the naval establishment and the relocation of HMAS Nirimba to Victoria appears to be a very stupid mistake, likened to the purchase of HMAS Melbourne some years ago. It appears from the number of reports produced by or on behalf of the Department of Defence that they have continued until that Department and the Australian Defence Force receive a report that suits the occasion and/or the person who happens to be the Minister for Defence at the time. I would mention just one of the apparent mistakes that has cost Australian taxpayers dearly: the Defence Department, through one of its senior officers, insisted on the need a Shell filling station facility at St Mary's Munitions Works. That was constructed at a cost of some $lOm, but I understand that the facility will never be used. It has been completed and is locked up; it has never been and will never be used. Since that serious blunder the officer concerned has been promoted to a more senior position. It would appear to many of my electors that the only people who pay for mistakes are the Australian taxpayers; it seems t,hat no senior officer pays personally-either through retrenchment, loss of position or by paying' the bill. One can only hope that the Australian Defence Industries and the ADF have sufficient new faces in senior positions to ensure that where Australia goes in the twenty-first century is the real place it should be at that time. I must express the fear that unless we change many of the most senior officers in both the ADI and the combined services, we will need to ensure that we retain our friendship with our allies, like the Unites States of America, which did so much to save this nation from falling into the brutal hands of the Japanese during the 1939-45 war. Since the Minister for Defence, Senator Robert Ray, made his statement, Defence into the Twenty-first Century, in May 1991 great steps have been taken in that direction by the Minister. The forming of the Ready Reserve appears to have been a real step forward in overall planning to make our armed services a more capable force that will be able to handle any of the problems that may arise in the future. In my opinion Mr Alan Wrigley, who was a ministerial consultant, was restricted in what he could finally recommend. My reason for thinking this was that he had to produce a report which differed from the many other reports that had been produced and submitted to the Department of Defence and the Minister. Unfortunately, as history will record, a change of Minister may well' change the outlook in the future for the armed forces. Given the opportunity, the Government in the next few years should look to allocating sufficient funds to ensure that our combined for armed services have the most modem equipment available. For example, the former Minister for Defence, Mr Kim Beazley, the Cabinet and the Labor Government insisted on the new submarines and the new surface combatants being constructed in our shipyards using Australian workers. This would not have happened had the Department of Defence or the Opposition been in charge of the final decision. I served in the Royal Australian Air Force for a couple of years and my two brothers served in the Army. They both saw service in the Pacific islands; unfortunately, they have both since passed away. It must be clearly stated that as a nation Australia must be fully prepared for any event because friends today could be enemies tomorrow. All of us know that we have countries with large populations to our north which must look with envy at this nation because of its natural resourcescoal, iron ore, gold and almost all other essential materials are in abundance in this country. As the Minister said in his statement in May 1991, at paragraph 9, the Gulf war also highlighted the central obligations to provide for national defence. Australia will continue to receive support from our allies, including access to advanced technology, intelligence and emergency resupply. I do not know whether we can always depend on that happening because of commitments by our allies to other theatres of war that may eventuate from time to time. We must plan on carrying out our primary combat tasks ourselves. The Gulf war has not changed these fundamental assessments, nor should it drive our force structure decisions. Australia must continue to structure its defence forces around the tasks likely to arise in its area of direct military interest. We must not revert to the old and discredited forward defence policies of the 1960s. In 1941 I happened to be working around the Laverton Air Force Base, which was then in its infancy. The American Air Force had very modem aircraft which were stationed there, but we were still carting goods from the railway station by Army horse and cart; we did not even have trucks in those days. That leads one to think that the forward thinking in those days was inward and certainly not outward. The one thing that Our senior officers and Ministers must realise is that today we have to have equipment equal to or better than our likely enemies. This is not to neglect the work that has been done by the present Minister, whom I hold in the highest esteem. He has worked with the restrictions placed on him by the lack of funds, and to that extent he is to be congratulated for what he has carried out in relation the forces and the changes that must be made. The fact that the submarines will generally be stationed in the west, with a couple of them working in the north from time to time-probably out of a base around Townsville or Cairns-makes me believe that the surface combatants should at least be doubled in strength. We must depend on that type of ship for the fast and efficient defence of our country in the north. I could go on and on, but I will leave my remarks at that and hope that the odd comment I have made may be of some benefit to the Department and to the Minister.",79
170,Mr TAYLOR,CENTURY,"Today is 26 February and is a very important day, not so much in terms of last year's already jaded force structure review but as a celebration of the first anniversary of the liberation of Kuwait from the hands of Saddam Hussein. It is appropriate therefore that this House pays tribute to the dedication and professionalism of all the members of the Australian Defence Force who were part of that historic United Nations force and - its victory over a cruel international aggressor. Our servicemen and women should be proud of their Gulf achievements on land, in the air, at sea and at the planning level in Canberra, and with our allies. The Federal Opposition salutes them and their families. They were all part of an outstanding national and international team effort. It is inappropriate to single out specific people; there were many exceptional efforts. However, if I could be forgiven for a little family bias, I want to pay particular tribute to my brother, Rear Admiral Rod Taylor, now the Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff but then the Assistant Chief of Operations in Defence Force Headquariers here in CanbelTa. His operational expertise and dedication during the Gulf crisis were recognised in his receiving the honour, as an officer, of the Order of Australia in last month's Australia Day List. Indeed, my family and friends are all very proud of his achievements. Notwithstanding these efforts, and despite what Defence Ministers may have said in the initial stages of this debate in May last year and since, it needs to be recognised that our naval effort, although modest, could not have been sustained had operations been escalated to a shooting war at sea and then prolonged without United States logistic support. Our land and air forces, had they been involved, would not have fared any better. That indeed is very pertinent to the debate before us. My first point is that despite ministerial grandstanding from both Senator Robert Ray and the honourable member for Kingston (Mr Bilney), the major defence force review findings announced on 30 May last year are driven primarily not by strategic considerations but by the continuing squeeze on he defence dollar. While a number of worthwhile initiatives in the review are worthy of bipartisan supportindeed the Opposition is providing such support-in the areas of civilianisation, base rationalisation, contracting out and a marked reduction in the logistic tale, the whole package smacks of glossy oversell and an underlying reduction in operational capability, as the honourable member for Casey (Mr Halverson) and the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) have both indicated. The Executive Director of the Australian Defence Association, Michael O'Connor, hit the nail on the head at that time in his description of the review, which he saw as a mixture of ordinary housekeeping, a shopping list based on nothing more than good intentions and a manpower restructuring based on vague hope. I suggest that developments since have reaffinned those views. We have seen one of the most prestigious joint standing committees of this Parliament table in November last year a most damning report into defence force reserves, which flies largely in the face of statements of the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) just six months earlier in the debate. We have seen the farcical, uncoordinated and ad hoc nature of our coastal surveillance effort being highlighted in Montague Sound in the north-west by the so-called Chinese boat people several months ago. We have seen media reports in recent weeks of the euphoria of the commissioning of the first Australian built FFG, HMAS Melbourne, only to read within days that the Navy would be placing one of its sister ships and a destroyer escort into some sort of care and maintenance status simply because the broader budgetary needs could not be met. The basic problems are these: the funding expectations created by the 1987 Defence White Paper have not been fulfilled; operational exercises have been cut back; operational capability has declined; training and exercise opportunities have been allowed to lUn down; personnel wastage rates have been high and costly, particularly amongst officers and at the command level and other specialist ranks; the reserve forces have been neglected shamefully and are in divided disarray; a morale problem amongst defence personnel exists; and, finally. some defence management practices remain outdated and highly inefficient. In a nutshell, there is a perception by many within and outside the defence machine that defence policy has lost direction. While we should not draw invalid lessons from the Gulf war, one thing is clear to me and to the Opposition: the strategy that underpins the 1987 Defence White Paper and its defence policy is questionable. particularly the concept of warning time as a key ingredient in defining defence preparedness and our national ability to respond quickly to other than a regional incident. Even in regional terms, our operational capabilities during the 1987 Fijian emergency highlight our serious operational limitations. The Government has done nothing to redress these since other than to persist with the line that the White Paper remains a valid cornerstone of its national security policy. In particular, our commitment to the Gulf war the started to focus public attention on some of the real limitations of our defence capabilities. In some quarters-this is a view I sharethere has been a basic question mark as to whether the 1987 White Paper was written so that it meant all things to all people. The result is an uneasy compromise between competing strategic and financial views. However, I would suggest that the White Paper now poses bigger problems for this Government. Although the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) will not bring themselves to admit it, many of the underlying strategic assumptions have been overtaken. More significantly, it has locked the Government into a multi-billion dollar capital equipment purchasing program despite its failure to live up to the Budget allocations which the White Paper identified. The consequences are that other areas of defence spending, particularly manpower and operating costs, have to be squeezed to pay for the equipment. This is a real reason for this force structure review. The Opposition rejects the comments of the Minister for Defence that its approach to defence policy making is both ad hoc and contradictory. Instead, for example, those opposite should be looking at their own Government's sorry record in its high priority aim of coastal surveillance and its head in the sand approach to the security strategy which underpins its outdated 1987 Defence White Paper. Defence Ministers need to bite the policy bullet on both. The Minister for Defence and the Minister for Foreign Affairs should accept that they need an early reassessment of national security strategy. Senator Ray's tablet of stone approach to the 1987 White Paper no longer holds water, as the increasing volatility of the international arena shows. The force structure review of last year is therefore poorly based and is a substantial figment of the Government's unfunded imagination. What the review lacks but requires for its own credibility is a number of things: it needs a clear assessment of the strategic realities facing Australia; it needs an analysis of the implications of these realities for Australia's national security situation; and, finally, it needs an outline of the restructuring of the Defence Force that flows from that changing strategic and security outlook. Clearly, the previous Prime Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and the Minister for Defence were poles apart in their public utterances on these points. The most recent boat people incursion, and its aftermath, cannot be restricted to criticism of the Australian Customs Service or Immigration authorities. Other Federal Government departments are involved, not the least of which is the Department of Defence. I agree with my colleague, the shadow Minister for defence science and personnel, Senator Newman, that the Government's so-called high priority for coastal surveillance as part of its defence strategy has failed, and failed very badly. Defence Minister Ray and Foreign Minister Evans should recognise that yet another penetration of our sovereignty has highlighted the abysmal lack of resource and coordination available to coastal surveillance authorities. As I said earlier, both Ministers need to bite the bullet and convince the latest Prime Minister (Mr Keating), who has said forcefully and publicly that he makes all the important policy decisions, that our national security strategy needs urgent revision. The Government cannot continue to sit back complacently and depend on the strategy that underpins the 1987 Defence White Paper. Demonstrably that tablet of stone ran aground in Western Australia's Montague Sound some weeks ago. Australia's surveillance requirements need to be given a higher priority within the defence umbrella. Improved patrol boats, the acquisition of airborne early warning aircraft to supplement the Jindalee over the horizon radar, and better command, control and communication links with civil agencies will be positive steps forward. Both the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) appear not prepared to alter the cosy, bureaucratic status quo in the defence machine. After the next general election, a Hewson government will not be accepting any departmental status quo-Defence includedwithout critical analysis. Indeed, Defence is in for an overdue shake-up. If that upsets some people on Russell Hill, including present Ministers, so be it. Their real concern, I have to say, appears to be the defence of the status quo rather than that of Australia. What the force structure review confirms is that the promises made in the 1987 White Paper cannot be met. What is required is a new White Paper which addresses all the elements of our defence policy in a sensible, coordinated way. That means addressing the strategic situation and force structure implications as well as the budgetary situation. The force structure review comes as a deep disappointment to all those who had hoped for a statement that would make defence planning more predictable and that would be more directly related to the changes in our regional and international security. In the event, it is an inadequate response to the critical situation in which our Defence Force finds itself. The Government strategy is neither credible nor affordable. On the other hand, the Opposition is approaching the issue of force structure in quite a different way from the Government. We will base our changes or additions to our defence force structure on the reassessment we are making of Australia's strategic circumstances and outlook. Wait for it: we will not be getting into the game of ad hockery or of endorsing or amending any of the aspects of the uncosted equipment shopping list which the Government has produced in this structure review. The results will be announced later this year at a time dictated by the Opposition, not by an increasingly jaded government. The 1991 review should be seen for what it is: a grandiose publicity document with little substance. I would like to make a brief concluding remark about one aspect of present and past Defence Ministers' performance. Regrettably, all have shown a lack of administrative ability and a poor perception of the role of people. I highlight just two examples of ill-judged ministerial decision making and administration: firstly, the scandalous situation imposed in large part by this Government, on compensation for HMAS Voyager survivors, about which I will have more to say in tomorrow's grievance debate; secondly, a most recent decision-if indeed a decision has yet been taken-on the question of homosexuality in the Australian Defence Force, a very sensitive issue, but something that I think we should be addressing. I refer the House to a couple of articles in yesterday's Courier-Mail. The one entitled 'Gay Diggers a worry for forces chiefs' stated: Gay Diggers are expected to be allowed into the anned forces within weeks under a new policy on sexual relations. An editorial in the same newspaper in part stated: It is much less a matter of prohibiting homosexual males from serving in the Australian Defence Force on health risk grounds, than one of unit discipline. It is that seed which genninates effective unit perfonnance. I would simply say to the Prime Minister, to both Defence Ministers, to the Chief of the Defence Force and the Service chiefs-of-staff that discipline, security and medical well-being are mutually exclusive to pressures to turn a blind eye to homosexual activities. It is a recipe for disaster in the Defence Force environment, as recent HlV positive group detection illustrated. I hope that all authorities from the Ministers down will reject categorically this thin end of an unnecessary wedge.",80
171,Mr RONALD EDWARDS,CENTURY,"I was surprised to hear the remarks of the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor). In the past, had those criteria been applied to the British Services they would have lost a substantial amount of their officer corps. That would certainly be so if homosexuality were a criterion. MI"" MCGauran-That is a slur against a close ally.",83
172,Mr RONALD EDWARDS,CENTURY,The honourable member may be excessively sensitive. He may have some personal reason to be sensitive. I do not. Mr MCGauran-Don't be stupid.,83
173,Mr RONALD EDWARDS,CENTURY,"Well, do not interject. You are outside the. Standing Orders. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs Sullivan)-Order! Mr MCGauran-This is typical of a man involved in WA Inc. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-Order! Order!",83
174,Mr RONALD EDWARDS,CENTURY,I ask the honourable member to withdraw his most recent remark. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-I think that the comment by the honourable member for Gippsland might have been taken as personally directed at the honourable member for Stirling.,84
175,Mr RONALD EDWARDS,CENTURY,"Yes, it was. He said it was typical of a member involved inMadam DEPUTY SPEAKER-It should be withdrawn. Mr MCGauran-Not only this honourable member but several others from Western Australia are involved in WA Inc. They have perverted good government in that State. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-Order! Sit down!  Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-Order! The honourable member for Chilley does not have the call. I have asked the honourable member for Gippsland to withdraw. Mr MCGauran-I do not regard my comments as being defamatory. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-I have asked you to withdraw. The honourable member for Gippsland should withdraw. Mr MCGauran-I will certainly withdraw if it offends the honourable member, but the public record speaks for itself. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-The Standing Orders allow the honourable member to request withdrawal; he has. Has the honourable member for Gippsland withdrawn? Mr MCGauran-Certainly.  Deputy Speaker. The honourable member has not withdrawn without qualification. He must withdraw.",84
176,Mr RONALD EDWARDS,CENTURY,"Madam Deputy Speaker, I ask that he withdraw without qualification. Mr MCGauran-But nothing the honourable member can say will change the public record. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-I would ask the honourable member for Gippsland to help the process of the House. Please withdraw without qualification. Mr MCGauran-I withdraw.",84
177,Mr RONALD EDWARDS,CENTURY,"Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. Mr MCGauran-When is the honourable member going to make a personal explanation?",84
178,Mr RONALD EDWARDS,CENTURY,"I need to make no personal explanation. I actually volunteered to appear before the royal commission, which no one else could do. I was there to support the good findings of the process and I make no further comment on that. The point I wanted to get across is that I am somewhat surprised at the view taken by the honourable member for Groom. If we look at some of the comments from Defence Force people in relation to the question of who will get into the Defence Force, we see that they are not opposed to that question. I find it unusual that the honourable member wants to impose that strict view. It is a matter of historical record that within the British armed forces there were people who made other social choices in terms of whom they cohabited with. Whether or not that interfered with the operation of the armed forces is another matter, but some people in the defence forces believe it would not. I find the honourable member's view surprising. The honourable member was correct in what he said about health concerns and coordination of the unit. But it does not require a torrent of interjections to overcome the point I am making, which is that in the past it was operationally effective. Some people may be able to produce evidence to show that it was not. Incidentally-and this may be beyond the honourable member for Gippsland-this was exactly the basis on which the Spartans based their armed forces. I realise that matter of history is beyond those who prefer the normal current of comment in this place, but that is exactly what the Spartans based their armed forces on. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-It might help the House if the honourable member for Stirlirig returned to the subject of the debate.",84
179,Mr RONALD EDWARDS,CENTURY,"This is within the matter of defence forces. Thank you, I will. There are other points I would like to make, Madam Deputy Speaker. Again, I find it surprising that the Opposition is speaking about Australia's strategic approach and the question of the compensation for the Voyager victims. We were not in government then. The Opposition parties were in government and they could have dealt with the matter then. Many people have told me of their circumstances and they were rejected at the time. The honourable member for Groom said that we have not really focused on Australia's defence needs. The Dibb report did that remarkably well and it made a very significant contribution to Australia's defence approach. It rejected this notion of forward defence and talked about defence for Australia. I believe that was a significant redefinition of what we are doing within the context of defence. I accept that the honourable member may want to engage in debate about the best method of procurement and the best way to allocate resources. We always ought to have that debate and this is the appropriate place to have it, but r cannot accept that this Government's defence approach is a bad one. The evidence supports that. When the Gulf conflict emerged r found it surprising that there was much comment from those opposite to the effect that we were incapable of responding. Australia's defence response was excellent. Members of the crew of HMAS Sydney, which docked at FremantIe last Thursday, assured me that they felt they were well equipped and well able to integrate their operation not only with that of the United States, in particular, but also with those of the British and the French. They felt that they really had vessels that, in terms of their capability, were well suited to that task. We really have to focus on these realities. The ongoing role that Australia's defence forces are performing in the Gulf is highly regarded. r take this opportunity to say that the Minister for Defence, Senator Robelt Ray, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley), members of the Opposition and r were present on the very significant occasions of welcoming back HMAS Sydney and farewelling HMAS Darwin. The people involved in the boarding operations do so with pride. They have performed 219 interceptions and boardings in the Gulf. Many people may not realise that the sanctions policy still applies. The honourable member for Greenway (Mr Gorman) would understand that this very significant exercise of boarding vessels and ensuring sanctions are not being broken is being performed by the Australian naval forces. The boarding crews commented that the ships' masters preferred the Australians to do the boarding because it was felt that they were better organised and more efficient. They certainly were very cooperative and courteous in the way they boarded ships with foreign flags. So the Australian defence forces are performing a very significant task in the Gulf. There is something I should say. I think my colleagues opposite would accept this. r was really alarmed to learn that the Australian defence forces cannot receive Radio Australia during Gulf deployment. We know the position taken by Radio Australia at the time of the Gulf War, which r think was unacceptable. Families in Australia could not use Radio Australia to broadcast messages to members of their family deployed in the Gulf. r thought Radio Australia's initial attitude was an extremely short-sighted one. It did, however, respond in the end. r am also alarmed that Radio Australia cannot be received by the defence forces in the Gulf on a regular basis. Quite frankly, the members of the crew were all news hungry. They wanted to know what had been happening in Australia, they wanted to know something about Australian sports results, they wanted news and so on. This really highlights the inadequacy of Radio Australia. If I can be honest, I think it comes back to the Government to consider whether it is going to further resource Radio Australia to improve the quality of the transmitters and to ensure that Radio Australia provides an effective service for people overseas. I was particularly alarmed-and I say this to the honourable member for Groom-to find out that apparently expatriates have a very low priority in Radio Australia's allocation. Frankly, that is appalling, because after all Australians are the ones who pay the taxes for Radio Australia. Radio Australia costs approximately $13m annually. It takes many of its feed broadcasts from the ABC and from pooled resources. For Radio Australia to mount a bigger operation, particularly for our defence forces, would be a remarkably good service. The Americans and the British can expect radio broadcasts when they are deployed overseas; our service personnel should also be able to. Again, I find it appalling expatriate Australians are given third priority in the list after Radio Australia has served other purposes. I find that unacceptable, particularly for defence forces which rely a great deal upon communication. The commanders of those ships did say to me that one of their priorities was to ensure that they gave as much information as they could to their personnel. But Radio Australia could do that relatively easily without a great increase in cost. It is something that we as a Parliament should he pushing to do. We should certainly be pushing to change this absurd rule that expatriates remain Iowan the list of priorities for service. I do not think Australian defence personnel should be treated as third class citizens in terms of communications in this respect. It is an issue I will continue to press. The honourable member for Groom mentioned the question of coastal surveillance, which I want to take up because it is very close to us in Western Australia. Clearly, in relation to coastal surveillance Australia is in an enormous predicament. First there is the large area required to be patrolled and there are the difficulties in terms of actually mounting effective surveillance. In my view, many effective operations are performed in the region, particularly the north-west of Western Australia, but I would be foolish to accept that the situation was ideal. It is not, and I believe that an increase in resources is required. We are not talking about mounting a defence capability in terms of a war on a day by day basis. Obviously, we always have to have that as a contingency, but we are talking about being able simply to secure the Australian mainland in the event of quarantine and immigration incursions in particular. In my view we are better placed than we were in the past, but I still do not think that, given the changes in our region, we can accept or expect that we can simply under-resource the issue. I believe that it needs an increase in resources. It is certainly an issue in Western Australia, but I believe it is a wider issue than that. I am happy to see that the Minister for that Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) has at least understood that we ought not to be taking a long time in terms of processing these so-called refugees, because the Australian taxpayer should not be hoodwinked while lawyers simply try to milk the system for the benefit of people whose refugee status can be determined relatively promptly. We in Western Australia are very pleased that the six Collins class submarines are going to be deployed in that State, where there has been a lot of debate in the past about a twoocean naval policy. There has to be. I think such a policy is appropriate. In light of the Australian mainland mass we need to have a two-ocean policy. The submarine deployment reflects that need. I wish also to make an optimistic comment. I have been speaking quite recently to a gentleman who was involved in Norforce. He was in the SAS. His name is Reg Davies, and he is a member of the upper House in Western Australia. He was telling me with great satisfaction about the work that he did in developing Aboriginal recruits into Norforce in Western Australia. That sort of exercise is to be commended because it proved to be very effective, certainly in terms of the difficulties that some of those communities experienced. It was able to give them focus and pride in their work, and I believe that we ought to recognise the worthwhile work that is being done. There are a couple of other observations I wish to make. The other major thing we ought to observe is that the world in which the honourable member for Groom learned to operate as a serviceman has changed dramatically: that is, the notion of a Cold War with two over-arching superpowers, where one could predict within limits the outcome of certain conflicts. The Gulf war showed that, if an authoritarian figure such as Saddam Hussein is prepared to stop at nothing to achieve his ends, in the end we have to rejig the world so it can come to terms with coping with that eventuality. In that case we had to get the United Nations to move before we could get world cooperation. That situation will not disappear. We cannot assume in the future that it is a question of getting on the hotline telephone from Washington to Moscow, or Moscow to Washington, and resolving a problem. That will not happen in the future. What we have to understand is that we now need a new circumstance for dealing with those conflicts and eventualities, and I believe that is important. Another point we all ought to be aware of-it is one that worries me, and we have raised it with officials in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation-is the question of an arms bazaar that is resulting from the breakdown of the former Soviet Union, now called the Commonwealth of Independent States, where clearly all the member states are strapped for money. Their economies are in a mess because of the mismanagement of the previous administration. It is with great concern that one must wonder whal will happen, first of all, to the dispersal of convening tional weaponry, particularly if it was 10 find its way to the Middk East and, secondly, what will happen with (he nuclear sdentistsabout 100,000 of them-who have been employed in previously Soviet projects related to the nuclear program. What will happen in terms of their deployment? If they were to find themselves working for people such as Saddam Hussein or Gadaffi, I believe the world would be at some risk. I make those two final comments because I believe they are somewhat sobering. The question of our preparedness for defence in the twenty-first century is an issue we have to be thoughtful about. We have to be able to adapt to circumstances. This is an area in which I believe this paper and the Government are prepared to adapt.",85
180,Mr REID,CENTURY,"It is a privilege to have the opportunity to participate in this debate on what I believe is one of the most important issues to face this House, and that is the defence capability of this nation both now and in the future. I believe that we had the opportunity last year of recognising how important it is to Australia and Australia's defence. Our involvement in the Middle East crisis exposed to me and to the Parliament just how vulnerable Australia may be in the event of any activities of aggression close to our northern boundaries. I believe that Australia is not as well equipped in the defence area as it could be. I take some pride in recognising that the capability of Australia in producing defence components is a very large factor in my electorate, and that is Australian Defence Industries, which is located in Bendigo and which was recently awarded a major contract of $17m for gun components which will take the work at the Bendigo facility of Australian Defence Industries into the twenty-first century. That contract provides for nine ammunition loaders and fuse setters for the ANZAC frigates, to be huilt between 1994 and 2003. The equipment ill automatically feed ammunition from the below deck magazines to the frigates' 127 millimetre deck m01mted guns. Australian Defence Industries in Bendigo is looking forward to being successful in obtainfurther contracts under that ANZAC frigate contract. It is quite clear to me that the 'luaIity of workmanship at Australian Defence industries is of the highest class not only in Australia but on an international level. In this particular contract it was able to compete on quality, efficiency and price, and Australian Defence Industries was playing a major role in equipping Australia for a solid, reliable and trustworthy defence capability within Australia. I note that the Parliamentary Secretary to  He had the opportunity of representing the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) recently at Australian Defence Industries in Bendigo. I am pleased that he was able to come to see that magnificent facility because the quality of defence work that is carried out there is second to none in Australia. That particular area of defence work has been carried out at that plant for many years, and it is making Australia more self-sufficient in the area of defence, whilst at the same time providing opportunities for the many employees at that plant-480 in fact-to develop their skills in the defence area to a very high level. Just recently Australian Defence Industries has embarked on an upgrading of equipment and has moved into the twenty-first century with equipment which is used in the production of components for defence vessels. That equipment can also be used for other major boat building contracts. ADI is able to tender for private work as well as defence work and, of course, the defence work gives it a very sound capability. It has built up a highly skilled work force and its capabilities in the defence area are excellent. Another matter that I would like to touch on in relation to Australian Defence Industries is that it has been willing to open its plant to the public. I believe it is important that the public understands what Australian Defence Industries is trying to achieve in upgrading Australia's defence capability. Sometimes when people do not have the opportunity to visit a plant of that nature, all sorts of fears and misrepresentations may come into the debate about that plant. I am sure that when people visit and see the type of work that is being carried out there and are able to assess from their own view just what is being achieved to improve Australia's defence capability, they will get a great deal of assurance that Australia needs that defence capability and needs to keep it at the ready. Another example I would like to give to the House about moving into the twenty-first century and the future of defence relates to the Australian headquarters of the Army Survey Regiment, which is also established in Bendigo. It is a very self-sufficient group. In fact, it is responsible for the production of maps and charts for the defence forces. Many of those maps are produced by the Army Survey Regiment based at Fortuna Village, which was previously owned by George Lansell, who was known as the quartz king in Bendigo. The regiment is housed in a magnificent old home which dates back to the 1800s and is built on top of many gold mines. Lansell built his home alongside the gold mines and the stamping mills so that he could hear the mills going in the middle of the night and know that more gold was being stamped out. It has a wonderful history. I am delighted that the Army Survey Regiment is expanding its presence in Bendigo at that site. It has taken great care of this building. It is quite amazing to go into the Army Survey Regiment headquarters to see the new technology-and it is new technology, high technology-that is being used. The systems and computer technology is at the forefront of world trends. The regiment is at the leading edge of world technology in cartographic drafting and is the most productive cartographic centre in Australia. It cooperates with many countries. In fact, it cooperates with all of our allies, including the United Kingdom, the USA and other countries with which we have an alliance. As I say, the regiment is at the leading edge of technology. It produces some very high class work. It has some of the most modem equipment and is currently upgrading that equipment so that it can continue that most important role in the Defence Force, which is one of providing information systems and making maps and charts for all of the armed services. Not only does it provide the maps and charts to the armed services, it also has quite an extensive range of productions which can be made available to other agencies in both the public and private sectors throughout Australia. There is a great interchange of technology which has been developed by the Anny Survey Regiment. The regiment will soon celebrate its fiftieth anniversary of relocating to Bendigo and will be granted the freedom of the city of Bendigo. I will be present at that ceremony and I look forward to it. Such ceremonies are always very spectacular. Most of these people, whilst they are very highly skilled technicians, take the other aspects of their Army and military training very seriously indeed and always put on a tremendous display at special events. The Anny Survey Regiment has moved into technology which has been developed in joint programs, particularly with the USA, which has taken some huge leaps in technological advancement in the past few years. The regiment is cooperating with the United States and the UK authorities in perfecting all that technology so that it can be advanced for mutual benefit. I think the whole of the Defence Force and the defence Reserve units have a great desire to reach a very high level of professionalism. Recently I saw this professionalism in action when I visited 15 Transport Squadron, which is located is Bendigo. I went to the advanced driving facility at Monegeetta, not far out of Melbourne, and saw the squadron in action in the high level of training given to the transport operators. I had the opportunity of joining with other local civic leaders on this open day at Monegeetta to see the dedication of the Reserve forces and the type of training that those people were prepared to undergo. Many of them do this as a purely voluntary service to the community and to their country. I and, I am sure, my coalition colleagues with whom I have had discussions have received letters from members of the Anny Reserve units saying that they want to continue to train but they have run out of the man-days and training days that have normally been allocated. Many of the reservists continue with their training for free because they are so dedicated to lifting the standards of their service and their desire for professionalism in the Anny Reserve units. I can testify to that, having seen the members of this transport squadron in action and the quality of the training that they receive. To say the least, it was very impressive. The recently formed Ready Reserve, whilst a noble idea in theory, still neglects the real needs to take Australia's defence capabilities into the twenty-first century. Until the recent force structure review, our Army could muster six regular infantry battalions and 15 reserve infantry battalions. Most of these units are under strength. The reserve battalions are badly equipped and at the moment are not receiving sufficient training. In addition, the six regular battalions will be reduced to four, by converting two of them to reserve units manned by the new Ready Reserve. I do not believe that this is adequate for Australia's defence purposes. That means that since 1972 Australia's first line of defence, the regular battalions, has been more than halved from nine to four. One major problem with the Ready Reserve concept is that of overseas deployment. Individual reservists can volunteer for overseas duty, but if the Ready Reserve is to be deployed as one unit, how can the Government guarantee that the whole unit will volunteer? What use are the reserve units if the funding for training is inadequate or reduced? Training does not only relate to combat areas. As I mentioned earlier, I was very privileged to join members of the Bendigo based 15 Transport Squadron on their driving course and to see the skills that have been attained by those reservists who keep the Army on the move. Of course, it was once said that an army marches on its feet. Now it has some very modem moving vehicles and equipment and it can transport Defence Force personnel very rapidly. I do not think there is too much marching in wartime conditions. Finally, I am concerned about the future of Australia's defence forces. If the current Government trend of cutbacks continues, the future of defence in the twenty-first century will be very bleak indeed for Australia.  tary to the Minister for Defence)(5.50 p.m.)I would like to endorse some of the remarks the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) made about the fiftieth anniversary of the Australian Defence Industries factory at Bendigo. I think it is a tribute to the working men and women of the factory that we had that display. They have certainly gone through a process of dramatic change. Not only are they serving the Defence Force and meeting its needs, but they are also undertaking quite a wide variety of commercial work and they are winning work both in defence and commercially against stiff competition. I agree with the honourable member's comments about the value of opening establishments such as ADI Bendigo. I report to the House the high esteem in which I believe the people of Bendigo hold the factory. As I did in Bendigo, I wish to record the nation's appreciation of the service of all those who have worked at the factory in that period of 50 years. The ADI factory has undergone some quite dramatic changes. I certainly wish them well in the future. It has been disappointing listening to some of the Opposition members. Certainly, my colleague from Bendigo was seeking a bipartisan approach; I wish we could take a bipartisan approach to defence. But I do take exception when Opposition members stand up and say that their policy contained in the Fightback package is to spend more on defence, when the reality is that they will be making a cutback. The Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) has estimated that the effect of their policies would not be the reduction we are having in the force structure review, but that an additional 15,000 uniformed people would be cut from the Defence Force. I think it is really sad that in its Fightback package the Opposition not only wants to hit the serving men and women of the defence forces with a 15 per cent GST, but also wants to get rid of 15,000 of them. It is true to say that the Labor Government has really undertaken the hard work in defence by tackling issues. If one talks to officers they will say that this is a period of challenging change which they are accepting and meeting headon. In terms of tackling the difficult issues, I give no better example than what we had to do with the Office of Defence Production. It was grossly inefficient; it was not commercial or competitive. We had to corporatise it. We had to go through a lot of pain in terms of structural changes, but the benefits are starting to come through. More than 6,000 people are employed in ADI and Aerospace Technologies of Australia, the other government corporation. I believe that they have managed the change very well. We have only to look at the contract that was won recently for components of major gun systems to be installed on the ANZAC frigates. In budgetary terms, the change has been more dramatic. We have, in effect, saved the defence budget something like $1.3 billion because of the improvements we have made by corporatising ADI, for example. Having been given some responsibility for these two organisations, I can say that the ambition I share with the Minister is the need to secure their growth and long term future. Industry policy and capital equipment is another area of stark contrast between Opposition rhetoric and performance and what the Government has had to do. What did the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor) say? He said that we had an incredible shopping list of military hardware. Let us see what has happened. We have made an enormous commitment to the Australian Defence Force and its capability by doubling the acquisitions budget. Not only have we done that, but also we have done it within a framework of encouraging Australian industry participation. What has been the effect of that? We have lifted Australian industry participation from 40 per cent to nearly 70 per cent in that major capital acquisitions program. That is an outstanding contribution. We have done this for Australian industry by providing preference for local content. We have specified the scope for contracts on specified work; for strategic reasons, we have had to engage Australian industry to supply these goods; and we have used defence offsets. I believe we also have a good record in the area of exports. We are encouraging the export of Australian military products wherever possible. We are starting off from a very low base. Last year it was something like $160m. I believe that we will be able to do more. r have visited the Defence Science and Technology Organisation in Salisbury and I am impressed with the quality of the work done there. The people are certainly responding to the changes and taking a more commercial approach. I think we need to facilitate this work. I think the Defence Science and Technology Organisation is a national asset. It is an asset for the defence forces and they will always be its prime customer. But the organisation's research and development, as it is developed, can lead to assistance for Australian industry; in fact, it can also commercialise the defence research. I, for one, would like to see the Defence Science and Technology Organisation undertake more commercial work. But that matter is being addressed by my colleague the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney), who is overseas at the moment. I am sure we will see some changes in the future. The Opposition mentioned coastal surveillance in a defence context and the recent incursion on the north-west coast of Western Australia. I think it is to be regretted that the honourable member for Groom, a former serving officer, raised that matter. Firstly, as he would know, the Department of Defence is not responsible for coastal surveillance; that is a matter which falls within the jurisdiction of my colleague the Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs (Mr Beddall). Secondly, it occurred in an area which has absolutely no strategic military value at all. Thirdly, looking at the small number of people who made that incursion, and given the difficulty of the terrain and the desperate plight they were in when we were able to find some, but not all, of them, what is the military significance? I rather regret the Opposition trying to muddy the water by suggesting that the defence forces somehow displayed some sort of lapse. That is not the case; the defence forces were not responsible for that.",87
181,Mr REID,CENTURY,"It demonstrates how vulnerable we are.  ble with such a coastline. The force structure review is all about what the honourable member is criticising us for: making sure that we are far more capable in the north. We are doing it-that is something those opposite would not do. We are getting away from our east coast obsession. But when we do it, those opposite do not agree with us; they are criticising our approach. I am not suggesting for one moment that the force structure review will pick up incursion such as that. The point I am trying to make is that the defence forces and the Defence Department are not responsible, and never were responsible, for coastal surveillance; and, in any event, that incursion by a small number of people was, in strategic terms, of no value whatsoever and the terrain was completely inhospitable. I want to finish on this note. I am surprised that any member of the coalition has the gall to get up and question this Government's approach to the HMAS Voyager disaster, given the coalition's record of two failed royal commissions and the sad deathbed testimony of Sir David Martin. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. Leave granted; debate adjourned.",91
182,Unknown,CENTURY,Sitting suspended from 6 to 7.30 p.m. MINISTERIAL· STATEMENT One Nation,91
183,Mr KEATING,CENTURY," When I became Prime Minister a little over two months ago I pledged to fight the battle against unemployment and for economic recovery with all the energy I could muster. Tonight we tum those words into action. Tonight the Government presents a Statement to get Australia moving - a four year strategy for growth in the nineties. Mr Speaker, for a Government which took pride in creating 1.6 million jobs in the '80s this recession has been a bitter blow. Far worse, I know, has been the blow to a great many Australians. In 1992 we need recovery and we need jobs. In the past 70 days my colleagues and I travelled around Australia, meeting business people, union leaders, State Governments and community organisations. We received hundreds of messages from concerned Australians offering ideas and suggestions. We listened. We tested our ideas with people trying to succeed in tough times. We reflected on our successes and failures, and drew some lessons from them. We worked through the proposals and put them to three tests. We decided that whatever we did should speed recovery. Whatever we did should set us up for long term prosperity. And whatever we did should be most helpful to those in need. Tonight I announce measures which meet these requirements. A Four-year Plan Labor's plan for the next four years will create over 800 000 jobs, without increasing the current account deficit and at the same time return the budget to surplus and Australia to growth. Low inflation growth. We have a $2.3 billion plan for Australia. Tonight's Statement contains great initiatives. I believe, historic initiatives. Measures big enough to kickstart the economy and get things going. Big enough to get people back to work. And big enough to stir the imagination. But our program will do more than speed our recovery from recession - it will build Australia of the future. It will help our young people now; and it will still be helping them when they raise their own children. Building on our advantages and the great gains we made in the '80s. it will make us much stronger. A Stronger Australia This Statement is very much about making this nation strong. H is about government and private enterprise working in partnership. About cooperation to achieve worthwhile change, instead of barren confrontation. It's about Australians, realising that their destiny is in their own hands, combining their strengths to make the nation strong. A nation, like all successful nations, where employers and workers pool their creativity and energy to transform workplaces. A nation in which our rail, road, sea and air services serve us better and bind us together as a federation - as one nation. A civilised country where we take care of those in need. Where we invest in our children. This is the nation I have always thought we should be. It's the nation I think we can be. That is why I want to keep up the pace of change. I want Australia to be fiercely competitive in the world - so that we can deliver opportunity and care at home. I want us to be strong within, so we can be strong in the world - a world which too often does not compete fairly. This is the Australia we worked towards in the '80s: when the Accord transformed our industrial relations; when the number of strikes fell by 60 per cent; when investment and employment grew; and when we opened the country up to more competition. Getting Things Moving We will get things moving by giving an immediate boost to spending with a one-off payment worth over $300 million to the Australian families with children: by bold reforms to provide incentives to private investment; and by undertaking major capital works programs of permanent benefit to the nation. Most of these initiatives will have an impact now. boosting demand and, in tum, boosting jobs. They will reinforce the stimulus coming from lower interest rates and bring forward economic recovery. Mr Speaker, spending will be sensible and responsible. The economy needs a spur, and the soundness of the budget allows us to provide it. But as recovery proceeds and the private sector regains its spark, we will wind back the spending in the budget, returning it to surplus by 1995-96. The scale of work over the next few years will be massive. While private investment is low we will take the opportunity to build railways, roads, ports, electricity grids, air terminals, waste management plants, colleges, schools - in all, more than a billion dollars of new construction over the next two years. The Big Projects Mr Speaker, for much of our history Australia has been disadvantaged by the great distances which separate us from each other and the world. Our major population centres were - and remain - hundreds of kilometres apart. Our lines of supply were long: the costs of transport high. Mr Speaker, tonight I announce a series of historic undertakings to help overcome those distances, to improve our links Australia-wide and our interaction with the world. To make us more truly one place. One very much more efficient nation. Building a Rail Highway and Competitive Ports We will do what should have been done a hundred years ago - we will create a standard gauge national rail highway from Brisbane to Perth via Melbourne and Adelaide. We shall do it in a way that ensures the project is underpinned by work practices which make such an investment viable. The Brisbane-Sydney-Melbourne railway line will be modernised and upgraded for faster and more reliable transit, and a new standard gauge will be laid between Melbourne and Adelaide, tying the east coast network via Melbourne to Perth. A standard gauge spur will be built at the port of Brisbane, linking it to the Acacia Ridge rail terminus. A dedicated freight line will be built out of Enfield in Sydney to give freight trains clear access to the southern line. A new rail-sea-road terminus connecting with the port will be constructed at Dynon in Melbourne. Rail facilities at the ports of Fremantle flnd Adelaide will be upgraded. Together with the other main line rail investments, this will expand opportunities for moving freight across Australia and generally improve the efficiency of our freight transport. Exporters will see at last the ports of Sydney and Melbourne competing for business with the ports of Brisbane, Adelaide and Fremantle. The rail highway will also provide essential competition with road transport. At the same time it will significantly reduce damage to roads, and make them very much safer. A Better and Safer Road Network We will be spending over $600 million extra on roads between now and the end of 1993-94. We will accelerate construction of city ring roads in Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney to link national highways, and we will improve other roads to create a more efficient network throughout Australia. We are offering to develop the Sturt and Newell highways to create first class direct links between Adelaide and Brisbane and Melbourne and Brisbane. Aviation Revolutionised Mr Speaker, for too long Australians were priced out of air travel by the two-airline agreement. Two years ago this Government opened our skies to competition and, especially after Compass entered the market, air travel became affordable to most Australians. The enthusiasm was enormous. It boosted business and tourism. But we have taken only the first step. With tonight's Statement a new Australasian air transport policy is unveiled. It brings cheaper and more efficient air services within Australia and abroad. It binds Australia and New Zealand in a truly competitive environment. Qantas will at last carry domestic passengers, and our established domestic airlines will fly international routes. The Government expects that Australian and Ansett Airlines will be operating across the Tasman by 1993 at the latest. To help new competitors into the airline industry we will build new common-user air terminals. We will also speed the expansion of the international airports in Melbourne and Brisbane. Our great changes to the national transport system will make our continent smaller and our nation greater. They are a one billion dollar investment in the future. Mr Speaker, we will start other projects to make better use of our resources and integrate our States and cities. Generating Power We have a great capacity to produce electricity - but it is not as cheap as it be. I will seek the co-operation of the State Premiers to develop a National Grid Corporation to connect users and producers from Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia and Tasmania. To facilitate this my Government is offering $100 million to upgrade the transmission link between New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. With the States' agreement, we will take the crucial step of separating power generation from distribution. Power generating authorities will have to compete, which will improve service and efficiency, and deliver energy to homes and industry more cheaply than most other countries in the world. Other Public Works Mr Speaker, among other major public works to be undertaken, in Victoria a high quality rail service will be built from Melbourne to Geelong. In Queensland a rail service will be built to connect Brisbane to Robina on the Gold Coast, providing transport to one of the fastest-growing communities in Australia. In Adelaide we will get the Multifunction Polis going by paying for and carrying out the early stages of work. And in Perth a sewage treatment plant will be built, using Australian-developed, worldbest processes - for the benefit of the people and the environment - and as a sign that Australian technology can solve problems here and overseas. Mr Speaker, immediately, these great public works will help re-start the economy. They will create jobs now, and by the assistance they give to industry, they will still be creating them into the future. Changing the Tax Rules to Boost Investment As our industries change, as workplaces are should transformed, we will replace old machines with new machines, old factories with new ones. Our discussions with business leaders have led us to change the taxation provisions in ways which will make investment in Australian industry more attractive - particularly the kind of big and durable investments we need. From tomorrow the cost of new capital equipment can be fully claimed against tax long before its economic life is over by accelerating rates of depreciation. The new rates are particularly generous to long life investment. For example, from tomorrow, plant and equipment which lasts twenty years can be effectively claimed over seven and half years. These new schedules mean that from now on Australian tax rules for investment will be more than competitive with comparable countries. Mr Speaker, we will make other big changes to tax rules for business. Private Provision of Public Infrastructure In a landmark reform to greatly improve public infrastructure and take the load off the State governments and local councils, we will use special tax preferred bonds to encourage private companies to build roads, ports and electricity generating plants. Equity Development Funds for Small and Medium Businesses We will also change the tax system to channel new money into successful and promising smaller businesses which today are unable to attract equity capital. either on the stock exchange or privately. To further assist small business we are increasing from 20 per cent to 50 per cent the amount of goodwill exempt from capital gains tax on the sale of a business. And more businesses will qualify for this exemption. Getting Large Projects Started and Getting Them Finished We are going to simplify the environment and heritage reviews which are often involved in big projects by building on the historic environment agreement we have finalised with the States this week. It will lead to a single environment process for Australia. With the introduction of a 10 per cent development allowance we will reward big projects which complete the review procedures quickly, which are world competitive and completed within a reasonable time. Tourism Mr Speaker, we will change the rules to encourage the tourism industry, one of the great success stories of the 1980s and one of the economic stars of the 1990s. In the next decade the number of tourists coming to Australia will increase from 2.4 million to 6.5 million. That means 200 000 new jobs for Australians. To meet the demand for accommodation we have made the write-off provisions on touristrelated buildings much more favourable for investment. We will nearly double it. We will also increase financial assistance to the Australian Tourist Commission to promote Australia abroad. Motor Vehicles Mr Speaker, the recession has had a severe effect on motor vehicle sales. From tomorrow the sales tax on new cars currently subject to the 20 per cent rate will be permanently lowered to 15 per cent - a saving on a new Commodore or Falcon of around $800. With cheaper cars we will drive newer cars, which is good for the environment, good for road safety, and good for one of our most important industries. Banking Mr Speaker, we are moving to prevent unnecessary foreclosure by banks of viable businesses unable to meet debts. Banks will be able to claim tax deductions for partial debt write-offs and also for losses on debt for equity swaps, allowing firms in difficulty to trade their way out of trouble. Developing Ideas Mr Speaker, too few of our research successes are exploited commercially by Australia for Australia. To help overcome the impediment, we will create an Australian Technology Group, to bid for the rights to publicly funded research projects and sell them on to business. The ATG will make the link between good research ideas and good business. This will be in addition to the 125 per cent deduction for the costs of research and development which is now a permanent feature of our tax system. Exporting Mr Speaker; all of these initiatives will help build a productive base for Australian exports. The potential increase in our exports by 1994 is $20 billion. Of this the potential increase to Asia is $13 billion. Among the measures we will take to seize this opportunity, the Government will extend Austrade's network throughout the world, and particularly to Asia. The Workplace Mr Speaker, a nation cannot be strong if at the very point where wealth is made - the workplace - people are locked in conflict. Modern industry has to be a co-operative process. That is a truth we tapped when we began the task of changing our industrial culture, from one in which employers and workers were always at each other's throats, to one in which they talk about how to do things better. We will continue this change and move quickly towards a bargaining system in which higher, wages will come from increased efficiency. Employers and workers will be free to change workplaces in whatever way is most efficient, and to register their settlements as binding agreements with the Industrial Relations Commission. But basic standards must be met. We will not support slashing minimum wages and conditions. Our reforms to industrial relations have been the most constructive step this country has taken since the war. To stop now, as our opponents are hell bent on doing, would be the most destructive step we could take. Low Inflation Mr Speaker, just now our inflation rate is the second lowest in the world. We must keep it low. Inflation puts up interest rates, it encourages speculation rather than production, it erodes the value of savings. It is a totally corrupting influence on the fabric of society. The bed-rock of the great post-war economies has been low inflation. It must be ours too. Labor will never surrender the inflation fight. Mr Speaker, last week I sought and received an assurance from the ACro that wage claims will enable us to maintain an inflation rate comparable to that of our trading partners. Personal Tax Reform To create the climate of trust and fairness necessary to preserve wage outcomes the nation can afford, and with them low inflation, the Government will lower the tax rates over the next four years. When these tax reforms are complete more than three-quarters of Australian taxpayers will pay no more than 30 per cent on their last dollar of income. A 30 per cent tax rate under Labor, no inflationary consumption tax, no 15 per cent string attached. Mr Speaker, it is almost inconceivable that anyone would contemplate deliberately putting inflation back into the economy. But the Leader of the Opposition contemplates it. It's his big idea. With a 15 per cent consumption tax and without a wage agreement, even on the admission of one of his own economic consultants, we are back into built-in, doubledigit inflation. And, Mr Speaker, not only that, of course, we would be back into rising interest rates. Mr Speaker, it is truly astounding. Sparking the Recovery I said one of the objects of this Statement was to give the economy the spark it needs by getting spending going again. We want to bring forward the recovery without creating an on-going cost to the budget. With this in mind, we have decided to boost spending by helping Australians who urgently need to spend - families with children, including the unemployed. Tonight I will ask Parliament to approve a one-off, special payment on 2 April to every family which qualifies for the Family Allowance. The payment will be $125 for a family with one child, rising to $250 for a family with five or more children. Mr Speaker, as part of the measure, the Family Allowance Supplement for low income families will be permanently increased by $3 per child at a cost of $240 million in 1992-93. Helping the Hardest Hit We also intend to give special assistance to a number of other groups who have been hard hit by the recession. We will be increasing the funding for the emergency relief agencies such as the Salvation Army and St Vincent de Paul who shoulder much of the burden of helping the poor and the homeless. Farmers Mr Speaker, Australian farmers are amongst the most efficient in the world. For most of the life of this nation they have provided the economic backbone. They have also borne much of the hardship which uncertain markets and an uncertain climate have inflicted. There are two major areas of rural production which have recently gone through difficult times; wool is one, wheat is the other. We should nurture these great industries and help farmers during the recovery phase. We will allow the Wool Realisation Commission to make cash payments to wool growers in the event that proceeds from the stockpile are surplus to debt repayment requirements. We will also provide a one-off addition to the Rural Adjustment Scheme to help wheat and other broad acre growers plant their crops to take advantage of recent rains. Textile, Clothing and Footwear We are determined to become more competitive, but this will not blind us to the human cost of industrial change. We will spend more on helping the textile, clothing and footwear industries to adjust; and we will assist further adjustments by creating opportunities for downstream processing of our wool clip, including the development of new wool-tops production. Furthering Education Mr Speaker, in the 1980s the Labor Government made two dramatic changes to education in Australia. We increased secondary school retention rates and we expanded universities. In 1983 less than four out of 10 young Australians completed 12 years of schooling. Today that figure has doubled. In 1992 around 500 000 Australians are participating in higher education, an increase of over 120 000 students since 1987 - the equivalent of 12 new universities. There has been a revolution both in the way we think about education and in the way we conduct it. We are giving more people more chances. We are becoming better equipped to meet the challenges. But we cannot be a clever country if we lack the skills and know-how to innovate and deal with problems in the workplace - if we cannot implement our own ideas. From tonight technical or vocational training, the weak reed in Australian education, will become a strand of equal strength. We will va<;t1y expand vocational education, so that we will become not just a clever country, but a capable one. In conjunction with the States we are offering to build an expanded technical education system where the Commonwealth will fund the whole program. With State government agreement and Commonwealth money - an extra $720 million over the next three years - we can create thousands more places and give school leavers a chance they would not have had while lifting the quality and status of vocational education. Training and Support Mr Speaker, we will also provide training and support to prepare the young, including the young unemployed, for entry to the work force. By raising employer incentives, we will create an extra 9 000 first-year apprenticeship places in 1992; an extra 10000 places in the Australian Traineeship System, and 7 000 apprentices presently at risk of retrenchment will be retained. We will redirect funds to the needs of the long-term unemployed. The Government will provide an extra $100 million to JOBSTART, creating another 44 000 job opportunities. We will also provide funding to create jobs in regional Australia, and expand the JOBSKILLS program and other programs of assistance. Conclusion As I said at the outset, we have a plan for Australia - a big plan. With our strategy, within four years the Federal Budget will retuni '.to surplus, and we will have created another 800 000 jobs, clipping 3 percentage points off unemployment. We will have made up our loss in economic growth five times over, and will have done it while keeping inflation low. Within four years Australians will be working in one of the best-designed tax systems in the world, and most will be paying a maximum taxation rate of 30 per cent without Dr Hewson's consumption tax. Mr Speaker, I spoke earlier about the great distances which have for so long separated Australians - geographical distances, social distances. The measures I have announced tonight will help to close the gaps. In transport and communications, in workplace reform, in encouraging investment in industries Australia needs, in expanding technical education and in providing help to people in need, we are closing the gaps. Labor believes that the community and the economy must advance together: that all our efforts should go towards uniting the country, not dividing it. The most successful societies are notable for their unity, for the cooperative quality of all their relationships, from the workplace up. That is the kind of Australia we seek, and which I firmly believe we can have. An Australia which is more truly one nation. Mr Speaker, we can come out of this recession stronger than we've ever been. With low inflation, with strong manufacturing as well as our traditional rural and mining industries, with a new spirit of cooperation, new skills and a new culture of investment and productivity. We are now living amongst the fastestgrowing economies in the world. For the first time in our history we are close to our major markets - the chance is there as it has never been before. We have the essentials for a strong recovery. The measures I have announced tonight will harness them. They will harness Australia's talents and energy. They will make us stronger. They will give us back our sense of purpose and our confidence. Confidence in ourselves - and in Australia. Mr Speaker, I present a copy of my speech and the statement titled One Nation. I move: That the House take note of the papers. Motion (by Mr Beazley) - by leave agreed to: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the Opposition speaking for a period not exceeding 27 minutes when the debate is resumed at 7.30 p.m., on Thursday, 27 February 1992. Debate (on motion by Dr Hewson) adjourned. APPROPRIATION BILL (No.3) 1991-92 First Reading Message from the Governor General transmitting particulars of proposed expenditure and recommending appropriation announced. Bill presented by Mr Willis, and read a first time. Second Reading",91
184,Mr WILLIS,CENTURY,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. Appropriation Bill (No.3) 1991-92, together with Appropriation Bill (No.4) and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No.2), which I shall introduce shortly, comprise the Additional Estimates for 199192. In these Bills, Parliament is asked to appropriate moneys to meet essential and unavoidable expenditures additional to the appropriations made for 1991-92 under Appropriation Acts (Nos 1 and 2) and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Act and to fund in this financial year important initiatives announced in the Prime Minister's recent economic statement. Of the additional appropriations in the Additional Estimates Bills totalling $1,116.5m, $S34.2m is sought in Appropriation Bill (No.3), $277.1m in Appropriation Bill (No.4) and $5.3m in the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No.2). These amounts are offset, in part, by savings in the appropriations made by Appropriation Acts (Nos 1 and 2) 1991-92, reflecting the Government's determination to improve the efficiency of continuing programs as well as changed funding arrangements for Austudy, Abstudy and assistance for isolated children which from 1 January 1992 have been funded from a special appropriation agreed to by Parliament in the last session. These savings, amounting to $S36.3m in gross terms, are detailed under the relevant appropriation headings in the document Statement of Savings Expected in Annual Appropriations, which has been distributed to honourable members. After discounting those savings by the amount of $690.Sm attributable to the changed funding arrangements I have just mentioned, the net prospective savings identified by departments against the annual appropriations are $144.5m. After allowing for net prospective savings, the appropriations sought represent a net increase of $971m in payments to be financed from annual appropriations in 1991-92, an increase of 2.S per cent on the amounts made available at the time of the 1991-92 Budget. Excluding funding for economic statement initiatives of $115.9m, the net increase represents 2.5 per cent of the 1991-92 annual appropriations, a figure comparable with previous years. I now outline some of the main areas for which the Government has found it necessary to seek additional provisions in the Appropriation Bill (No.3) 1991-92 to meet payments for the ordinary annual services of the Government. Although the Budget figuring contained three allowances for prospective wage and salary increases, those amounts were not then appropriated, and funds are now required to meet increases resulting from award decisions. An amount of $195.3m is included in Appropriation Bill (No.3) for increased running costs for all departments and agencies including Defence, an increase of 2 per cent on the amount of funding for running costs included in Appropriation Act (No.1). This amount includes the costs associated with national wage case increases, various minor Government initiatives which have been previously announced and transfers between financial years. Gross additional estimates of $219.Sm are sought for the defence portfolio in Appropriation Bill (No.3). This figure includes: $62m for running costs, reflecting higher retention rates than estimated at Budget time and the effect of national wage increases; $112.6m for stores and equipment which largely reflects adjustments for price movements and exchange rate variations; $16.7m for defence facilities, related to the decontamination of the Albion Explosives Factory site, Enoggera Ready Reserve accommodation and a number of other new works; and $22.6m for compensation and legal expenses as a consequence of a larger number of claims, higher settlement value of those claims and higher than average number of servicemen who have died on duty. In addition, Appropriation Bill (No.3) includes provision for: $87.4m for increases in labour market program assistance to job seekers and industry; , $11.6m reflecting increased demand for the Aboriginal tutorial assistance program; $40.6m for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, including $1O.1m for the community development employment project reflecting increased participation rates, $21m for the national Aboriginal health strategy and $5.2m for measures responding to the Aboriginal Deaths in Custody Royal Commission; $50m for residential care for older people reflecting higher approval claims for payment than provided for in the Budget; $43.2m for child-care fee relief reflecting growth in average fee relief and increased activity; $8.2m for the transfer of funding for the John Curtin Medical Research School from the Department of Employment, Education and Training to the National Health and Medical Research Council; $20.7m for bounty on computers reflecting an increase in eligible claims under the Bounty (Computers) Act 1984; $11m for the textiles, clothing and footwear industries development strategy; $25m for an increase in funding for the 'black spots' road program; $12.3m in additional maintenance grants under the aerodrome local ownership plan to expedite the completion of the transfer of the remaining Commonwealth-non-Federal Airports Corporation-civil airports to local ownership; $20m for waterfront reform to fund the exit of waterfront employees under the WIRA retirement and redundancy package; and $11.3m for Australian Taxation Office property operating expenses due to a rescheduling of modernisation funds from 1992-93 to enable early completion of new buildings. The balance of $139.8m in the amount included in Appropriation Bill (No.3) is made up of minor variations across a range of programs across most departments and agencies. These additional appropriations are required to meet the 1991-92 commitments that have been made by the Government since the Budget-including partial funding of those announced in the Prime Minister's economic statement, as well as unavoidable cost and price increases and other parameter changes since the Budget was prepared. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Costello) adjourned. APPROPRIATION BILL (No.4) 1991-92 First Reading Message from the Governor General transmitting particulars of proposed expenditure and recommending appropriation announced. Bill presented by Mr Willis, and read a first time. Second Reading",99
185,Mr WILLIS,CENTURY,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. In Appropriation Bill (No.4) 1991-92, appropriations totalling $277. 1m-additional to those made by Appropriation Act (No.2) 1991-92 - are sought for capital works and services, payments to or for the States, the Northem Territory and the Australian Capital Territory, advances and loans, and for other services. The proposed appropriations are needed to meet essential and unavoidable expenditures for which provision was not made in that Act and to partly meet the 199192 commitments announced in the economic statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). The additional appropriations are sought to meet certain cost and price increases which have occurred since the Budget, together with other commitments that have been made by the Government. Areas where significant increases are sought over amounts provided in Appropriation Act (No.2) 1991-92 include: $20m in payments to the States and Territories for assistance for the restoration of heritage properties; $11.7m for demonstration practice grants for general practitioners; $27m in payment to Victoria in lieu of petroleum royalties reflecting increased petroleum production forecasts since formulation of the Budget estimates; $33.9m increase in rural adjustment payments reflecting additional assistance to farmers during the current rural downturn; $lO.2m to provide for the payment of the balances of the former fishing research trust accounts to the Australian Fishing Management Authority; $60m for accelerated road funding announced in the November employment statement; and $54m contribution to the Federal Airports Corporation for construction of a general aviation aerodrome at Badgerys Creek. The remaining $60.3m included in Appropriation Bill (No.4) comprises minor increases in a number of programs for a range of portfolios. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Costello) adjourned. APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (No.2) 1991-92 First Reading Message from the Governor General transmitting particulars of proposed expenditure and recommending appropriation announced. Bill presented by Mr Willis, and read a first time. Second Reading",101
186,Mr WILLIS,CENTURY,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. In Appropriation (parliamentary Departments) Bill (No.2) 1991-92, appropriations totalling $5.3m additional to those made in the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Act 1991-92 are sought for recurrent expenditures of the parliamentary departments. The increase sought relates primarily to essential and unavoidable costs associated with activities of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr CostelJo) adjourned. SOCIAL SECURITY AND VETERANS' NA AMENDMENT BILL 1992 First Reading Bill-by leave-presented by Dr Blewett, and read a first time. Second Reading",101
187,Dr BLEWETT,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The Bill provides for the social security measures announced in the February 1992 Economic Statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). One aspect also applies to certain veterans. It is recognised that the current recession has made life more difficult for families with children and for those on a pension or benefit who have to pay rent. With this in mind, the Government is keen to target special assistance to these groups. The first of these initiatives is a one-off payment of a family allowance bonus to all those in Australia who receive a routine family allowance payment on or in respect of 2 April 1992. The bonus will be an amount of $125 for a family with one child; $175 for a family with two children; $200 for a family with three children; $225 for a family with four children; and $250 for a family with five or more children. A one-off amount of $125 will be made for each child in an approved care organisation who attracts payment of family allowance to the organisation on 2 April 1992. The family allowance bonus is payable only to those whose family allowance is usually paid to an account in Australia or otherwise is paid in Australia. It will be possible for the Department of Social Security to recover any overpayments of this family allowance bonus, but it will not be subject to deductions by the Department to help satisfy any other debt a person may owe to the Department. This one-off payment will prove useful to those who have dependent c-ildren and will also provide an early stImulus to the economy as the money is spent and enters the economy. The second of these initiatives is to increase the child amounts paid to certain pensioners, beneficiaries and recipients of family allowance supplement. The Government has de-ided to increase these amounts by $3 a child per week, except for a child who attracts a frozen rate of payment. Those who will benefit from this initiative will be: all recipients of family allowance supplement except to the extent that the rate includes a frozen amount; all social security pensioners and beneficiaries with dependent children whose rate of pension or benefit includes a child add-on except to the extent that a child addon is a frozen rate; and all Veterans' Affairs service pensioners with dependent children whose rate of pension includes a child add-on, except to the extent that a child add-on is a frozen rate. These changes will take effect on the first payday after 2 April 1992. As a part of the legislation to be introduced shortly to bring about the integration of family allowance. family allowance supplement and pension and benefit child add-on amounts, this $3 increase will become a permanent part of the family payment rates. Speaking in terms of the current legislation the intention is to increase from 15 per cent to 16.2 per cent of the combined pensioner couple maximum basic rate the benchmark used in indexing family payments in respect of children aged under 13 and from 20 per cent to 21.2 per cent of the combined pensioner couple maximum basic rate the benchmark for indexation of family payments in respect of children aged 13 to 15 years on 1 January each year. This is another payment targeted to groups which, because of the cost of bringing up children, the Government has judged to be in particular need at the moment. The third initiative involves the abolition of all rent assistance waiting periods for social security recipients except those waiting periods which apply to single beneficiaries without dependent children who are aged below 18. In the 1991 Budget it was decided that the existing 26-week waiting periods should be reduced to 18 weeks as of 20 March 1992. This new decision supersedes the 1991 Budget decision for all except those aged single beneficiaries under 18. Some beneficiaries will still serve a de facto waiting period where the standard one week waiting period or other longer waiting periods for payment of a social security benefit are involved. This package of social security measures continues this Government's proud record increasing social security and veterans' payments required by those most in This package is a compassionate response the current recession and will help to reduction stimulate economic activity by injecting $317m into the economy in April. Ongoing extra expenditure will be $65m for the rest of vehicles. the current financial year, $290m in 1992-93, $301m in 1993-94, $299m in 1994-95 and $304m in 1995-96. I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memoranprice dum. Debate (on motion by Mr Costello) journed. NA BILL (No.1) 1992 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Baldwin, and read a first time. Second Reading",102
188,Mr BALDWIN,SALES TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"Sydney-Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services and Minister Assisting the Treasurer) (8.17 p.m.)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill will give effect to the Prime Minister's announcement made earlier tonight in One Nation of a reduction in the rate of sales tax on passenger motor vehicles. The reduction will be from 20 per cent to 15 per cent and will apply to vehicles that have a wholesale sale value of $30,505 or less. The reduced rate of sales tax for these vehicles will apply to all taxable dealings with passenger motor vehicles that occur on or after 27 February 1992. The passenger motor vehicles that will qualify for the lower rate of tax will be those vehicles that, if imported, attract customs duty of 35 per cent under the Customs Tariff Act 1987. The 15 per cent rate will also apply to Australian-manufactured vehicles which, if imported, would qualify. Sales of passenger motor vehicles have of suffered heavily in the economic downturn. This has had adverse employment effects need. throughout the economy for domestic to manufacturers, retailers and importers. The in the rate of sales tax for passenger motor vehicles, other than luxury vehicles, will help to stimulate demand for these Depending on pricing behaviour in the industry, the tax reduction should reduce the of an average sedan by a little over 3 per cent, or about $800. The consumer price index could be reduced by about 0.2 peradcentage points by the measure. The reduction in the rate of sales tax on passenger motor vehicles will cost $40m in 1991-92 and $185m in 1992-93, rising to $275m by 1995-96.

The following answers to questions were circulated: Mr Geoffrey Manners: Arrest Warrant (Question No. 882) Mr Aldred asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 4 June 1991: (1) Is he able to say whether there is an inactive arrest warrant against Mr Geoffrey Manners; if so (a) on what grounds and (b) why has it not been withdrawn. (2) Has Mr Manners been lodging written requests to the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions concerning the matter since 15 August 1990. (3) If the arrest warrant referred to in part (1) has been withdrawn, has Mr Manners been informed in writing; if not, why not.",103
189,Mr DUFFY,PAPERS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I have been advised by the DPP that it appears there may originally have been five warrants for the apprehension of Mr Manners obtained in 1984 and 1986. These warrants related to Me Manners' alleged involvement in taxation fraud. 1\vo of the warrants being Victorian warrants were withdrawn when Me Manners was advised in August 1990 that the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions withdrew its request for his extradition. Me Manners was advised in October 1990 by the Associate Director that as far as the Office of the DPP was concerned all criminal proceedings against him were at an end. He had earlier been advised through his solicitors in similar terms by the Melbourne Office of the DPP in September 1990. It would appear from records of the former Special Prosecutor's Office that there may be three inactive warrants issued from the Queensland Magistrates Court. Despite enquiries made of the Brisbane Magistrates Court the Court has advised that they have no record of any outstanding warrants. (2) Mr Manners has been corresponding on a broad range of matters with the Commonwealth DPP since August 1990. He has made various allegations and assertions of impropriety against Commonwealth officials and other persons. He has been told on a number of occasions that the DPP will be prepared to consider those allegations upon receipt of supporting evidence. He has not provided any evidence. NA (3) Me Manners has been advised that if there are warrants against him they will not be executed. If and when the Court locates the warrants, they will be marked withdrawn. The position as far as the Office of the DPP is concerned has not altered since Me Manners was notified in September and October last year that all proceedings against him were at an end. Small Business in Australia (Question No. 947) Mr Ford asked the Minister for Small Business and Customs, upon notice, on 21 June 1991: How many copies of the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce's report Small Business in Australia, which was presented to the House on 30 May 1991, were produced and what was the total cost of its production. Mr Beddall-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: In total, 10,000 copies of Small business in Australia were produced at a cost of $74,292. Overseas Intelligence Agencies (Question No. 1076) Mr Barry Jones asked the AttomeyGeneral, upon notice, on 12 September 1991: Is he able to say (a) whether any overseas intelligence agencies such as the CIA and MIS anticipated (i) Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 or (ii) the coup against President Gorbachev and the events now called the Second Russian Revolution, including the rise of President Yeltsin and the collapse of Kremlin power in August 1991 and (b) why the agencies that failed to anticipate those events did so.",105
190,Mr DUFFY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: In accordance with the practice followed by successive Australian governments, this Government does not propose to comment on matters which might relate to the classified operations of the intelligence agencies of other governments. Category B Postage (Question No. 1231) Mr Andrews asked the Minister for Land Transport, upon notice, on 14 November 1991: (1) Has his attention been drawn to suggestions or plans to phase out category B postage. (2) Will all category B postage be phased out; if so, when. (3) What is the total number of publications registered as category B in Australia. (4) What total sum was paid in postage on category B items in (a) 1989-90 and (b) 1990-91. (5) Does the publisher sort category B items according to postal area of destination before they are lodged with Australia Post; if so, what would be the estimated additional cost, including wages, if the sender did not pre-sort the items. (6) If category B postage is to be phased out, (a) what estimated additional income to Australia Post will result and (b) will Australia Post provide special postage rates to charitable and other organisations eligible to register their publications as category B but ineligible for category A. (7) Did Australia Post record a profit in 1990-91; if so, what sum. Mr Robert Brown-The answer to the honourable member's question, based on advice from Australia Post, is as follows: (1) Australia Post has advised me of its intention to progressively phase out the whole of the Registered Publications service over the next three years. (2) Australia Post intends to progressively phase out access to the Registered Publications service for all ""commercial publications""*, irrespective of whether they are Category A or Category B publications, by the end of 1993. Access for all""non-commercial"" publications will be progressively phased out by the end of 1994. *""Commercial publications"" for this purpose are defined as publications produced by commercial organisations whose income is not fully exempt from income tax or organisations which are carried on for the purpose of profit or individual members. (3) Approximately 9,000. (4) (a) and (b) Australia Post does not have separate category B revenue figures available. The combined revenue from both category A and category B was: 1989-90 $47m 1990-91 $48m The Registered Publications service incurs heavy losses (1990/91-$21.4m) which have to be borne by the users of other postal services. (5) One of the requirements of the Registered Publications service is that all the publications must be pre-sorted. Whilst the additional costs to Australia Post if the sender did not pre-sort the publications would be considerable, the carriage of publications is open to full competition and, therefore, information on the amount of such costs is considered by Australia Post to be commercially confidential. (6) (a) Matters relating to Australia Post's income in relation to competitive products are considered to be commercially confidential. (b) No. Australia Post intends to close the Registered Publications service by the end of 1994. Concurrent with the phasing out of the Registered Publications service is the introduction by Australia Post of a new commercially competitive service called Print Post for the carriage of periodical publications. Print Post charges will be aligned to the cost of providing the service. Whilst generally higher than Registered Publications rates, in some instances they will be lower. They will be significantly lower than comparable letter rates. (7) Yes. Australia Post recorded a $144.1 million operating profit, before abnormal items and tax, on total assets of $2,110 million. Oil and Petrol Levies (Question No. 1245)  Resources, upon notice, on 28 November 1991: (1) What were the (a) rates of excise per litre levied on petrol and (b) receipts from that excise for each year between 1980-81 and 1990-91. (2) What were the (a) rates of crude oil levy and (b) receipts from that levy each year between 1980gain to the 81 and the termination of the levy. (3) What information is he able to provide on the background to the termination of the crude oil levy and on subsequent revenue measures.",105
191,Mr GRIFFITHS,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) The rate of excise levied on petrol in 1980-81 was 5.16 cents per litre. The rate was increased to 6.16 cents per litre on 17 August 1982 and thereafter increases occurred at irregular intervals. In February 1991 the rate of excise was 25.77 cents per litre. Table 1 shows excise rates between 1981 and 1991. (1) (b) The gross excise revenue collected from petrol has increased from $760.3 million in 1980-81 to $4019.2 million in 1990-91. Table 2 shows excise revenue from motor gasoline from 1980-81 to 1990-91. In 1980-81 crude oil, LPG and petroleum products excise amounted to 11.4 % of total revenue and 2.9% of Gross Domestic Product. In 1990-91 these excises contributed 8.1 % of total revenue equivalent to 2.1 % of Gross Domestic Product. (2) (a) Over the period 1980-81 to 1990-91 broadly two excise regimes have operated. The parity/non-parity oil levy operated to 1 July 1983, at which time it was replaced by the excise tranche regime. The latter remains in place for all onshore areas and offshore exploration permit areas WA-1-P and WA-28-P (the North West Shelf project area) and the associated production licence areas. It should be noted that both of these regimes were modified to some extent after their introduction. Parity/Non-Parity Excise Regime Under this regime crude oil was valued at the import parity price set by the Government. Excise was levied at the rates set out in Table 3. The rates that applied were as follows: production of 'old' oil was classified as either 'parity' or 'non-parity' crude oil, with 'nonparity' oil paying a higher rate of excise; and the parity allowance varied depending on the size of the field. The parity allowance for small (producing up to 2 million barrels per annum) was 100%. For medium fields (producing 2 to 15 million barrels per annum) the parity allowance was initially set at 50% and increased to 55% for 1981-82 and 60% from 1982-83 onwards. The parity allowance for large fields (producing ter than 15 million barrels per annum) was 50%. The parity/non-parity regime operated up to 30 June 1983 when it was replaced by the excise trancheregime. Excise Tranche Regime The excise tranche regime levied excise as a percentage of price. The rate of excise increased on a progressive scale as set out in Table 4. The excise was levied as a percentage of the import parity price until 31 December 1987 after which, following the de-regulation of crude oil markets, it was set on the basis of the volume weighted average realised price (VOLWARE). From 1 July 1983 the progressive tranche scale was introduced for 'old' oil (oil discovered before 18 September 1975) with the top marginal excise rate set at 87%. Oil other than 'old' oil was initially excise free. The tranche regime underwent several refinements after its introduction in 1983 as follows: in April 1984 the progressive tranche scale was introduced for 'new' oil (oil discovered after 18 September 1975) with the top marginal excise rate set at 35%; in October 1984 the progressive tranche scale was introduced for 'intermediate' oil (oil from fields discovered before 18 September 1975 but not developed prior to 23 October 1984) with the top marginal excise rate set at 55%; the top marginal rate for 'old' oil was reduced from 87% to 80% in 1986-87 and then progressively reduced to 75% by 1989-90 as shown in Table 4; and in July 1987 the 30 million barrel excise exemption limit was introduced. This effectively allowed the first 30 million barrels of production from new developments and onshore areas to be free of excise. The excise tranche regime (and State royalty) was replaced for Barrow Island in July 1985 by a Resource Rent Royalty (RRR) administered by the Western Australian Government. The Commonwealth receives 75% of the Barrow Island RRR. (2) (b) In 1980-81 excise receipts from crude oil fields and LPG were $3108 million. In the period to 1990-91 receipts from this source rose to a maximum of $4202 million in 1984-85, then declined to $1240 million in 1990-91. Table 5 shows crude oil and LPG receipts from 1980-81 to 1989-90. (3) In the 1990 Budget, the Government angrea- nounced a package of reforms to provide a more certain and efficient basis for offshore petroleum production taxation and to encourage efficient exploration activity in Australia. The reforms which took effect from 1 July 1990, replaced the excise and royalty regime on the Bass Strait project with the petroleum resource rent tax (PRRT) and introduced full deductibility against the PRRT for all company exploration expenditures in Australia's offshore areas outside the North West Shelf exploration permit areas WA-I-P and WA-28-P and the associated production licences. Commonwealth excise and royalty arrangements continue to apply to production from the North West Shelf project, in recognition of its special circumstances. Petroleum production onshore and in State internal and coastal waters is subject to State royalty and Commonwealth crude oil excise. The production based excise and royalty regime was inhibiting the enhanced development of the mature Bass Strait fields. The crude oil excise had evolved over time into a complex range of rates that varied according to annual production levels, and the timing of the discovery and/or the date of development. These arrangements discouraged full economic development of the Bass Strait reserves. In contrast, the PRRT obtains an equitable community return from the Bass Strait resource without inhibiting economic development because it is levied on net income rather than production and is therefore sensitive to changes in prices and costs. All production costs are deductible. Following the reforms, a further $1-1.5 billion is expected to be invested in Bass Strait, generating an additional 200-300 million barrels of oil and enhancing gas production. Company-wide deductibility of exploration costs against the PRRT encourages the broadening of Australia's exploration effort. Previously, deductibility was limited to individual permit areas; as a result, for a company, after-tax exploration costs were lower in a PRRT paying permit area than in prospective but relatively unexplored areas. The change to a company-wide system equates a company's after-tax costs for exploration in all PRRT offshore areas.

192,Mr BEAZLEY,REVENUE FROM CRUDE OIL AND LPG,"The Minister for Shipping and Aviation has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) to (3) The Australian Maritime Safety Authority, formerly the Maritime Operations Division of the Department of Transport and Communications, administers port state control inspections in accordance with Australia's rights and obligations under international maritime conventions to which Australia is signatory. It is the Authority's aim to inspect approximately 25 % of all foreign flag vessels over 500 gross tonnage calling at Australian ports in any year. This figure accords with established international practice. The procedures employed for the inspections are in accordance with International Maritime Organization resolutions. Resources have not enabled the target level to be achieved in every year. These inspections are carried out on a random basis on all types of ships visiting this country. They ensure such things as ship certification, manning levels, crew qualifications, hull structure, life saving appliances, fire fighting and navigational equipment, load line and radio equipment comply with the standards of the relevant convention. Inspections were implemented on 1 April 1985. A system for the formal recordings of port state control data was not introduced until early 1986. As a result, the records prior to that are incomplete. The control provisions of the international conventions confine the port state to inspection of the validity of certificates issued under the relevant conventions unless there are clear grounds for believing that the condition of the ship or of its equipment does not correspond substantially with the particulars of the certificate or has not been maintained so as to conform with the convention requirements. In order to ensure the integrity of the inspections and to establish ""clear grounds"" the instructions require marine surveyors to record all departures from convention standards as ""deficienTABLE 1 FOREIGN VESSEL VISITS Question Year 1. Foreign vessels visiting Australian ports during year counted once only 2. Vessels inspected by DOTC/AMSA Percentage 2/1 3(a) Vessels with any deficiency Vessels with serious deficiencies NOTES: 1.

Records are incomplete and cies"". It follows that a considerable number of deficiencies recorded during such inspections are of a relatively minor nature and do not pose an immediate hazard to the safety of the ship or its crew. In many such cases the deficiencies may be, and are, rectified by ships' crews during the normal stay in port, without delay to their schedules. The decision on whether specific intervention action, eg detention of the ship or refusal of outward Customs clearance, is warranted as a result of a deficiency is a matter for the judgement of the individual surveyor on the basis of all of the facts of the case. The Authority'S data base does not permit identification of the seriousness of the deficiencies and thus the statistics show all deficiencies found during inspections. All cases involving serious deficiencies are reported to the International Maritime Organization and the Flag State Administration of the ship in accordance with the convention provisions. These cases are identified in the response to Question 3. The responses to the questions are given in the attached Tables 1,2 and 3A-3G inc. Table 1 shows the responses to Questions 1,2 and 3(a).

(5) Yes. (6) No direct assistance for chiropractic care is provided by my Department. The provision of health care in Australia is essentially a matter for the State{ferritory Governments.

It is a matter for each State to determine its priorities and the funds that are allocated between the many competing areas of State Government spending, including hospital and health services. (7) There is no health care education budget per se in the Department. Health care education is funded through various program activities ego the budget for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is $3m in 1991/92.
