2,Mr GABB,Unknown,"I have received from Mr. Stott, secretary of the Wheat-G rowers Protection Association, the following telegram :-Bounty ' on production basis umtuitahl* wheat-growers. This will lose £1,000,000 tu wheat-growers in all States. On production VmRu Queensland benefits; on export basis the extra finance goes to exporting States. Kxi»>n bounty will automatically raise home prices. This provides sufficient benefit to Queensland. I ask the Minister for Markets and Transport the reason for the Government's decision to pay the £3,000,000 wheat bounty on a production basis instead of on an export basis as originally proposed? Has consideration been given to the fact that payment on an export basis would automatically raise the price of wheat for home consumption throughout Australia?  Government has not. come to any definite decision; the matter is still receiving full and careful consideration. UNEMPLOYMENT EELIE F.",11

11,Mr BLAKELEY,LIGHTING OF POST OFFICE,"Darling-Minister for Home Affairs) [3.6] - by leaveBefore the recent adjournment of the House, the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley) had recorded in Hansard a statement dealing with thf Canberra Hog Farm, which, in the main, was an attack on an officer of my department. The whole of the assertions contained therein have been personally investigated by me, and 1 find, as a result the of this inquiry and a perusal of the departmental papers, that on the whole, the are either a distortion of facts or untruths. In respect of the farm occupied by Mr Dennis, the statement included about 25 definite allegations of which, I find, not one is correct. With regard to the farm occupied by Mr Coles, I find that the officer named was not responsible for the establishment, of the farm, or for any constructional work other than fencing. On the administrative side, there is no question that everything possible was done by him, both during the time the farm was being developed, and subsequently to assist the lessee and to protect the interests of the Commonwealth and the lessee. The documentary evidence in the departmental papers in support of this includes tribute* from the lessee immediately prior to his occupation in 1929 and recently, and there is no evidence that any matter bearing on the farm has been neglected by the officer concerned. It is admitted that some delay in the development of the existing farm occurred. This was recognized before thf lessee went into occupation, and at a conference with him and his solicitor, it was agreed that as compensation for this delay, the lessee should receive a rebate of rental for a period covering the first three months of his occupation. Some time after Mr Coles entered into occupation, he revived the subject of the delay in granting him possession of the land, due, in my opinion, to the depression in the pig industry, and ako to the fact that the lessee's financial backing had not been realized. In order to meet the lessee, and recognizing that the Administration wag obtaining a service in the removal of wet garbage from hotel and boarding establishments, Mr Coles' rent-free occupation of the farm was extended until the end of 1930. It was also agreed to refund the .amount of £121 6s. l i d . paid by himas a deposit when he accepted the lease. At a later stage, the Administration agreed to remit the rental due to the 31st December, 1931, and in addition, waived its claim to an amount of £25 6s. 7d., due to it under the terms of the lease for the supply of water to the farm. It will be seen that, up to date, no rent has been received by the Commonwealth from this undertaking. A considerable amount has also been expended by the Administration in endeavouring to supplement the water supply and in alteration of the feeding system, and at the present time further representations by the lessee are receiving consideration. I do not doubt, for one moment, the bona fides of the honourable member for West Sydney in bringing this matter before the House. I do, however, take the greatest exception to the honourable member's informant supplying him with particulars which are proved to be false, apparently with the object of damaging the reputation of one of my officers. Officers of the Service have no means of refuting allegations made against them in the House, and I feel I would be remiss in my duty to my staff if , after satisfying myself that the allegations are false, I did not refute them in this House. The statement made by the honourable member on information supplied to him is damaging to the reputation of Mr Brackenreg. 1 take this opportunity of assuring the honourable member that he has been misled, - smd of making public the fact that all the allegations regarding Mr Brackenreg are groundless. Mr Brackenreg, who is a reliable officer, has carried out his duty as a government servant in a most creditable and honourable way, and there is not the slightest justification . for the attack which has been made upon him. EXCHANGE RATE.",12
12,Mr GREGORY,LIGHTING OF POST OFFICE,It has been reported in the press recently that the Government way are allowable deductions. has been in communication with the bankmatter ing authorities with a view to pegging exchange at a rate lower than that at present prevailing. Will the Treasurer say if action has been taken in this matter?,13
13,Mr THEODORE,LIGHTING OF POST OFFICE,"There has been a full discussion between the Prime Minister and myself, and representatives of the Commonwealth Bank Board. At present it would be inadvisable to make a statement as to the nature of the discussion and the points that were under consideration;. but a representative of the Commonwealth Bank Board is to consult with the representatives of the trading banks, and some action will be taken later with regard to the exchange rate. An announcement will then be made. The Government and the Commonwealth Bank Board agree that it would be inadvisable at the present time to make any change that would cause too sudden a change in the existing rates. INCOME TAXATION . NA TAX.",13
14,Mr JONES,DEDUCTIONS FOR UNEMPLOYMENT RELIEF,"As payment of State unemployment relief tax is allowable as a deduction in respect of federal income tax in some States, and not in others, and as this discrimination is contrary to the spirit of federation, I should like to know if the Treasurer will take steps to recti i'y this anomaly by allowing State unemployment relief tax as a deduction for federal income tax purposes in all States?",13
15,Mr THEODORE,DEDUCTIONS FOR UNEMPLOYMENT RELIEF,"The matter mentioned by the honourable member has been under consideration. It is not strictly accurate to say that there has been discrimination between taxpayers of the various States in respect of allowable deductions for federal income tax purposes. There is a wages tax, or impositions in the nature of a wages tax, operating in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland, and so far such payment? have not been allowable deductions for federal income tax purposes. In South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania, the additional revenue required to finance unemployment relief is incorporated in the ordinary income t.a.» ' law. Therefore, payments made in thai The has been brought under the notice the of the Federal Commissioner for Taxation, who has undertaken to reconsider the decision which he gave with regard to unemployment relief tax payments in Victoria and the other States. WAR SERVICE HMS.",13
16,Mr WHITE,DEDUCTIONS FOR UNEMPLOYMENT RELIEF,"In the absence of the Minister in charge of war service homes, I ask the Prime Minister if it is a fact that a committee is being appointed to consider whether"" relief can be given to ex-soldiers who are in arrears with their repayments for war service homes, and if so have representatives of the TJnited War Service Homes Purchasers Association been invited to become members of the committee? In view of the urgent need for relief, will the Minister say when the committee will meet? Mr Scullin"" - There is no foundation whatever for the newspaper statements that the appointment of a committee is contemplated to consider the matter mentioned by the honourable member. A sub-committee of Cabinet is dealing with the whole position. An inquiry into individual cases is necessary, and, as the Assistant Minister in charge of war service homes has already announced, every case of individual hardship is being dealt with on its merits. Every case of hardship is being met, and, where possible, relief will be given. The sub-committee of the Cabinet is going into the question of whether general relief is possible; but a complete and permanent writing-down of the capital cost of war service homes, amounting in the aggregate to about £28,000,000, at a time when nobody can say with any degree of accuracy what is the real value of property, is not contemplated, because such a suggestion is unsound. I agree that a position of great difficulty is arising, and we are considering that aspect of the matter with a view to making the burden as light as possible for all concerned. We have already reduced the rate of interest by 1 per cent.",14
17,Mr WHITE,DEDUCTIONS FOR UNEMPLOYMENT RELIEF,B y i per cent.,14
18,Mr SCULLIN,DEDUCTIONS FOR UNEMPLOYMENT RELIEF,"It has been reduced by 1 per cent, in the case of loans to the States for soldier settlers, and by \ per cent, in the case of purchasers of war service homes. interest charged to the various State Governments in respect of advances to soldier settlers is now 4 per cent., and State Governments make an additional charge for administration. The Commonwealth Government is charging 4 per cent, interest on war service homes and i per cent, for administration. The relief by way of reduction of interest by i per cent, is undoubtedly going to returned soldiers in the case of occupants of war service homes, and some relief will, 1 believe, be given to returned soldier settlers.",14
19,Mr BELL,DEDUCTIONS FOR UNEMPLOYMENT RELIEF,"Has the reduction of 1 per cent, in the case of soldier settlers been passed on?",14
20,Mr SCULLIN,DEDUCTIONS FOR UNEMPLOYMENT RELIEF,I think only part of it ; a portion is going to administration.,14
21,Mr HAWKER,DEDUCTIONS FOR UNEMPLOYMENT RELIEF,What safeguards are . being adopted to ensure the State Governments will pass on the relief to returned soldiers ?,14
22,Mr SCULLIN,DEDUCTIONS FOR UNEMPLOYMENT RELIEF,"We trust that the State Governments have as great a sense of honour as any other administration, and will pass on the relief given by the Commonwealth Government. We have not yet been able to ascertain the exact figures involved in regard to war service homes, but we are giving consideration to the question whether some relief could not be given in respect of payments on account of principal for, say, a period of twelve months where the circumstances warrant such action. Mr *WHITE - All valuations are down. ",14
23,Mr SCULLIN,DEDUCTIONS FOR UNEMPLOYMENT RELIEF,I have already pointed out to the honourable member that no one is in a position to place an equitable value upon property today.,14
24,Mr WHITE,DEDUCTIONS FOR UNEMPLOYMENT RELIEF,The municipalities are doing it.,14
25,Mr SCULLIN,DEDUCTIONS FOR UNEMPLOYMENT RELIEF,"If is impossible, under existing conditions, to value war service homes in a way that would be fair to the buyer, the Government, and the community. I also remind the honourable member that municipal valuations for rating purposes may rise and fall from year to year; whereas a writing down of values of war service homes for Commonwealth purposes would be permanent. There is therefore no analogy between municipal valuations for taxation purThe poses and Commonwealth valuations for repayment' purposes. The Government is considering the whole questhe tion of capital costs, but I do not see how it is possible to write them down permanently at this stage. Values are fluctuating so greatly that no government, with a sense of responsibility, would undertake the task. UNEMPLOYMENT . NA TERRITORY.",14
26,Mr WARD,RELIEF WORK IN FEDERAL CAPITAL,Can the Minister for Home Affairs inform the House whether award rates and conditions are at all times observed on relief work carried out in the Federal Capital Territory?,15

28,Mr HOLLOWAY,CLOTHING AND TEXTILE,"I ask the Prime Minister, if , in view of the repeated allegations of sweating in the clothing and textile industries, published in the Melbourne Age newspaper, the Government will consider the necessity of appointing special inspectors to police arbitration court awards?",15
29,Mr SCULLIN,CLOTHING AND TEXTILE,"The Attorney-General's Department is in communication with the Registrar of the Arbitration Court, who has been asked to furnish a report upon the matter. NA STOCK. DISSENTING BONDHOLDERS: INTEREST ON UNCONVERTED STOCK.",15
30,Mr LONG,AUSTRALIA N CONSOLIDATE D,"I have been approached by a lady who is a holder of Commonwealth Bonds, amounting to £900, which have not yet been converted, and asked to .inquire if , in the event of her consenting to convert the holding into the recent Commonwealth debt conversion loan, it will be possible for the Treasurer to arrange for the repayment of the loan in 1988?",15
31,Mr THEODORE,AUSTRALIA N CONSOLIDATE D,"Provisio n has been made in the conversion operation to enable the Loan Council, and, by delegated authority, the chairman of the Loan Council, to arrange for the consolidation of smaller amounts, such as the one mentioned by the honourable member, to mature at the earlier dates provided for under the conversion plan.",15
32,Mr CROUCH,AUSTRALIA N CONSOLIDATE D,Is £900 regarded as a small amount?,15
33,Mr THEODORE,AUSTRALIA N CONSOLIDATE D,"Yes , all amounts under £1,000 arc so regarded. The chairman of the Loan Council has authority also to include sums exceeding £1,000 where special circumstances warrant such action.",15
34,Mr LYONS,AUSTRALIA N CONSOLIDATE D,"Is it a fact that interest accruing since July on bonds or inscribed stock, the holders of which have dissented from conversion, has not yet been paid, and. if so, can the Treasurer say when it will be paid?",15
35,Mr THEODORE,AUSTRALIA N CONSOLIDATE D,"I understand that the position is that in cases where halfyearly dates for the payment of interest have occurred since the conversion loan was launched, the rate of interest payable to those who have dissented is that which would have been payable had the holdings concerned been converted. This course has been adopted pending a final decision as to what shall be done with the unconverted portion of the outstanding loans.",15
36,Mr CROUCH,AUSTRALIA N CONSOLIDATE D,"A m I to understand that interest due on unconverted holdings in the loan which matured on the 15th August has been reduced to 4 per cent., and that the amounts due have been paid ?",15
37,Mr THEODORE,AUSTRALIA N CONSOLIDATE D,"The rate of interest that has been paid is in accord with the rate provided for under the conversion scheme. It would depend upon the interest payable on the original bond* whether the rate paid was 4 per cent, or a little liigher than 4 per cent.",15
38,Mr CROUCH,AUSTRALIA N CONSOLIDATE D,The interest has not been paid at all.,15
39,Mr THEODORE,AUSTRALIA N CONSOLIDATE D,The dissenting bondholders to whom interest has become due have been paid the rate which would have been payable to them had they converted. ',15
40,Mr LATHAM,AUSTRALIA N CONSOLIDATE D,"Is the Prime Minister yet able to supply me with the information, for which I asked the week before last, with regard to the amount of unconverted securities and the dates of maturity? Mr .SCULLIN - I made inquiries on that subject this morning. The information which the honourable member requires is still being prepared.",15
41,Mr LONG,AUSTRALIA N CONSOLIDATE D,"I direct the attention of the Treasurer to the very deserving case  of many cases. This man holds an overdue New South Wales bond, which matured on the 10th August last. I ask what stepshave been taken by the Cominonwealth Government or the Common- - Mr. wealth Bank to relieve such bondholders who cannot obtain money in respect of their bonds?",15
42,Mr THEODORE,AUSTRALIA N CONSOLIDATE D,"Provisio n was made for the conversion of that loan the conversion scheme, and a considerable interest. amount of the holdings in that loan were converted; but some dissent notices were ©1 received. The mode by which unconverted bonds will be dealt with is now under consideration, and a proposal will Ibe submitted to Parliament in regard it in the course of a few days. TARIF F SCHEDULE. Mr It. GREEK-In view of the that the Senate will resume next Wednesday, has the Government given any constatements sideration to the practicability^ of subdiings in Cabinet. viding the tariff schedule into parts, so that the members of another place may be able to enter upon their discussion of the tariff items without waiting for the - completion of the whole schedule by this chamber ?",16
43,Mr SCULLIN,AUSTRALIA N CONSOLIDATE D,"Consideratio n has been given to that matter. The Governgation ment desired to divide the schedule into two parts, and submit the business to another place in two separate bills with the object of facilitating the discussion there; but when the proposal was carestatement fully investigated it was found that practical difficulties were too great. would impose a very great strain upon the departmental officers concerned this business to watch the passage of the schedule through two Houses at the one time. I am afraid, therefore, shall have to abandon that idea. But, with the co-operation of all honourable members, this House could complete its discussion of the schedule in about two weeks. WESTMINSTER BANK. AUSTRALIAN SHORT-TERM INDEBTEDNESS.",16
44,Mr BEASLEY,AUSTRALIA N CONSOLIDATE D,"Will the Treasurer inform me whether there is any truth in the reported statement that the Commonbut wealth Government will be asked to pay an increased rate of interest of between 2-} per cent, and 2$ per cent, for a newal of treasury-bills to the value of £5,000,000, which mature with the Westminster Bank to-dav?

47,Mr HAWKER,INTEREST ON SOLDIER,"Is the Prime Minister aware that at least one State Minister has announced that there is no oblion State governments to pass m the reduction of 1 per cent, in the interest on loans for soldier settlement in cases where the interest charged to the settler does not exceed 5 per cent? If so, is that in accord with the decisions the of the Premiers Conference? Will the It right honourable gentleman also say whether there is any honourable underin standing or agreement among the members of the conference to the effect that the full reduction in interest will be that we passed on to the settlers?",16
48,Mr SCULLIN,INTEREST ON SOLDIER,"When the reduction was made in interest rates the Commonwealth Government reduced by 1 per cent, the rate of interest on all moneys advanced by it to State governments for soldier settlement purposes. It was pointed out at the Premiers Conference, that some of the governments had not been charging for administration, and it was felt that they were entitled to do so; I did not understand that that charge would in any case exceed one-half per cent. My impression was that at least reone-half per cent, redaction would be made in the interest charged by State governments on all moneys which they had advanced for soldier settlement purposes. WIRELESS BROADCASTING.",16

Tn of the very great demand for this report, I ask honourable members not to retain copies longer than is absolutely necessary. WHEAT ADVANCES ACT. FORMAL MOTION FOR ADJOURNMENT.",17
55,Mr SPEAKER,INTEREST ON SOLDIER,"I have received from the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Stewart) an intimation that he intends to move the adjournment of the House this afternoon for the purpose of discussing a definite matter of urgent public importance, viz., "" The failure of the Government to give effect to the Wheat Advances Act 1930 "". Five honourable members having risen - in their places, Question proposed.",17
56,Mr STEWART,INTEREST ON SOLDIER,"Wimmera) [3.30] or I have moved the adjournment of the House because of the statements that f so, have been made that, as a result of the Premiers Conference, it is proposed 'to distribute £3,000,000 in relief to the the wheat-growers of Australia, as a bounty upon the coming crop. I am aware that legislative proposals will come before the House which will give honourable members full opportunity to discuss relating to the wheat industry, and I do not intend to anticipate them. My reason for sponsoring this motion is to ask for a definite statement from the Prime Minister (Mr Scuflin) in answer a question that is being asked by wheat growers from one end to the otlier of the Australian wheat belt: "" Why is the Government coming forward with proposals for relief in connection with the orop before it honours its obligation to growers with regard to the last",17
57,Mr MARTENS,INTEREST ON SOLDIER,Does not the honourable member want any relief for this crop?,17
58,Mr STEWART,INTEREST ON SOLDIER,"If the honourable member will listen I shall try to make clear what I think the wheat-growers A brief review of the attempts of for the Government to assist the wheatof Australia is necessary in order fully to assess the position. In February, 1930, the Prime Minister made an appeal to the growers of wheat throughout the Commonwealth to "" Grow more wheat."" from That was backed by a "" Grow more and wheat"" campaign sponsored by the view various State governments. Associated with the appeal was a projected guarantee of 4s. per bushel of wheat, cash on delivery at railway sidings. A bill to give effect to that guarantee was brought before Parliament and passed this chamber, but was rejected in another place.",17
59,Mr MARTENS,INTEREST ON SOLDIER,B y members of the Country party.,17
60,Mr STEWART,INTEREST ON SOLDIER,"I am not going, into details. I am merely mentioning facts. I make no party issue of this matter, and am not speaking in any party spirit. As a result of the failure to provide that guarantee of 4s. a bushel, a serious position was created in the wheat belt. At the time. I moved an adjournment of the House, and appealed to the Government to take action to give some relief to the growers, pointing out that, otherwise, a disastrous state of affairs would arise. I was supported by honourable members on both sides of the House, also by the leaders of all parties. As a result a bill was drafted which provided for the payment of 3s. a bushel f.o.b., of which 2s. a bushel cash was to be paid at local sidings. The subsequent payment, on the basis of 3s. a bushel f.o.b., would have given to the growers an average of 2s. 4d: a bushel at country sidings. That measure passed both Houses, on the voices. Certainly there was criticism regarding details of the bill, but the main principle-that of granting ussistance to the wheat-growers-wa s supported by the leaders and members of all parties in this House and in another place. It received the Royal Assent on the 23rd December last, and is still upon the statute-book, but its provisions have not yet been honoured by the Governmeut. Not one wheat-grower has received a penny as a result of the passage of that legislation. The reason given for the non-fulfilment of the terms of that act is that the Commonwealth Bank stated that, under the provisions of the measure, it could not adequately secure itself for repayments of any advances made. I am somewhat hazy, and I think most people are, as to the actual reasons which prompted the Commonwealth Bank to refuse to provide the money, but I shall not go into details. All I and the growers of wheat are concerned with is that the money has not been paid.",17
61,Mr BRENNAN,INTEREST ON SOLDIER,It is no use gliding over the difficulties.,18
62,Mr STEWART,INTEREST ON SOLDIER,"I do not intend to do so. The Prime Minister or the Minister concerned will have an opportunity to reply to my motion, and I am confident he will not attempt to glide over the difficulties. A definite authoritative statement should be made in connection with the non-fulfilment of the terms of that measure. There is a further bill, of which notice appears on the business-paper. This, the Prime Minister has definitely stated, will not be proceeded with further. It is a short measure to provide for an advance of £6,000,000, £2,o00,000 of which was to go to necessitous wheat-growers, the remaining £3,500,000 to be 'paid as a bounty at the rate of 6d. a bushel. The latest proposal emanating from the recent Premiers Conference is a projected bounty of 6d. a bushel on export wheat. The point that I desire to emphasize, and that governs ray action in moving the adjournment of the House, is that it refers only to the coming crop, and makes no reference whatever to that of last season. As a result of the appeal to the growers of Australia, a crop was produced last year estimated to be 212,628,699 bushels, of which approximately 198,000,000 bushels was marketed by the growers at an average price of about Is. 9d. a bushel at country sidings. The difference between that price and the 4s. a bushel guarantee that had the approval of this House is 2s. 3d. In other words, the farmers received less than half the amount that they expected when the crop was sown. Assuming that the growers lost 2s. 3d. a bushel on the 198,000,000 bushels marketed last year, their collective loss on that crop amounts to £22,275,000. The trouble is that the debts incurred by the farmers because they did not receive that money have not yet been liquidated. Unfortunately, many hundreds of them in all parts of the Commonwealth have been driven off the land, their properties have been sold, and there is no more pitiable sight than the mortgagees' sales in the wheat belt today. There we have the spectacle of hard-working men, who need never havibeen sold up, going off their properties practically without a penny, because the assistance promised them by the Government has not been forthcoming. Th* land and farming plant are, in most cases, sold for much less than their value, because, everybody being in an impoverished condition, no"" one can afford to pay much for anything. The farmers cannot get credit, and they are now faced with the task of taking off the coming crop, an expensive undertaking which is beyond their resources. I have here two telegrams received from different areas in my constituency, and the condition described in them is typical of that prevailing throughout the wheat belt, not only in Victoria. but in the other' wheat-growing States of the Commonwealth as well. My friend, the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory), has informed me that the same state of affairs obtains in Western Australia, and I know that things are no better in New South Wales and South Australia. The first is from the wheat-growers' association at Berriwillock, and is as follows:Implore Guvernnient's assistance; calamity. Crops cannot be harvested. Banks not financing cornsacks; people's feeling incensed to limit. Action must be prompt. The second is from the secretary of the Wheat growers Association at Culgoa, and is in these termsWheat-growers here cannot finance jute jroods, duplicates, &c. Assistance imperative and immediate. The farmers need money to harvest this year's crop. Apparently a sum of £3,000,000 is available for the assistance of growers, and I urge the Government to make that money available in respect of last year's crop, so that the farmers may be able to use it to defray harvesting expenses this year. There is a moral obligation, not only on the Government, but also on this Parliament, to see that the farmers receive some assistance in accordance with the terms of the Wheat Advances Act passed last year. honour of Parliament is involved. I suggest that the Government should proceed with the bill now on the notioe-paper, but of which notioe of withdrawal has been given. With some amendment of its machinery clauses, that measure would furnish a means of distributing the sum of £3,000,000 which ifl supposed to be available. Such legislation would be a fair substitute for the 1980 Wheat Advances Act, and would enable the Government to carry out the promises made to the growers. Governments in every other country in the world wihere wlieat is grown have come to the assistance of. the growers. In Canada today the Government, is making an advance of 5 centsa small sum it is true-towards portatipu costs in connection with the crop now being taken of f . In New Zealand the wheat-growers have been protected. On the Continent of Europe, France, Germany and other countries have taken steps to protect and assist the growers. In the ifr. Stewart. United States of America, action has been taken by the Federal Farm Board to help the wheat-growers. In no other country in the world have the wheaf-growers been promised so much, and received so little, as in Australia. Now the Government suggests that the money available should be paid on the coming crop, and regards this, presumably, as honoring the promise made last year in respect of the previous crop. Such a proposal cannot be facing permitted to pass without protest. By our action in passing the previous wheat bills, we have created a feeling of expectancy among the growers, most of whom are now smarting under a keen sense of political injustice. If the Minister would adopt my suggestion, it would give the growers finance at a time when they badly need it. To-day, a spirit of indifference, amounting almost to despair, prevails among settlers in the wheat belt. The land is not being fallowed, and the farmers are becoming demoralized through repeated disappointments.",18
63,Mr MAXWELL,INTEREST ON SOLDIER,"If the honourable member's proposal is accepted and adopted in regard to the last crop, will he make a further appeal in regard to the coming crop ?",19
64,Mr STEWART,INTEREST ON SOLDIER,"I am glad that the honourable member asked that question, The because he has reminded me of a point which I was in danger of forgetting. We know that a definite loss was incurred by growers in respect of the last crop, but we do not know what the price will be for the coming crop. Last week the price of wheat rose 6d. a bushel in the overseas markets, and at the seaports of the capital cities of Australia there was a rise of 4d. to 4/Jd. a bushel in one week. It is possible that this upward trend may be maintained. I make no predictions, but it is possible. Conditions are unsettled in the Far East today. I mention this only as a contingency which may arise. There are rumours of trouble between Japan and Russia in Manchuria. A declaration of war would send wheat prices soaring, in trans- a night. That is a powerful reason why this money should be made available to the farmers to repay them in some slight degree for the definite losses which have occurred. As for the coming crop, we shall have to deal with that when the time comes. If rhe banks have made certain stipulaGovernment's tions regarding the advance of this money, the Minister should inform honourable members what they are; whether the Government has protested against them; whether it acquiesces in them; what further negotiations are proceeding, or whether it is necessary to approach the banks again. I suggest that the leaders of all parties in this House, and in another place, should confer with the Government, decide on a common policy, and should together urge upon the banks the necessity of enabling the Parliament to honour its promises in respect of last year's crop. This is a matter in which the responsibility of, not only the ment, hut also the Parliament is involved. At present, there is an act upon the statute-book that has not been repealed, and to which effect has not been given. This is unparalleled in the political annuls of this country. From one end of Australia to the other, the wheat growers are asking why effect has not been given to the Wheat Advances Act of 1930. I urge the Minister to make a definite statement to the House regarding the actual position, more particularly with respect to the developments which .have occurred since the last conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers, l i is true that, brief paragraphs have appeared in the newspapers from time to time, and that the Minister, in reply to a deputation which I introduced to him in Melbourne, outlined the position as it was at that time; but. no official pronouncement has been made in Parliament. I have submitted this motion to enable the Minister to make a complete statement regarding the position, ai<d to say whether it is not possible to make the sura of £3,000,000 available in connection with the 1930-33 harvest, and thus assist the wheat-growers in financing this season's crop.",19
65,Mr GREGORY,INTEREST ON SOLDIER,"Swan) [3.51] - T second the motion. I agree entirely with the views expressed by the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Stewart). I look upon the present position of the wheat-growers in Australia as one of grave importance. The manner in which they have been treated is a reflection upon the honour of, not oidy the Government, but the Parliament itself. The inactivity seems to savour of something in the nature of repudiation in its ugliest form. I am speaking, not only on behalf of those who have suffered so severely in the past, but in the interests of those who are now faced with tremendous responsibilities. I honestly believe that if action is not immediately taken Australia will find it exceedingly difficult to retrieve its position. Acute distress was prevalent in the new wheat areas in Western Australia in 1912, when the harvest was a failure. In traversing the district at that time. I could not help but admire the steadfastness and determinaGoverntion of the wheat-growers, and thu courage and fortitude of their womenfolk. In some instances, I found that the children were being fed ou grain and clothed in bags. The majority of those settlers have, in consequence of their determination, since made good; but it was because of the conditions of these people and the high cost of their requirements owing to our tariff policy that I became determined to resist the demands to exploit them further. Since that time further new areas have been opened up for wheat-growing, but owing to the heavy cost of commodities, due largely to the fiscal policy of the Commonwealth, the settlers are faced with difficulties similar to those experienced by others in earlier years. These settlers, who did wot have the slightest opportunity to take advantage of the high pi-ices which ruled after the termination of the war, are now in the wretched position of the growers in 1912 to whom I have just referred. History is repeating itself. The position of many of our wheat growers is hopeless. Many of them are bankrupt, and desperate, and unfortunately, others have forsaken their holdings upon which they had hoped tn make homes for themselves and their families. No country can afford to forsake settlers of this class. Their present position has been greatly intensified by their loyalty to their country and their desinto assist the Government. They listened to the pleadings of the right honourable the Prime Minister (Mr. Scullin) who exhorted them, on many occasions, to produce more wheat, and told them that if they did they would receive the benefit of a guaranteed price. Since this Parliament passed an act providing for the payment of Ss. a bushel f.o.b. the Government has found that finance is not available. A proposal submitted by honourable members on this side of the chamber, to impose a sales tax upon flour, which would have provided sufficient money to pay 3s. a bushel^ did not meet with the approval of the Government. At the time the proposal was made, I urged the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr. Eorde) to issue negotiable bonds equivalent to 6d. a bushel which would have shown the farmers that the Government was endeavouring to honour its promises.",20
66,Mr MARTENS,INTEREST ON SOLDIER,Without any gold backing such as the honourable member advocates.,21
67,Mr GREGORY,INTEREST ON SOLDIER,"If the honourable payments member for Herbert (Mr Martens) beenable lieves in repudiating the pledges made to the wheat-farniers, I do not. An inassist crease in our wheat exports, it was pointed out, would assist in roducing adverse trade balance, and, consequently, the farmers were urged to produce more. The wheat-farmers - loyally responded the Prime Minister's appeal and, as a result, their losses are much greater than they otherwise would have been. A record area was placed under crop last year, but this year the area will be duced at least 25 per cent. In travelling through portion of my electorate, I found many instances in which farmers who had commenced fallowing had later abandoned the work. When I questioned them as to their reason for so doing they replied, "" If we continue it will only getting further into debt. Look at the market"". They stated that they were fed up with promises, and demanded the honouring of the Wheat Advances Act. The area under crop this year will proI bably be 25 per cent, less than last and in the following year the reduction may be still greater. At the present price of wheat it is impossible for the wheatin growers to purchase their requirements or to employ labour, and this is accenproduction tuating the financial difficulties confrontaddition ing the country. The members of ployed farmers' organizations in-Western Ausfarmers tralia and South Australia have stated that owing to the failure of the Government to redeem its promises they intend to hold this season's wheat. I do not wish to harass the Government in this connection. I know the difficulty it has had in connection with financial matters; but a determined effort should be made by it to honour its promise. The small area that is being placed under crop this year, and which will be further reduced in the following year, is of more significance than the threatened hold-up of next season's crop. It is the responsibility of Parliament to act promptly in this matter, aud I trust that the motion will receive the support of the Government and a majority of honourable members. H; is very easy for the Minister to say that £3,000,000 is to be made available in connection with the coming season, but based on last year's crop would the farmers to place land under fallow as well as to make purchases to them in taking off the coming crop. In that way additional employment our would be available; more money would be in circulation, not only in the country, but in the cities, and trade geneto rally would be stimulated. The fate of the agricultural industry is largely in the hands of the Government, and in the interests of the nation, it should give immediate effect to the Wheat Advaitces reAct passed last year. It may be advantageous to make a promise with respect' to uext season's crop; but the present position of the wheat-growers^ particularly in the new areas in Western Australia and South Australia, where they have experienced several years of mean drought, is exceedingly precarious. I am hopeful that, as a result of this debate, the Government will make a special effort to see that something is made available to the farmers this year. f the money cannot be advanced through year, the Commonwealth Bank, I think the Government would be justified in issuing bonds up to, say, 6d. a bushel payable nine or ten months. If that were done it would not only tend to increase and make ' a considerable to the number of people emthis year, but would also give the an opportunity to make preparadefinitely tions for next year.  Miuister for Markets) [4.1]--As the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr. Stewart), in submitting his motion, confined his remarks almost entirely to the payment of a guarantee of 3s. a bushel, I do not propose to go very muoh outside that aspect of the question, except to deal with one or two matters incidental to it. The honourable member said-that no definite announcement had been made as to why this payment of 3s. was not made. I cannot understand why the honourable member should say that, because time and again the Prime Minister (Mr Scullin) and I have told the honourable member and the country why the payment was not made. But if it be true that the honourable member does not know the reason for the non-payment, it would have been more generous on his part if he had not in his motion spoken of "" the failure of the Government to provide the 3s."" The honourable member knows perfectly well why the payment was not made. I have the minutes of a deputation, one of many on this subject, introduced to me last week by the honourable member, and on that occasion his words were more generous than they have been today. Speaking of the first Wheat Marketing Bill, he saidJ. may say that 1I have discussed the question through and through with Mr. Moloney, and, in justice to him, I want to say that he did everything that a man could do as Minister in charge of the 4s. bill, to get it through Parliament. He did everything possible in my presence to induce senators the other House opposed to the bill to draw their opposition, and he gave away more than I thought he could do in that endeavour. The suggestion has been made that the Government were not Bincere in reference to that bill. I think that is an unfair charge, as I believe the Government made every endeavour to implement that promise.  the next bill.  be seen that there would have been no need for the next bill if the first had been carried. The farmers would have received, not 3s., but 4s. a bushel. I do not suppose that the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) forgets that he voted and worked against the Wheat Marketing Bill, yet he would have the wheat-growers believe that he stands four-square for them in every effort, made to help them. If the honourable member for Wimmera is really serious about the matter",21
68,Mr STEWART,INTEREST ON SOLDIER,"Is the Minister suggesting that I am not?  giving the honourable member credit for being sincere. He, in turn, I believe, will give me credit for being sincere in my efforts to help the wheat-growers. I have done everything that I could do, and the Prime Minister has dpne everything he could do, to let the farmers know exactly the position of the Government in regard to the 3s. guarantee, and I cannot believe for a moment that there is any great misunderstanding in the minds of the wheat-growers in regard to the matter.",22
69,Mr STEWART,INTEREST ON SOLDIER,"The point is whether the Government intends to honour the guarantee.  honourable member for Wimmera wants the statement to be made again, I have no objection to making it ; but it will be merely telling the wheat-growers what they have been told many times. The honourable member for Wimmera said that the Prime Minister had appealed to the farmers to grow more wheat, and the wheat Government was, therefore, under an obligation to assist them. I said from the beginning, and the Government recognized it, that because the Prime Minister had appealed to the farmers to in grow more wheat it was under an obliwith- gation to them; and in order to give them some recompense for having responded to the Prime Minister's appeal, we introduced our first Wheat Marketing Bill. It embraced what was the definite policy of the Government in regard to wheat, ancl that was to establish a comT pulsory pool. The honourable member for Wimmera was with me in that; he has been generous enough to admit it ; and I also called to a conference other honourable members from all parties in this House. They stood by me throughout all the debates on the bill. To the proposal for a compulsory pool were tacked provisions to provide for a guarantee of 4s. a bushel, and if those provisions had become law, there would have been no further difficulty. The responsibility for any failure to give assistance to the wheat-growers Australia rests, not on the Government, bin. on those senators who rejected the first Wheat Marketing Bill. The Governbeen ment would have been justified in going no further when that bill was defeated, because it represented its definite policy; but., in view of the fact that the farmers were in a very serious plight, and because the Government was anxious to help in the road. iliem, the then Acting Minister for Markets (Mr Eorde), after conferences with wheat-growers and honourable members opposite, brought down another bill, which provided for a payment of 3s. a bushel.  through both Houses.  now the honourable member for Wimmera wants another statement as to why the 3s. was not paid. When the bill was passed, the Acting. Minister went to Commonwealth Bank ancl asked that the advance should be made available.",22
70,Mr LATHAM,INTEREST ON SOLDIER,"Whic h he should have done before.  Minister had, I understand, made perThe sonal representation to the bank. I the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Latham) will listen to me, I cell him exactly what took place.",23
71,Mr LATHAM,INTEREST ON SOLDIER,"I think I have already beard this speech four times.  just what I have been telling the honorhandle. able member for Wimmera. I am saying now what has already been said on several occasions. But, apparently, the honourable member is not satisfied that he has heard ii often enough. It is exactly the ment made in the House by the Prime Minister. When the Acting Minister Markets went to the Commonwealth Bank, the board said that it had received legal advice that, under the Constitution, bank could not be protected against loss if it advanced the money.",23
72,Mr LATHAM,INTEREST ON SOLDIER,"If there was any in the legislation, it must have been in the Commonwealth Bank Act or in the Wheat Act. It could not have been the Constitution.  the Minister consulted the bank, its reply was that its legal advisers expressed doubt of as to the power under the Constitution to protect itself against loss. That position has not altered. It has stated by the Acting Minister for Markets and myself, time and again, and it has been set out by the Prime Minister, I repeat today that the bank would not provide the necessary money on account of constitutional difficulties alleged to be",23
73,Mr STEWART,INTEREST ON SOLDIER,"Not under the Constitution, but under the terms of the act,  the papers relating to the matter upon the table in the Library, in reply to questions asked in another place, and honourable members of this House, as well as the members of another place, have perused the documents, and were thus made fully acquainted with the whole position. That is another answer to the allegation of the honourable member for Wimmera that the a definite statement has not been made.",23

The Government realise! shall that the farmers are in a serious plight, and nobody could be more willing than the Government is to provide all the money that is considered necessary to help the farmers out of their difficulty; but we cannot produce money by turning a",23
75,Mr STEWART,INTEREST ON SOLDIER,"Will the Government pay that £3,000,000 on last year's crop?  representations have been made to the statebanks that the money should be paid with respect to last year's wheat. for That was the unanimous opinion of the conference that was held recently in Melbourne. But those who are prothe viding the money say that they cannot advance it for last year's wheat. Therefore, the Government had no option but defect to accept what it could get. No one knows better than the honourable member for Wimmera that, even after in the bank would not provide the 3s. a bushel, the Government endeavoured to the farmers by other means. As honourable members know, the bill introduced by the Government to provide for a fiduciary uote issue was rejected in another place. Had that bill been passed, the Government proposed under it to raise finance to the extent of £6,000,000 lor the relief of the wheat-growers, £3,500,000 to be paid in the form of a bounty, and £2,500,000 to be distributed among necessitous farmers. After the rejection of that measure, the original Wheat Marketing Bill was re-introduced, and although it did not provide for a guarantee, if it had been passed, as honourable members opposite admitted when [ was discussing the matter with them, it would have enabled the Wheat Board to fix the price of wheat for local consumption which, on the estimate of this season's production, would have provided the equivalent of a bounty of 6d. a bushel. That would have meant Gd. a bushel in addition to the £3,000,000 proposed to be advanced by the banks, so the farmers of Australia would have received an extra Is. a bushel for thoir wheat. But the Wheat Marketing Bill was again rejected by the Senate. When the honourable member for Wimmera spoke of the failure of the Government, he might have tried to show that the responsibility lay at the door who frustrated every attempt by the Government to help the farmers. The first and second wheat marketing bills, and the proposal for a fiduciary currency, were rejected by the Senate.",23
76,Mr STEWART,INTEREST ON SOLDIER,"The proposed fiduciary payment was never before the Senate.  the passage of the Government's fiduciary ^currency proposal depended the fate of the scheme to raise £6,000,000 for the wheat-growers. That fact was definitely stated in this House by the Prime Minister (Mr Scullin). Those three bills were rejected by the Senate, and in regard to the other measure, ferred to by the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Stewart) in submitting his motion today, my reply is that when the Commonwealth Bank was approached for the money, it said that its advice was that it could not constitutionally be protected against loss. I remarked the honourable member at the recent tation which he introduced to me, "" pose you were in my place, and the banks said to you, 'We cannot provide this relieve the position. money,' what would you do in the circumstances,"" and he replied, "" I realise the great difficulty that you are in."" He knows that if he had approached the bank, as the Government had, and if the bank had declined to advance the necessary money, he might have objected, as the Government did; but, when we get down to tin tacks, what further could have been done? The honourable member for Wimmera now has an answer in which the Prime Minister and the Government concur. Everybody can see that it would not be right to build the farmers up with false hopes. They ought to be told definitely, and I wish to make it known to them, that so far as the 33. per bushel is concerned, the position is that the Commonwealth Bank was asked for the money, and it replied that its legal advice was that it should not make it available under the circumstances. I would do anything whatever to relieve the position in which the farmers find themselves today. The honourable member for Wimmera admitted at the deputation that I could not have done more than I have done. of those He has now asked me to make known the present position. My reply is that this Government, in conjunction with the State governments, has asked the banks to do their 'utmost to afford relief, ancl their response is that they will make £3,000,000 available for distribution on the basis of next season's crop. That is the most that we can get at the present time. I only wish the amount was three times as great. My final word is that this Government had a definite policy in regard to this matter, and has done everything humanly possible considering that it has control rein only one house of this legislature. Had we had control in both branches of the Parliament, the legislation that we have brought forward with the object of assisting the farmers of Australia would have been passed, and they would now be much better off. The failure in that to direction must be placed, not at the door depuof the Government, but at the door of Supthose who have frustrated every attempt that has been made by the Government to",24
77,Mr LYONS,INTEREST ON SOLDIER,"""Wilmot) [4.21] - The honourable member for ""Wimmera (Mr Stewart) brought forward and dealt with his motion today in terms to which exception could be taken. He handled the matter ""on purely non-party lines, and made an appeal to the Government to come to the assistance of those whom he directly represents. The Minister f  other hand, has, as usual, grasped the opportunity to make a purely party political appeal. The whole of his time was devoted to that object, and he has failed to make the position any clearer than was before he spoke. Such an utterance will not get us anywhere, nor will it relief to those for whom the honourable member for Wimmera has made his appeal. That honourable member made absomerely lutely and emphatically clear serious difficulties under which the wheat-growers are trying to carry on day. He has shown unmistakably that they are not in a position to undertake the harvesting and marketing of the next crop, and has asked the Government to make the £3,000,000, promised by the banks, available in such a way that the' farmers will be able to harvest and market that crop.",25

80,Mr LYONS,INTEREST ON SOLDIER,"This assistance is it of only a temporary nature, and only touches the fringe of the question. afford The proposition that has been advanced appeals to me, and I believe that it is a practical one. But it is not sufficient to provide £3,000,000 to help the the wheat-growers over a temporary difficulty when the market price of wheat is tobelow the cost of production. We have to do something more than meet the position from crop to crop. Honourable members on both-sides of the House have urged that the wheat-growers be put on a better basis for the future. Since the previous proposals of the Government were discussed, it has appointed a secretariat committee on employment and production, aud that committee has reported on this very question. A f t e r pointing out the serious position of the wheatfor growers-whic h needs no emphasis-the committee declared that while most exindustry was more or less unprofitable at present, it was hoped that much it would contrive to hold out on credit in the hope of future recovery. The reThe possible exception on a large scale is wheat. There is real danger-that the strain no in wheat-growing may be too great. The present position was set out by the £3,000,000 committee as follows:1. The load of debt on the wheat-farmer is so heavy that no probable recovery of wheat prices will enable him to clear it in he any reasonable number of years. 2. There is no immediate prospect of wheat paying for the current costs of production. The future is therefore entirely without for a large proportion of wheat-farmers. suggestion was made that each State should tackle the problem separately, but on uniform lines, and that a small committee should be appointed representmeans ing bankers and mortgage companies, merchants and storekeepers, fertilizer companies, oil companies, and State vernments, to make recommendations MI regard to themeasures that should be mendations made. adopted to deal with the problem that confronts the wheat-growers. also statedTlie necessity for further help will depend largely 0*1 the price realized next season. the price rises to something over 2s. on farm which is not unlikely, it would be just possible for most farmers to hold out eusrierision of interest and postponement depreciation and repairs, but the living lie a very hard one. .

97,Mr MCNEILL,INTEREST ON SOLDIER,"I do not think so. The Wheat Marketing Bill embodied a definite scheme for the marketing and financing of the wheat; the principle of compulsory control, which it contained, is in accordance with the policy of the Labour party.

Every man must recognize that if the primary producers collapse, business people, workers, and all sections of the community will suffer. Therefore, the aim of the Government is to assist the primary producers in every possible way. Had it had a majority in both chambers in the guarantee of 4s. a bushel would have been paid.

102,Mr HILL,INTEREST ON SOLDIER,"The speech of the honourable member was temperate and in good taste; it stated the position fairly. The opinion of the ordinary farmer regarding the Government's promise of n bounty in respect of the next crop is conveyed in the following letter I have recoived from ' Mr W. Dunstone, of Wanurp, via Mitiamo:The announcement that the Federal Government intends to pay the proposed export bounty on wheat on next year's crop has caused consternation among growers in the district, and yesterday I forwarded to you a telegram, setting out their disapproval of such a course. The opinion generally held is that as last year's crop was the one grown in response to the Government's appeal to grow more wheat, and was also the crop on which so many promises were made, and none of which were fulfilled, it is only right that any bounty now proposed should be paid on that, and not on the incoming. crop. . Under the present proposal hundreds of wheat-growers will receive nothing whatever, as the extreme wet at sowing time prevented them from getting any crop in. In this district it is safe to say that not more than 30 per cent, of the crop was sown. It also seems certain that if the bounty is to be paid ou the exportable surplus it will be at least fifteen mouths before it can be paid at all, as it is obvious that the wlieat must be sold before they know what the exportable surplus is. In fact, so fed up arc the growers with the promises of the present Government, that they have made up their minds that if this bounty is to be postponed to next year's crop it will undoubtedly prove another dud which will be about dud No. 4. Under the circumstances, I have been asked to write to you setting out our opinion on the matter, and would like you to let us know whether anything can be done to have the bounty distributed among last year's growers. I support tlic request of the honourable member for ""Wimmera that the bounty be paid on hist year's crop. There is no difficulty in paying a bounty on production, and it could be more easily paid on last year's crop than on that for next, season. If the money were made available on, say. the 1st November, in respect of last year's crop, it would go a long way to pay for cornsacks and-other necessaries to enable the next crop to be harvested. To-day many farmers in all States are in such desperate circumstances that they are unable to purchase cornsacks or other necessary commodities for the next harvest, and they would have appreciated assistance much more this year than in respect of next year's crop.  the honourable member, and so does the Government. There is no difference of opinion on that point. I said I would be prepared to do anything to help the farmers.",27

104,Mr LATHAM,INTEREST ON SOLDIER,But is not wheat being sold today at 2s. 6d. f.o.b. in Australia?,28
105,Mr HILL,INTEREST ON SOLDIER,"As a matter of fact, on the 8th of this month, wheat was selling at 17s. 6d. per quarter in London. On that basis, the net return to the farmer at country railway sidings would be about Is. per bushel. I should like these facts to sink into the minds of honourable members in order that they may realise how desperate is the position of our wheat-growers. The honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Stewart) pointed out that we had just reaped a harvest of 212,000,000 bushels, and he dwelt at some length upon the promise of the Government to pay a guaranteed price of 4s. per bushel. Most of last year's crop has been sold, and, as nearly as we can ascertain, the average price received has been Is. 8d. per bushel, so that, assuming the cost of production to be 4s. per bushel, our growers have lost about 2s. 4d on every bushel reaped. This would amount', in the aggregate, to £23,100,000.",28
106,Mr FROST,INTEREST ON SOLDIER,"If the Government had been permitted to handle the harvest, it would have made a success of its operations.",29
107,Mr HILL,INTEREST ON SOLDIER,"I am convinced that the Government could not have found the money to finance its proposal to pay 4s. per bushel. As a matter of fact, it was unable to operate its later scheme to pay 3s. a bushel, which really was Is. 7^d. per bushel less, because the original proposal provided for 4s. a bushel at country railway stations, whereas the later bill stipulated for the payment of 3s. f.o.b.. which, as I have explained, was really 1s. 7id. below the return to be guaranteed to the farmer under the original sdi erne. It was the duty of the Government, before introducing those measures, to ascertain definitely if finance could bo made available to meet its obligations.  ing Minister for Markets said that ho did take the necessary steps.",29
108,Mr HILL,INTEREST ON SOLDIER,"The Government took no tic tion to find out if the money could be obtained, and, therefore, its proposals were foredoomed to failure.",29
109,Mr GIBBONS,INTEREST ON SOLDIER,"Calare) [4.52] - It has heen urged by opponents of the several legislative proposals of the Government to assist our wheat-farmers that because of defects in the more recent legislation, the Commonwealth Bank was unable to provide the necessary finance; that because of constitutional objections, the bank could not accept responsibility in the matter,",29
110,Mr LATHAM,INTEREST ON SOLDIER,It was because the bill was faulty.,29
111,Mr GIBBONS,INTEREST ON SOLDIER,"I could understand the reluctance of the Commonwealth Bank to undertake financial responsib i l it y in respect of a product that already been sold; no doubt it is this objection that prompted the bank to take up the present attitude. But I cannot dispel from my mind the lurking thought that, in this debate honourable' members opposite wish it to be inferred that the Government is not sincere in its endeavours to help our wheat-growers. failure of the Government-to give effect to-its proposals has been due largely to the legal objections raised by the Deputy Loader of the Opposition (Mr Latham) whose attitude in this chamber profoundly influenced the members of another place in rejecting the bill which provided for the payment of a guaranteed price of 4s. per bushel to our wheat growers. It is, however, significant that the financial policy for which the honourable gentleman and his supporters stand has been abandoned now by almost every European country. The Commonwealth must, if we are to assist our wheat growers, come into line with them. If the fiduciary notes issue proposal had been adopted, it would have been possible for the Government, with the assistance of the banking institutions, to provide the necessary finance to maintain the solvency of our wheat-growers. I am prepared, at all times, to justify the Government with respect to the many measures which it has introduced in the interests of our primary producers. Since the rejection of its original proposal, despite the fact that finance could not be obtained for the payment of a guarantee of 3s. per bushel, the banking institutions of this country are making credit available to the extent of £32,000,000 to maintain the solvency of the nation, and I now submit that, if the Government's original scheme had been adopted, and if credit had been allowed to flow in the ordinary channels of commerce, the actual measure of inflation necessary would have been less than half that which has taken place since then. The policy adopted by the Commonwealth Bank and the private banks is in accordance with the financial ideas of the majority constituting the Opposition in the Senate. The banks have maintained the solvency of our governments to the extent of £50,000,000, but have, at the same time, withdrawn from industry has credit necessary for the maintenance of employment and the solvency of those engaged in our primary avocations. Responsibility for the maintenance of that policy, and for the rejection of the Government's financial proposals, rests with those in this House, and especially with the Opposition in another place. The Had the necessary additional note issue been authorized, it would have been possible for the Government, without unduly straining the credit of the country, to pay our farmers 4s. per bushel for their wheat, 'and so to have assured their solvency. Reference has been made to the' fact, that at a recent meeting of farmers in Bendigo, a resolution was carried in favour of a fiduciary note issue with a view to financing next season's wheat crop. But what is the position today? The British £1 note is worth only 15s. In other words, there has been an inflation of British currency to the extent of 25 per cent. This will affect all sales of Australian primary production. The depreciation of Britisli sterling to the extent of 25 per cent, will increase the purchasing power of those who buy our primary products. If we had departed from the orthodox methods of finance by adopting the scheme outlined in the proposal to pay our wheat growers 4s. per bushel, would not that have increased the purchasing power of our consumers, so that our farmers, and our wool-growers, would have received higher prices for their products? members of the Opposition party, and some members, of the Country party, so far as the guarantee of 3s. is concerned, together with the Senate, must accept responsibility for the position in which our people are today. I am as familiar with the position of our farmers as is any other member of this House. Not long ago, a farmer in my district, when about to commence hay-cutting, applied to the Bural Industries Board for three bales of twine, but because his credit was absolutely exhausted, his application was rejected. The desperate position in which that farmer, in company with thousands more in the various States find themselves, is largely due to the action of members of another place in rejecting this Government's legislative proposals for the maintenance of our credit and the solvency of our people. It is high time that we ceased worshipping this fetish of the gold reserve, the calamitous effects of which have been evident in the Mother Country ever since the House of Commons, in 1925, passed a measure authorizing the return to the gold standard. That measure brought Great Britain, as well as other countries which followed the example of the Mother Country, to a condition bordering on bankruptcy.",29
112,Mr HAWKER,INTEREST ON SOLDIER,"Wakefield) [4.59] The honourable member who has just resumed his seat (Mr Gibbons), has had much to say in criticism of those who were responsible for the rejection of the Government's proposal to pay our farmers a guaranteed price of 4s. per bushel. In that regard I have only to remark that they would have been still better off had the Government been able to honour the other impossible promise of 6s. 6d. per bushel made by the honourable membei' during the 1929 elections. The temperate speech of the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Stewart), and the moderation of his proposals certainly deserve more sympathetic consideration than has been given to them by Ministers .and government supporters. I except the sympathetic reply given by the Minister for Health, but the Minister for Markets seemed to take the attitude that, because two of the colleagues of the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr. The Stewart) voted agaiust the first wlieat pool, the Government was absolved from even considering any proposals emanating from the Country party. For my part, I make no pretence that I ever gave any support to the compulsory pool proposal. When the Government found that the strength of opinion was against , it, there was, in my opinion, an obligation upon it to find other means of helping the farmers. "" I believe that when the Government introduced the Wheat Advances'Bill it made an honest effort to help the farmers. There was, on the whole, a sincere attempt by honourable members in all parts of the House to discover a way by which help could be given to this hard-pressed section of primary producers. While I admit that the Government on that occasion showed some goodwill, ancl a sincere desire to help, I cannot go so far as to say that it went about the matter efficiently. The Minister has stated that there was a consultation between the Government and the Commonwealth Bank Board before the bill was passed. It is evident from the speech of the Minister who introduced the bill just what was the extent of the consultation.",30

This the sort of bungling is merely increasing the and destitution prevailing in the Acting Prime farming districts. I have before me newspaper reports of statements made by the Minister between the 17th December, when the bill was finally passed by both Houses of Parliament, and the time when the measure was finally abandoned by the Government of being amended. During that interval marketing conditions in Australia became chaotic. Nobody knew what was day going to happen.

120,Mr HAWKER,INTEREST ON SOLDIER,"I believe that it would be a better economic proposition for the country to make the money available in such a way as to enable the farmers to keep going. If it is paid on last year's wheat, I am afraid that the great bulk of it will merely go to the farmers' present creditors, and will not help the growers for the future. Of course, in those cases in which the farmers had a good crop last year, but have been unable to sow this year because of floods, it would be not just, but also a good business proposition, to divert a portion of the funds to a payment in respect of last year's crop, so the farmers may have finance for fallowing this spring, and for seeding next year.",32
121,Mr SPEAKER,INTEREST ON SOLDIER,"The honourable member's time has expired. Mr E. RILEY (South Sydney) [5.10]. - The honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Stewart) complained that the Government had made to the v/heat-farmers promises which it did not carry out. I remind honourable members that the Government promised to raise £18,000,000 to relieve distress; £6,000,000 to be allocated to the farmers, and £12,000,000 to relieving unemployment. I represent a city electorate, and I know something of the hardship occasioned by unemployment. There are 110,000 persons on the dole in New South Wales, and the number is increasing. . It is necessary that the Government should obtain money to solve the unemployment, problem, and it is desirable that it should get assistance the banks.",32
122,Mr LATHAM,INTEREST ON SOLDIER,"But the banks cannot deal with that matter. Mr E. RILEY - But they can advance money for the assistance of the farmers. Throughout Australia today there are between 360,000 and 400,000 persons out of work, yet there is no suggestion that the banks should advance money for their relief - I sympathize with the man on the",32
123,Mr LATHAM,INTEREST ON SOLDIER,It would be a great help to Australia if the banks could obtain relief from some governments.,32
124,Mr SPEAKER,INTEREST ON SOLDIER,"Order ! The House is dealing with a motion in respect of the Wheat Advances Act 1930, and I ask honourable members to confine their remarks to that. Mr E. RILEY - The Government promised to provide work for the unemployed. It tried to get the money from the banks for this purpose, and it failed. I do not blame it for that. A bill was passed through this House, and submitted to another place, which rejected it. I am pleased to learn that the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) favours the proposal to issue bonds to help the farmers out of their difficulties. In my opinion, neither the wheat-farmers nor the unemployed can be effectively only helped unless we have an emergency currency. The gold standard has been proved to be a myth. As a matter of fact, we that have had no gold standard for years. The banks oppose the issue of an emergency currency, but there is plenty of wealth in the country to back such an issue. If , at. the present time, I had a property worth £12,000 or £15,000, the banks would probably not advance mo anything on it. They are tying up credit. The farming community is suffering from the same thing, the banks having foreclosed on many farmers, who have been put off their land. There is loud complaint because the fanners have been forced off their land; but. in the cities thousands of persons have been put out of their homes, and are living'in camps. The Government has a responsibility towards these people. We must strike out on new lines. We cannot content ourselves with saying that we have had a conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers, which carried certain resolutions that cannot be put into effect because from the banks will not agree. We are in the midst of a crisis, and must grapple with it, and one way of doing this is to increase the currency issue. If war were declared tomorrow we should not hesitate to do it. If we would be justified in issuing new currency to defend the country, surely now that the country is over-run by a vast army of unemployed, we would be justified in adopting similar measures. land. I know the bad position he is in, and my vote went in favour of giving him a guarantee of 4s. a bushel for his wheat. ""Unfortunately, that projectwas rejected by another place, to its everlasting disgrace. Had that 4s. a bushel been granted and the money put into circulation, the farmer would have benefited, and Austraha would have overcome many of its difficulties.",32
125,Mr MAXWELL,INTEREST ON SOLDIER,"""We had not the 4s. a bushel to pay for the wheat. Mr E. RILEY - It could have been found. It is strange that any honourable member should claim tha^ Australia is too poor to give a guarantee to find a few million pounds to pay for wealth produced by the country. Certain honourable members are too prone to utter jeremiads decrying their country. Had the Labour party a majority in both Houses, 4s. a bushel would have been paid to the farmers. I believe that the primary producers of Australia could be relieved of much of their distress if we expanded our currency and increased the purchasing power of the community. I welcome this motion, because it has ventilated a grievance, but I point out that our farmers are not the only sufferers. There are 400,000 out of employment in the Commonwealth, and in New South Wales alone 110,000 persons are on the dole.",33
126,Mr STEWART,INTEREST ON SOLDIER,"That unemployment results largely from the decreased spending power of the farmers Mr E. RILEY - I agree. Had the 4s. a bushal guarantee been provided, the position of the farmers would have been relieved, and the money placed in circulation, to the benefit of the community generally. It is futile to carry motions such as this if we do not go further and increase the purchasing power of the community, by providing additional currency.  During question time today the Prime Minister (Mr Scullin) stated that he hoped that the sense of honour possessed by the State governments of Australia would be equal to that of the Eederal Government. I hope that it, is superior to it. The outstanding feature of the ministerial statement of policy delivered by the Prime Minister on Wednesday,the 12th March, 1930, was a reference to the development of our primary industries. The right honourable gentleman saidDevelopment of primary industries for the production of exportable wealth and the extension of Australian manufacturing wil l help to balance our external trade and enable us to employ our people' and eventually to maintain a larger population. The Prime Minister went on to sayThe Government devoted much attention to the necessity for stimulating the export of primary producers . . . The Commonwealth Government has invited the State governments to join with it in guaranteeing the growers for the first year 4s. per bushel, payable at country sidings. I hope that honourable members and the people generally will realise that the Commonwealth Government did nof undertake to give the guarantee of 4s. a bushel. It desired to create the most unprecedented position, and make the State governments contribute towards the guarantee. It was because the Minister in charge of the measure refused to relieve the State of Western Australia of the obligation to meet its share of the guarantee to the farmers that the bill was rejected in another place. The promise of this Government to help the Wheat industry was definite, and the need of assistance urgent. The following message was broadcast by the Prime Minister in March of last year. In addition, the States made strong appeals in the matter, and the machinery of the post office was used to give publicity to the request urging farmers to grow more wheat. The right honourable gentleman statedWe must grow more wheat and we. must export more wheat, but if the wheat-growers of Australia a.re prepared to heed appeals to increase the. area under cultivation they are entitled to some guarantee in the matter of price and to asfirances that their wheat will be marketed in a business like way. The Commonwealth Government is offerinc to the wheat-growers a charter. We appeal to them to take it with the price guarantee and the assurance nf business like marketing that go witli it . We also appeal to them earnestly io increase the acreage under production. The «vay in which wheat-growers responded to the call for increased production was mjin-iiiicent. AiJed by a good season, Australia produced a record wheat crop-and the growers accumulated a record debt in the effort. That is the greatest default that has been perpetrated by any parliament in Australia. Despite the appeal of the Prime Minister (Mr. Scullin) t.o the patriotism of the growers, and his admission that the problem is of the utmo3t importance to Australia, the right honourable gentleman is now absent from the chamber. He has left the Min to reply to this motion on behalf of the Government. Honourable members know that the Minister has done nothing but make political capital out, of this matter. He has endeavoured to persuade the people of Australia that his Government could have provided a guarantee of 4s. a bushel, but although the necessary legislation had been passed, it could not provide 3s. a bushel for the farmers. It was claimed that there was a technical fault in the Wheat Advances Act. Why u-iis it not rectified? l'hu Governmeut also refused to assist the wheat-farmers by putting into operation the carefully planned scheme evolved by Professor Perkins of South Australia, which provided for a sales tax on flour consumed in the Commonwealth. That scheme, which could have been put into operation promptly and effectively, was rejected. The Government has done nothing to fulfil its promises to the farmers. Ou the other hand, it has, ckrough the medium of tariff schedules, loaded them with staggering burdens. Hitherto, the farmers have been mulcted in order to provide for the people of the .cities. To-day the farmers have nothing: consequently there is much unemployment in the metropolitan areas. The man ou the land is over-burdened, 30 our cities are languishing. Yet the Government persists in placing further penalties upon the farmers to provide profits for Lysaght Limited and such concerns, while it neglects to fulfil its promises to our primary producers. No other government in the world has been gniJij' of more disgraceful conduct'.",33
127,Mr A GREEN,INTEREST ON SOLDIER,"Kalgoorlie-Post master-General) [5.26] - I have only a few minutes at my disposal. I marvel at the attitude of honourable members opposite who prevented the Government from providing a guarantee of 4s. a bushel, and have thwarted every other effort on the part of the Government to help the wheat-farmers. The honourable member  Although the Government declared that it could provide 4s. a bushel for wheat in the early part of 1930, it was unable to find 3s. a bushel in December of that year. The reason is that early in 1930 wheat was bringing from 4s. to 4s. 6d, a bushel, whereas in December it had; dropped to 2s. 6d. a bushel. I cannot, understand why honourable members opposite persist in nullifying'the efforts of the Government on behalf of a community so worthy of assistance. I fully believe that the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr. Stewart) is sincere in his desire to help the farmers, but it must be recognized that it is quite impossible to persuade the Commonwealth Bank to provide 3s. a - bushel for wheat at this juncture. The Government has exploited every avenue in an endeavour to assist the farmers. It introduced a Fiduciary Notes Bill. Honourable members opposite found fault with that. They know very well that it was no wildcat scheme, but that it would have returned a tenfold benefit to aud indirectly assisted many unemployed workers in Australia. The Government is on the eve of making another endeavour to assist the wheat-farmers. It realizes that the scheme will not do half as much as is needed, but it is the best that can be done now. One great drawback is that prices have fallen disastrously. I am confident that when they are restored to something like normal, Australia will hark back 'to the good times. Until then, our path will continue to be bestrewn with difficulties. All should do their utmost honestly to assist the farmers and the - country generally.

Postponed item 176 F 1By omitting the whole of sub-item, (F ) and inserting in its stead the following sub-item:"" (f ) (I ) Machines and machinery, n.e.i., ad val., British, 55 per cent.; termediate, US per cent.; general, 75 per cent."" ^ The CHAIRMAN (Mr MCGRATH) For the convenience of the committee, item 176 F 1 "" Machines and machinery, n.e.i."", and item 178 D, "" Motive power machinery and appliances except electric "", will be considered together, but the votes will be taken separately.",37
141,Mr FORDE,NEW SOUTH WALES,"Capricornia-Minister for Trade aud Customs) [5.31] - The duties recommended in each of these cases are similar. The duties on the machinery covered by sub-item 176 F 1 were 45 per cent., 55 per cent, and 60 per cent.' uuder the 1921-28 tariff, and those now proposed are 55 per ceit., 65 per cent, and 75 per cent., respectively, the increases thus being 10 per cent. British and intermediate, and 15 per cent, general. The additional imposts have been designed for the purpose of rehabilitating one of our principal key industries which has fallen on very evil times, The engineering industry has never been in such a perilous condition since the inception of federation, and as it is of very great importance to Australia, it is desirable that it should be afforded adequate protection. Whenever a depression occurs the engineering industry is the first to be hit hard. The history of the present depression shows that the first section of industry to--be adversely affected is that which has to do with capital costs. The installation of machinery is, of course, capital expenditure involved in establishing a factory. Machinery production is essentially concerned in capital costs. The conditions that have been created by the tariff are such that with the upward trend of prices, due to a trade recovery, there should be a considerable expansion TARIFF. in machinery manufacturing in Australia. The upward trend in the prices of our exportable products will make more money available for industry, and this will enable manufacturers to buy machinery. An examination of the conditions of the machinery trade, even during the depression, shows that machinery manufacturers have received orders for aconsiderable quantity of machinery which will be needed for the manufacture of goods which have been granted adequate protection. Take, for example, the manuinfacture of wireless sets. The prohibition of the importation of wireless sets into Australia has caused great activity in thrlocal factories which manufacture these sets, and they have placed orders for the machinery they need to turn out sets to meet the demand. The tariff has definitely enabled machinery manufacturers to widen their range of designs and types of. machinery. As the result of my inspection of many factories throughout Australia, I have learned that manufacturers generally are well satisfied with the efficiency of Australian-made machines. The average man in the street has no conception of the wide range of machinery that is being manufactured in Australia. It was a revelation to me to find that such a high percentage of the machinery in operation in our factories has been made here. The granting of adequate protection to the engineering industry must have an immediate effect on other key industries, such as the coal, iron and steel, copper and - timber industries, all of which are closely allied to our engineering enterprises, and depend on them, to a large extent, for prosperity. The engineering industry as a whole has been subjected to very keen competition by overseas manufacturers. A large amount, of the work obtained by engineering establishments throughout the Commonwealth of late years has been secured as the result of the policy adopted hy government departments, semi-government bodies, and municipal councils of granting a measure of preference to local tenderers when deciding to' let contracts. The preferences accorded have usually, amounted to from 5 per cent, to 15 per cent, over and above the duty payable under the tariff. This policy is'very patriotic. That additional desree of preference has frequently made all the difference in determining whether particular work would be done in the Commonwealth or overseas. number of establishments have been kept supplied .with work on account of the additional preference extended to them in this way by government bodies. But owing to the curtailment of loan moneys, government expenditure throughout Australia has been reduced to a minimum, with the result that our engineering establishments have been affected more than any others. It is now essential that this industry should obtain orders fro m private firms which, in the past, have, in a large number of cases, shown a distinct apathy towards the local metal working trade when they have required machinery for the extension of their factories or for replacement purposes. This disinclination on the part of private enterprise to purchase its requirements fro m local machinery manufacturers is not new. It has been our experience, unfortunately, that while certain private firms desire 100 per cent, protection in respect of their f roducts, they also wish to be free uy the equipment for their factories any country in the world. Mr M . CAMKHON - To what'firm s the Minister referring?",38
142,Mr FORDE,NEW SOUTH WALES,"It has been the practice for manufacturers generally to adequate protection for their products, and for freedom to buy their machinery in Germany, the United States of portion America, or any other foreign country. Many firms have shown a complete per cent, to 30 per cent. ignorance of the fact that much of the machinery that they required could produced in Australia. Often manufacworkmen. turers have learned only when they have applied for the admission of certain machinery under departmental by-law, that three or four Australian engineering firms could provide their requirements, and have been manufacturing such machinery for a number of years. The Tariff Board, in its annual report 1927, commented upon .this subject in the following words:A situation that has come the unreadiness of many Australian manufacturers to use locally-made goods. If Germany protected by the tariff, the local manufacturer Other countries of the secondary product has little cause for complaint if the materials and machinery he uses enjoy the protection of a duty. The former Prime Miinster, Mr Bruce, in addressing manufacturers in July, A large 1929, said that he found "" a great number of partial free traders-gentleme n who wanted the utmost protection for all they sold and free trade for all they bought."" The right honourable gentleman continuedI ask you, are you as sound protectionists in regard to machinery as in regard to the things you want to sell? I am amazed at the number of applications from manufacturers for the concessional introduction of machinery. Mr Bruce was Minister for Trade and Customs for about twelve months, and was conversant with the apathy shown by many Australian manufacturers to the welfare of the Australian engineering industry. There has always been a tendency to place machinery orders abroad. With manufacturers who will not support local industries, the current of protection flows in one direction only. It is useless to appeal to them to change their policy, particularly as a 5 per cent, or 10 per cent, difference in price in favour of an overseas machine has, in a to large number of cases, been a sufficient in , reason for them to refuse to patronize the local industry. The only method by is which they can be brought to a realization of their duty to other Australian industries is to increase the duty and compel them to support the local ask for machinery manufacturers. In the engineering industry the proof labour to material is very high, the approximate average ratio being 70 The industry, therefore, offers potential employment to be a large number of skilled Australian The skill and efficiency of the Australian artisan is beyond question, and the Government, therefore, feels that it is incumbent upon it to take such measures as will provide work for them. The following is a summary of the importation statistics for the yeare 1928-29 and 1929-30, from the point of for view of the country of origin: 1023-29. 1929-30. £ t United Kingdom .. 1,414,907 .. 1,215,911 under notice is United States of America 1,054,540 1,025,220 .. 201,373 . . 297,008 143,767 148.847 Totals 2,874,587 2,686,986 Of the total value of importations for 1928-29, £1,492,153 worth, or more than 50 per cent., was admitted under by-law at British , free, or general, 10 per For 1929-30 the total importations were valued at £2,6S6,986.",39
143,Dr FABLE PAGE,NEW SOUTH WALES,What do those figures include?,40
144,Mr FORDE,NEW SOUTH WALES,"Machiner y covered by item 176 * 1. Motor cars are not included. The value of the machinery admitted under by-law in 1929-30 was £1,163,636, or 43.3 per cent, of the total. These figures indicate that when definite evidence is produced that necessary machinery cannot be commercially manufactured in the Commonwealth, the Minister does not hesitate to exercise the power conferred upon him by Parliament to admit it at concessional rates of duty. On the basis of the 1929-30 importations, after deducting the value of machinery admitted under by-law, there existed a potential market for Australian machinery manufacturers to the value of £1,500,000. Through the imposition of these increased rates of duty the Government trusts that this trade will be diverted to the Australian engineering industry. With respect to item 178 o, "" motive power machinery and appliances, excepting electric,"" the duties were increased from 45 per cent. British, 55 per cent, intermediate, 60 per cent, general, to 55 per cent. British, 65 per cent, intermediate, and 75 per cent, general. importatio7is under this heading in 192829 totalled £1,048,3S6, and in 1929-30, £1,139,290. This sub-item now includes goods previously covered by subitems 178 B and 378 c of the 1921-28 tariff. These goods comprise cylindrical boilers, water tube boilers, furnaces for boilers, gas producers, steam condensers, and ships' propellers. From an analysis of the importation figures, it has been ascertained that, of the total value of importations for 1928-29, machinery to the value of £248,089 was admitted under departmental by-law either free of duty or at a duty of 10 per cent. This figure represents 26 per cent, of the value of total importations. For the year 1929 the value of the machinery admitted under by-law was £390,374, representing 34.2 per cent, of the total value of the importations. These figures indicate that the by-law provisions of the tariff are sympathetically administered, when it can cent. be shown that machinery of the type under consideration cannot be commercially manufactured in Australia. If an importer applies to the Minister or to the Comptroller-General of Customs with respect to importations, an officer of the Department of Trade and Customs is instructed to ascertain whether machinery of the type j>roposed to be imported can be manufactured in Australia. If that oflicer finds that it. can be commercially manufactured in the Commonwealth, he submits a report; to that effect to the tariff branch. Mr ARCHDATJO PAKKMILI. - What is meant by "" commercially manufactured "" I",40
145,Mr FORDE,NEW SOUTH WALES,"The honourable member  well as I do what is meant by those words. The head of the tariff branch of the Customs Department then submits a re-1 commendation to the Minister, stating whether in his opinion such machinery sliould. be admitted under departmental by-law, or whether the duties stipulated under the tariff should be imposed. In view of the substantial quantity of the machinery, admitted under departmental by-laws, it should be evident to honourable members that a sympathetic view is taken with respect to such importations without in any way depriving Australian manufacturers of the protection which Parliament intends should be afforded to them. The A f t e r deducting the value of the machinery admitted under departmental by-laws for 1929-30, a total of 748,000 remains. As j M s machinery can be manufactured in the Commonwealth, the Government has imposed the increased rates with the intention of forcing purchasers to obtain their requirements in the Commonwealth. As previously mentioned, it requires, in a large majority of cases, an increase of 10 per cent, or 15 per cent, the in the rates to divert this trade to the Australian engineering industry, which the Government is determined to do. As the ex-Prime Minister, Mr Bruce, said to a gathering of Australian manufacturers in 1929, while many of these people require adequate protection for the commodities they manufacture, they are prepared to absolutely disregard the Australian manufactures of the goods they require for their own equipment. 1 trust that this item will receive the support of a majority of the committee.",40
146,Dr EARLE PAGE,NEW SOUTH WALES,"Covyper) [5.50] I am. glad to learn that it is the intention of the Minister (Mr Forde) to include the discussion of this subitem, which relates to motive power machinery and appliances with machinery included in other sub-items, as I am thus afforded an opportunity to test the feelings of the committee on the question of extending greater preference to Great Britain. Everything that the Minister has said indicates the wisdom of dealing with this item in the manner that I shall indicate in an amendment which I intend to move. If that amendment is carried, it will force the Government. to re-classify all these sub-items, and will thus ensure that machinery of the type covered is really being manufactured commercially in Australia. If , it is not, it should be placed in a separate item instead of being grouped in what may be termed a nondescript collection. The Minister said that during the year 192S-29 roughly 43 per cent, of the machinery imported into Australia under sub-item 176 r was admitted into Australia free of duty. That is to say, that the Customs Department, after carrying out the fullest investigation, admitted that the equipment was not being manufactured in this country. A careful investigation of the whole position would show that fully one-half of the remaining 57 per cent, should also have been admitted free of duty for the same reason*, that should be dont if Australian industries are to be cheaply and efficiently equipped. I hope the committee will adopt the amendment I propose to move, under which the rates would be 25 per cent. British, 55 per cent, intermediate, and 60 per cent, general, instead of the existing rates of 55 per cent. British, take the lead. 65 per cent, intermediate, and 70 per cent, general. The adoption of that amendment would necessitate a rewas classification of these sub-items. Mr Forde.:-The adoption of the rates suggested by the right honourable member would mean imposing lower duties than existed under the 1923-28 tariff.",41
147,Dr EARLE PAGE,NEW SOUTH WALES,"I am satisfied, from my own investigation, that, in view of the peculiar circumstances which have since arisen, this Parliament must reduce the duties in the interests of the Commonwealth and of Great Britain. What is the present position in Great Britain ? It is one of great difficulty. ' Great Britain has been forced off the gold standard, and is experiencing great trouble in providing employment for over 2,000,000 persons in that country now out of work. Great Britain can speedily be placed upon a better economic basis by those units which comprise the British Empire diverting to Great Britain the maximum volume of trade that is possible at this juncture. Not only can Great Britain be assisted out of her present difficulties, but I venture to assert that, by the adoption of the proposal I am now submitting with respect to the duties on machinery, the dominions and other por tions of the Empire can also be assisted to overcome the financial and economic problems now confronting them. The British Empire, which controls one-quarter of the world's services and has one-quarter of the world's population within its territory, produces 70 per cent, of the total production of gold, 60 per cent, of rubber, 47 per cent, of tin, and 90 per cent, of nickel, as well as immense quantities of other raw materials. The British Empire, while endowed with such magnificent resources in the matter of raw materia^ finds herself short of £100,000.000 worth of gold to meet her external short-term indebtedness. We must develop and manufacture customs machinery required by the whole of the Empire, in order to utilize the resources of the Empire, and thus ensure that in each of the dominions, especially in Australia, we have the machinery to enable them to utilize these resources to the best possible advantage.",41
148,Mr GIBBONS,NEW SOUTH WALES,Grea t Britain should,41
149,Dr EARLE PAGE,NEW SOUTH WALES,"Grea t Britain the leader of the great industrial revolution, and is one of the principal producers of metals and machinery. Her scientists and inventors have been the leaders in practically all the mechanical development that has taken place throughout the world. In Australia we need cheap and efficient mechanical equipment, and we can get it. The figures quoted by the Minister show conclusively that we have to import a great deal of the machinery required in (.his country. An extraordinary feature af the figures quoted is that for many years the quantity of machinery n.e.i. has remained practically stationary, showing that a continual market is developing for this particular class of machinery in Australia that is not covered by local manufacture. The inclusion of items J74, 404, 405 and '219 in the schedule was made to - ensure that particular types not manufactured commercially .in Australia shall be admitted free of duty. That principle is recognized in our customs tariff, and I am now suggesting that we shall carry out the principles to the fullest possible extent. What is the position with respect to the importation of machinery? Very high duties are im- f posed, and as a result only those articles which are not being commercially manufactured in Australia are imported. Yet in 1929-30 we imported no less than £.14,730,000 worth of machinery.",41
150,Mr FORDE,NEW SOUTH WALES,"Unde r what items? , Dr EARLE PAGE - I am referring --- the value of the whole of the machinery imported, as set out in the customs figures and classification. If we dissect the figures we find that of the £10,600,000 imported under one group, Great Britain secured only 34 per cent, of the trade, but of the £4,069,000 worth under another group she secured 81 per cent, of the trade. I am satisfied that if our tariff schedule were amended in the direction I suggest Great Britain would receive a decided advantage ancl would be able materially to increase her proportion in that big group of which she now only receives 34 per cent. shall point out shortly how the position could be materially improved tinder this particular item. Although the figures from which I am quoting are not so complete as those which the Minister used, I find that the total importations of machinery in 1928-29 were valued at C1,80S:000, of which Great Britain supplied £853,000 ajuj foreign countries fO.'.S.OOO.",42
151,Mr BEASLEY,NEW SOUTH WALES,The right honourable gentleman should mention the type of machinery to which he is referring.,42
152,Dr EARLE PAGE,NEW SOUTH WALES,"Althoug h 45 per cent, of that trade was obtained by Greai Britain, I believe that, under a revised tariff schedule, fully one-half of the r-' uiainder could also be supplied by the Mother Country. In this belief I am supported by the opinion of British manufacturers, who contend that by an amendment of the tariff they could obtain a large proportion of the trade. It is quite evident that some of this machinery has been manufactured in Australia only because it has been too costly to import it ; but as I previously stated, the value of importations has not varied to any extent, year by year. There is every reason that at this particular junctunwe should endeavour to give Great Britain the maximum share of our trade, l i . 1927-28 the total importations under thh particular item, so far as I have been able to gather, were valued at £1,559,000, of which Great Britain supplied £840,000 worth, iind foreign countries £719,000 worth, as compared with the subsequent year in which Great Britain supplied £853,000 worth and foreign countries £955,000 worth. In that, period Greas Britain's exports of machinery to Australia decreased from over 50 per cent to less than 45 per cent. When 1 came to examine the items I found that in 3927-98 there vyas admitted free of duty £332,000 worth of machinery out of Great Britain's contribution of £840,000 : and £265,000 worth out of .€7.19,000 worth imported from foreign countries-, and that the duty paid totalled well over 50 pgr cent, on the remainder. What is the result? This machinery was nol really competing with ordinary Australian machinery. It had to be bought overseas; but, as a result of these high I duties, such machinery installed in Australian shops has actually been overcaj)italized to the extent of 50 per cent. The effect has been to increase production costs generally and the cost of establishing new industries. It has also mean) an increase in the prices at. which good? generally can be. sold in Australia. Mr FdBDEi^-If a maehine cannot be Commercially manufactured in Australia it is admitted free of duty.",42
153,Dr EARLE PAGE,NEW SOUTH WALES,"The honourable  will produce correspondence between manufacturers, importers of certain machines and the Customs Department, showing the real value of the phrase, "" Commercially manufactured in Australia "". He will show that the Customs Department, after a year's argument, has allowed single machines to come in duty free to serve as patterns for the development of new industries in Australia, thus admitting the previous impossibility of making these machines commercially in Australia. Otherwise there would have been no justification for its ultimate surrender.",43
154,Mr FORDE,NEW SOUTH WALES,It shows how fair the department is when further .investigation proves that Australian manufacturers cannot make a particular type of machine.,43
155,Dr EARLE PAGE,NEW SOUTH WALES,"I am not discussing the fairness or otherwise of the customs officials. I am arguing that the officials and the Government-and not' merely this Governmeut, because the figures I am quoting relate also to the period when the Bruce-Page Government was in power-shoul d not be put in an unfair position in regard to these matters. There should be a proper reclassification of the items so that the attitude of the customs officials should be perfectly clear to every one, and if Australian manufacturers could successfully establish their claim to be able to manufacture certain machines commercially in Australia, they could have special items in the tariff schedule protecting their machines. That would be the right way to manage the business. The present system puts an undue and unjustifiable strain upon the intelligence, ability, and capacity of the Minister for Trade and Customs and his staff. In this connection I am speaking of governments in general. The more I have seen of the matter, the more I am satisfied that this change should have been made earlier, and the more I regret that the late Government did not do what T am now advocating. It did take steps to make certain goods duty free under by-law. What I am saying now is not in condemnation of the Government or the officials; I am merely indicating what I think should be done. When we find that n course we have been following is unduly penalizing the industries of Australia by piling up their costs, it is useless to continue upon it, particularly at a time when prices are falling. I find that in 1927-28 the duty collected on machines, omitting those that have been admitted duty free, or at 10 per cent, under by-law, was approximately from 50 to 60 per cent. In two years for which I took out the figures the value of machinery imported amounted to from £5,000,000 to £6,000,000, and in one year the total importation of machines aud metals from Great Britain was £4,572,000.",43
156,Mr GIBBONS,NEW SOUTH WALES,Throug h Great Britain.,43
157,Dr EARLE PAGE,NEW SOUTH WALES,"The Customs Department is quite capable of seeing that the law is obeyed in that direction.  Trade and Customs, he made certain that goods purporting to be British would be British in fact, by insisting that 75 per cent, of the value must be of British origin. Of the total value of £4,572,000 worth of goods imported from Britain in the year of which I am speaking, £1,226,000 worth was imported duty free, leaving £3,300,000 worth on which over 50 per cent, duty was paid. In the last seven years approximately £100,000,000 worth of machinery has been imported to establish and equip new industries in Australia with capital plant. The Labour party talks about the adverse trade balance. If it would look at the page of the Commonwealth Year-Book on which the trade figures are given, it would find that the Statistician says that the adverse trade balance is largely offset by the introduction of private capital due to the establishment of new industries because of the protective policy which was being pursued during the period of which I am speaking. The adverse trade balance is really more than covered by the new machinery imported, which as the Statistician points out, has not yet had the opportunity to produce exports commensurate with ii> capital cost. Nor could we expect ii to do so immediately. The additional capital eost of installing thif machinery in Australia over its actual cost in the country of origin' was £45,00.0,000, leading naturally to an increase in the cost of goods generally. extra transport charges, and extra wages. I should like to illustrate the point by quoting some figures relating to the export mutton trade. This is one of our greatindustries, and. one we must extend, yet, because of the increase in the general cost of living, as the result of the over-capitalization of our industries by the imposition of these high duties, the cost of exporting mutton has increased by 6G per cent, since pre-war years, making it almost impossible for the man who is growing sheep to carry on an export trade at a profit. It is worthwhile to try to ascertain how the increase in cost has been brought about. Not long ago Mr Tout, speaking in Sydney, pointed out that the cost of shipping 32,000 sheep from the station to London was £3,668, or 6s. 3-^d. per carcass, in 1914. whereas in 3.930 the cost was £6,15S, or 10s. 3d. per carcass, an increase of 66 per cent. The details are exceedingly interesting, and are also relevant to the other item which the Minister is including in this discussion. They are set, out in the following table:Railage' 1 8 Wages of slaughtermen and drovers, abattoirs fees . . 0 5J Freezing, freight and insurance 4 0 Total 6 1}",43
158,Mr BERNARD CORSER,NEW SOUTH WALES,How does the honourable member connect his remarks with the tariff?,44
159,Dr EARLE PAGE,NEW SOUTH WALES,"The machinery used in freezing works is charged ihe exorbitant duty of 50 per cent. Tariff Board has reported that locomotives made in Australia cost 20 per cent, more than the imported locomotives, on which duty has been paid. One of the causes of this high cast is the high c-obt of installing machinery in the various shops which turn out locomotives. Throughout the whole gamut of costs generally we find that they are increased by reason of the fact that the capital cost of the machinery installed to make goods for general use in Australia, whether for export or local consumption, has been enlarged, and as the result the costs are ever so much higher. Afr. BERNARD CORSER - A good deal of that machinery has been here for years.",44
160,Dr EARLE PAGE,NEW SOUTH WALES,"Some of it has been here for years, but much of it has to be renewed every year. Otherwise, why should it be necessary to impon £42,000,000 worth of machinery and manufactured metals, and pay such a heavy duty upon it , when there was a reduction of imports generally amounting to £20,000,000 ? Why should the Ministei have admitted 43 per cent, of the importations duty free? He did so because there was no chance of having it manufactured in Australia. I come now to consider the effect on employment. In 1922-23, 43 meat factories, employing 4,820 hands, gave an added value of £1,900,000 to output. In 1930, there were only 33 factories, employing 3,178 hands, giving an added value to their output of £1,387,000. This morning's Sydney Morning Herald 1914. 1930. pointed out that in 1930 there were in Sydney 919 more factories than there Per Head. Por Head. were in 1929, yet there were 29,000 more men out of work.

161,Dr EARLE PAGE,NEW SOUTH WALES,"What is the position in Great Britain ? Does that country try to make all itfo machinery and machine tools? It will be found that Great Britain imports 43 per cent, of its machine tools, because it does not pay ii The to specialize in those particular lines. In the year before last Germany sent 6,263 tons of machine tools into Belgium, 7,193 tons into Great Britain, and 11,854 tonf into Erance. Even a highly protectionist country like France is not foolish enough to put a burden on its own back in the way Australia is doing by increasing unnecessarily the capital cost of its mechanical equipment.",44
162,Unknown,NEW SOUTH WALES,Sitting suspended from 6.15 to S p.m.,44
163,Dr EARLE PAGE,NEW SOUTH WALES,"In looking through the tariff, one sees the need for a complete reclassification of the duties. instance, there is a duty of 60 per cent, cm die heads. Nobody makes die heads in Australia, yet dies should he made here as cheaply as possible. blacksmiths' hammers, a special steel is required, and it does not pay to make them in Australia, yet the heavy duty of 60 per cent, is imposed on them. On brickmaking machinery there is an impost of 65 per cent. No doubt a reduction of that duty would bring down the cost of bricks and the cost of houses and so stimulate the building trade. A plant costing £51,000 at a European port was required in Australia for the purpose of converting coal into fuel oil. We do not produce oil at the present, time, aud the plant to which I refer was a complete one, yef an average duty of 60 per cent, was imposed, because certain parts of the plant could be made in Australia. Owing to those heavy duties that industry has not been established, and a tremendous economic waste continues. On a great proportion of the imported machine tools used in Australia high rates of duty are charged, despite the fact that there is a special provision in the tariff for admitting, them duty free if they cannot bp commercially made in this country, and it is not possible to convince the Minister that they cannot be made here economically. Many articles that are admitted practically duty free at the present time could be made here commercially if the necessary machinery for their manufacture were allowed in free of duty. The honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Yates) referred to certain stamping machinery, and pointed out that a statement by men who had not seen that type of machinery that it could be commercially made in Australia had prevented the establishment of a local industry. The object of the amendment that I am about to submit i.s to extend tariff preference to Givat Britain, to a much greater degree than has been possible in the past, hy reducing the British preferential ruth. That would force a reclassification nf the series of sub-items with which rhe committee is now dealing. If an article could be made in Australia, it should be put into a special class for duty purposes, and Eor articles that cannot be made commercially in this country should be admitted duty free. I move That the paragraph be amended by adding Eor the following:""And on and after 1st October, 1031 (1) Machines and Machinery, n.e.i., ad val., British, 25 per cent.; intermediate, 55 per cent.; general, 60 per cent."".  I support the amendment. It seems to me that these duties, which were too high, before, and which will be still higher if the rates in the schedule are agreed to, are the last that should be increased at the present time. If there is one thing that should be as cheap as possible in Australia it is the machinery of production, whether in the factory or on the farm, because it is highly desirable that the overhead costs of manufacture and production should be kept as low as possible. When a new enterprise is started in Australia) and a person wishes to manufacture goods which have never been made here before, he naturally look's - round for the best type of machinery for the purpose, but he is tremendously handicapped, in many cases, by the Customs Department, lltbegins with the initial handicap of having to pay a good deal more than is charged in any other country for the cement ti - jed in the floor of his factory, for the glass in the windows, and for the iron nn the roof. On proceeding to install his machinery, he finds, possibly, that Groat Britain is the best place in which to buy the particular plant required, or, if his purpose be to establish a fruit-canning factory, for example, he may find that the United States of America is the only country in which efficient machinery of the desired type can be obtained. Then, because a particular engineer who has probably never seen such a plant before, and could not guarantee that a similar plant made in Australia would work satisfactorily, declares that Such a machine could be produced iii this country, the business man has to choose between a plant which could not be guaranteed to work satisfactorily and an imported plant on which the duties are -5 5 per cent. British preferential, 65 per cent, intermediate, and 75 per cent. general. The heavy duty on machinery able part of their catch. has brought about the failure of many an enterprise that should have resulted in the establishment in Australia of a new industry. I shall give a crete illustration.",45
164,Mr KEAITE,NEW SOUTH WALES,"It is not the fault of present Government.  marks by saying that these high duties were too high previously, and the Governsatisfactorily ment which the honourable member supbe ports is making matters worse by seeking to raise them still higher. The fishmeal industry nourishes in Europe. In Germany, so much of this material is used for stock food that local supply is insufficient to meet mand, about 100,000 tons being imported annually. I understand that this meal is made from the cheaper classes of fish, and also from fish offal. Proposals for the establishment of the fishmeal inplant dustry were made recently in, I believe, more than, one State, but they have abandoned, owing to the particular duties which we are now discussing, despite fact that the makers of the plant required- a British firm-were prepared to take three-fourths of the payments fishmeal, which could have beeu exported after the plant was in operation. Yet, we have such a distorted sense of probe portion, apparently, that we throw away a mackerel to catch a sprat. In order to provide a little temporary employhave ment for a few men in the engineering trade, we lose an opportunity for the establishment of an industry which would provide work for a larger number price of persons - Owing to the general de- £3,150. pression, the fishing industry is in straits. A considerable section of the public are now unable to purchase fish, being compelled to depend on cheaper forms of food, and the demand for fish has fallen off to such an extent that fishermen have been forced to restrict their catches. If the fishmeal industry were now in existence-and I claim that tax of 6 per cent., £434. it would have been established, had the tariff in. respect of the machinery quired been administered in a sane .landing way-thos e fishermen who find difficulty in making a living today would have had an additional outlet for a considerwould Those who contemplated establishing the industry required a plant capable of processing 25 ton3 of fishmeal conper day. They approached the Customs Department, and asked whether they the would be permitted to bring the plant in from Great Britain duty free. They stated that they believed that such a had never been made in Australia before, while it was being manufactured in Great Britain, and could guaranteed to give the desired results. The cost of the plant f.o.b. Great Britain was £3,150, and it was capable of processing 25 tons of fishmeal daily. The Customs Department made inquiries, the and it wasascertained that certain the deengineering firms in Australia were of the opinion that they could make some parts of this plant, such as elevators and so forth. Naturally, the British makers were not prepared to guarantee that the would work satisfactorily unless they provided the whole of the parts; been nobody could blame them for that. A good deal of correspondence ensued be the tween the promoters of the enterprise and the Customs Department, but I shall not weary the committee by reading the in letters. The department held the view that as some parts of the plant could be made in this country, duty would have to paid ou it if it were obtained from Great Britain. I shall show the committee what the increased price would been if the present duties of 55 per cent., 65 per cent., and 75 per cent, on "" Machinery n.e.i. "" had been paid. I have already remarked that the f.o.b. of the plant in Great Britain was Freight and insurance would sore have amounted to £588; the duty under the British preferential rate of 55 per cent., £1,906; the primage duty of 10 per cent., £346; the duty of 20 per cent, on the cost of packing, £30; the landing ' and delivery charges, £75; the exchange at 30£ per cent., £1,140; and the sales That would have brought the total cost to £7,669. reSome of these items, such as insurance, and delivery charges, would have been the same if the plant had beeu admitted duty free. Part of the sales tax have been charged, but it would not have amounted to nearly so much if these duties had not been imposed, because the sales tax is assessed on the total cost, including all the duties. The price that the plant would have cost was so great that the project for the manufacture of fishmeal in Australia was abandoned. I believe that the dried fish weighs only about one-fourth of the raw material; therefore, about 100 tons of fish would have been required daily to produce 25 tons of fishmeal.",46
165,Mr KEANE,NEW SOUTH WALES,"Why cannot the necessary plant be made in Australia?  that certain parts could be made here, if the specifications were given. But specifications could not be supplied. It was known that a plant capable of producing 20 tons of fishmeal daily was required, but they did not know the exact measurements of""the machine. Strangely enough, the Department of Trade and Customs would not permit them to import one plant so that it might be copied by Australian engineers, and thus make possible the building of further plants in Australia. The following letter was written to the Controller-General of Customs on the 6th July last by the firm who desired to import this machine:We desire to acknowledge receipt of letter dated 2nd instant, and to request we be informed as to reasons which have caused the Minister to refuse our application. The correspondence submitted by us discommittee. closes that this plant is not, and, under present conditions of small demand, cannot be, commercially made in Australia. The number plants which might be used in this country would not be sufficient to reimburse local manufacturers for their preliminary expenses, such as the cost of patterns, dies, & c , repay the cost of drawings provided by seas manufacturers. Moreover, a first Australian-made plant could hardly be completed in less than eighteen months, and meanwhile large numbers of men would continue to suffer unemployment. Moreover, the number of men employed in principle manufacturing the plant in Australia would comparatively few-probabl y not more thantwenty, which figure bears no comparison the number of fishermen , and operators which these plants would give employment. Under the circumstances, it is difficult understand the decision of the Minister, specially in view of the anxiety of the present Government to relieve unemployment and to* create new industries, and the attitude Minister in this direction would not appear to compare favourably with that of the British manufacturers of this plant, who have expressed their willingness to accept cent, of their payment-sprea d over a considerable period-fro m the proceeds of the sale of fishineal in Great Britain produced by the plant. That is one of the most glaring examples that could be quoted to show the folly and the short-sightedness of the policy that apparently is heing adopted by the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr. Eorde) in connection with the admission of plant that is required by a new industry in Australia. I could add illustration to illustration; but I shall content myself by supporting the amendment of the right honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page), because I consider that we should give a much more substantial preference to Great Britain than is given by the duties that appear in the schedule. It is all very well to say that a duty of 55 per cent, against Great Britain, compared with 65 per cent, intermediate and 75 per cent, general, gives a preference to Great Britain. Undoubtedly it does; but what is the advantage of any such preference if the duty itself is so high that it is practically impossible to compete against it? It is like loading on a man a burden that it is impossible for him to carry, and urging that the treatment meted out to him is very favoryour able because another person is asked to that carry a burdeu that is twice as great. The amendment is an eminently reasonable one, and should be accepted by the",47
166,Mr WHITE,NEW SOUTH WALES,"Balaclava) [8.20] - I , of also, support the amendment of the right honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page). I consider that this is one of the or to most ill-considered duties that has ever overbeen applied. If we are to bring down production costs, whether in primary or secondary industries, we must at least fishermake machinery for production as cheap as possible. I am an advocate of the of establishing Australian be manufactures, so far as that is reasonable with and economically possible. In this oase, to however, industry is being taxed unnecessarily, hy the extortionate duty that is to imposed. The amendment proposes that the duty on British machinery shall be 25 per cent. I point out that tie present of the duty of 55 per cent., being on an ad valorem basis, is equal to 60 per cent. Then there is a primage of 10 per cent., 75 per an exchange of approximately 30 per cent., a packing case duty which approximates 2 per cent., and shipping, insurance and other charges, which vary from 10 per cent, to 15 per cent. Adopting the former figure, it will be found that the total is 112 per cent., which, added to the price of an engine costing £100 f.o.b. in Great Britain, would make the price landed in Melbourne or Sydney considerably over £200. The cost to the primary or secondary producer would be raised proportionately. No more flagrant example of the effect of the application of this duty can be quoted than is to be found in the case of engines of the crude oil type, particularly those of larger horse-power. Those large oil engines comprise a variety of designs and types. A common design of any type could not be made to suffice for all purposes; standardization is not possible. Any honourable member who is at all acquainted with machine shops knows that, in order to produce machinery, drawings have to be prepared, patterns made, and certain tools manufactured. If made for one machine only, the cost becomes ridiculous and out of all proportion to the usefulness of the machine. In the case of engines, some of these machines' may be of horizontal type and others of vertical type, some heavy running at low speeds, others light running at high speed, some on the two-stroke, ancl others on the four-stroke principle. In order that the most suitable type may be obtained to meet the particular circumstances of the case, ancl purpose for which it is required, it is necessary that the whole of the above range should be available within Australia, because at the moment all types being used. .No country in the world has reached a higher standard of quality in engine manufacture than has Great Britain. In that country are established numerous firms which are noted for their production of a particular type of engine. If a provincial town in Australia wishes to install its own lighting plant it must purchase a certain type of engine to drive the dynamo; but simply because one firm makes a certain type of engine in this country, the Government endeavours to compel that municipality, which may be hard-pressed for funds, to purchase its engine from that particular manufacturer, even though that engine may he unsuitable. Unless the council can induce the Minister to allow the duty to be lifted for the occasion, it is obliged to suffer that enormous-penalty. Is it to be wondered at that we cannot bring about decentralization, and that there are thousands of unemployed in our cities? The people will not live in our country towns because they are penalized in regard to their transportation charges, first, on the goods that they obtain from the cities, and, secondly, on the products that they send to the coast. In addition, they have to pay excessive duties on the equipment that is necessary to provide them with some of the benefits of civilization. One of the worse features of this duty on machinery or that type of engine is that, under a by-law, either the Minister or the department may be induced to lift the duty so as to allow the machine to come in free. Let us consider how that by-law may be applied. I have particulars of goods that were landed in Melbourne in February last for tariff decision. In the case of a vertical oil and gas engine of 400 horse-power, the duty was lifted for a day and the engine was allowed in free. On the same day another '300 horse-power engine of the crude oil type also was allowed in free. The ordinary honest firm that is asked by an urban or country municipality for a quotation for an English or continental engine that cannot be made in Australia, would estimate the the cost on the basis of, the English f.o.b. price, to which it would add all the other charges that I have enumerated. But another indentor who felt that he was on are good terms with the Customs Department would say, "" I can get the duty lifted in your case "". I do not say that there is anything dishonest in that practice. But what is the result? An engine worth something like £1,000 or £2,000 would, in the case of the straight-out trader, cost"" an additional 112 per cent., while the other indentor who knew that the Customs Department would allow the machine to be imported without payment of duty, would be able to quote .a figure so much lower. Is that any inducement for factories to equip themselves with up-todate machinery, and is it fair to the importers or even to the manufacturers of machinery? The purpose of the amendment is to make the Minister enumerate the different types of machines, and to state specifically the duties that apply to each, instead of having a drag-net item with power in the hands of the Minister to say, when the occasion arises, whether the duty shall be applied or not. Some honourable members must know how the process works; I do. An importer places an order with a firm on the other side of the world. When the goods arrive he interviews an official of the Customs Department. Two or three other machinery firms in Australia are shown a catalogue of one of the best-known makers of engines overseas, and are asked to say whether they could make the particular type of engine on which it is sought to have the duty lifted. In 90 cases out of 100 the reply is: "" We could "". The question asked should be: "" Could you make it economically, at a price that would pay the man who buys it?"" The customs official, knowing very littfle about the quality of the machine to be imported, accepts the word of the local manufacturers. The manufacturers of machinery .in Australia, if we exempt agricultural machinery, employ only a handful of people; yet on their assurance that they could make the machines, a 55 per cent, duty is imposed. There are thousands of firms in. Australia who could copy most machines, but could not make them economically, or turn them out on the same scale or of the same quality as .those turned out by overseas manufacturers. This would be admitted by any manufacturers who did not want to see the public fleeced by excessive costs. If , when the matter was placed before them, they had the courage to say: ""We could make them, but not at a reasonable price "", the imported article would be admitted duty free. They are rarely frank enough to make that admission, especially in these depressed times when they want work at whatever cost. Because both primary and secondary producers are being penalized, and on the ground that costs would be reduced if our machinery were available at as cheap a price as possible- a condition that must be present if we are to regain economic equilibrium- I have much pleasure in supporting the amendment.",47
167,Mr GIBBONS,NEW SOUTH WALES,"Calare) [8.29] - The immediate effect of a reduction of the tariff upon machinery has been belatedly realized by certain honourable members who have preceded me; but the principle which the amendment embodies is absolutely opposed to the practice that has been adopted in the past by governments that have not hesitated to impose revenue tariffs against the particular items that have been discussed this evening. The Leader of the Country party (Dr Earle Page) said that he had moved the amendment with a view to helping British manufacturers and encouraging trade with Great Britain at a period when it is suffering extraordinary economic distress. My knowledge and experience of the manner in which the department exercises its right to waive the duty on machinery that cannot be commercially manufactured in Australia, convinces me that the administration is absolutely efficient and sensible. Unfortunately, this debate is degenerating into a general attack upon the protectionist policy. The contention in favour of a reduction of the duties on railway_ rolling-stock might be all right if we could expect reciprocal treatment from the countries likely to be benefited. If such duties were removed, we might get our rolling-stock from the United States of America ai slightly cheaper rates, but we have to remember that that country imposes a duty of 13^d. per lb. on Australian wool, a prohibitive tax which makes it impossible for us to sell our wool in America. Yet honourable members opposite have pleaded, ostensibly for the benefit of the primary producers, that we should admit free of duty the machinery manufactured by a country that deliberately excludes one of our primary products. As for the plea on behalf of the manufacturers of the United Kingdom, the fact has been convincingly demonstrated that some of the goods imported from Great Britain are the products of other countries, and it would be impossible for the Customs Department to police imports in such a way as to ensure that the preference granted to Great Britain applied only to goods manufactured there. I have expressed on other occasions my view that the tariff is not scientific, and that it . places on industry direct burdens that could be avoided, especially having regard to the changed economic conditions thai have resulted from the adoption of the financial emergency plan. Therefactured fore, I regret that honourable members opposite, instead of concentrating on those items which could be immediately amended without detriment to the policy of protection, are making a general attack upon the tariff. The machinery produced within the Commonwealth, particularly agricultural machinery, is designed to suit Australian conditions, and its efficiency has been proved. I have always maintained that the interests of primary and secondary industries interlock. Our fiscal policy should be designed to hold, the balance evenly between those two sections, but the scales are in some respects weighted unduly in favour of the manufacturing and urban interests and against the primary producers. Such injustices which result from the unscientific application of the tariff could be moved, but I can see no justification for the proposal of the honourable member for  tralia should ""adopt a flexible tariff which not would enable it to exchange its primary products for machinery and other manufactures of America. Such a policy would disregard the general development of the country, and would tend to break down the tariff barriers behind which our young industries are establishing themselves. Machinery that can be commercially manufactured in Australia and sold without increasing the burden on industry should be manufactured here. The elimination of such manufactories or any other secondary industries that are on an economic basis must reduce the consuming power of the community by lessening the market for other products. In regard to the claim that greater preference should be shown to the products of Great Britain, leading economists in the United Kingdom have admitted recently that one reason why she is losing trade in machinery and in other manufactures, is that she is 25 years behind some of her competitors. That contention has been advanced by those who advocate that Great Britain should alter her fiscal system in order to protect and de velop her manufacturing industries. If Great Britain is manufacturing machinery which is necessary to the development, of Australian indnstrvand such machinery cannot be commercially manuhere no duty on it is charged. Surely that preference is ample. When we are asked to lower our protective duties in order to relieve the economic distress in the Mother Country, I remind honourable members that we are dealing with an emergency tariff, formulated to cope with an extraordinary economic position in Australia. Those who fail to realise that the present tariff policy has been rendered necessary in order to maintain the solvency of Australia are ignorant of facts which should be known to all students of public affairs.",49
168,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,NEW SOUTH WALES,"Warringah) [8.45] - The items in this particular section of the tariff furnish the clearest evidence of the slip-shod methods adopted by the Government in the compilation of the schedule. Articles covered reby some items undoubtedly should .be protected-ever y honourable member approves of the protection of legitimate Australian industries-bu t others which canbe manufactured in Australia should not be subject to the heavy rates of duty that have been imposed. It is remarkable that, in respect of 108 items, the ra'te of duty is to be "" as prescribed by departmental by-laws ""-furthe r evidence of the ruleof-thumb method followed in the classification of these items. In many instances the Minister, or a departmental officer, will determine whether or not certain articles can be manufactured in Australia. Upon his decision will depend the rate of duty to be levied and whether those engaged in the industry concerned will get a fair deal. This is a singular and, I submit, altogether too great a power to place in the hands of the person who, for the time being, is Minister for Trade and Customs. The trading community is entitled to know where it stands, and what rate of duty is payable upon certain classes of machinery without having to appeal to the Minister or the department for a decision. The tariff, and particularly this section of it, is, I repeat, full of absurdities. In some items the rate of duty will depend upon whether the article in question c»n be ""commercially manufactured"" in this country. I have asked the Minister for a definition of this term, but the honourable gentleman has declined to say just what is meant and, as we all know, his interpretations and definitions are as variable as the winds that blow during the equinox. Mr R. GKEEN - Apparentl y the Minister takes the view that because an article can be manufactured in Australia it can be "" commercially manufactured,"" which, of course, is absolutely wrong.",50
169,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,NEW SOUTH WALES," .Exactly. On several occasions when applications have been made for the admission of machinery or other commodities duty free on the ground that they cannot be manufactured in Australia, the persons making the applications have been required to produce blue prints or plans. These have been shown to local firms, who thereupon alleged that the articles could be manufactured in Australia, with the result that the duties have been imposed and the public of Australia penalized. I have in mind a case which aptly illustrates my point. Recently' the Manly Gas Company obtained quotations from Chicago for a spherical gasometer, the landed cost of which was £3,129. ""When application was made for its admission duty free, the Minister made inquiries and informed the company that the gasometer could be manufactured locally by the Cockatoo Island Dockyard for £6,520. Apparently, this is the Minister's interpretation of the phrase "" commercially manufactured"" which appears against so many items in the tariff. As a result of the Minister's activities in this matter, the Manly Gas Company was compelled to pay duty amounting to £2,005 on a gasometer costing £3,129, making the total cost £5,134, which was still £1,386 below the quotation obtained from Cockatoo Island Dockyard. The Manly Gas Company will be unable to show any tangible assets in its capital account for the £2,006 duty paid on the gasometer, and, in addition, the users of gas in the Manly district will be forced to pay for all time approximately id. per foot more for all gas consumed. This is the direct result of the absurd fiscal policy of this Goversment.",51
170,Mr MAXWELL,NEW SOUTH WALES,"To be logical the Minister should have levied sufficient duty to cover the difference between the cost of the imported gasometer and the Australian quotation. ^ Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL Evidently he did not think of that; otherwise he would have done so. All honourable members agree that the costs of production must come down; but, when supporters of the Government make use of this argument, they have in mind the costs, not of secondary, but of primary production, and incontinuance of its policy to assist manufacturers, this Government persists in imposing duties which work the greatest harm to primary producers. Apparently Ministersand their supporters fail to realise that, unless costs are reduced in our secondary industries, it will not be possible for our primary producers to reduce their costs ,to a material extent, and yet this is essential if they arc to market their products overseas on a competitive basis. I could cite many instances to prove the harm which this Government, through its tariff policy, is doing to Australian industries. Although the Diesel engine provides the world's cheapest form of engine power, it is subject to the same duties in Australia as the ordinary petrol and. kerosene engines. One well-known British Diesel engine reduces the cost of running, as compared with a petrol engine, by 75 per cent. This particular engine represents the very latest developmentsin engineering, and experimental work, which is still proceeding, has already cost the makers more than £30,000 on the new model alone. Similar engines are admitted free of duty to New Zealand. As 90 per cent, of the importations are for the use of primary producers, oue has not far to look for at least one of the reasons why the primary producer in Australia is so much worse off than - the primary producer in other parts of the Empire. This item is typical of the treatment accorded to the primary producers in hundreds of items in the tariff. There is no justification whatever for these particularly heavy duties upon articles which are not manufactured in Australia.",51
171,Mr FORDE,NEW SOUTH WALES,They are admitted duty free from Great Britain if they cannot be manufactured in Australia.,51
172,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,NEW SOUTH WALES,I have just cited an instance of tariff blundering in connection with the Diesel engines.,51
173,Mr FORDE,NEW SOUTH WALES,Gasometer s can be manufactured in Australia.,52
174,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,NEW SOUTH WALES," That is not denied; but, as I have shown, at what price! The Australian price obtained by the Manly Gas Company was £6,520, as against the Chicago quotation of £3,129 landed at Manly. It is hopeless to expect anything from a Minister holding such an oblique, and, I suggest, idiotic view on tariff matters. It has always been a rule, when machinery has been allowed in duty free on the ground that it cannot be manufactured in this country, to permit local manufacturers to inspect it with a view to its reproduction in Australian workshops. And yet I have a case in which the Minister has withheld permission ou the ground that, if it were permitted, he would be favouring one competitor at the expense of another! The Minister has altogether a mistaken conception of his position. That particular machine was admitted duty free on the understanding that it would be open to inspection by Australian engineers with a view to its manufacture in Australian engineering establishments. The Minister said that the person who desired to inspect this machine was entitled to do so provided he made arrangements with a certain manufacturer. The necessary arrangements were made, even to the fixing of the day and hour; but when the time came, the manufacturer refused to allow the inspection to take place. A report to that effect was made to the department, and the gentleman was informed that he was entitled to inspect the machine. The manufacturer again agreed to allow the inspection to take place, but later again withdrew his consent. For some inexplicable reason, the Minister, who is a Czar for the time being, issued a ukase that, no one was to inspect the machine. I do not know whether he has since made an order that the machine must be kept covered for fear some one might surreptitiously inspect it ; but those are the facts to which direct attention. The Minister has my correspondence with the department, and to that extent has the advantage over me, for I am speaking from memory. I have, however, given the salient facts of the case. I entirely repudiate the absurd suggestion of the honourable member for Calare (Mr Gibbons) that honourable members on this side of the committee are discussing the general fiscal policy of the Government. Under the able direction of the Chair, the debate is being kept close to the items under discussion, which throws up in bolder relief the nonsensical statement of the honourable member. The hard, cold facts are that, although this honourable gentleman is supposed to be representing the primary producers, he very rarely has. sufficient courage to support his sentiments by his votes. As his constituents are almost wholly wheat-growers and other primary producers, it would be reasonable to expect the honourable member to champion their interests, and do his utmost to see that they obtain their"" machinery under reasonable .'conditions; but he is full of inconsistency. He had something te say about holding the scales evenly between the secondary and primary industries. Everybody desires to do that, of course, but it will hot he done by the methods which the honourable member has adopted. We are not here to talk as he has been talking. The Minister may laugh, but. that does not alter the fact that it is our business not to talk aimlessly around the subjects before the Chair, but to make some useful contribution to the discussion with the object of assisting the community at large. I direct the attention of honourable members to certain statements about tariffs which were made by Mr Henry Ford in an interview published in the New York Telegram on the 20th May, 1930. The first of these is as follows :In Ford's opinion a high tariff will not stimulate industry but will slow it down by s process of stultification. It will not do away with unemployment, but will eventually increase i l hy limiting or killing world trad* without, which business cannot properly expand. Mr Ford then goes on to make some apt I remarks about the value of competition in business. It appears to me to be the ambition of the Minister and some of his colleagues to put an end to all competition in business in Australia, and to make impossible the adoption of new ideas and progressive business methods by creating monopolies. In this connection Mr Ford saysBusiness thrives on competition. Nobody does his best if lie knows that no one is competing with him. Comfortably tucked away behind a tariff wall which completely shuts out all competition, and which gives industry an undue profit which it has not earned, the business of our country will grow soft and neglectful.' Instead of enlarging and putting on an increasing number of workers, the tendency would bo to be satisfied with things as they were, and to stand still. Despite these Himalayan tariff imposts, business is at a standstill in Australia today. In today's newspapers, the statement is made that, notwithstanding the promises of the Government, there are 29,000 fewer workers in the factories of New South Wales than tdiere were last year.",52
175,Mr JONJSS,NEW SOUTH WALES,What is the position in America ?,53
176,Mr ARCHDALEPARKHILL,NEW SOUTH WALES,"I am dealing with bur own country. I shall leave the honourable member to deal with America. The Minister has stated, not once or twice, but a score of times, that the result of the imposition of these duties would be to increase the number of our factory employees by at least 50,000; but the actual position is that there are today about 100,000 fewer employees in the factories of Australia than there were before the Minister attempted to bolster up industry by embargoes, prohibitive duties and similar impositions. In his concluding remarks Mr Ford, in the article fro m which I have already quoted, referred to prohibitive pretention in the following words:It is just a final belated effort on the of a small group of men to have one last, fruitful, dig Into the pockets of the masses. The one inevitable result of the operation of these duties will be that a relatively small handful of people will dig deeply within the pockets of the primary producers and the wage-earners who constitute the masses of this country. I a.m unable to understand how it is that our wage-earners do not realise that the result of the piling up of high prices must mean the scaling down of their wages. The pushing through of this tariff schedule is neither more nor less than a base attempt on the part of a Labour government to reduce the wages and the scale of living of the workers of this country, without providing them with a single compensating advantage. I shall support the amendment, but 1 regret that it does not go far enough. It will still allow the imposition of duties of 60 per cent, and 65 per cent. Such protection, plus the primage duty of 10 per cent., exchange of 30 per cent., and freight and insurance charges, should be sufficient for auy purpose. But all through the items of this tariff schedule one finds anomalies and evidence of injustice and unfairness. No honourable member has auy desire to deal unfairly with the manufacturers of this country; on the other hand, we wish to do everything we can. reasonably do to help them. But we also have a duty to the men living in the bush who have to struggle f o i a living without any protection whatever, They have to sell their products at world parity prices without the adventitious aids which those engaged in secondary industries receive. Then, too, we are surely under an obligation to consider the interests of the mass of the consumers who constitute the majorit y of our citizens, and who, while receiving the rawest deal that any government has given them since the consummation of federation, are e:ng entirely forgotten by honourable members opposite.",53
177,Mr FORDE,NEW SOUTH WALES,"Capricornia-Minister for Trade ancl Customs) [9.13] - The honourable member for Warringah (Mr . Parkhill) has stated that the department has meted out unfair treatment to one of his constituents who desired to inspect a certain machine which had been admitted part duty free under departmental by-law. I shall not mention the name of his constituent, but his letter to the honourable member readMy principals about a year ago imported a machine from America, and have been so successful that they now desire to increase their plant and consequently will be giving more employment to Australians. Later, the letter statedIt occurred to me that I should avail myself of the opportunity of inspecting a machine for a similar purpose which was imported some time ago duty free under a customs by-law. The departmental attitude in connection with such applications is set out in the following letter:I desire to inform you that in dealing with applications for admission of goods under by-laws the fundamental fact to be established is whether the article' is or is not being mercially made in Australia. If the article is not being made in Australia, the Minister may then admit such goods under the appropriate by-law item of the tariff. This principle has been followed by the department under various Ministers since the inception of federation.  Minister for Trade and Customs, a system was instituted whereby recipients of tariff concessions should, if further supplies were required by them, endeavour to have their subsequent requirements manufactured in Australia. A form of guarantee was drafted, the terms of which aro very wide, but the application of .which has always rested in the hands of the Minister. In the late Mr. Pratten's time it was laid down that although the importer would be required to furnish satisfactory evidence that he had endeavoured to obtain future supplies in the Commonwealth before a further concession would be arranted, it was not intended that any importer or manufacturer should be forced to disclose to a competitor the details and knowledge which he had spent money abroad to obtain. In the case now under review, it is acknowledged that the principals imported a machine from America about a year ago, and yet the applicant desires on their behalf to inspect a machine imported by a competitor. This, the department does not consider equitable, and for this reason the Minister has not .insisted upon the firm concerned permitting the applicant to view the machine imported by that company. The grievance was that this gentleman was not allowed to insja machine that had heen brought in by his competitor. My department has been subjected to a good deal of criticism because that machine was brought it' free, but the competitive company also brought in a machine duty free  for Trade and Customs, he laid down a certain principle that has been invariably followed by his successors, and from which I have not departed. The hononih'e member for Gippsland  an instance showing where the machinery duties had prevented the establishment of the fishmeal making industry in Australia. He said that my department had notified the company that the necessary plant could not be admitted under by-law because certain portions of it could be made in Australia The actual position is that the managing director of the Fish Meal Company, the concern that had allegedly gone out of existence because my department would not allow it to com- bring in a machine duty free, notified my department to this effectThe managing director stated that he has. had a number of interviews and discussions with Mr J. W."" Stamp, regarding the manufacture in Australia of a plant suitable for treating wet fish for fishmeal, with the result that he is now satisfied that the plant offered by J. W. Stamp would be entirely suitable for the requirements of Marine Industries Limited The same gentleman also stated that negotiations with Mr J. W. Stamp have been so successful that it has been definitely decided by his company to place an order with Stamp to proceed with the manufacture of a plant for erection at , in New South Wales. He further stated that in addition to being absolutely satisfied that the plant offered by Stamp would be efficient and suitable for treating wet fish for fishmeal, its cost to his company would be approximately one-half of the f.o.b. price of the English unit. He also stated that although the plant offered by J. W. Stamp is of a smaller capacity, and operates differently from the unit offered by the ICnglish manufacturers, he is satisfied that it will be n success as a fishmeal making plant. Another company intends to establish a plant. I think in Sydney, and it needs some special machinery. I ts representative called to see me a few days ago, and I asked him to consult with Mr J. W. Stamp. He did so, and then told me that Stamp could not manufacture the type of machine required. If that is the case, the special machine needed will be allowed in duty free. No department could deal more sympathetically with such rases than mine has done. The right honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) said that during the last seven years Australia had imported over £100,000,000 worth of machines and machinery. Unfortunately, for purposes of analysis, the statistical item "" machines and machinery,"" covers a wide range, including cash registers, cooking appliances, cable wire, electric fans, lamps, telephones, wireless sets, lawn mowers, typewriters, and so on, all of which can hardly be described as machinery necessary for the production of consumable commodities. When it comes to a matter of production of highlyspecialized articles, my department takes a most sympathetic view of the matter. The right honourable gentleman said that we should seek by preferences to give Great B r it a in orders for machinery that is now purchased from the United States of America and Germany. Later in his speech, he declared that British manufacturers were not foolish enough to manufacture highly-specialized machinery that could be bought to greater advantage in the TJnited States of America and Germany. The right honourable member's speech was illogical. The Government is making every endeavour to have these machines made in Australia, but, where that is not possible, it is realized they must be brought in from overseas-at times from the TJnited States of America and Germany.",53
178,Mr LATHAM,NEW SOUTH WALES,"Kooyong) [9.22] This is one of the most important items in the tariff. It is a drag-net item, providing that all machines and machinery n.e.i. are to bear a duty of 55 per cent., 65 per cent., and 75 per cent. The British preferential rate is being increased from 45 per cent, to 55 per cent. As the Minister said, it is a very general item, which applies to many articles. We have to draw certain distinctions in order to arrive at a wise conclusion on the proposal of the Government. In the first place, as the right honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) pointed out, ii is very important to do everything in our power to reduce the capital costs of industry. There have been examples where, owing to. the imposition of heavy duties upon machinery imported to make consumable goods in Australia, very heavy costs indeed have been permanently imposed upon an industry* I agree, in a general way, with the idea that we ought to remove the duties from the capital assets where we import for the purposes of further production. That, however, is only one side of the matter. The other side is that ""it is quite impossible for Australia to obtain any real success in manufacture unless there is an efficient and effective engineering industry here. An engineering industry cannot be efficient if it is confined to casual work. There must be an opportunity for manufacture, as well as for repairs. Any one who is interested in the matter must be aware that-and I do not reflect upon anybody-the engineering industry in Australia is a deplorable one. It has been so for some years past. Recently, there was an inquiry in the Arbitration Court into this industry which showed the need for some rationalization, and indicated that the engineering industry in Australia required overhauling. It is a pitiful thing to see how Australia is losing engineering work. Speaking generally, no ship repairing is now being done in the Commonwealth. Owners prefer, if possible, to have the vessel towed to another country to have the repairs effected.",55
179,Mr LONG,NEW SOUTH WALES,B y cheap labour.,55
180,Mr LATHAM,NEW SOUTH WALES,"It is a matter of costs, as against those of the whole world.",55
181,Mr LONG,NEW SOUTH WALES,Does the honourable gentleman suggest that Australian artisans are not efficient?,55
182,Mr LATHAM,NEW SOUTH WALES,"No . I say that our costs are so high that our ship repair work has gone. Everybody who has any information with respect to the engineering industry in this country, knows that. At the present moment, a leading Melbourne firm that used . to do thousands of pounds worth of repair jobs a year is in liquidation. Cockatoo Island Dockyard aud Mort's Dock are also in an unfortunate position. The costs are too high. It is all very well to deplore that fact, but that does not make jobs for men. This work has practically vanished. So long as the costs remain high in Australia, the work will not be done here. ""What are we going to do about it? Are we going to remain at zero point, or try to recover this and other work? Certainly, we should try to recover it. Higher duties have been imposed upon machines, machinery, and machine tools. Is it likely that the result is going to be a diminution of costs in engineering work done in this country? It is hardly pretended that that is likely. I urge that there should be a very careful reconsideration of the duties which affect the engineering industry. Take the New South Wales figures of work repair in engineering shops. I have not the precise figures in my mind, but I know that they are in the proportion that a factory which three years ago had 850 hands, today has only 12; another factory which a few years ago employed 1,400 hands now has only 300. In dealing with this item, we ought to consider the .engineering industry and other industries which are dependent essentially upon it. Is it going to help those industries t Probably some honourable members opposite believe that the imposition erf jiiese additional duties will provide more work in the engineering trade. It is a sad thiug that there was far more work in the trade many years ago, when the duties were considerably lower than is the case today. This has to be borne .in mind. Many of the products of the engineering industry are implements of production, not consumable articles themselves, so that when costs are high the articles are simply not produced, because they are not ordered. The question then arises whether we are not going exactly the wrong way about effecting a revival in of the most depressed industries in the Commonwealth. The number of men out of work in the engineering industry is probably proportionately greater than those unemployed in any othor industry. There aro one or two honourable members here with special knowledge of this matter. I do not profess to any special knowledge, but those who do will, I agree with me that unemployment is worse today in the engineering industry than in any other. The condition of many former employees is' pitiable. When the Arbitration Court inquired into the industry, this fact was recognized, although the inquiry wus held before the present depression had become acute. The position is worse today, and I do not think that we shall help matters by imposing these duties. They will serve merely to aggravate the slackness of industry in general, and of the engineering industry in particular. This has always been a general item. In my opinion, the time has arrived when wo ought to differentiate between those machines which can be made perfectly wtail in Australia, and which there is no need to import, and other types of machinery which cannot be made here ou an economic basis. Under this item, machinery is dutiable at 55 per cent., 65 per cent., and 70 per oent. I have here a pamphlet which illustrates lathes made by MCPherson's Proprietary Limited, Melbourne, and I have been interested to ascertain the reputation they have in the trades in which they are used. I find that they have an admirable reputation; they are apparently first-class machines.",55
183,Mr LONG,NEW SOUTH WALES,"Are they for steel turning, or for wood turning?",56
184,Mr LATHAM,NEW SOUTH WALES,"For both; and they are, I understand, highly efficient. Let us give protection such as is fair and reasonable in respect of those and similar articles; but do not let us mix up machines like that Will other machines of an entirely different kind. Owing to the high duties imposed, some machines are, in effect, being excluded from Australia today, to the detriment of various industries. They will probably never be made here, yet they are most necessary to certain Australian industries. one If they are imported, such heavy duties are imposed that they amount to a handicap on our own industries, and our own people. It is true that item 415 A provides for the admission, free from duty, as prescribed by departmental by-laws of manufactures imported for use "" in the development of an Australian industry"", aud I particularly draw the attention of think, honourable members to that phrase "" or of the natural resources of Australia, or for use in public hospitals, or public educational institutions, or for use by public utilities established under Commonwealth or State law, and not conducted for private gain "". The item provides that such machines may be brought in duty free, if they are of a "" class or kind not commercially manufactured in Australia or the United Kingdom "" or of a "" class or kind not commercially manufactured in Australia "" and not admissible under certain other items. The honor hill) referred to a case in which a machine had been admitted under this by-law, and the Minister replied to the honourable member's statement. Ever since I have been a member of this House I have had a quarrel with the Customs Department as to the interpretation of this provision. My quarrel has been, not with the present Minister particularly, but with all - those who have administered the department since I have been in Parliament. I take the present opportunity of referring to the matter, because it has a particular bearing on the item we are considering. In the first place, I have always understood that, as the honourable member for ""Warringah pointed out, when a specialized machine was admitted duty free under this item to a particular manufacturer, A.B., so that he might use it to develop an Australian industry, it was a condition that the machine could be viewed, and used as a model by other manufacturers engaged in the development of an Australian industry.",56
185,Mr CROUCH,NEW SOUTH WALES,B y other engineers?,57
186,Mr LATHAM,NEW SOUTH WALES,"Undoubtedl y ; that is the whole purpose of the provision. If A.B. is allowed to import the machine duty free, why should X.Y., his competitor, have to pay 55 per cent, or 65 or 75 per cent, duty on a similar machine? Surely A.B. is not to be given the benefit of a duty-free machine for his own private profit! The essence of the provision is that a machine is to be used in the development of an Australian industry, and the Customs Department has generally interpreted that as meaning that, if allows A.B. to import the machine free of duty, he must allow his competitors to see it.",57
187,Mr JONES,NEW SOUTH WALES,Coul d not the competitor import another machine duty free?,57
188,Mr LATHAM,NEW SOUTH WALES,"No , because one machine has already been imported, and it is supposed to be available for copying.",57
189,Mr MARTENS,NEW SOUTH WALES,"If the competitors of the first importer were allowed to import [luichines also, then there could be no restriction upon anybody importing them.",57
190,Mr LATHAM,NEW SOUTH WALES,"I have always underpresent stood that the department had in mind the development of an Australian industry, and not the henefiting of a particular person. only a competitor who has any use for a machine imported on these terms, and the competitor should have the right of access to a machine admitted duty free. This idea of excluding the competitor would, if logically applied, result in the exclusion of everybody who was interested in the industry, because only petitors would be interested.",57
191,Mr JONES,NEW SOUTH WALES,"If a machine is not commercially manufactured in Australia, why should not the competitors be allowed to bring in machines under similar conditions to those enjoyed by the first importer? '",57
192,Mr LATHAM,NEW SOUTH WALES,"The practice has been to admit a machine not hitherto manufactured here, so that it may be used as a model for the manufacture of similar machines here.",57
193,Mr FORDE,NEW SOUTH WALES,"There is very little demand for the particular machine which has been referred to. In this case, both the interested parties were allowed to bring in machines duty free, because there was not sufficient demand for them to justify any one making them here.",57
194,Mr LATHAM,NEW SOUTH WALES,"If the Minister will allow everybody to import the machines duty free when they are not manufactured here, I have no complaint.",57
195,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,NEW SOUTH WALES,'Did the Minister allow the man to whom I have referred to bring in a machine duty free?,57
196,Mr FORDE,NEW SOUTH WALES,He had brought one in duty free twelve months before the other was imported.,57
197,Mr LATHAM,NEW SOUTH WALES,"I shall content myself if with re-stating my contention as follows: If a person is allowed under item 415 A to import a machine duty free, either everybody else who wants to import a similar machine should be allowed to do so without payment of duty, or the first importer should be compelled to permit any one who desires to do so to inspect that machine. My real quarrel with the department is over the interpretation of the phrase, "" being of a class or kind not commercially manufactured in Australia"". It appears to me that, both under the administration and past administrations, the Customs Department has interpreted the phrase "" not commercially manufactured "" as if it were "" not comI t is mercially manufacturable"". This Parliament has not authorized the Customs Department to say to manufacturers, "" Can you make this machine here if you get an order?"" Such an inquiry is irrelevant to this provision. The only inquiry authorized is whether the machine' is already being commercially manufaccom- tured in Australia. That is the plain meaning of the item. The present Minister and his predecessor have accepted, the interpretation of the officers of the department that if a machine can be made - whic h is often a matter of opinionon a commercial basis, item 415 A cannot be applied in favour of an intending purchaser of a machine from another country. Plainly, the words of the item refer to articles now actually being made, or which have been made, and there is a great deal of difference between the phrases "" not commercially manufactured in Australia"" and "" that cannot be commercially manufactured in Australia"". The first phrase refers to a matter of fact, the second to a matter of opinion. The best test of what I may call "" commercial manufacturability "" is whether the article in question, is, in fact, being manufactured at the time. If a machine or article has never been manufactured in Australia, it is unlikely that it can be manufactured here in any quantit y on a payable basis, because there are so many persons out to make money that if it could be manufactured commercially some one would have already begun to do it. The question whether a machine can be manufactured here commercially is disputable and doubtful, and has led to many injustices in the administration of the Customs Department. If the words were applied in what seems to me to be their plain meaning, many of the difficulties which have arisen in the administration of the law under item 415 A would disappear, and the intention of Parliament would be carried out. This is a discretional item. There has to be a departmental by-law before there can bo an admission, and citizens are not in a position to test the matter. I urge the Minister's earnest consideration of what I suggest is the plain meaning of the phrase. The true intention of Parliament should be carried out in the administration of the tariff. The right honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) proposes to effect a reduction of from. 45 per cent. t:o 25 per cent.",57
198,Mr EOKDE,NEW SOUTH WALES,That would be bringing the duties below those imposed under the 1921-28 tariff.,58
199,Mr LATHAM,NEW SOUTH WALES,"I am prepared to vote tor a reduction, but not by way of a jump like this. Even with the exchange rate as it is, it seems to me that a reduction of from 45 per cent., 'as was imposed under the 1921-28 tariff, to 25 per cent, is very serious.",58
200,Mr GREGORY,NEW SOUTH WALES,Onl y 20 per cent.,58
201,Mr LATHAM,NEW SOUTH WALES,"It has been 45 per cent, since 1928, and at present I feel that a reduction to 25 per cent, over all is rather heavy. On the other hand, I feel, as I have said, that over the whole range of articles covered by this item, the duty is absurd. With the knowledge that has been gained by years of administration it will be admitted that a reclassification is necessary. On some articles this protection may be justified; on others it is not. In many instances, we arc only injuring Australian industries by imposing these duties. It is not as if revenue were obtained from them. Often their operation frequently means that manufacturers have to do the best they can with inefficient plant, and therefore find it more difficult to compete with imported goods. The real remedy is to be found in'a reclassification. I therefore ask the Minister to consider whether it would not be practicable to select' some articles on which high protective duties can be justified, and in the interests of all sections of the community to reduce the duties on the others. Although I feel that at the present moment there ought to be a real reduction in many of the duties imposed, I am inclined to think that a reduction of 20 per cent, is rather heavy. I should like to hear more on the subject before definitely making up my mind on that aspect of the question. I shall listen with interest to the debate before I finally determine how I shall vote.",58
202,Mr MARTENS,NEW SOUTH WALES,"Herbert) [9.47] - I do not profess to be an authority on mechanical engineering, but I know something of the difficulties encountered by those who have to iustall different types of machinery. During the last eighteen months, applications were made by the City Council of Cairns and the Town Council of Thursday Island in my electorate for the free importation of certain machinery which they desired to install. I unsuccessfully endeavoured to obtain a remission of duty on those two particular plants, as the Minister contended that they could be manufactured in Australia. In each case, reputable machinery merchants called for tenders for the supply of these plants, and in one case an incomplete tender was submitted, but in the other no tender at all Was forthcoming. It is therefore reasonable to assume that the complete plants could not be manufactured in Australia otherwise those engaged in the manufacture of such machinery would have submitted tenders. Although some parts of the plaut may be made in the Commonwealth, the fact that no tenders were received was a clear indication to me that the complete plant could not be commercially made in this country. In the two instances I have mentioned, machinery was required by public bodies which cannot raise revenue very readily} and which have to conserve the interests of the ratepayers. I do not suggest that these plants could not be manufactured in Australia, but the fact that no offers wore received surely suggests that their manufacture was not a commercial proposition to Australian engineers. I am anxious to encourage Australian manufacturers, and I admit that in some cases very generous treatment is meted out to those controlling Australian industries. But, in the cases 1I have quoted, groat hardship was inflicted upon two public bodies. I understand that» when a tender is submitted by an overseas manufacturer the whole plant must be taken, otherwise a higher rate of duty is imposed, which naturally presents a difficulty to those who wish to install machinery. If duties are imposed for the purpose of raising revenue' the people should be told. The late Government imposed duties purely for revenue purposes, and, in fact, obtained most of its revenue from that source. I am opposed to this or any other Government imposing duties merely for the purpose'of raising revenue unless it distinctly states to £570,000. that that is its intention.",58
203,Mr GREGORY,NEW SOUTH WALES,"Swan) [9.53] - This is a dragnet item in which all classes of machinery which are not covered by other items are included. The reason for the increase of duties under this item which embraces an enormous quantity of machinery and parts has not been given. I am not one of those who approve of the Minister for Customs possessing the extensive powers which he now enjoys of increasing or remitting duties, l t places too much power into the hands of influential people. The imposition of these additional duties is having a most disastrous effect upon production throughout Australia. It has not even been contended that as a result of these unnecessarily high rates the number of persons engaged in industry has increased. When we reach electrical machinery I shall direct' the attention of the committee to the opinion expressed by Sir George Julius, in Hobart, some time ago, who said that rather than have these heavy duties it would be better to pension off every electrical engineer in Australia, and allow electrical machinery to come in duty free. The first inquiry made by a British or American manufacturer who proposes to establish a factory in Australia is the price at which he can obtain power,- the first essential for cheap production. Honourable members opposite and . some on this side of the chamber seem to think that anything that is cheap is inferior. The honourable member for Calare (Mr Gibbons), who is pleased to think that the Government of New South Wales pays a higher price for the rails and locomotives used in his electorate merely because they are' manufactured in Australia, apparently, disregards the additional burden which is placed upon the primary producers in the matter of freight. In connection with the contract let to Messrs. Thompson and Company, of Castlemaine, some years ago for the supply of fourteen locomotives for use on the Port. Augusta to Oodnadatta railway, the extra price involved in giving the work to an Australian manufacturer necessitated nn additional interest payment of 6 per cent, in the £1 and 10 per cent, in the £1 sinking fund which is equivalent Notwithstanding these unnecessary additional imposts, some still ask for lower freights upon our railways. A little while ago an American engineer who came to Australia submitted an adverse report upon a big mining venture, because the necessary plant which - could have been obtained in the TJnited States of America for £250,000 would cost £525,000 in Australia. He said that the amortization was so great that the proposition was unprofitable. The tender of a Melbourne manufacturer for a plant capable of boring an 11-inch hole to a depth of 4,000 feet was £11,800, whereas that of an American plant capable of boring a 20-inch hole, 9,000 feet was £6,322. Imagine a government imposing a duty of £1,950 on the American plant that was to be used for boring for oil in Australia!

I trust that common sense will prevail, and that the committee will agree to the amendment. [14] Mr E. RILEY (South Sydney) [10.2]. an - Accordin g to honourable members opposite who have spoken to-night, the time cerhas arrived for a revision of our whole a tariff policy. The* Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Latham) says that metal trade is more depressed than any other industry in the country. As a matter of fact the depression in this industry is due to a change of conditions in the engineering world. Formerly, the steamers which visited Australia from per overseas ports were of comparatively small tonnage, and a great deal of their be repair work was done in Australia. Those steamers have now been replaced on the Australian trade by vessels of considerable tonnage, which carry their but own engineering staffs, and undertake their own repairs. Modern, engineering methods have led to the adoption of stanand mass production, and spare parts are produced by the thousand. has had a depressing effect upon the engineering shops, but the proAustralian metal trade would have been in a very much worse position if it had not been for the protection afforded by I have had occasion to interview previous Ministers for Trade aud Customs A asking for the remission of duties on certain machinery, and upon sufficient justification being shown, to them, the The Ministers have acceded to my requests.",60

Surely he is aware that the Manly Gas Company, having a monopoly, can impose whatever charges it likes upon its customers. I am a customer of the Manly Gas Company, aiid I am obliged to submit to whatever conditions it lays down. According to the honourable member the company will be obliged to increase the price of its gas by a' thousand feet because it has been called upon to pay £2,000 in duty upon a gasometer. Yet it ca?n still pay handsome dividends. The honourable member alio spoke of the Eord monopoly in America. I remind him that the Eord works Were built up under a protective tariff. The TJnited States of America would not be the country it is today if it had not had a protective tariff.",60
206,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,NEW SOUTH WALES,"If it had hot been for its population. Mr E. EILEY - The tariff has increased the country's population. One purpose of the Australian tariff is to increase population in Australia. If we abolished our protection what chance would we have of attracting population to tills country? If the right honourable member for Cowper had his way, population Would increase in Other countries at, our expense. It is nonsense to say that Australians cannot make the machinery required in this country. It is true that we cannot do it at a price which would accord with the ideas of honourable members opposite. ""We have no coolie or black labour to use. Our workers do not work for Wages such as are paid in Japan of China, or even in Great Britain. In Australia we have built up a wage based oh a high standard of living. The metal trade has as much right to be protected as any other industry in Australia. Some of our engineer'ing shops are equipped with thoroughly up-to-date plants. ""We have choose between employing Australians in the manufacture of the goods we require and sending money overseas to enable our needs to be supplied from abroad. Of course, the question of S minds, shillings and pence arises, but the overnment is not prepared to lower the workers' standard of living. Mr MAxwELL -'-What is the use of high wages if there is no work? Mr E. RILEY - There would be little benefit to the Country if the workmen had plenty to do, but received starvation wages. If Australia is to progress, it must have, a protective tariff. strength of a country is dependent to a large ex-Seat upon the skill of its workers. If we do not protect our own engineering industries, the time may come when we shall need trained mechanics, and shall not be able to find them. Br. EARLE PAGE (Cowper) [10.18] - I intend to reply to certain statements of the Minister regarding the importation of machinery. He said that he was willing to admit, free of duty, machinery that cannot be made in Australia, and the honourable member - for South Sydney (Mr E. Riley) remarked that we should do nothing that would result in sending work out of Australia to cheap-labour countries; but, owing to the duties now under discussion, the Minister has actually caused work that Could have l.»een done in Australia to be given to Japan. There was an opportunity for the erection of seven fishmeal plants at various points on the Australian coast. The Minister has been considering this matter since the 19th November last, and as I understand the last letter on the subject is dated the 10th June, the correspondence has extended over a period of eight months. The Minister now states that an order for one machine has been placed in Australia; but I shall show that this machine is of an obsolete type, and will prevent the success of the industry. The seven other plants, which would have provided work in Australia for hundreds of men, are not in. operation today, because they oould not be imported under present conditions, aiid fishmeal, which might have been made in this country by Australians, is being imported from Japan. The Minister has prevented the importation of certain machines, the manufacto ture of which in Australia, would have provided work for only a few men, but. hundreds of men would have been employed continuously in operating such machines. The sole effect of the Minister's action has been to make a certain amount of extra work in Japan in the manufacture of fishmeal. I shall quote extracts from some of the letters written by manufacturers to those who desired to import these, machines. In a lettor dated the 19th November, permission was sought to bring into Australia a machine which would operate The continuously under a solvent process for the manufacture of fishmeal and fish oils, which would have been suitable for human consumption as well as for consumption by stock.",61
207,Mr FORDE,NEW SOUTH WALES,Does the right honourable gentleman say that seven different companies wanted to import machines?,62
208,Dr EARLE PAGE,NEW SOUTH WALES,"No ; the original company has inquiries from seven different places in Australia where the machines could have been used, if their importation under reasonable conditions had been allowed.",62
209,Mr FORDE,NEW SOUTH WALES,"They have accepted an Australian machine, and are quite satisfied with it.",62
210,Dr EARLE PAGE,NEW SOUTH WALES,"The Minister speaks as though the manufacture of this machine was completed. Apparently, in despair, after trying for months to import suitable machines, somebody has given an order for a plant to be made in Australia, which, I shall show, will be obsolete when finished, and will hamper the industry from the beginning. In the first place, permission was desired to bring in, duty free, a machine which would work continuously with the solvent process. Various manufacturers were written to, but none had seen such a machine working in Australia. Comptroller-General of Customs had suggested that certain, firms be written to, and every one of them replied that they could not make this machine unless they received a licence from Messrs. Eose, Downs and Thompson Limited, who hold the patent rights. In the event of that permission being given, they were willing to pay a 5 per cent, commission on all machines manufactured by them. An importing company, which was also a machinery manufacturing company in Australia, had a right under licence to manufacture a certain type of fishmeal plant which was not up to date. In a letter dated the 28th January, 1931, this firm statedWe know these firms, and would state that hitherto they have only made abattoir machinery for turning out manure, but the plant under 'consideration is of a different type, and is for producing meal for feeding stock, and, possibly, also for human consumption. This type of plant has only been evolved within the last few years, and hitherto there has not been a demand for it in Australia, so that Australian manufacturers have not had cause to study the problems attached to the successful production of fishmeal. The company sent to the Minister copies of the correspondence that it had received. It was stated that the correspondence showed that one firm was not in a position to quote for the plant required, and admitted that no one in Australia had made a plant for the manufacture of fislmeal by these methods. The letter continuedFrom the latter letter it is evident that these people have never made afishmealplant, and are not in a position to quote for a plant of the type required. They state that the continuous type of plant has not, in their experience, proved satisfactory. But this type of plant has been in use v in Great Britain, having been made by Messrs. Eose, Downs and Thompson Limited. The Australian manufacturers said that they would not turn out a continuous machine but one similar to that which was used in the making of manure, and added that the solvent process was not used. Horrocks, Roxburgh Proprietary Limited, however, pointed out that in England and Germany, where this industry is carried on successfully, the solvent process which the Australian manufacturer says is impracticable is the standard process. The letters that ] The have in my possession demonstrate conclusively that, had the request of the firm beeu acceded to, there would be operating at the present time in Australia-o n the Clarence, in Gippsland, in Sydney, and in Western Australia-fro m five to seven plants employing several hundreds of men, producing what we have now to import. It is not right for the Minister to suggest, in view of these letters and their dates, immediately a request is made, that there is a satisfactory answer to it. I wish to place on record, also, the position in connection with another machine that is used in the production of oil from copra. At the present time copra is somewhat of a. drug - on the market, yet coco-nut oil, which is extracted from it, finds a ready sale, and is worth twice as much. If we had copra mills in Australia we should be able to procure practically the whole of the copra that is grown in our island dependencies, and the other islands adjacent to Australia, and be able to sell the oil readily in Canada and the United States of America; but, when application is made for the admission duty free of a special * type of oil-making machine, it is refused on the ground that certain portions of it can be made in Australia. Thus we are prevented from establishing a new industry and of doubling the value of the exports from Papua and New Guinea. Is not that a stupid position for us to be placed in? I trust that the Minister will reclassify the whole of this item in such a way that protection will be given only to those machines that are actually being made in Australia, so that the .development of new industries will not be impeded by the exclusion of those the manufacture of which in Australia is merely problematical. I understand that there is n feeling in the minds of some honourable members that, notwithstanding the present primage duty, a British preferential rate of 25 per cent, would not afford sufficient protection to those machines that are made in Australia. I therefore ask that leave be granted to amend my amendment to make the rates read, ""British, 35 per cent.; intermediate, 55 per cent.; general, 60 per cent."" Leave granted; amendment. amended accordingly.",62
211,Mr NAIRN,NEW SOUTH WALES,"Perth) [10.24] - The Minister has assured the committee that sympathetic consideration is given to every application for admission under by-law of machinery for specialized purposes. I shall give an example which I cousider reveals anything but sympathetic consideration by the honourable gentleman. There is in Western Australia a company named Plaimar Limited, which has most successfully exploited a number of the local industries in the direction of producing chemical products and synthetic compounds, having been particularly successful in connection with extracts from boronia and sandalwood. Its exports amount to approximately £120,000 per anuttm; therefore it may be taken to be thoroughly bona fide. Its efficiency, and the capacity of its managers to deal with different industries, aro undoubted. Some years ago, with a view to extending its business, this company laid down at a cost of £5,000 a farm for the growing of herbs, from which to extract essential oils and the like. Last year, when the farm was approaching the productive stage, the principal expert of the company visited Europe, and selected machinery suitable for the purposes of the new industry which it' was intended to establish; and an application was made to the Minister, for permission to import the machinery free under by-law. Following. his usual practice, the honourable gentleman sent out his scouts to ascertain whether any manufacturer was prepared to undertake the manufacture of this particular type of machinery; and it was not surprising that some one was found who was prepared to take the risk-. A firm of metal workers in Adelaide whose business was connected with motor cars, having been given a general idea of the class of machinery required, and being incited by the prospect of securing a monopoly and of making high profits, expressed its willingness to undertake the manufacture of this machinery. It had the impudence to request that the specifications, which it was necessary for the overseas manufacturer to lodge with the department with his application for the admission of the machinery under by-law, should be handed over to it in order that they might be copied. It was unacquanibed with the type of machinery in question, but felt that if supplied with the specifications it could make a success of the venture. It is to the credit of Plaimar's that they refused to be a party to this piracy of other people's ideas, and the specifications were, not handed over. Nevertheless, the Adelaide company persisted with its claim that it could manufacture this machinery. Later, I believe, the Minister discovered some Melbourne manufacturers who said that they, too, were prepared to take a chance on it. Mr Marr, the technical manager of Plaimar Limited, went to the trouble of making a special trip to Adelaide to interview those who claimed that they were able to make this machinery; and he was absolutely satisfied that they were not competent to undertake the work. This machinery is in a highly specialized class; it is used in connection with a new chemical business, in which Australia, and indeed Great Britain, is not able to specialize. Mr Marr was not prepared to run the risk of paying for the experiment, to be performed hy the Adelaide manufacturer. The Minister after delaying the applicant from October, 1930, until March of this year, refused the application, on the ground that there were in Australia manufacturers who were prepared to undertake' the manufacture of this machinery, the result being that ""Western Australia was deprived of a promising industry, and neither the department nor the manufacturers have derived any benefit from their dog-in-the-manger policy. The Minister and many other honourable members have expressed a pious desire to give every facility to industry in order that work may be provided for the unemployed; but the manner in which the tariff is administered precludes all possibility of that desire bqing realized. Machines are amongst the tools of trade of industry, and we cannot expect to be able to produce in Australia a very large proportion of the many classes of machines used here. Some oil engines and the less intricate classes of machinery may be made locally, hut the more specialized machines, which are the product of extensive and costly research, and are required in only small numbers, cannot be economically manufactured here. Unfortunately, the administration of this schedule is controlled by a Minister whose enthusiasm for high protection amounts almost to an obsession. I commend that portion of the amendment which seeks to give a more effective preference to British products. Great Britain is Australia's best friend and customer, and to her more than to any other country in the world must we look for the restoration of our prosperity. But effective preference to Great Britain is not conferred by the present schedule. When tariff duties are so high as to operate prohibitively the preference which the schedule purports to give becomes a mockery. I agree that the Minister should exercise his discretion, particularly in the direction of excluding American goods. Australia loses on almost all of its transactions with the United States of America, and the ministerial discretion should be exercised in the direction of curtailing imports from that country. But with Great Britain the administration should be more sympathetic. Moreover, when persons are trying to establish new industries, the Minister's first consideration should be, not the interests of a few employees in some small factory, but the larger interests that will be promoted by assisting the establishment or development of some other industry. I cordially support the amendment. Mr BERNARD C0RSER (Wide Bay) # [10.35 J -""Machine s and machinery n.e.i."" excludes locomotives, tractors, internal combustion engines and all sorts of other machinery specifically mentioned in the schedule. Therefore, the item relates only to undefined machines and machinery which, so far as we know, are not made in Australia at the present time. The Minister may at any time propose a duty which he regards as essential, or admit duty free any machines that are not commercially, manufactured in Australia. Therefore, the amendment moved by the right honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) does not introduce any important principle. Although the right honourable member made a great onslaught on the tariff policy generally, and appealed strongly for greater preference to the products of Great Britain, his remarks were not particularly applicable to this item. Of course, every part of the Empire deserves to get the benefit of preferential duties, and how the amendment would help the Empire I cannot understand. The schedule provides for duties of 55, 65 and 75 per cent., and the amendment proposes that they be reduced to 35, 55 and 60 per cent. I fail to' see that American goods will be excluded by reducing the duty on them from 75 to 60 per cent. I would prefer that the general tariff duty proposed by the Minister should be doubled against the United States of America. If the arguments that' have been advanced by the members of the Opposition were applicable to the item? I would oppose the amendment. We have been told that £100,000,000 worth of machinery was imported into Australia during the last seven years. Presumably the importers were influenced by the knowledge that the tariff would protect the product of such machinery, and I shall not be a party to removing that protection, and thereby possibly rendering the machinery useless. I shall support preference to Great Britain wherever it does not involve the denial of adequate protection to those industries which can be, and should be, established here in the interests of the country, and for the employment of our 3>fople. There are many items that need all the protection that this schedule provides. That applies to some articles of machinery, but in respect of unspecified machines it is safe to leave to the administration discretionary power to collect duties or grant free entry, as the circumstances may dictate. I cannot support any general move for the reduction of the tariff duties, for I know that many Anstey, F. primary as well as secondary industries Blakeley, A. would suffer considerably if the present Brennan, F. policy of protection were tampered with. Chifley, J. B. There are many who would reduce the Coleman, duty on our primary products to favour Culley, C. E. importations. Question-That the amendment (Dr Fenton, J. E.

212,Mr FORDE,NEW SOUTH WALES,"Capricornia-Minister for Trade and Customs) [10.50] - The rates ou locomotives and road rollers have been increased by 15 per cent, in the British preferential and intermediate tariff, and. by 20 per cent, in the general tariff. There are several engineering shops in Australia quite capable of producing all the locomotives and road PAIKS. rollers required. It will be noted that the importations of locomotives are of considerable value. The increased rates are proposed in an endeavour to secure Riordan, D. to Australian engineers work which should undoubtedly be undertaken in this country. The duties imposed on these goods are part of the Government's plan co rehabilitate the engineering industry. Provision exists under the tariff for the *d mission of machines, machinery, &c., under by-law where it is proved that certain types cannot be manufactured in A ustralia. During 1928-29, locomotives rn the value of £74,721 were admitted under by-law, and in 1929-30 importations so admitted were valued at £79,847. The administration of the by-law items tiuables the railways to import at nominal rates of duty any locomotive of a special design, or of a type not manufactured in Australia.

Motive Power Machinery and Appliances (except Electric), viz.:(D) N.e.i. ad val., British, 55 per cent.; intermediate, 65 per cent.; general, 75 pencent.",65
213,Mr HAWKER,NEW SOUTH WALES,"Wakefield) [10.59] This item deals with various forms of motive power machinery concerned with generating other than electrical power. Practically every argument that was advanced against the increase in the rates of duty in connection with item 176 F 1 applies with equal force against the increase in these duties. I shall quote what the Minister for Agriculture in the Labour Government of New South Wales stated regarding the action of machinery, 33 firms generally when they were put in 17 the position of monopolies by this Government. I quote from the. Daily Guardian, 16 Sydney, of 26th January, 1931To-day's Australian Labour Party country AYK8. conference was remarkable for an outburst by the Minister for Agriculture (Mr Dunn), directed against Australian machinery firms. They had held a gun at his ear to get financial guarantees, and were he said, "" worse than Ned Kelly."" Mr Dunn was particularly caustic in his criticism of Australian machinery firms. After the Federal Government had wiped out their competitors with prohibitive tariffs they held a gun at his ear to extort financial guarantees, he said. They demanded that the Government guarantee one-third of the cost, otherwise they would not deliver machinery to farmers. ""Their actions have been reported to the Federal Government,"" he said, ""but in order to help the farmers we made the necessary guarantees so that the crops coidd be harvested."" NOES. That, coming from a sympathetic source, shows what is liable to happen when a federal government, whether it be Labour or otherwise, grants a monopoly to any section of manufacturers. I have here a copy of a letter written by the New South Wales agent, of a Victorian firm engaged in the manufacture of chaff-cutters and other machinery. It is dated the PAIBS. 23rd of this month. ' It was sent to a farmer who had made inquiries as to the cost of improving his chaff-cutting plant, and who wanted, among other things, a boiler to steam his chaff. The letter statesPrices of new boilers today are particularly high, and in this connection, vou mav decide to advertise in the Sydney Morning Herald for a good second hand boiler. Tbat is clear evidence that the manufacturers of, at any rate, one item of power machinery, have taken advantage of the additional protection handed out to them so indiscriminately by the present Government. I move That the sub-item be amended by adding the following:""And on and after 1st October, 1031, (n) n.e.i., ad valorem, British, 35 per cent.; protection should be withdrawn. intermediate, 55 per ceiit.; general,"" 00 per cent."" ^_",66
214,Mr LATHAM,NEW SOUTH WALES,"Kooyong) [11.4] - I congratulate the Government very heartily upon the absence from the item as it stands to-night of the sub-item "" carburettors, British, £ 3 ; intermediate, £3; general, £3."" Although this schedule was introduced as the last word in tariff protection, I am glad to see that the Government has had enough sense to omit that sub-item.",67
215,Mr GREGORY,NEW SOUTH WALES,"Swan) [11.5] - The sub-item referred to by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Latham) was included in the tariff schedule, and has now been omitted. It was never approved by Parliament, and I wish to learn from the Minister whether any duty was ever collected under it, and if so, whether it has been refunded?",67
216,Mr BERNARD CORSER,NEW SOUTH WALES,"Wide Bay) [11.6] - This item covers, among other things, diesel engines, which are now being manufactured by Walkers Limited, of'Maryborough. This engineering firm has been established for the last 60 years, and has manufactured, with credit to itself and to Australia, a great' many of the railway locomotives used by the various Australian governments. During recent years the firm has given consideration to the manufacture of other heavy machinery as there is but little demand today for railway locomotive construction. The general manager of Walkers Limited, Mr BE. S. Goldsmith, toured the world in 1928 to acquire information, and, as a result, decided to make arrangements for the construction of diesel engines at the works in Maryborough. He visited various overseas works at which such engines were being made, and concluded an agreement with Messrs. Mirrless, Bickerton ancl Day Limited, of England, for their manufacture in Australia. Upon his return to this ""country, a request was made to the last Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Gullett) whether he would afford the new industry adequate tariff protection if the company proceeded to establish works here, and was given an emphatic answer in the affirmative. Since then honourable members have received literature supplied to them by the Australian Association of British Importers urging that this tariff The honourable member for Warringah (Mr. Parkhill) has even used in this committee some of the arguments supplied to him by the association. Honourable members have been furnished by a section of the Sydney Chamber of Commerce with similar literature, which misrepresents the position in regard to the manufacture of diesel engines. Since receiving the promise of tariff protection from the honourable member for Henty (Mr Gullett), Walkers Limited sent to Britain two of its engineers to study the manufacture of these machines. These gentlemen have now returned, and the necessary plant has been installed for proceeding with the work. Both the former Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Fenton), and the present Minister (Mr Forde) have honoured the promise given by the honourable member for Henty. In the literature supplied by the Australian Association of British Importers, it is stated that the imposition of the duty provided in this tariff schedule on the importation of diesel engines would be a hardship on the primary producers. The honourable member for Forrest (Mr. Prowse) agrees with that. Let me inform him for his edification, and in order to contradict the statements which have been made, that Walkers Limited has no intention under its agreement to manufacture engines of less than 100 horsepower.",67
217,Mr WHITE,NEW SOUTH WALES,"U p to what size can the firm, manufacture?",67
218,Mr BERNARD CORSER,NEW SOUTH WALES,"U p to 1,000 horse-power. In the literature which has been distributed here, it is stated that no diesel engine of 1,000 horsepower has ever been manufactured in any part of the world. It is stated that no diesel engineering firm turns out fixed engines of 1,000 h.h.p. It goes on to say that the local manufacturers, Walkers Limited, have undertaken to do what the more experienced engineering firms of the world do not attempt to do. That statement has been placed before honourable members in the hope that they will oppose this item. I have here an engineering journal dated 30th A p r i l , 1931, advertising a Crossley heavy oil horizontal diesel engine of 1.000 horse-power; yet the Association of British Importers state that such a thing has never been made. Dr EAR LE PAGE - Does the advertisement say they are diesel engines?",67
219,Mr BERNARD CORSER,NEW SOUTH WALES,"Yes . It is stated that this firm cannot manufacture diesel engines of over 200 horsepower, but it is clear that they are able to do so. The first diesel engine manufactured by the firm was of 200 horse-power. Yesterday I received a telegram to the effect that orders for diesel engines have just been received from Sydney, Melbourne, and from Central Queensland, and that the firm is hopeful of the immediate future. I have a copy of the tender by Walkers Limited for the supply of a diesel engine of 720 brake horse-power which shows that the information supplied to those opposed to the encouragement of Australian industry is incorrect. This is an Australian matter. I am not opposed to assisting British industries, and intend to support them whenever necessary; but this is an instance in which we can assist an Australian industry and provide employment for our own artisans, who are equal to those in any part of the world. The Australian firm producing diesel engines, Walkers Limited, has been in operation for 60 years, and is co-operating under licence with Mirrless, Bickerton and Day Limited, a British firm which has been manufacturing diesel engines for the last 30 years.",68
220,Mr ABOHUALE PARKHILL,NEW SOUTH WALES,I m p o r t in g most of the necessary parts.,68
221,Mr BERNARD CORSER,NEW SOUTH WALES,"That statement is inaccurate. Honourable members have received damaging information regarding the actions of Walkers Limited to prove that they are making only a small part of the engines in Australia. A paragraph in a circular issued by the company readsIn view of the extreme importance attached to the proper selection of material and to the heat treatment of same, we propose to adopt a safe course in this particular case by incorporating in the construction of the engine, cylinder liners, pistons, cylinder covers, crankshaft, and possibly one or two minor details to be brought from the works of our licensees. Honourable members should realise that the importers quoted only the portion of the circular which suited their case; but deliberately refrained from quoting subsequent paragraphs which clearly explain what actually occurred. The next paragraph not quoted readsWe arc producing these items in our own works at present; but we desire to avoid.the possibility of the article not giving satisfaction and to leave no reason to doubt that the engine will give the maximum of satisfaction that would be obtained from an imported engine",68
222,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,NEW SOUTH WALES,"They imported the parts from Great B r it a in . Mr BERNARD CORSER,-The honourable member for Warringah knows that certain parts that were imported were to be used in the. construction of the engine referred to in the circular quoted, but that subsequently all the necessary parts have been manufactured in Australia. The Sydney Chamber of Commerce, and the importers who supplied some honourable members with the information they have given to the committee, did not quote all the facts. It was not fair enough to say that the parts are now manufactured in Australia. Another paragraph readsAny industry should be in a position to. obtain its motive power machinery at the lowest possible price, and should be able, without incurring penalties, to purchase the most efficient machinery the world can produce. The Mirrless diesel engine manufactured in Australia is equal to the best that is manufactured in the world, and it was for that reason that Walkers Limited selected that design. The M i r r less Company has had the longest and best experience in diesel engine building in Great Britain . If it is in our interests to protect the manufacturers of Australian locomotives, why should we not protect the manufacturers of other types of machinery? Such machinery cannot be profitably manufactured unless fairly heavy customs duties are imposed. The Australian workmen must be protected. We have also to remember »*.hat, in Australia, the raw material ciosts more than it does in other smaller and more compact countries. The - Australian Association of British Importers, further speaking of another type, says- Tlicy expend immense sums on research work, the benefit of which goes to the users of their product. It is the same with the engines manufactured by Walkers Limited. Built into the engines is not only their own 60 years' experience, but also the 30 years' experience of the British company. The laboratories and experimental works of the British firm are available to Walkers Limited in connection with their diesel construction. The association also saysAs 00 per cent, of the importation.! are for the use nf primary producers one has not far to look for at least one of the reasons why the primary producer in Australia is to much worse off than the primary prmlinvr in other parts of the Kinpirc. That is absolute nonsense. The primary producer is not likely to require an engine of from 100 up to 1,000 horse-power, but there is another company in Austraha manufacturing smaller engines of this type. In another part of its communication the association goes on to sayThe parts which they admit they would import comprise all those which are most difficult to manufacture leaving only the iron work to bo produced locally. It would be very interesting to know how much extra employment is actually created in the Australian works by this duty. Obviously, it cannot be substantial in view of the comparatively small proportion of the work that will be done locally on any order that the Australian company can secure. At present, 85 per cent, of the engine turned out by Walkers Limited has heen made by that firm. Of the later engines, 95 per cent, will be completely manufactured by Walkers Limited, and by the time the present contracts are completed lOOpor cent, of the engine will be manufactured by it. The firm would not rush into carry out the who'e of the technical work on the first engine, and p-""isi""ihiy bring about a failure. It thought that, its host policy was to Mr liernni'l Cnrsc"". look before it leaped. It is to be hoped that' most people, whether they are opposed to a protective policy or not, will agree that there are some essentials which can be manufactured with advantage in Australia, and surely there is nothing more essential for Australian development than the manufacture of crude oil engines which it is possible to turn out in Australia up to 1,000 horsepower. For marine purposes, these engines are built up to 10,000 horse-power, mid there is no reason why Australian artisans who have been associated with engine construction for 50 or 60 years should not be protected to enable them to undertake the construction of diesel engines now that steam is going out of favour as a motive power. I hope that the propaganda which has been distributed among honourable members will not bring about a vote hostile to these duties.",68
223,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,NEW SOUTH WALES,"Warringah) [11.25] - I would not have risen hut for the extraordinary speech of the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr. Corser). It was a series of incoherent and unconnected statements. Although Walkers Limited has not been mentioned to-night; although no word has been said against the firm, he has referred to what he called a statement, and has proceeded to tilt at what it contains. The honourable member constitutes himself the advocate for Walkers Limited. He cares more for that firm than for any other interests castin Australia; but it would have had a higher reputation in the committee and in the country generally if the honourable member had not spoken in its defence. We are told that it has now started to manufacture diesel engines. On the strength of an order for three engines, the honourable member has claimed that no one should say a word against the duty. But he has told .us that when this great establishment was asked to manufacture an engine of 100 b.h.p. it said, "" We can manufacture everything except the external parts find the internal parts; in effect, we can merely put a case around it."" At any rate the honourable member produced a statement to that effect. He has therefore actually done damage to his clients' on use. No one would have known of the firm's disability if the honourable member had not mentioned it. I pointed out in an earlier speech that British firms had spent £30,000 in perfecting, these engines, but all that the lionorable member can say is that his firm has an order for "" three whole engines "". If the firm for which the honourable member makes so many appeals to the committee is such a wonderful concern, why does it need 100 per cent, protection?",69
224,Mr BEBNARD CORSER,NEW SOUTH WALES,It does not get it.,70
225,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,NEW SOUTH WALES,"It gets 70 per cent, under this tariff, 10 per cent, primage and 30 per cent, exchange. The honourable member talks unconvincingly about the merits of a firm which has been in .existence for 60 years, ancl yet still needs prohibitive protection! object of tariffs is to protect embryonic industries, so that on reaching maturity they may be able to do without duties, and withstand the competition of the world. After an industry has been in operation in his electorate for 60 years, the honourable member now wishes to give it a protection amounting to over 100 per cent., to enable it to carry on. That firm might well say- "" Save me from my friends!"" The honourable member belongs to the Country party, I understand; but,- judging by his utter disregard' of the interests of the primary producers, including those in his own electorate, I should say that his proper place is among the disciples of extreme protection. The firm in question will wish that he had not spoken on this matter, because he has done neither it nor the Country party any good.",70
226,Dr EARLE PAGE,NEW SOUTH WALES,"Cowper) [11.33]. - The Minister has a discretionary power with regard to admitting into Australia engines designed for the purpose of assisting production. One of the most successful power undertakings in Australia is the Nymboida hydro-electric scheme, ancl a 1,000 horse-power diesel engine is required in connection with its work and extension. Tenders have been called in Australia and overseas, and it is found that the tenders from the Australian companies are 2D per cent, higher than the cost at which a suitable engine from overseas could be landed in Australia, after paying all costs, including exchange; customs and primage duty. Surely it cannot be contended that these engines could be commercially made in Australia, when there is such an enormous disparity between the local and overseas prices. If the Government insists* on the payment of the high duty imposed? on engines of this type, the primary producers will have to pay a higher rate than would otherwise be necessary for the electric current required by them for their ordinary undertakings as the Nymboida undertaking supplies hundreds of farms, and will not, in any case, spend the additional 20 per cent, to get an untried Australian machine. Before tenders were called for, I urged the Minister that The he should use his discretionary power in this matter. The undertaking to which I have referred is carrying on a work which will give employment to 360 men in the next two years at a time when unemployment is rife. If it is forced to pay an excessive price for this engine, it will not be able to provide the employment that would otherwise be given in the extension of its work. I am satisfied that, if the Minister looks carefully into this matter, he must give it favourable consideration.",70
227,Mr WHITE,NEW SOUTH WALES,"Balaclava) [11.36] - I was rather surprised and amused at the speech of the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Corser). I had supposed thai members of the Country party were low tariffists, but, judging by the honourable member's speech, and hie support of bounties on cotton and certain other primary products, they may be more correctly described as primary and geographical protectionists. The honourable member said thai members of the Nationalist party had beeD guided in their attitude by certain literature, but 1 say emphatically thai I have not read any of the literature to which he referred. I am surethat the honourable member for Henty (Mr. Gullett), when Minister for Trade and Customs, made no promise of a 55 per cent. duty. Such an impost would give an actual protection of 112 per cent., or more. The engines under consideration"" are used for pumping plants for irrigation work, and in butter factories, and the heavy duty imposed on them will penalize the man on the land just as much as the duties on engines of a smaller type. The honourable member for ""Wide Bay spoke as though diesel engines were used only for particular purposes; but I point out that they wil l shortly be employed even as the power units of aeroplanes. I give the firm at Maryborough full credit for enterprise, and it well deserves to be classed as a first-rate engineering concern. It has survived adversity, and has turned out efficient, work. The honourable member remarked that this firm is making engines in all sizes from 100 to 1,000 horse-power. Ou referring to the Tariff Board's decisions, Nos. 221 to 227, I find that on the 6th February, 1931, nn engine of 400 horse-power was admitted free. On the same day another engine of 300 horse-power was admitted duty free. Mr BERNAJU> CORSER - The not then made one; this is only a new enterprise.",70
228,Mr WHITE,NEW SOUTH WALES,The honourable member is shifting his ground. This duty was in operation before that date.,71
229,Mr BERNARD CORSER,NEW SOUTH WALES,It took them two years to get ready.,71
230,Mr WHITE,NEW SOUTH WALES,The honourable member has claimed that this firm can make engines of all sizes.,71
231,Mr BERNARD CORSER,NEW SOUTH WALES,So it,71

233,Mr BERNARD COKSER,NEW SOUTH WALES,Before were made in Australia.,71
234,Mr WHITE,NEW SOUTH WALES,"They would be admitted again tomorrow if the request were made to the Minister. The honourable member does not realise, what is well known to any man who has had experience of a machine shop, that the making of engines ranging from 100 to 1,000 horse-power would mean the employment of more capital than any engineering f i r m in Australia possesses.",71
235,Mr BERNARD CORSER,NEW SOUTH WALES,Nonsense !,71

240,Mr WHITE,NEW SOUTH WALES,"In Great Britain, wliere the highest standard in engine construction has been reached, and where various types are made, the different firms specialize in one type.

British, 70 per cent, intermediate, and 75 per cent, general. I have no objection to a duty being imposed on certain types of switches which are very simply made, and can be turned out in large quantities, and the price of which has been reduced; but there are other types of a highly technical and very expensive character, which are not being made to any extent in Australia, and which it is absolutely* necessary should be thoroughly guaranteed because on their integrity depends the safety of thousands of pounds worth of machinery. I desire an undertaking from the Minister that duty will not be imposed on that particular type of switch.",71

As a matter of interest,' it may be stated that apart from the home market Australia in the past has been Great Britain's best customer for electrical goods. There are ten manufacturers in Australia today making this switch gear. They are in a position to supply practically all types of industrial switch gear, and a substantial percentage of switch gear for power stations and substations, particularly that with voltages under 33,000.",72
