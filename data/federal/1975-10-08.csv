0,NA,Unknown,"Perhaps it was a response to a rather rash apfacUitate proach that he might have made to the member as he has to other people he has met in his career. I have a copy of the Sandilands report with and although I have not had a chance to consider it fully I am intrigued by page 3 of the report which states in part: However, we have not had the time or the resources research into all the practical impUcations of introducing such a systemThat is, current cost accountingand we assumed it was not the intention that we should so. That seems a rather curious conclusion. The right honourable member may well be aware that the Sandilands Committee has recommended a about royal commission before any definitive action taken by a government. So there is a long way to go. As far as this Government is concerned, not want to be placed in the position where some sort of heated debate arises and people are forced to take firm and dogmatic decisions opposition to each other. All I have said is that on the basis of the assessments which have been made so far, and consistent with statements I made in the Budget Speech in this House, it a seems that there is room for a great deal more considerauon of some of the complex issues which arise in the recommendations of the without notice. Mathews report. It is the intention of the ment to address itself to those issues. I suggested that it would be helpful if the Opposition cared to do that also. Finally, I would not care to hear anyone from the Opposition, least of all the rightAustraha's honourable gentleman, moralise by implication about the obligation of a government in response to the findings of any committee. I have a clear recollection of what happened to the Vernon the Committee and its report. NA",17
1,Mr FULTON,TORRES STRAI T ISLAND S,I preface my question to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs by referring to allegations which were made last weekend by the Premier of Queensland relating to the ties of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs relation to the Torres Strait Islands. Has the Mindisclosures ister yet received a report from his Department in the Torres about those allegations?,17
2,Mr LES JOHNSON,TORRES STRAI T ISLAND S,"I have received a partment report. It established that the Premier has made allegations which represent, in most cases, either half truths or non-truths. It is an amazing situIslands. ation. The Premier has gone up to the Islands and has made a lot of contentions in connection with matters which arose out of initiatives were taken by my predecessor who proposed a number of self-help projects over 14 of the Islands involving an expenditure of approximately $ lm. The Premier has made allegations me that equipment has been off-loaded in the wrong places. Some of those allegations are true. Weather conditions prevented equipment from being landed in therightplace so it was offto loaded for trans-shipment. He has contended that cement has been left to waste on Saibai Island whereas in fact it was off-loaded on Dauan Island and was covered effectively to protect it from the weather. He has made allegations do that a vessel chartered by the Department, the Miss Doreen, was not utilised. In fact it was chartered by a co-operative and it has been used almost continuously. He has made complaints the hovercraft to the effect that it is hardly is effective whereas there have been only 2 cancellations of that hovercraft in respect of 400 hours I do of operation. There are many other matters which cannot stand up to examination. I believe the Premier should apologise to the Torres Strait in Islanders on whom he has reflected.",17
3,Mr SINCLAIR,TORRES STRAI T ISLAND S,I take a point of order. In view of the nature of this reply I ask the Minister to make statement after question time. It is obviously a prepared answer if it is presented to the House in that form instead of a response to a question Govern Mr SPEAKER-The question was in order and the Minister is in order in answering it.,17
4,Mr LES JOHNSON,TORRES STRAI T ISLAND S,"What has been far north has been the Premier's deep south. He likes to keep it that way and he appears to resent the presence there of the Australian Government which, for the firsttimein history of the Torres Strait Islanders, is encouraging initiative, autonomy and independence. The Premier even told the Islanders who asked for assistance in respect of some of these transport matters: 'Why do you not get your the transport where you get your money?' that does not appear to be a very co-operative attitude in activithe matter of helping these people. in The Queensland Premier has not made all the which could be made about disasters Strait Islands. For example, I am given to understand that the Queensland Deof Aboriginal and Islanders Advancement and Fisheries, hired a barge to carry a bulldozer worth $80,000 to one of the Torres Strait That barge was registered for work in the Thursday Island harbour. Yet it was taken past that harbour into hazardous waters. The which barge capsized en route and dumped this exto pensive bulldozer worth $80,000 into deep water. It has not been recovered up to this very day. The poor unfortunate crew of, I think, 4 persons with 3 passengers lived on lemonade and beer salvaged from the submerged' cabin of the upturned barge by making regular dives. Now there is an inquiry into this matter by the harbourmaster of Thursday Island",17
5,Mr SPEAKER,TORRES STRAI T ISLAND S,Order! I tliink that the answer by the Minister is becoming extraordinarily long.,18
6,Mr LES JOHNSON,TORRES STRAI T ISLAND S,It seems to me that there are many disclosures which could be made about the Torres Strait Islands. If there were a thorough inquiry into the administration of the Islands I think there would be a lot of egg left on the face of the Queensland Premier. NA,18
7,Mr LYNCH,OVERSEAS LOAN RAISING,"I ask the Prime Minister the following questions: Is there any authority outstanding for any money lender, intermediary or agent to raise a loan for the Australian Government? If so, what are the details? Are any of his senior Ministers presently involved in major overseas loan raisings?",18
8,Mr WHITLAM,OVERSEAS LOAN RAISING,"No . NA NA Mr BENNETIVI direct my question to the Minister for Administrative Services. Is it a fact that negotiations took place with the Tonkin Labor Government regarding the implementation ofjoint electoral rolls for Western Australia? Is it a fact also that the Court Liberal-Country Party Government has refused to complete the agreement? If so, what are its reasons for this action.",18
9,Mr DALY,WESTERN AUSTRALIA,"I anticipated that an important question Uke this might be asked. I have been able to ascertain that certain negotiations were entered into in regard to this matter. I will explain it in full to the honourable member. The Australian Government did approach the Tonkin Government regarding the implementation of joint electoral rolls for Western Australia. On 6 December 1972 a joint report was submitted by the Commonwealth Electoral Officer for Western Australia and the State Chief Electoral Officer indicating the feasibility of such an arrangement. On 17 October 1973, the arrangement was signed by His ExceUency the Lieutenant-Governor of Western Australia and forwarded to the State Chief Electoral Officer for Western Australia. On 6 November 1973 the arrangement was signed by His Excellency The Governor General. On 22 November 1973 the State Chief Electoral Officer for Western Australia advised that the Attorney-General had decided that the fixing of a date for implementation of the joint roUs arrangement be deferred . until amending legislation to the State Electoral Act was passed. This was expected to be in August 1974. On 30 March 1974 the Western Australian State elections resulted in a change of Government. On 31 July 1974 Mr T. D. Evans asked the following question in the Legislative Assembly of Western Australia: (1) Does the Government intend to legislate by amendment of the Electoral Act to facilitate the use of a joint Commonwealth-State electoral roll at the next State general elections? (2) If not, why not? Mr 0""Neil, the Minister representing the Minister for Justice, rephed: The matter is still under consideration. On 12 November 1974 verbal advice was received from the Australian Electoral Officer for Western Australia that the matter was still under consideration. On 14 November 1974, Mr B. T. Burke asked the following question in the Legislative Assembly of Western Australia: (3) Does the Government intend to proceed with plans to amalgamate the Australian and Western Australian electoral rolls? Mr CNeil, the Minister representing the Minister for Justice, rephed: (3) No action is presently being contemplated. On 7 October 1975 verbal inquiries were made of the State Chief Electoral Officer for Western Australia. He has informed me that so far as he is aware there has been no change in the attitude of the Government of Western Australia towards the implementation of the joint roUs arrangement. Although the formal document for inaugurating the joint rolls arrangement was signed by the Lieutenant-Governor on behalf of Western Australia and the Governor General on behalf of Australia it cannot be implemented until the State enacts certain legislation. It appears that the present Western Australian Government has gone cold on the scheme, but it is difficult to understand why this should be so bearing in mind that not only would it provide a better roll for State purposes but it would also save the State some thousands of dollars annually. I think the only reason can be that this action is part of a Western Australian Government attempt to gerrymander the boundaries of Western Australian State electorates which it is in the process of doing at this time at the dictates, as usual, of the infamous negotiators of false boundaries, the Country Party in Western Australia. Mr Garland- Mr Speaker, I ask that the paper from which the Minister has been reading be tabled.",18
10,Mr SPEAKER,WESTERN AUSTRALIA,There has been a request that the paper from which the Minister quoted be tabled. Mr Daly-It is confidential.,19
11,Mr SPEAKER,WESTERN AUSTRALIA,The Minister says it is confidential. NA,19
12,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,XL PETROLEUM PTY LTD,"I ask the Prime Minister a quesuon. Has he yet confirmed with the honourable member for Henty or the Minister for Minerals and Energy statements of fact which the chairman of XL Petroleum Pty Ltd has made to the Opposition and which are reported in the Australian Financial Review this morning? Has the Prime Minister confirmed that the Chairman of XL Petroleum asked the honourable member for Henty to deliver personally his letter which stated that ACTU-Solo Enterprises Pty Ltd was buying its crude for an enormous premium? Has he confirmed the fact that after deUvering the letter personally the reply of the honourable member for Henty to the chairman of XL Petroleum, who claims he has a witness, was to the effect that unfortunately the Minister cannot do anything about the approval of the sale because there have already been other deals at a premium? There is a precedent for transactions at prices higher than the Government approved price. Mr Whitlam I have not seen the article. NA",19
13,Mr COATES,TOBACCO ADVERTISING,"Is the Minister for Health aware that tobacco manufacturers are diverting promotional expenditure into sponsorship and other forms of advertising to avoid the intent of restrictions on television and radio advertising tobacco products? Is it still intended totally to prohibit electronic media advertising of tobacco products in September next year? If so, what can the Minister do to prevent companies from ing the spirit of the restrictions?",19
14,Dr EVERINGHAM,TOBACCO ADVERTISING,"I am not aware of the intentions of the tobacco companies but I know from what has happened overseas that when broadcasting advertising has been banned they have channelled vast resources into advertising in colour magazines, on billboards, in cinemas and other areas and I have no doubt that would happen to some extent at least in this country when we impose our ban, as we have promised, in September next year. The States have agreed on very limited restraints, I should say, on the promotion of smoking. They have agreed that they will move to have a warning incorporated in all forms of advertising by the same date-September next year. I should have hoped they would agree to something with a little more bite. However, let us not get things out of perspective. If all tobacco advertising were banned immediately it would not restrain the tendency for increased consumption of tobacco. The Soviet Union, Sweden and other countries have had complete bans on all forms of tobacco advertising but have still suffered from an increase in consumption. Obviously what has to happen is that we have to give smoking an image which makes it repulsive. NA NA",19
15,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,ENERGY,I ask the Prime Minister whether he will reaffirm his confidence in the administration of his portfoUo by the Minister for Minerals and Energy.,19
16,Mr WHITLAM,ENERGY,Certainly I wiU. I do not quite understand what the honourable gentleman is driving at in these questions. I noted that he did not speak yesterday on a matter referring to the Royal Commission on Petroleum. The Right Honourable Leader of the National Country Party wiU not say outside the House-eve n on television-the things that he says in the House. I reiterate what I said(Honourable members interjecting),19
17,Mr SPEAKER,ENERGY,Order.' The Prime Minister will resume his seat. If honourable gentlemen want question time to continue they will behave themselves. I wiU not have members of the Opposition and front bench members of the Government shouting across the chamber while a Minister is trying to answer a question or while a member is trying to ask one. If it happens again of I will terminate question time.,19
18,Mr WHITLAM,ENERGY,I reiterate what I said last week: A royal commissioner has inquired into floutthese matters. The royal commissioner was appointed a judge of the Supreme Court of New South Wales 20 years ago.,19
19,Mr STALEY,ENERGY,B y a Labor goverament.,19
20,Mr WHITLAM,ENERGY,"An honourable member interjects: 'By a Labor Government'. He was appointed by a Labor government. He has also had the confidence of successive governments, as has been shown by the fact that he has been asked to undertake, for non-Labor governments, inquiries such as royal commissions and committees of inquiry. He was not a member of the Australian Labor Party at any time in his career as far as I know. Mr Speaker, I beheve that interjections Uke that, since they are heard by a number of people, have to be answered. They are completely unworthy suggestions. If any honourable member believes that the judge in question is unfit to carry out this royal commission, procedures are open to the House to express that view. But it is quite improper by way of interjections or insinuations in questions to cast reflections on the judge. After all, the judge.cannot answer. He can deal only with matters which come before him as a judge or as a royal commissioner. The matters which have been said in this House by the Leader of the Opposition, the Leader of the National Countiy Party and various other worthies could all be put before the royal commission. Mr Ellicott-They were before the royal commission.",19
21,Mr WHITLAM,ENERGY,"T he honourable and Minister learned member for Wentworth interjected. I mission have no doubt that if he sought to appear before the royal commission he would be heard by the royal commission, and that would seem to be proper course for him to take if he has matters relevant to the terms of reference commission. The Government asked the royal commissioner to inquire into this specific matter. The persons concerned were represented by counsel. There could scarcely be more experience in ascertaining and interpreting matters of fact. In those circumstances I believe, as I said last week, that it is completely unworthy for honourable members-in some cases learned members-to be casting aspersions on the brought findings of the royal commission. The Leader the Opposition is pursuing this line. He has not sought by himself or by counsel to put any facts before the royal commissioner. The royal combody? mission is still sitting. It is open for him to put any new facts or arguments before the royal commember's mission. I invite him to do so. NA",20
22,Mr JACOBI,NATURAL DISASTER INSURANCE,"I address my question to the Treasurer. In view of the Senate's rejection of Australian Government Insurance Corporauon Bill and particularly the nadonal interest vision which would extend insurance cover to months ago. people in those areas subject to the devastation of natural disasters, I ask the Minister: Can he indicate what action the Government now intends to take to set up a natural disaster insurance mission or scheme? The Minister will appreciate that such coverage is a matter of urgency:",20
23,Mr HAYDEN,NATURAL DISASTER INSURANCE,"The Treasury has been working on proposals in this area for sometime.The matters are quite complex and involve detailed research and consideration. We have received submissions from the industry and we have appreciated the communications we have had with various representatives of the industry. I hope that we will be in a position soon to make a statement on this proposal. I ought to observe'for the record the very helpful points of view which the honourable member who asked this question has submitted to me, to my predecessors and to the Treasury fromtimeto time on this subject. ACTU-SOL O ENTERPRISES PTY LTD",20
24,Mr ANTHONY,NATURAL DISASTER INSURANCE,"I preface my question to the Prime Minister by saying that the Prime Minister has been quite emphatic today and on several other occasions concerning his acceptance of the findings of the Royal Commission concerning the alleged deception of the Government by ACTU-Solo Enterprises Pty Ltd. Is the Prime equaUy emphatic in accepting the Com's view that-to quote from the report-'it would be inequitable and unjust to companies that have abided by the Government pohcy that the ACTU-Solo should, as a result of misrepresentation and deceit, acquire any right to further alof the royal locations ' of crude oil?",20
25,Mr WHITLAM,NATURAL DISASTER INSURANCE,I made it plain last week that I accept the Commission's findings. I can a judge with only reiterate that. NA,20
26,Mr REYNOLDS,AUSTRALIAN LEGAL AID OFFICE,Can the Attorney-General advise the House when the Legal Aid Bill will be on for debate in the House and the Senof ate? When can honourable members be confident that the Australian Legal Aid Office will be able to operate as an independent statutory,20
27,Mr ENDERBY,AUSTRALIAN LEGAL AID OFFICE,I understand the honourable concern. I hope the Bill will be again brought before the House in the very near future but one has to take account of what I understand was a Press statement put out yesterday from the Opposition parties to the effect that they were going to move tb defer consideration of the Bill the when it does reappear in the House and in the Senate. One can only deplore such a decision. proDebate on the Bill was commenced here about 2,20
28,Mr WHITLAM,AUSTRALIAN LEGAL AID OFFICE,Fou r months ago.,20
29,Mr ENDERBY,AUSTRALIAN LEGAL AID OFFICE,"I am corrected; it was 4 commonths ago. Surely that is much moretimethan is normally required for adequate consideration of a Bill. The fact is that the Opposition parties do not believe in legal aid. There is plenty of record and plenty of evidence of that fact. The Opposition spokesman on matters affecting the Department of the Attorney-General, Senator Greenwood, is on record as having said that he opposes in principle the Australian Legal Aid Office. That means he opposes legal aid. The Victorian Attorney-General, a prominent member of the Liberal Party, also is on record as having said that he opposes in principle the Australian Legal Aid Office. Wherever one looks one sees confirmation of that same fact. The Opposition parties do not want legal aid facUities extended to people in need. Further confirmation, if it were necessary, can be obtained from other facts. If one looks back to the last year of the Liberal-Country Party Government, 1972, one finds that not only was there no such thing, no such concept, no such idea as an Australian Legal Aid Office-ther e certainly were not 30 offices such as now operate around the countrybut the sum total of its expenditure on the subject of legal aid to the Australian States was in the neighbourhood, from memory, of only $300,000- a token sum. It is laughable when one thinks of the nature of the problem-of the extent of the need. This Government allocated in the recent Budget in excess of $ 16m to meet the need that the Opposition parties assess at something hke $300,000.1 put to the House that that is the best evidence of the priority, the low priority, the absence of priority that the Opposition parties give to legal aid. The best evidence of this lack of priority falls from the lips of the Leader of the Opposition himself who said a little while ago in one of his early contributions, if one can call it that, to the Budget debate that a Liberal-National Country Party Government in future would dismantle the Australian Legal Aid Office. The pubhc should be left in no sense of uncertainty about the intentions of the Opposition parties in regard to legal aid in Australia. There is certainty and it is that they do not believe in it. NA",20
30,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,PETROLEUM ROYAL COMMISSION,"I ask the Prime Minister: Since he is so determined to support in full aU the findings of the Royal Commissioner into petroleum, Mr Justice Collins, why has his Government so far ignored the finding of the Royal Commission that a second refinery should be buUt in the Sydney area at Kurnell and why has he allowed the Minister for Minerals and Energy to pursue an entirely alternative and different proposal?",21
31,Mr WHITLAM,PETROLEUM ROYAL COMMISSION,The matter is under active consideration. NA,21
32,Mr MULDER,FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS,Can the Treasurer advise when the statement onfinancialtransactions for the month and quarter of September will be released? Is he in a position to give some indication of what the statement will reflect?,21
33,Mr HAYDEN,FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS,"The statement on the financial transactions for September should be released early this afternoon. The statement will show a deficit of $816m. I hope I can forestall the usual foolishness that we have each month when this statement is released, displayed",21
34,Mr SINCLAIR,FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS,"I rise on a point of order, Mr Speaker. The Treasurer has just indicated in his response that a statement is to be released this afternoon. Again, this is a matter which surely should be presented to this Parliament as a ministerial statement and not in response to a question without notice.",21
35,Mr SPEAKER,FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS,Order! The Minister is entitled to answer the question asked.,21
36,Mr HAYDEN,FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS,"I am afraid that it is not a statement of that nature; it is a statistical statement. If the honourable member ever bothered to read such statements he would be aware of this. Obviously he has not listened to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition try to make fallacious points on this subject at the end of each month. I do not blame him for not listening. But in any case, in an effort to forestall the usual sort of foolishness which we see displayed by the Opposition I should like to point out that the statement will indicate that although the September quarter is completed and the figures are related for that quarter in the statement, less than a quarter of budgeted outlays for the year were spent in the September quarter and less than one-sixth of the budgeted receipts have been received for the September quarter. Overall, the picture is consistent with the seasonal pattern of budget accounts. For instance, the September quarter deficit as a proportion of total deficit is 0.7 per cent. Last year the figure was abnormally low at 0.4 per cent. But in 1973-74 the proportion was 3.4 per cent; in 1972-73,1.1 percent; in 1971-72,5.1 per cent; in 1970-71, 43.2 per cent; in 1969-70, 1.4 percent; in 1968-69,1.5 percent; in 1967-68 and 1966-67, 0.9 per cent; and in 1965-66, 1.4 per cent. That is, the situation is not abnormal and indeed with the exception of last year represents the lowest level, in the terms in which I am quoting, for a decade. I think what must also be borne in mind is that receipts are down because of a delay in collections of coal export duty and crude petroleum excise. In consequence the October receipts will be boosted by more than $100m. In the current quarter nearly $500m will be collected as company tax collections. I am indicating thesefiguresto show the unevenness with which the fiscal transactions proceed in the course of the year, and therefore the complete crudity and stupidity of Opposition statements based on a simple multiplication of either a monthlyfigureby twelve or a quarterly figure by four- a calculation which produces a completely unsubstantiable result. But perhaps the most welcome result which is showing up at present, indicating that we are having a significant success in a very difficult economic situation in managing the economy, is that the rate of increase in average weekly earnings is falling back at this stage to a much lower level than we had projected when we prepared the Budget. We prepared the Budget on projections of a 22 per cent increase in average weekly earnings..In fact average weekly earnings are now increasing at a rate of 17 per cent a year; that is, they are increasing at a rate 5 percentage points down on what we had anticipated when the Budget was drawn together. That is a very welcome result and indicated that success is being achieved. We are holding our expenditure level pretty much as we had projected and in turn, because the increase in average weekly earnings is falUng, receipts too will be falUng. I am not guaranteeing that we will continue to have the success. a long way to go yet; there is a difficult haul still in front of this country in restoring economic health, but if that projection continues and if have even more success on the wage front, and this wiU reflect itself in the cost front generaUy and overaU in a more successful econonuc result than we had predicted when we puUed the BudOpposition get together, the deficit will be larger than had anticipated when we put the Budget together. But that would be a totally welcome result and consistent with a much healthier objective being achieved in economic managecountiy, ment. I quote from a Budget statement.",21
37,Mr SPEAKER,FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS,Order! The Minister's answer is getting extraordinarily long.,22
38,Mr HAYDEN,FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS,"I will conclude on this. I quote from a Budget statement to indicate that well recognised principle. The quote is: Should average earnings rise less than assumed, taxation revenue would be less than estimated and the Budget would be greater. It would not follow, however, that Budget objective of maintaining an environment conducive to balanced economic growth would be adversely affected such a development. On the contrary, such a result would be more likely to serve the broad economic purposes to Budget pohcy is directed. The source of that is page 40 of the statements attached to the 1969-70 Budget Speech. SimUar comments were made in the 1970-71, 1971-72 and 1972-73 budgets at pages 4, 5, 11 and 10 respectively. I hope that kills the fallacious nonsense that we hear from the Opposition from time to time on this matter. NA NA",22
39,Mr ELLICOTT,PETROLEUM,"My question is directed to the Attorney-General. I refer him to the third report of the Royal Commission on Petroleum. I also refer him to the answers given by the Prime Minister that the Government accepts the findings of that Commission. I ask the Attorney General: Has he considered that report? I also ask: Has he, pursuant to his undoubted responsibUity, set in train a consideration of whether criminal proceedings should be taken against Mr Souter and other persons involved in the deal discussed in that report?",22
40,Mr ENDERBY,PETROLEUM,I can simply answer the question this way: The report is still under consideration. NA,22
41,Mr INNES,POLITICAL CAMPAIGN FUNDS,Does the Minister for Administrative Services propose to introduce legislation during the present session to provide for pubUc disclosure of the source of campaign funds by There is political parties in Australia?,22
42,Mr DALY,POLITICAL CAMPAIGN FUNDS,"Legislatio n providing for the disclosure of campaign funds by individuals and we poltiical parties has twice been introduced to this House and another place and rejected on both occasions, despite the fact that the previous Leader of the Opposition indicated that the would support it. The need for this we legislation has since become more apparent, particularly this week when we have seen the Leader of the National Country Party of Australia, the lackey of the oU interests of this acting as a paid mercenary in this Parliament for oil interests because of the funds that have been provided to members of this Party. Everybody knows he speaks in this Parliament from briefs presented to him by the oU interests because they are putting in huge amounts of this is a funds to defeat this Government. The Leader of the National Country Party is deficit acting in this Parliament as a CharUe MCCarthy the for the oU interests simply because he and his Party are paid by the oU companies to bring into by this Parliament the oU companies' case to defeat which this Government if they possibly can. We find also that the Liberal Party is now getting into the scene. We find that the oil companies have the Leader of the Opposition speaking for them today in the Parhament. They have even paid the gentleman who was not going to take a brief to get on the front bench of the Opposition. He is asking the Attorney-General questions today. Every honourable member opposite today is so working in this Parliament, and they have to because the oil interests have put in huge funds and are calling the tune in this Parhament.",22

70,Mrs CHILD,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS," Mr Speaker, my attenand don has been drawn to several paragraphs in today's Australian Financial Review. I should like to tell the House that I could not spoken in such terms as I am not really quite so familiar with aspects of the oil industry to have spoken that way. I am also not aware of any leged precedent set by this Government on sales. I have taken letters from Mr Sykes to the Minisstanding ter for Minerals and Energy (Mr Connor) and other Ministers on many occasions during a period of 18 months. While I was aware of the resentations. contents of some of the letters, many of them were hand-written and very difficult to decipher. I certainly refute the suggestion that I could be aware of the contents of all of them.",25
71,Mr LLOYD,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS," Mr Speaker, I wish to make a personal explanation. Yesterday the Minister for Health (Dr Everingham) when replying to a Dorothy Dix question from the honourable member for Evans (Mr Mulder) not claimed that the information I gave the House Thursday night concerning Australian Capital Territory hospitals was incorrect. The Minister incorrect. In the House on Thursday night I referred to ngures from the Minister's own departsonal mental estimates, division 327, which showed quite clearly that the Department's contribution to the Canberra Hospital will be reduced from $10,570,000 to $7,660,000 and to the Woden has not done so. Valley Hospital from $7,443,700 to $6,056,000.1 acknowledged that the estimates stated that was because of Medibank funding of 50 per of the total costs. The Minister stated in the House yesterday that the Budget allocation for the 2 hospitals had increased by 28 per Minister should check whether his figure relates to all ACT health expenditure, including Medibank, which comes from another department, and not to the hospitals. Alternatively he should instruct his department",25
72,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Order! The honourable gentleman is debating the question.,25
73,Mr LLOYD,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"The serious misrepresentation concerns another matter which is the number of resident medical officers in the 2 hospitals. In speech on Thursday night I said that it was namely. hoped to recruit 37 resident medical officers in the ACT hospitals for the commencement of 1975 but only 29 were initiaUy recruited and appointed. In May the Canberra Hospitals Board sought the Minister's permission which was forthcoming, for the Canberra and Woden Valley hospitals to increase the resident medical officer estabhshment by nine for 1976 to a total of forty-eight. Staff ceilings have been invoked since then which has prevented the recruitment appointment for 1976 of any number of resident medical officers in excess of those on strength on 1 July 1975. Those staff ceilings have apply equally to interns and registrars.",25

81,Mr SPEAKER,EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Hodges) proposing that a definite matter of pubUc impormy tance be submitted to the House for discussion, The lack of employment opportunities for school and others seeking to enter the work force at the end I call upon those members who approve proposed discussion to rise in their places. (More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their places)",25
82,Mr HODGES,EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES,"In dealing phUosophy with this matter of pubhc importance on the of employment opportunities for school leavers and others seeking to enter the work force at the end of 1975 I want to highUght the graveness the problem and the importance of providing for our younger generations. I want to point to the situation that existed when the Labor Governtomorrow. ment took office, and then to look at the causes of the problem and some of the solutions which should be adopted. One of the gravest problems facing the nation today, although it tends come caught up in and overshadowed by the bigLabor ger issues of high inflation, industrial unrest, economic crisis and high unemployment, of people, which it is a part, is the plight facing young school leavers and othersseeking to enter the work force for the first time. Government bers can say what they like. They can bleat until the cows come home as far as I am concerned. But the lack of employment opportunities largely, and indeed almost entirely, caused by the poUcies of this Government and the drastic changes instituted by this Government. Now, in mentioning school leavers and others, I refer to people. the problem of young people from technical colleges, colleges of advanced education and universities. It is a grave problem and the gravity of the problem cannot be assessed in the short term because it is in the long term, I believe, this nation may feel the fuU effects of the fact there are very few job opportunities avaUable school leavers today. If we all address ourselves to the problem and look back to when we were this age, this difficult stage in Ufe, when we to make a decision as to what we would do, can aU recall ourfirstjob, be it a parttimejob a full time job. The change from school life college life to the work force is a major change say the least. I feel for these people today as are pushed from place to place, business house to business house, and factory to factory, in their efforts to find employment. Their confidence surely be shattered and one wonders just what deep adverse psychological effects this experinot ence may have on them in the future. They cerwe tainly are facing a difficult period because job opportunities are just not avaUable. They will have a confused state of mind, no security, a sense of not being wanted and in many instances they will turn to crime and to drugs. It is all leavers for the Minister for Housing and Construction of 1975. (Mr Riordan) to look startled but this in actual of the fact will be the situation. I want to point up the importance of providing for the younger generation. I refer to Plato, the Greek phUosopher who in about the year 400 BC made reference to the younger generation. The is as vahd today as it was in 400 BC. lack He made the comment that so long as the younger generation is and continues to be well brought up the ship of state will have a fair voyof age; otherwise the consequences are better left unsaid. That phUosophy was right then and it is right now. These young people are our adults of I maintain that our social structure depends largely on our famUy life. Our society must be to belaid on good foundations. If members of the Government would only go out into their the electorates and talk to the parents of these to the headmasters and principals of the high schools, and find out their feelings, they would realise the concern that exists in our commemmunity today. I want them to talk to these people. These are the people-the teachers and the headmasters-wh o help to mould the future is of our young people. If Government members would only do this, I believe, they would put a greater effort into finding a means of alleviating this difficult situation of finding jobs for young There is a great amount of work done by officers of the Commonwealth Employment Service in association with Rotary clubs, Lions clubs and Apex clubs. Service clubs generally have that been active infindingjob opportunities. Various that courses are carried out. But there is no point in for having courses for young people if there are no jobs for them to go to at a later date. If honourat able members examine the situation when the had Labor Party took office they will find that there we were about 100 000 registered as unemployed. or We were told by the present Prime Minister (Mr or Whitlam), the Leader of the Opposition of the to day, that we could not Uve with 100 000 out of they work. We were told that we could not live with an inflation rate of approximately 4.5 per cent. It was not long before our unemployment figure will had reached 150 000. The number of unemployed rose to 200 000 and since January it has been below 230 000. The Government said could not live with an unemployment figure of 100 000 and we could not live with an inflation rate of 4.5 per cent. The level of inflation rose to 10 per cent within months and is currently running at 17 per cent, but probably a more acright curatefigurewould be 20 per cent. We were told that inflation was imported. I wonder how inflation was imported into this nation. If we look at the Australian nation today we find that even if the rest of the world was not operating we would probably be as self-supporting and as well off as any other nation. Business confidence was good when this Government took office. Expansion programs were going on. Job opportunities for school leavers were quite plentiful. I quote from the introductory remarks to the policy speech of the then Leader of the Opposition, Mr Gough Whitlam, during the 1972 Federal election campaign. Just Usten to these hollow words: Do you believe that Australia can afford another 3 years like the last 20 months? Are you prepared to maintain at the head of your affairs a coalition which has lurched into ment piled on embarrassment week after week? Will you accept another 3 years of waiting for next week's crisis, next week's blunder? Will you again entrust the nation's economy to the men who deliberately, but needlessly, created Australia's worse unemployment for 10 years? Or to the same men who have presided over the worse inflation for 20 years?",26
83,Mr LLOYD,EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES,Who said that?,27
84,Mr HODGES,EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES,"That was said by the then Leader of the Opposition, the Honourable Gough Whidam, in 1972. This Government has presided over the worse inflation, the worse unemployment, the worse industrial strife and the worse economic crisis this nation has known since Federation. These are the big issues, much talked about issues, but tucked away we have a problem which is not highlighted, not cared about, by this Government-the problem of school leavers looking for work. This Government has presided over the worse situation in relation to the lack of job opportunities for school leavers ever known in our history. Our school leavers' pUght is the by-product of the mismanagement of this nation's affairs by this Government. I use the word 'by-product' in its worse sense, as one might use it in terms of noxious waste from a manufacturing industry. It is unfortunate that the by-product of this Government is that today we have so many school leavers in our community looking forjobs. I turn to a question in relation to the latest unemployment ngures that was asked in the Senate by Senator Everett on 9 September and answered by Senator James MCClelland, the Minister for Labor and Immigration. The Minister answered: My Department has prepared for me some estimates unemployment for the coming year, and I underline that they are only estimates. In particular, I think we conscious of the fact that a record number of school leaversapproaching, it is estimated, a quarter of a milhon-wil l come on to the labour market by next January. The best estimate that the Department is able to give, and of course it is nothing in which we take any pleasure, is that actual unemployed, including school leavers, who register for unemployment, could approach 400 000 members of the labour force in 1976. He went on to elaborate that statement. Two hundred and fifty thousand school leavers are to be plunged onto the labour market in a matter of months. We hear of Government restrictions on the growth of the PubUc Service, and of course this will mean there will be fewer opportunities for employment. Those who are now back at school total quite a number, I believe. I do not know whether the figures are avaUable but many young people who finished their education at the end of 1974 were forced to go back to school in crisis after crisis, embarrassthe 1975 school year. What will the figure be in 1976 for those who cannot obtain satisfactory employment at the end of this year? Our high schools and our coUeges are going to be crowded out. According to the available figures, there were 9335 registered school leavers in August this year and in September this number had dropped by only 900 to 8466. Mr Kevin Cairns-They do not care.",27
85,Mr HODGES,EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES,"They do not care, as the honourable member for LUley says. If we look at the number of job vacancies we find that it also is down. In his Budget Speech the Treasurer (Mr Hayden) mentioned that the Government refused to increase the dole for 16 to 18-yearolds. The Government is trying to force young people out to work. This is obvious, but what are these people to do when there are no jobs to go to? I would like the Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr Riordan), who is sitting at the table, to answer that question. The intent, of course, is to try to force these people out to work. Perhaps $36 for a single person is sufficient to Uve on and therefore, the Government says, it will not increase the benefits and so encourage people to be bludgers all their Uves. Where do these people go when there are no jobs? I suggest that we should apply the remedy at the root cause rather than adopt measures such as those taken by the Treasurer. I look next at the cause of the problems. I believe that basically the poUcies of this Government have caused the situation which exists. The Prices Justification Tribunal is squeezing companies for profits, which means that there is less expansion by companies. The repercussions are quite widespread. If companies do not expand, of job opportunities of course are not available. have to be Drastic changes from the promotion of a free enterprise system, such as we had under 23 years of Liberal-Country Party government, have been implemented far too quickly by this Government. I liken this to a person buying a thriving business and then closing the front door and putting a sign on it directing all the customers into the side street or around to the side lane. This is exacdy what this Government has done. Another measure that has caused problems and reduced the number of job opportunities is the drying up of overseas capital by the restrictions that this Government has placed on the inflow of such capital to help develop this nation. The great taxation grab which this Government has indulged in is also a matter for concern. There is no tive these days for people to save to expand and spend their money. The strangulation of the mining industry and oil exploration companies has had a very profound effect on the number of available job opportunities. What are the solutions? I beheve that there must be restraint by the unions. There must be wage restraint. I think the statement made by a former Treasurer, the Honourable Frank Crean- I do not know whether he was the second or third last Treasurer-that one man's pay increase would be another man's job is true. The trade unions must show greater resimmense. traint than they are showing. It is of no use this Government trying to dissociate itself from trade union movement. It is pandering to the trade union movement and at the moment is in a dreadful bind. This Government is synonymous with the trade unions, and we all know the way in which they are ruining this country today. There must be genuine efforts to ness activity in this country. It is of no use this Government talking about stimulating the private sector of the economy; there have to be genuine efforts. No businessman in this country, be he large or small, is going to respond government that on the one hand says it is interested in private enterprise and on the other hand shows duplicity at every turn. This ment must put money back into people's pockets. This is a further solution to the problem. The people of this nation should not be subjected to such a heavy tax burden, a burden that is placed on them by a government that is hell on social reform. I hope that the Minister for Housing and Construction will reply to this point because if he considers that the social problems that are being created by the lack of job tunities today, particularly for young people, not important then I would like him to say so. There must be an abandonment of a number of the new social reforms proposed by this Government. This Government is caught in a vicious circle. It wants to reform, yet in doing so it wants more taxation. The prosperity of this nation cannot be sectionalised. The greatest good for the greatest number must prevail. School leavers are not interested in pohtical infighting, fine rhetoric or the playing of politics in any shape or form. They want jobs and they want security.",27
86,Mr SPEAKER,EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES,Order! The honourable member'stimehas expired.,28
87,Mr RIORDAN,EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES,"Anybod y who lisincentened to the speech of the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Hodges) must feel some sadness and disappointment. The real difficulty of the Opposition is that it is engaged in an action which is unfortunately a combination of cynicism and irresponsibility. I was disappointed this morning that the Opposition did not take a more positive, more intelligent and more reasoned approach to this subject. When I first saw the matter of public importance listed I thought that the Opposition might put forward some sensible, intelligible suggestions in the national interest to assist in what is a real and crucial social and quite economic problem. My disappointment is I am bitterly disappointed that the Opposition's so-called shadow Minister for Labor, the the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr Street), who sits opposite me does not agree with what I am saying. Unfortunately, therefore, I will have to lump him in with my remarks about the Opposition's approach. Frankly, I thought that he had more to him. I hope that he will not perstimulate busisist with this line. The Opposition has raised this matter of pubUc importance. One would expect that at least something would have been said in a positive to a and progressive manner. What sort of proposition is put forward? We heard quotations from Plato from the year 400 B.C. I do not have Govern the unemployment ngures for that time. Mr Hodges-Did you not Uke the quotation?",28
88,Mr RIORDAN,EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES,"Yes, but I note that it was used in the context of trying to denigrate youth, as certain people in every generation denigrate bent their youth. The honourable member is no exception. I say that there is nothing wrong with the youth of Australia today. Honourable members opposite will never get over the shock to opportheir system when this Government gave 18are year-olds the right to vote. They will never recover from it. The honourable member for Petrie talked about the worse inflation, the worse economic conditions, the worse industrial disputation and the worse unemployment since Federation. What utter garbage! There is no other way to describe that statement. Where has the honourable member been? Does he not know what happened in the Depression? Does he not know of the great industrial disputes of the past? Does he not know what happened in the 1920s, in 1949 or in the early 1950s? Does he not know about the inflation of the 1950s? Does he not know about the great industrial disputes of the 1920s? Of course there is bad inflation. Of course there is bad unemployment. But when the honourable member makes such a ludicrous, broad, sweeping statement he merely displays a degree of ignorance that is unaccountable in a member of Parhament. This Government will use every effort and will strain every muscle to eUminate unemployment: It is a cardinal plank of the poUcy of the Australian Labor Party that it shaU not have unemployment. The Government will use every effort to avoid it. It must be recognised by every reasonable person that our trading partnersthose who have a similar economic system to ours and those who do not-ar e suffering from the same sort of pressure of inflation and unemployment at this time. The national interest is not served by this cynical attempt to ride to power on the backs of the unemployed. I wish that some of those who hold senior offices in the Opposition understood personally what unemployment was all about. It is all right to talk about it from a lofty height, from the intellectual safety of the ivory tower, from the background of the silver spoon. Those who understand the difficulties and the trauma of unemployment would never tolerate it as a deliberate poUcy. The Government accepts that the present position is intolerable. It will be doing everything possible to eliminate it with the shortest possible delay. But some of the suggestions which are made from time to time are so economically unsound that not only would they not assist the current position but they would also positively worsen it. Some of these sorts of speeches made in this Parliament tend to undermine the confidence of the Australian community in the economy, thus making the situation worse. The honourable member for Petrie suggested that the Government's attitude has prevented people from saving. For goodness sake, savings bank deposits are skyrocketing at the present time. They are now in excess of $ 14,000m. Our problem is not that people wiU not save; one of our problems is that people are saving too much because they are listening to those who preach the gospel of despair and doom and they are scared to spend. This situation has been encouraged deUberately by some irresponsible and cynical sections of the Opposition-the desperadoes for power. The labour force in Australia between November 1972 and May 1975 has increased by AVi per cent-no t decreased. At the end of May there were almost 260 000 more people in the labour force than there were at the end of November 1972. Let me remind the honourable member for Petrie that at the end of 1971 and early in 1972 some 65 000 school leavers were looking for work. But I did not hear him or his Party expressing this grave concern then. In fact they did nothing. Mr Street-We got them back to work.",28
89,Mr RIORDAN,EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES,"In a moment we will come to how you did that. We expect that about 250 000 school leavers will be coming on to the labour force at the end of this year. The Department expects that about 80 000 of them will be registered with the Commonwealth Employment Service as unemployed. We are not suggesting that there will be a rapid absorption, because of the slow pick-up that is presently occurring in the economy. One of the great problems of unemployment to which I have referred in the past and which members of the Opposition do not wish to face, is that at any time when all of the unskilled labour of this country is employed there is an acute shortage of skilled labour. When there is not an acute shortage of skilled labour and when there is a balance between the vacancies and the jobs available there is acute unemployment among the unskilled labour. That is a legacy of the Liberal years of neglect. Like it or not, those are the facts. The Opposition might as well face up to the situation because it will not be allowed to forget it. What this Government has done in the meantime has been to endorse such things as the national apprenticeship assistance scheme, which was introduced by this Government in 1973 and which has been a significant and substantial encouragement to employers to train young people. Under the National Employment and Training scheme for non-apprenticeship employment a subsidy is payable to employers to encourage them actively to train people with inplant training. It would do Opposition members much more credit if they were prepared to use their energies and efforts to highlight and publicise these schemes and to advise those in the labour force and the employers that these schemes are available. They should be encouraging people to know about them. They should be encouraging people to use them rather than disthe couraging them. Everytimethey make a speech, members of the Opposition attempt to undercannot get it. mine confidence in order to bring about a failure so that they can gain some cynical political advantage. In 1975-76 the Australian Government will be spending $40m in these various forms of assistof ance for training. This will make for a more flexReferring ible labour force which can be better utilised Australian industry and commerce, thus overtotal coming the great deficiencies and difficulties come from unemployment. The honourable it member for Corangamite recently made a statements, ment about the Commonwealth Employment 17 Service. Let me say to him: Yes, the Commonper wealth Employment Service is visiting schools. He seems to think there is something sinister that. What the departmental officers are saying that school leavers should seek the Commonwealth Employment Service as soon as possible to advise what they should do. The careers reference centre caters for some 300 000 people every year. Mr Street-We set it up.",29
90,Mr RIORDAN,EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES,"The Opposition parties did got set it up and I congratulate them on at least ing that faltering step but they need not have kept it such a secret. They never advertised that service. They hardly told a soul about-it; have. We have extended it and last year about 300 000 people went to see it. We are not saying to young people that they should go down and get on the dole, as was implied in the statement of the honourable member. Mr Street-That has been said.",30
91,Mr RIORDAN,EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES,"We are not saying that. We are advising them of their rights. Thesituation is that on the one hand some members of the Opthe position say that all youths who are not working are sponging on the rest of the community while on the other hand others are saying that we left. should not be encouraging them to getout to work. I do not know what it is that members of the Opposition are trying to achieve. The other thing that this Government is trying to do is to extend the Employment Service and ascertain what vacancies exist for school leavers, particularly those with the necessary skills. those who cannot find employment, for those who are unable to obtain reasonable employplight ment, this Government has increased substanwish tially the unemployment benefits payable order to reduce the disadvantage and the sufferployment. ing. No monetary payment will ever overcome indignity, the mental trauma and the suffering of a person who genuinely wants a job and Mr Hodges-We agree with you.",30
92,Mr RIORDAN,EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES,"I am pleased to know that the honourable member agrees. I am pleased to know that he will stop this garbage can treatment young people who have not got employment. further to the field of training, under in the student assistance schemes in 1971-72 the expenditure by the previous Government that was $32.7m but this year under this Government will be $95.25m. In the field of student enrol14.6 per cent of the population between and 22 years was enrolled in 1971 and 18.1 cent was enrolled in 1974, an increase from 193 000 to 250 000. In the last 8 years of Liberalin Country Party administration in this country the is Government spent $77m on technical and the assistance of further education. Mr Street-We got them jobs.",30
93,Mr RIORDAN,EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES,In the period from 1973-74 to 1975-76 the amount being spent is $151.7m. The honourable member for Corangamite interjected and said that the previous Government them jobs. That is part of our problem. It got takthem jobs all right but it did not encourage people to acquire the skills that this country needs. It just threw them into dead-end jobs. It we did not matter what it was. The Government at that time was concerned about factory fodder. We are concerned about human development. That is the difference. Honourable members opposite are concerned only about providing labour for the mills. We are concerned about providing labour for those industries which are essential to Austraha's long term advantageMr Street-There will not be many left.,30
94,Mr RIORDAN,EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES,. . . . and ensuring that individual citizen can obtain those skills that he wishes to obtain. The honourable member for Corangamite says that there will not be many That is the sort of irresponsible cynicism that he should be ashamed to utter. What he is trying to do is to talk down this economy further. As a prospective responsible Minister he should be using his best efforts to increase confidence and to to get factories re-opened and expanded. Instead of that all that the Opposition is trying to do is to For run down the economy. This cynical and irresponsible act is a cruel attempt to exploit the of the unemployed in this country. I only that some honourable member opposite in had had some first hand knowledge of unemSome honourable members opposite certainly will have it before too long because when the Australian people next get their chance to speak I think there will be one or two honourable members opposite who will not be around this place.,30
95,Mr HEWSON,EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES,"From the rantings and the antics of the Minister for Housing and Construcuon (Mr Riordan), who has just resumed his seat, it would appear that he is one of the old Labor spruikers. I rise in support of my colleague the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Hodges) in this debate on this matter of pubUc importance-the lack of employment opportunities for school leavers and others seeking to enter the work force at the end of 1975. Bringing on this debate is no act of cynicism on our part, as it was described by the Minister. The Minister said he was disappointed because we of the Opposition are not going to teU him how to run this country. You cannot teach an old dog new tricks. In the 10 minutes that I have in which to speak I will not have time to present all my facts of criticism, let alone get his Government off the hook. When the people put us into government we wUlfixthe situation with positive and progressive poUcies. This Government has proved beyond doubt that it is an unemployment party. The school leavers are witnesses to a government that has wrecked the Australian economy and has gloomy refused to accept the guidelines of successful decessors in government. When this socialist Labor Government came to office in 1972 the scheme unemployment level was running at about killing 80 000 to 100 000. Mr MCVeigh-What is it now?",31
96,Mr HEWSON,EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES,It is about 300 000. Inflation was running at about 4.5 per cent. In less than 3 years unemployment has more than trebled and inflation has multipUed 5timesat least. Mr Kelly-Fiv e times?,31
97,Mr HEWSON,EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES,"Yes, in fact exactly 5 times. Where do the school leaversfitinto this picture? am afraid that it is a very sorry story we have to tell. It is a story which proves that this socialist Government, like all sociaUst governments, does not care. Should any honourable member want to challenge that statement, let me qualify what am saying. By its record the Whitlam ment has proved that its sociaUst poUcies have been deUberately designed to create within our communities a dependence upon government. What better way to create that dependency than to kill initiative. Let us consider how it set about kdling initiative. The Government aUowed inflaget tion to escalate with drastic consequences to vate enterprise but with beneficial results for the Government in that it was able to supplement its handout poUcies. The Government allowed, aided and abetted the unions to make increasing demands for higher and higher wages and shorter working hours. It Ufted the tariff barriers with devastating results for the textile industries. How the heU could the private enterprise industries survive under such a government-backed onslaught? This has created no opportunities for school leavers to become absorbed into the Australian work force. Again the aim appears to be to give the school leaver very Uttle choice but plenty of opportunity to educate himself or herself for a future of dependency on government. Because of a lack of job opportunities, particularly in the country centres, and the Government's desire to kill private enterprise the apprenticeship position is now in grave jeopardy. Apprenticeship opportunities are now denied to school leavers. Surviving private industry, particularly in the country areas, which employs about 70 per cent of the work force cannot offer apprenticeships because it is now working with skeleton staffs. The activities of private industry in the field of research and experiment in order to promote opportunities for further industrial development have ceased. The future of school leavers looks very indeed. They can show some initiative in prelearning how to Uve idle Uves. An apprentice has an opportunity to learn about the retraining or how to apply for the dole. If that is not a race of intelligent youth, I do not know what is. This Government certainly has proved that it is an unemployment party. It has pursued a policy of deliberately putting people out of work. This Government does not care. The Minister for Labor and Immigration (Senator James MCCleUand) clearly does not care. He has not given a positive reply, except to say no, to any I problem or anomaly caused by the mistakes of his Department. I could illustrate the situation by referring to a couple of glaring cases which I have taken to him in recenttimes.As soon as he won the top position on the New South Wales I ballot paper he dropped all interest in the politiGoverncal consequences of unemployment. Mr MCVeigh-He cares only for himself.",31
98,Mr HEWSON,EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES,"That is right, top of the Ust. It would appear that he used the knife on the Budexpenditure to behead the school leavers in prithe work force. He is not worried about the difficulties of the school leaver. As a Minister in a government of what has been termed 'the unemgovemment ployment Party' he is mamtaining the consistbegin ency of his Government which has succeeded in putting out of work-in seasonally adjusted terms-30 0 000 people, which is over 5 per cent of the Australian work force. The Government has withdrawn the Regional Employment that Development scheme when unemployment is the highest since the 1930s depression. The cutlike ting back of expenditure in the Budget has head of attacked only the work force. Has the Governafter ment run out of money? Has it gone broke? What next a cruel, callous government, a government that trust can accept the fact that nearly 400 000 school leavers will be on the labour market in 10 weeks years? and face the prospect of unemployment? Government is saying to the school leavers, the university graduates and the technical institute graduates: 'We are not going to alter our strategy. We know that there will more people out of work in January or February. We are not going to restore the RED scheme. beheve we are right You can all go to hell'. What a shocking indictment against tralian Labor Party, a party that has always claimed to represent the worker, a party that claims to care for the average little man. The Budget will not restore confidence in the private sector, the sector that employs oyer per cent of the working people. known fact that the Labor Government's Budget has also sown the seeds of destruction sands of small businessmen, farmers involved in small industries throughout Australia. They are the Utde people ALP once cared about but is now destroying. There is no section more seriously hurt than smaU business sector which is fuUy Australian owned, which employs fewer than each business and which wiU go to the waU this Government and its Budget. As my it. colleagues alongside me say, this is deliberate. long ago. The shattering results of a recent survey show that two-thirds of the businesses are in collapse and bankruptcy in the next 12 months.. chair. If these projections are correct somewhere between 20 per cent and 30 per cent of the Ausbe traUan work force are about to face unemploywhether ment. If the survey is only half right there a 10 per cent to 15 per cent unemployment level, which represents a shocking and horrible indictin ment of the Labor Party's pursuit of its doction, trinaire socialist philosophy. Since this Government has been in power more than 3000 of these small businesses have already gone broke and thousands are hanging on by theirfingernaUshoping for so that the private sector can again to plan with confidence. What hope has the school leaver in the work force in this predicament? I suggest that it is worth repeating what the Prime Minister said when he was the Leader of the Opposition, when he was leading great Party ofhis to the 1972 election: Do you believe that Australia can afford another 3 years the last 20 months? Are you prepared to maintain at the your affairs a coalition which has lurched into crisis crisis, embarrassment piled upon embarrassment week after week? Will you accept another 3 years of waiting for week's crisis, next week's blunder? Will you again enthe nation's economy to the men who deliberately, but needlessly, created Australia's worse unemployment for 10 Or to the same men who have presided over the worse The inflation for 20 years? If the position at thattimewas the worse for 10 years, it has been multipUed more than threefold Budget since this Government took power. be 400 000 or Mr HUNT - Who said that? We Mr HEWSON-The Prime Minister said that and that is an indictment on any Prime Minister the Ausand any Labor government.",31
99,Mr WILLIS,EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES," I suppose I should be getting used to it but one is continuaUy amazed at the sheer gall of the Opposition in debates such as this. Members of the Opposition will say anything at aU to make poltiical points. 70 Probably the best example we have seen for It is now a well some time is thefor thou Mr Garland-You are a hypocrite. and others Mr Riordan- Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER whom Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Martin)Order!

102,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES,Order! The honourable member for Curtin has withdrawn the remark.,33
103,Mr WILLIS,EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES,"Before I was so rudely interrupted I was about to say that the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Hodges) is probably the best example we have had for some Ume of the sheer gall of the Opposition in making pohtical points and outrageous statements. The Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr Riordan) picked up a couple of them and I wish to refer to two others. The honourable member for Petrie said that Government restrictions on the growth of the Public Service would not assist school leavers. His own leader the Opposition Leader (Mr Malcolm Fraser) said in the Budget debate that if he were Prime Minister of Australia at this time there would not only be restrictions on Public Service growth; there would be no growth at all. Here is the Opposition trying to make a point about our restriction on growth of VA per cent when in fact it is the Opposition policy to have no growth whatever of the Pubhc Service. Four thousand people who will get jobs in the Public Service as a result of our allowance of IVi per cent growth would not get those jobs if the Opposition were in government. So that is just a part of the example of the sheer cynicism of the Opposition 's attitudes in debates of this sort. The honourable member also deplored the fact that there was no increase in unemployment benefits to 16 to 18-year olds. Does that mean fact that the Opposition supports an increase unemployment benefits for 16 to 18-year olds? How does that fit with its pohcy of across the board on all sorts of items? How does that fit with its policy of cutting back Government expenditure by at least $ 1,000m? Would the Opposition increase social welfare payments as well? We have not heard that claim before but it would be interesting to add to the enormous list of other things which the Opposition has employment. mentioned fromtimetotimebut of which it does not take account of in its Budget strategy. Not only does the Opposition make these outrageous drawn. statements; it also makes no allowance for the fact that what is happening in Australia is happening all across the world. Mr Hodges-Chang e the record.",33
104,Mr WILLIS,EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES,"I shall quote a couple of points. I suggest the honourable member might pay some attention. If he looks at the pubUcation of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Economic Outlook- I am sure he has never heard ofit before-for July this year, at page 9 he will see this statement: Unemployment is now at its highest post-war level in many OECD countries. In other words, what is happening here is happening in many other countries. If he looks at page 5 he wiU see this statement: Total recorded unemployment in the areaThat is, in the OECD countriesis now about IS milhon, double the level at the last business cycle peak and equivalent to over S'A per cent of the civilian labour force. I suggest he think about that. If he turns to page II he will see this statement: The present recession in OECD countries is the most serious since the war. It is remarkable not only for its length and depth- a third consecutive half-year of negative growth has now been recorded for the area as a whole-bu t also for its widespread nature: virtually every OECD country grew by less than its medium-term average rate in 1974I especiaUy draw his attention to the next statementand no economyIn the Western developed worldis expected to take up slack in 1975. So the fact that we are not Ukely to have a reduction in unemployment until next year is not a situation which is occurring only in Australia; it is happening in every other country in the Western developed world. They all have high unemployment. None of them are expected to have a reduction in unemployment before 1976. But is in any concession made to that by Opposition in speakers in this debate or in any other debate? No, not one ounce of it. Members of the Oppocut backs sition are sheer poUtical",33
105,Mr COHEN,EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES,Humbugs .,33

108,Mr WILLIS,EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES,"It was not used against any particular member, Sir; it was a general statement against the Opposition. Mr DEPUTY CHAD1MAN-For the sake of peace and quiet, I suggest that the honourable member should withdraw.",34
109,Mr WILLIS,EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES,I withdraw the comment.,34
110,Mr COPE,EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES,"I raise a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. It has always been laid down by previous Speakers that unless a comment is directed particularly to one person it is quite in order. you are out of order.",34
111,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES,"I think the honourable member for Curtin was taking exception on the grounds that possibly the honourable member fbr Gellibrand referred to him as a humbug. Mr Garland-No , he said 'they'. It has been ruled previously that if it applies to specific people, even though more than one, the point of order should still be upheld.",34
112,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES,The remark has been withdrawn.,34
113,Mr WILLIS,EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES,"I was trying to make the point that the Opposition's pohcy would exacerbate unemployment in any case. This is something for which members of the Opposidon do not make any allowance, and understandably so. They have talked in their Budget strategy about the need for a cutback in government expenditure by $ 1,000m. If one looks at the kinds of areas where they have suggested there should be a cutback, it would obviously mean higher unemployment right now. If the Opposition were the Government now there would be zero Public Service growth. I have referred to that matter. There is no joy for the school leaver there. They have also suggested that there should be a substantial cutback in capital works programs, in government offices, in growth centres and in the National Capital Development Commission. The non-dwelling building industry is at the moment dependent on government expenditure. If there were a substantial cutback in this area there would be a great increase in unemployment in the non-dwelling building industry. There would be a lot of building workers, architects, engineers and so on out of work. It would also have secondary effects on the building materials industry; so there would be much more unemployment there. None of this of course would be assisting school leavers. This is only the peak of the iceberg, because members of the Opposition have also suggested in various ways that there should be other increases in expenditure such as the increase the superphosphate bounty, assistance to beef growers, increases in defence expenditure, etc. This would involve further cutbacks in other areas which are employment creating. If it involved further cutbacks in capital works, then that would certainly be important. If it involved further cutbacks in areas Uke education and social welfare, this would mean there would be more unemployment in those areas as well. The Opposition's poUcy is quite clearly one which would lead to a substantial increase in unSo employment in the immediate term. It is no counteracting argument to say that the Opposition 's proposed tax cuts would stimulate expenditure and therefore stimulate employment. If it did have such an effect it would be lagged. That could only happen after some period of time had elapsed in which there had been an increase in demand and employers had responded to that increase in demand by increasing production and then, having used up their current employees by increasing overtime to some extent, starting to put on more workers. So the employment effects would obviously be lagged and not felt until well into next year if any tax cuts were made now. That assumes even that there would be a stimulation from tax cuts, and that is by no means certain. In other countries which have adopted a tax cut approach it has been found that there has been a big increase in savings; much of the increase in personal disposable income which has come from the tax cuts has gone into savings and not into spending. West Germany has found that this has happened, as has the United States of America. So to cut taxes now would by no means necessarily create increased demand for goods and therefore increased employment. It could well be that the use of this poUcy would just see higher savings and, because it involves a cutback in government expenditure, certainly would create a much higher level of unemployment right now in various areas I have mentioned. Finally, they make no allowance for the fact that the economy is on the upswing at the moment. The trend is only very tentative but it is there. The pubUcation of production statistics by the Statistician in August gives seasonally adjusted figures for 12 basic items. Ten ofthose showed a substantial increase in August. So there are some indicators that the economy is starting to move upwards. We do not expect that there will be a substantial recovery in terms of employment until next year, but in that respect we are no different from any other country. If we try to in stimulate further production right now by tax cuts or increased government expenditure it would possibly lead to higher inflauon rather than increased employment.",34

115,Mr SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this morning a parliaable mentary delegation from Brazil lead by Deputy Mario Mondino. On behalf of the House I extend to the delegation an extremely warm welcome. Honourable members-Hear , hear! NA NA Bill presented by Mr Whitlam and read a first time.",35
116,Mr WHITLAM,INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION BILL,"Werriwa-Prime Minister) 'Director-General' (11.45) I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. Immediately following the introduction of this Bill, I shall be introducing Bills to amend the Telephonic Communications (Interception) Act 1960-1975 and the ConcUiation and Arbitration Act 1904-1975. The subject matter of the 3 BUls is related and I propose to refer to all this speech. Honourable members will know that on 26 September I announced that the Government had decided to appoint Mr Justice A. E. allowance Woodward, OBE., to be the head of the Ausof tralian Security IntelUgence Organisation. to take up his new duties on 24 November 1975 and it is intended that the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Bill will come into effect on that day. In announcing Mr Justice Woodward's appointment, I said that it is approation priate that this very important position should filled by a judge and that in the Government's view this position should in future always filled by a person holding judicial office. Government holds strongly to this view. Arising from the Government's decision to appoint a judge to head the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, this Bill ensures that such an appointment of a judge does not affect his tenure of office as a judge, or the salary, lowances and otherrightsand privUeges that he has by virtue of his judicial office. Service of judge in this position is to count as judicial vice for all purposes. There is no such in the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act as it now stands and what the Government is proposing is in line with simUar provisions which have been passed by this ParUaon other occasions. Section 13 of the Law Reform Commission Act 1973, for example, enables a judge to be appointed as a commissioner and retain his judicial status and therightswhich attach to that status. Further, I remind honourmembers that while he was a justice of the High Court of Australia, Sir Owen Dixon, who later became Chief Justice, was appointed Australian Minister to the United States in 1942 and the Judiciary (Diplomatic Representation) Act 1942 was passed to enable him to hold that office in addition to his judicial office. 1975 The Bill provides for the omciai title of the head of ASIO to be changed from 'Director General' to 'Director'. In November last year, the Government agreed that, in Australian Second Reading Government Organisations, the title 'Director' should ordinarily be used in preference to except in the case of organisations with significant state offices headed by 'Directors'. Expression has been given to this policy in other legislation-for example in the course of the passage of the Australian Development Assistance Agency Bill through this House in December 1974 the title 'Director-General' wherever appearing was changed to 'Director'. 3 of them in This was agreed without division. A judge appointed as Director is to receive such additional salary and annual allowance as are necessary to bring his salary and annual to the level payable to the Chief Judge the Austrahan Industrial Court. Mr Justice He is Woodward now receives such additional remuneration by virtue of his office as President of the Trade Practices Tribunal. Provision is made for the salary of the Director to be determined by the Remuneration Tribunal in the situwhere the Director is not a judge. In acbe cordance with the policy of the Government, the opportunity is being taken to change references be to 'the Commonwealth' in the existing AusThe traUan Security Intelligence Organisation Act and the Telephonic Communications (Interception) Act to 'Australia' or 'Australian'. The second Bill, the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill (No. 2), provides for an increase of one in the number of judges in the Australian alIndustrial Court so that the Court will consist of a Chief Judge and ten other judges. This will allow a the court to operate at its fuU strength during the serperiod of Mr Justice Woodward's appointment provision with ASIO, which is for 7 years. The third Bill, the Telephonic Communications (Interception) Bill, provides for the Prime Minister in future to be responsible for the issue of warrants to authorise the interception of telephonic communications. The provisions relating to the issue of warrants are found in sections 6 to 12 of the existing legislation. This change is proposed following the revised administrative arrangements order made on 26 September whereby the administration of the Australian Security IntelUgence Organisation Act was transferred to the Prime Minister. The Attorney-General will remain responsible for the administration of the other sections of the Telephonic Communications (Interception) Act and for the prosecution of offences under the Act. Secondly, the Bill provides for consequential amendments of the principal Act arising from the change in title of the head of ASIO. I commend the BUls to the House.

119,Mr RIORDAN,HEADQUARTERS AND ANALYTICAL," I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Works Committee Act 1969-1974, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for investigation and report: Construction of proposed new complex for the Antarctic Division headquarters and for the Hobart regional laboratory of the Australian Government Analytical Laboratories, Kingston, Tasmania. The proposal involves the construction of 8 separate structures, seven of which will be occupied by the Antarctic Division and which will provide accommodation for offices, display and conference areas, laboratories, workshops and stores while the remaining one will contain separate offices and laboratories for the Hobart regional laboratory of the Australian Government Analytical Laboratories. The buUdings will be constructed with reinforced concrete columns and floors and pre-cast concrete wall panels. The roof will be of galvanised steel decking, suitably insulated, and windows will be of tinted glass in aluminium frames. Air conditioning will be provided to all occupied areas in the laboratories, adrrunistrative buildings and instrument workshop. The estimated cost of the proposed work is $7m at September 1975 prices. I table plans of the proposed work.",36
120,Mr COATES,HEADQUARTERS AND ANALYTICAL," I support the motion moved by the Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr Riordan) that this project be referred to the Parliamentary Standing ComSecond Reading mittee on Public Works. The Antarctic Division was created in 1948 within the Department of External Affairs. It was later transferred to the Department of Supply. When the present Government came into office and the Department of Science was created, the Division was incorporated within that Department. In 1972, the previous Government decided to move the Cosmic Ray Section of the Antarctic Division from Hobart to Melbourne where all the other sections have been located. At the time. I raised the matter with the then Minister for Supply, Mr Garland, and asked him if the Cosmic Ray SecSecond Reading tion could be kept in Hobart. I suggested that the location of the whole Division should be in Hobart. His reply was that it would not be possible. During the 1972 election campaign, I promised to work for the transfer of the Antarctic Division to Hobart. The idea was received enthusiastically in Tasmania. As soon as Mr Morrison was appointed Minister for Science, I started the campaign to have the Division moved to Hobart. During 1973 I made a series of subTASMANIA missions to the Minister and convinced him of the feasibUity and desirabUity of the move. Finally in January 1974, Cabinet approved the transfer. The Antarctic Division began preparing the preliminary design brief which was PubUc completed in June 1974. The then Department of Services and Property began a search for a suitable site and Kingston which is just outside of Hobart was selected in May 1974. The purchase of the site was completed in October that year. Following that, preparation of the draft environmental impact statement was begun by the Department of Science and was published in February this year. Public comments were sought. The final environmental impact statement was begun in March 1975 and cleared by the then Department of Environment and Conservation in May 1975. The project was then referred to Cabinet which has approved its inclusion in design Ust C which aUows the Department of Housing and Construction to prepare sketch plans, limit of cost estimate and documentary evidence for the PubUc Works Committee. The Department of Science, as the client Department, has also prepared evidence. That having been completed and the dation, Treasurer having approved the limit of cost estilead mate, the Minister for Housing and Construction has today moved the referral of the project to the PubUc Works Committee. There now must be the public notice given notifying of public hearings and caUing for evidence. I understand that the Public Works Committee will be able to hold its hearings in Hobart in the first week of seek November. I hope that interested persons in Hobart wiU examine sketch plans and the model of the project which I believe is available. hope that the Public Works Committee will be able to report to the Parliament November and that the Parliament will approve the project so that the Department of Housing and Construction can forge ahead with of detailed contract documentation, with tenders being called and construction commencing by half way through next year. Some people have been frustrated at the time taken by all these necessary preliminaries of last year and this year. But it is a major project- a multi-million dollar project-and there has to be careful preparation for such a major expenditure of the taxpayers' money. The original proposal has been expanded and the project not to be just the headquarters of the Antarctic Division, but the Department of Science and Consumer Affairs complex. As the Minister said in his motion, it is a multi-building development for the Antarctic Division and also for the Australian Government Analytical Laboratories. The function of the Laboratories has been expanded by the Government's greater involvement in consumer affairs, apart from a generally greater demand for analytical services. The new procedures for environmental impact statements also added to the lead time but were an essential part of government policy in the public interest. I should now like to turn briefly to the reasons for siting the Antarctic Division headquarters in Hobart. Tasmania has had a relatively low level of Australian Government departmental spending because of the concentration of activities of the Government in Canberra, Sydney and Melbourne. My wish was to have any appropriate activities located in Tasmania to go some way towards correcting the imbalance and to provide the substantial spin-off benefits for the city of Hobart and the State of Tasmania. The Antarctic Division represents a most appropriate activity to establish in Hobart for a variety of reasons, including the proximity of Hobart to the Antarctic and its good port facilities. The Division's activities at present are dispersed over six locations, five of which are in various parts of Melbourne. They do not provide suitable accommoas they are inconvenient, inefficient and to low morale of the staff of the Division. This proposal wiU provide a permanent headquarters, bringing together into one location, all Australian based activities of the Division, leading to a more effective operation. There will be mutual benefits for both Hobart and the Antarctic Division. To save the time of the House, I leave to incorporate in Hansard my statement of 25 January 1974, commenting on the announcement of the Government's plans. The It is my honourable member for Corangamite (Mr Street) has already given his consent for which I before the end of thank him.",36
121,Mr SPEAKER,HEADQUARTERS AND ANALYTICAL,"Is leave granted? There being the task no objection, leave is granted. (The document read as follows)Press Statement 25 January 1974 JOHN COATES' COMMENTS ON ANTARCTIC NA One thing about this decision that particularly pleases me is that it shows that a back-bencher with an idea can see the results of that idea benefit his own electorate. The decision will be a great boost to Hobart and Tasmania as a whole-it will produce major spin-off benefits for Hobart such as in the provision of supplies and in the encouragement of service industries. The establishment of an industry-for that is what it isgenerates a great deal ofeconomic activity. It is not just the expenditure of 3 million dollars on a building, it is the generation of a whole new range of economic activities that will benefit everyone in the community. For the city of Hobart to have a well-respected organisation as this will add a new dimension to the identity of Tasmania and this will have a particular spin-off in the tourist industry. The city and the Division will soon become identified with each other. I know that this has happened in Christchurch) where the American Antarctic effort is based. This move will inevitably mean increased job opportunities in Tasmania, particularly in the technological and professional areas. We lose too many of our trained young people because of insufficient openings for them at present. I hope that the establishment of the Antarcuc Division Hobart will be thefirstof several moves of this will provide openings for our qualified people. The move will be of particular benefit to the University Tasmania, particularly in thefieldsof physics, biology, geology and medicine. Most of these Departments already have some interest in Antarctic research. To have Hobart as the Australian National Antarcuc Research Expedition (ANARE) base will be of significant benefit to the port of Hobart.' I see major advantages for the Division in the move. The status of the Division would be acknowledged much Hobart than in Melbourne. The Division will share mutual benefit of being associated with the University Tasmania. There would be a more specific relationship is possible with much larger institutions which have many other outside contacts. There may be initially minor disadvantages for the Antarctic Division in such things equipment but I believe that this disadvantage is marginal and hopefully will even lead to the development of a local electronics industry. Many of to transfer to Hobart but this will be a gradual move and is inevitable in the establishment of any Commonwealth activity in Hobart. To argue against would be to argue against any increase in Commonwealth spending in the city. I know that this decision will create a great deal of interest in the community and I have had talks with the Minister with a view to seeing that the Tasmanian people are properly informed in the progressive development of this move. Background I have said all along that able for Commonwealth activities to be centred in Sydney and Melbourne. Decentralised location of Australian Government departments is in the nauonai interest the interests of the development of our smaller cities. the election campaign I drew previous government to provide significant Commonwealth spending in this state. I promised at thattimeto do to change the policy. It is personally gratifying to Labor Government's commitment to the concept of development beginning to take effect in Tasmania. During 1972, before the election, I proposed to the ment that the Antarcuc Division be moved to Hobart interests of Tasmama. The Minister for Supply, Mr Garland, under whose department the Division was then located, opposed to such a move. In fact, the previous Government proposed to move the Cosmic Ray section that Hobart for many years away from Hobart to Melbourne. I was very pleased, at the time that I made my proposal public, that the now Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, took the idea with enthusiasm. As soon as the new Government was elected I sent a telegram to the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Barnard, asking him to delay the planned move Cosmic Ray section of the Division from Hobart to Melbourne pending examination of my proposal that the Division be located in Hobart. Mr Barnard agreed then I have been pushing the idea with the Government. knew several months ago that I had convinced the for Science, Mr Morrison, of the advantages of the move and finally this week Federal Cabinet considered Mr Morrison's submission and endorsed it.",37

I also thank in and the present Minister for Science and Conkind which sumer Affairs (Mr Clyde Cameron) and the former and present Ministers for Housing and of Construction for their help and co-operation in this project. I mention the work of the staff of the Division and its Director, Dr Garrod, the Department of Science and Consumer Affairs and the Department of Housing and Construction. I trust that there will continue to be good cooperation and the minimum of delay in the more in remaining stages of preparation for what is to the me, and I hope for the design team and the Divof ision, an exciting project. I commend this than reference to the Public Works Committee to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. as the supply of some technical STUART AND BARKLY HIGHWAYS, NA the existing personnel will have Approval of Work-Public Works Committee Act the move on these grounds",38
123,Mr RIORDAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY," I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969-1974, it is expedient to cany out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standmg Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Second three-year program of improvement and maintenance of the Stuart and Barkly Highways in the Northern Territory. it is neither necessary nor desirCanberra, The proposal is the second 3-year program for the highways and includes approximately 325 and in kilometres of pavement strengthening and During widening, approximately 235 kilometres of road attention to the failure of the realignment and the construction of 14 bridges, all I could besides routine maintenance and pavement see the resealing. The estimated cost of the proposed regional work is $34.6m. The Committee in recommendthen Governing the construction of these works has in the concluded that: (i) The Stuart and Barkly Highways form the main road links within the Northwas ern Territory and its continued development is has been in dependent on the provision of adequate transport facilities; (ii) the upgrading in accordance with the national highways standards is jusup tified and will increase road safety; (iii) the works will reduce the prolonged transport delays now experienced in each wet season; and (iv) the of the economic and social benefits which the proposed whole improvements will provide to the Northern Terand since ritory community are considered to outweigh I any possible adverse environmental effects. Minister Upon the concurrence of the House in this motion detailed planning can proceed in accordance with the recommendations of the Committee.",38
124,Mr CALDER,NORTHERN TERRITORY," I him am glad to see that this program has been brought before the House. I urge its implementation with great speed because not only do the roads need resurfacing, repairing and maintaining but also the road construction workforce in the Northern Territory is in dire straits. If work is not brought forward very soon many of the contractors will have to let their plant, equipment and men leave the Territory. This would be a bad thing to happen. The contractors would have to start getting organised again. I notice in the program a recommendation that the roads be rebuilt to a width of 7.4 metres which is 22 feet or thereabouts. At present they are 12 feet wide. Many years ago I recommended to the then Government and the Director of Works in Darwin-wh o is still there, thank goodness, because he happens to be a very keen road builder-that the cost of mamtaining these narrow bitumen roads is very often in excess of the original construcuon cost of a road of suitable width in the first place. Very often when driving on these narrow roads one meets a heavy transport or a cattle transport and has to get off on to the shoulder. I have measured the shoulders on some of these roads and found a drop of between 8 to 10 inches. It is very dangerous indeed. In fact I have buckled a couple of wheels in one hit trying to avoid a transport which has been coming from Mt Isa. I think the work will be most welcome and I know the Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr Riordan) will endeavour to get the planning through as soon as possible. I notice that the road, because of its realignment, will miss Pine Creek. I think this is a pity. I know that in the interests of straightening and realigning the road in order to cut out some of the sharp curves Pine Creek has to be bypassed. Pine Creek, a small hamlet, is hable to suffer very much from the road not passing its door. If the program cannot be altered and the road bypasses Pine Creek and leaves it completely out of sight behind a hill, I would ask the planners to see that there is suitable sign posting and an off-shoot road into the township of Pine Creek. Finally, I notice that for each of the next 3 years an amount of about $ 11.6m will be expended in mamtaining and improving these roads. I question whether this amount will be enough if the present inflation rate continues. I ask the Minister to look at that aspect. I hope that the amount will not be inflexible because in another 3 years if the inflation rate continues as at present the work will not be able to be carried out. Of course this depends on who is in government. I commend the motion.",38
125,Mr WENTWORTH,NORTHERN TERRITORY," I certainly support the remarks of the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Calder) in regard to this motion. I suppose that nobody would know more practically than he would about these roads. I think that the points he made are very valid I do not intend detaining the House for more than a minute or so. I hope that some consideration might be given to a road connection from Alice Springs to Broken Hill. This is perhaps the big defect in the whole of the roads system. One can come to the Stuart Highway from Mt Isa but to come to the highway from Sydney or Melbourne is not so easy or convenient. It seems to me-and I know something of this area myself-that the most important link to think of now is from the point where the road meets the South Austrahan border across to Broken Hill. From Broken Hill there are already tarred roads to both Melbourne and to Sydney. The link would cross the road from Adelaide northwards through Port Augusta, which portion is not completely sealed yet, to Marree. I beheve this section reasonably soon could be quite easily sealed. This would give us from Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney a link into Alice Springs and therefore a feed-into the Northern Territory. I hope at some future time to say something in more detail about this suggestion, but at present I simply content myself with supporting the remarks made by the honourable member for the Northern Territory and commending to the Government the possibility of investigating further the link from Broken Hill to Alice Springs.

126,Mr LAMB,ASSENT TO BILLS,"Unions and individual wage earners have fought for years to increase their earnings so that they might improve their standard of living. But what is more money if people cannot get value for money? They are sold shoddy goods. Working people are now concentrating on getting more value for money rather than simply getting more money. Consumer power is increasing due individuals like Ralph Nader and voluntary organisations. About 30 voluntary associations Australia are concerned with consumer affairs. They have recently formed themselves into the Australian Federated Consumers Organisation. It takes courage and money to fight for the rights of consumers. They get value for money only when they get what they think they are buying. Most people are unaware of those associations. They alone bear the load. State governments have partly taken up the responsibility and have been persuaded to set up consumer protection bureaus and tribunals led by officials who pubcould lish hard-hitting reports naming enterprises against which complaints are being made and substantiated. The field of consumer protection is wide covers, amongst other dungs, product informastandards tion, safety standards, misleading or representations, product quaUty, selling systems, liability for unsoUcited goods and actions. For instance, the Victorian Government, to support the consumers, has set up a consumer affairs bureau, which was established in November 1970, a smaU claims tribunal, a dimoral rector of consumer affairs to advise the Minister and a 10 member consumer affairs councU. Despite the action taken complaints from sumers continue. I shall give a few examples the House. The bulk of complaints to the badly under-staffed consumer affairs bureau in toria-thes e are the latest figures-indicat e matic upsurge in complaints in recent months. Since its inception more than 4 years ago it received 23 000 complaints and this year it expects to get 10 000 complaints, about 840 month, mosdy about cars, buUdings, electrical appUances, repairs and servicing and clothing. Other complaints concern advertising,floorcononce verings, furniture, footwear, dry cleaning, dering, luring, insurance finance, education, health andfitness,packaging, dangerous and hazardous products, door sales, maU order sales, prices and professional services. Despite the efforts of the States-the y will tinue no doubt-the Federal Government now wishes to establish a consumer protection authare ority to supplement the work of the State governChoice ments and voluntary bodies. There is a case perhaps to be argued that consumer interests can Germany. best be looked after by the consumers themselves. The private bodies, which led the way with dedication, persistence and meagre resources, embody to perfection the essential characteristics of the movement. They represent the consumers and they are totally independent. to They know exacdy what is needed and how to get tt. The Consumers Association in Britain and in the Consumer Federation of America are just 2 examples of private groups which have been successful. The proposed authority will have to work closely with those voluntary groups. It could also be argued that the function of governments should perhaps be confined to the making of laws to protect the consumer and to providing tribunals for the adjudication of complaints and for the enforcement of standards against offenders for whom warnings and reason have been ineffective. The government role also include financial assistance for private consumer groups, which are by definition non profit-making and rely on yearly subscriptions for their income. We believe that various powers and and machinery covering consumer and trading and practices at the federal level false should come under one umbrella while complementing the work of the States and supcredit transporting consumer groups. Consumer protection falls roughly into 2 areas-preventin g complaints by establishing standards and educating the buyer and using persuasion. If consumer advice and education are to be of value to the consumer they must be readUy avaUable, free and relevant. The conMinister for Science and Consumer Affairs (Mr to Clyde Cameron) has been overseas and no doubt will borrow heavUy from overseas experiVicence and will adapt the Swedish idea of a draestablishing store front advice centres. The Swedes found that most consumer protection achas tivity centred too much on helping the upper middle class rather than the disadvantaged or a low income groups. They said that too much advice was being given about refrigerators, television sets and simUar items, which are bought or twice in a hfetime, and not enough about launday to day items such as meat, vegetables and other foodstuffs. The shop front centre would get through to people such as pensioners who are unable to do comparative shopping because they cannot get around Uke other people. Sixty such shop front centres operate successfully in the conUnited Kingdom. The centres could give out leaflets on specific products or booklets which more comprehensive, simUar to the magazine produced by a voluntary organisation in Australia. That sort of thing operates in The second section of consumer protection is mainly that of redressing complaints through sanctions, publicity or legal means. The proposed authority would take over the responsibUity for administering section 5 of the Trade Practices Act which is based on the corporation's power. But it will rely on State co-operation when dealing with other than companies. The Opposition claims that our proposals have been prepared in haste. On its definition and record haste involves something which is achieved in less than 23 years of office. That is not good enough for the consumer. We have had the idea of consumer protection in our party platform for some years. There is draft legislation backed by much local and overseas experience. I beheve the charge of too much haste is merely a delaying tactic. The Opposition claims that the proposed authority would be unnecessary and that the functions could be carried out by the Trade Practices Commission. The scientific and legal standards of fair market tices are, as the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) said, clearly and closely associated with each other as they are in the United Kingdom and the United States. It is simply that the Opposition beheves the Trade Practices Act is sufficient whereby the Commission looks after competition pohcy and consumer protection as part of an integrated approach towards corporate market behaviour. We need to ask whether the one instrumenfrom tality can administer such disparate functions the full regulation of the market place and setting of standards for health, safety and other requirements. We beheve associated matters must be administered by the same body if benefit is to be obtained by the consumer. better that the proposed consumer affairs body should be operating at the public level than the Trade Practices Commission, submerged in economic and market problems, should carry out the responsibility. The proposed authority would be ably backed by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, the Ausagree traUan Government Analytical Laboratories and the Australian Standards Association, although the Australian Standards Association is conthought cerned mainly with technical standards. It is timely to mention one of its initiatives which borne fruit recendy. The Australian Standards Association urged a ban on the manufacture of all flammable fabrics. This matter years ago when the Australian Consumers Association made the same point. that children's nightwear made of flammable fabric will be banned in Australia and governable ments are expected soon to ban all clothing made of flammable material. The Victorian Minister has said that all States had backed the move and that Victoria would introduce legislation effecof tive from the first of next month and other States would soon foUow. We see here a concerted effort from voluntary organisations and State bodies backed by the Australian Standards Association. Where does the Opposition stand? It has said that it wants to delay the legislation for a couple of months, but it will not actually oppose it. Now the honourable member for Bennelong has said that the Minister for Science and Consumer Affairs should delay the proposed consumer protection Bill to enable further consideration of the Government's proposals by interested parties. Why does the Opposition want the delay? Is it against consumer protection? I believe it is because it is wedded to and obsessed with the profit motive at all costs-wha t the honourable mempracber for Hotham (Mr Chipp) has called 'the great rip-off. As the honourable member for Bennelong has said, the proposed consumer protection authority wiU not work if it concentrates solely on the buyer and not on the seUer and if it seeks to protect the buyer without regard for therightsof the seller. Vendors must see the benefits flowing from an Australian consumer protection authority. Responsible manufacturers will benefit atighteningup of regulations, laws and as supervision of standards because their comthe petition from manufacturers of shoddy and cheap goods will be less. Manufacturers can produce in confidence knowing the standards that full they must meet. Favourable publicity and It is recommendation would be given to the best quaUty goods. That is why I believe this Parliathat ment and this Government should effectively enter the field of protecting consumer interests.",39
127,Mr CORBETT,ASSENT TO BILLS," I Ustened with interest to the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Lamb) and, strange as it may seem, I with him on some aspects. But ms speech deteriorated as he went along and some of his comments towards the end were very illogical. I it was a good thing for the Government that he had only 10 minutes to speak. The reason has I have said that is that the honourable member for La Trobe said that the previous Government took 23 years to do very Utde in the way of conarose a few sumer protection. Now it appears Dr KLUGMAN - Nothing .",41
128,Mr CORBETT,ASSENT TO BILLS,"The advice of the honourmember for Prospect would not be worth anything either, so he can keep it to himself. He will be considered wiser if he does. The important point with respect to the period 23 years in which the previous Government was in office is that the consumer was protected constantly by the stability of the Australian omy which guaranteed the consumer a constant price. The consumer could purchase goods with any savings that he made without the effects the tragedy of the rate of inflation which rently is eroding the value of savings of people our community and affecting more adversely those with less worldly goods than others. The effects of inflation faU more heavily on the lower income class than on other classes. Another of the comments by the honourable has member for La Trobe of which I make some ancesaid criticism is his claim that the Opposition ently supported the profit motive at all costs. My of commendation for their work reply to the honourable member is that the protection. Government seems to have adopted a policy of no profit for private industry at any cost. But has been at the cost of unemployment and inflawith tion. That is the very decided difference the poUcy of the Government and the pohcy the Opposition. Mr Lucock-At the cost of the destruction the economy of the country.",41
129,Mr CORBETT,ASSENT TO BILLS,"As my friend from Lyne dedicated says, it is at the cost of the destruction of economy. He is quite right.",42
130,The CHAIRMAN,ASSENT TO BILLS,Order! I this would suggest that the honourable member regard all disorderly interjections.,42
131,Mr CORBETT,ASSENT TO BILLS,"Thank you, Mr Chairman. I some appreciate your comment. I understand your cause problem as I have been in the chair myself. We in fuUy availed the National Country Party and the Liberal always implemented Party are nothing if not completely fair to everyextent that they should body. I agree with the honourable member for La Trobe that private groups have done a very good job with respect to consumer protection. too, would Uke to see those groups given encourWildlife agement. Generally speaking, they are nonmade profit making organisations. I pay my tribute them. One must give most serious consideration the effect that consumer protection activities may have-that costs get out of hand. If there is thing which this Government is noted for, it that it has allowed cost to get out of hand every field. As an example of how this can pen in the area of consumer protection, I will quote from an article written recently and refers to the situation in America: Consumerism does not come cheaply. In fact, Americans are just beginning to realise what it can add to the product and to inflation. For instance, the cost of supporting all tory agencies created to monitor and so on works out at an average of US$2,000 a year for each American family. econThose ngures are frightening. Knowing the propensity of this Government with respect to costs and the way in which it handles its departments, of I am very much afraid that the cost of consumer curprotection could get out of hand if it is not in watched carefully. I wish the Minister for Science and Consumer Affairs (Mr Clyde Cameron) well in his new portfolio. I suggest to him that he look at the cost of .consumer protection pretty carefully and that he take on board what I have said and what the honourable member for La Trobe when giving consideration to the assistapparbe given toencouragement and the private that might be able to groups that are so worthy in consumer this I turn to the section of the estimates deaUng Science. I wish to refer to the work that is between done by the Commonwealth Scientific and of Industrial Research Organisation. The CSIRO has a worldwide reputation and deservedly so. of This was mentioned by the honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Eric Robinson). It has been my privilege to work with some of the very experts of the CSIRO in what is now the the Division of Wildlife Research but which was the Division of WildUfe Survey. Let me make point in connection with the work that the disCSIRO has done. The CSIRO is a very big organisation. Approximately 7100 people are on its staff. It has more than 100 laboratories and 37 research divisions. I am aggrieved be the work of these dedicated scientists is not of as their recommendations are not by the Government to the be. One classic example concerns the former DivI, ision of Wildlife Survey, now the Division of Research. I refer to the report that it on the controlled harvesting of kangaroos. to In the life of the previous Government a select committee of this House-the House of to Representatives Select Committee on WUdUfe Conservation-investigate d that aspect as part of one its terms of reference. In the period that the is present Government has been in office it has in ignored the recommendations of CSIRO scienhaptists backed up by the fauna authorities of Queensland. No doubt exists that if the Governwhich ment had taken notice of what the CSIRO experts and the Queensland wUdlife experts said in this respect we would have a more sensible apcost of a proach to the matter. This is an example of what should be done to examine very carefully expert the Federal regulaadvice that is tendered. consumerism, anti-pollution If expert advice is not accepted from a body such as the CSIRO, a responsibUity rests clearly on the Government to demonstrate why it has not accepted the advice given. Very often the Government would not be able to do that. But it goes blindly on. Amongst other people, a representative of this Government encouraged the American authorities to refuse to import kangaroo skins to the United States of America. This meant that a great deal of employment was lost where that employment was sadly needed. The benefit to country towns which would have resulted from the conunuing export of those skins was lost because of the delay. Another angle with which I wish to deal quickly is the amount of scientific research that goes into horticulture. State and Commonwealth authorities work in this area also. Legislation recently passed through this chamber to of estabhsh the Apple and Pear Corporation which will undertake research work. In Queensland Committee of Direction on Fruit Marketing does similar work. I hope that the activities of those bodies will not overlap. My concern is that the benefits of this research in that industry will be able to be utilised by fruit growers whose ability will be affected by the cost of supporting not only the Apple and Pear Corporation but also the COD. I hope that the Government will take some cognisance of this aspect and will note the heavy burden that will be imposed on these people in relation to the net returns that they receive. been estimated in Queensland-the position even worse in Tasmania-that the figure is approximately $2,000. I am told that in many instances some $500 will be paid to the Apple and Pear Corporation. The contribution the COD is a couple of hundred dollars. That amount is likely torise,even to double. How can these fruit growers be expected to carry on and make use of the scientific advantages which obtained for them? We must examine very medical closely the utilisation of scientific discoveries ensure that people are in a position to take advantage of them. We must look at the cost of consumer affairs activities. I do not wish my earlier comments about the American situation, when I mentioned pollution, to be construed as meaning that we against consumer protection and also against pollution control. Such a view would be entirely wrong. All I am suggesting is that a very careful watch be maintained on the expenditure in these very important and necessary aspects of Governbe ment activity to ensure that people receive full benefit from them without the need to pay unduly for those advantages.",42
132,The CHAIRMAN,ASSENT TO BILLS,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,43
133,Mr JARMAN,ASSENT TO BILLS,"The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation of which I am a member is conducting an inquiiy at present into packaging. Whilst in no way desiring to preempt thefindingsof that inquiry I wish to draw the attention of the Committee of the Whole to the consumer problems of paper packaging. The paper packaging industry imposes significant costs on the consumer without providing any significant services in return. These costs exist visibly at the retail level and also during production and disposal. At present the consumer is obliged was to bear these costs. The impact upon our society the packaging industry can fairly readily be measured. Australia's main producer and supthe plier, Australian Paper Manufacturers Ltd, valued its turnover in paper packaging for 1974 2 at $800m. At the consumer level it has been estimated to cost the average family $700 each not year. At the distribution level, just one of our visupermarket chains-Safeways-dispose s of 270 000 of the large brown paper bags used for carrying goods from the check-out to the car each week at an annual cost of $ 13m. This cost is also passed on to the consumer. The basic trend in the packaging industry is towards the introduction of disposable packages for all goods. This was one of the conclusions of It has the House of Representatives Standing Comis mittee on the Environment and Conservation in its report last December on beverage containers. That statement is equally apphcable to paper new packaging. Where once a chemist dispensed to medicine in the patient's own bottle, he now deals only in extensively packaged products, sometimes involving 8 different layers. This is to said to be for our protection and convenience. are One wonders, however, whether it improves the quality of any of these products. These to extra costs provide an essentially useless and a largely undesired service, but they are not confined only to the retail level. They are equally evident at the production level. Last year the forestry industries of Australia analysed and projected developments to the year are 2010. In what they called the Forwood report a massive expansion in forestry yield was predicted in the next 35 years. Also a significant restructuring of all forestry production was outlined. In simple terms, forestry products can divided into roundwood, which is fine quality the timber processed for construction, and pulpwood, which is used mainly for the production of paper and packaging materials. The Forwood report predicts pulpwood yield in the next 35 years to increase by 7 times, from one-fifth of the industry to over half. This means that the industry intends to step up the production of pulp paper for packaging at the expense of high quality construction timbers. The forestry industry has calculated that it is more lucrative to supply the demands of paper packaging than to produce fine quahty roundwood for construction timbers. This was stated in omciai Forestry and Timber Bureau leaflet No. 109 of 1967. By allowing profit to become the deciding factor, our forestry cycle is being radically modified. Pines are replacing gums. The alteration in our forestry cycle is such a massive operation that its consequences as a whole are not yet fully understood or controlled. For example, one area in Victoria-the Toronga Plateau in Gippslandstill stands barren from failure to regenerate pines successfully after a widespread clearfelling operation of the indigenous gums in order to supply industry's demands for packaging pulp for paper bags. The Toronga Plateau was similarly desecrated in the early 1950s. The same projects are also being undertaken but on a far larger scale in many parts of Australia, particularly the Eden area of New South Wales. At Eden whole forests and mountain ranges have been clear-felled. Extensive erosion has begun and the ecological system has been so radically altered that even fish in the joining Pacific Ocean have died, migrated or changed in species. The future existence of our forests is being jeopardised by excessive disturbance and ill-considered exploitation, and all this will have been brought about for the sake of a demand for paper bags. The forestry report estimated that per capita consumption of packaging paper is one-twentieth of a tonne a year. Amazing though that may seem, it further estimates that this consumption will double within 25 years. This expansion of the packaging industry is not only major in its impact on the comsumer and the environment, but also it would appear to be almost out of control. The disposal of this enormous quantity of packaging paper provides considerable probbut lems and expense. Even with improved methods of recycling waste paper it is predicted as likely that by 2010 that 65 per cent of packaging still will be burned, dumped or left lying about. the terms of 2.4 rnilhon tonnes of packaging to produced annually at that time, the wastage problem will be massive. At present, $100m spent through our rates on disposal of waste. Rates must treble in 30 years to cope with the new disposal problem. It is asserted by representatives of the packaging industry that they cater for the demands of the consumer. It can, however, be argued that in reality the consumer has not been provided with a real choice, and that these disposable products are very heavily promoted. In large supermarket chain stores, the consumer's choice is becoming increasingly limited to non-returnable items. This is the conclusion of the Standing Committee, to which I referred earher and on which I was a member, in reference to the beverage packaging industry. This is the predicament facing the consumer. He is obhged to pay for ever-increasing amounts of packaging which inevitably surrounds the goods that he wants. This packaging is expensive, largely useless, and highly wasteful of resources. It jeopardises our forestry and our environment, and it presents massive disposal problems. It is my hope that the government in co-operation with the States will create initiatives in this area. It istimefor the introduction of some form of control. Without restraint, the defects of today's packaging and forestry industries will be doubled within this generation. This initiative can be directed most positively towards investigating alternative materials for use where a genuine packaging need exists, such as roundwood, aluminium and even plastic with an emphasis upon returnabihty, not disposability. I place these facts before the Minister for Science ad- and Consumer Affairs (Mr Clyde Cameron) on behalf of the Australian consumer. The consumer is paying heavily for the present packaging of goods and so too is our environment.",43
134,Mr WENTWORTH,ASSENT TO BILLS," I would like to make 2 points only and to make them very briefly. The first is in relation to scientific programs in general. It is false economy to cut these back and to believe that you can make heavy cuts in research allocations and still maintain the integrity and progress of the system. I know that in the estimates for the Department of Science and Consumer Affairs those cuts do not appear to be very substantial. There may be insufficient allowance for the rise in prices. I note, for example- I am now speaking not of research of administration-that the proposed amount for postal and telephone expenditure in the Department seems to be grossly underestimated if what was spent last year is any criterion. I underIn stand that in the Senate Estimates Committee be hearing it has been found out that the estimates which are before us are in some respects grossly is underestimated. However, I make this observation in passing because my main point is one which is not, I think, concerned so much with these estimates as with research co-ordinated with these estimates but taking place outside them in universities where the slash has really caused tremendous economic loss and has been most ill-advised. Having said that, I want to come to one thing which is of less consequence but still not entirely without consequence, that is, the position on the Ord River and the scientific back-up for what is going on on the Ord River. The Ord River scheme has in summary been rather a disaster. This area has the best source of water, I think, in the whole of Austraha and most of it is going to waste because of the failure of the agricultural schemes. There have been 2 reasons for this, I think. The first is that there was an unscientific and undue reliance upon pesticides which had the effect of destroying the natural predators of the harmful insects and therefore ultimately multiplying the insects and the damage they did. The cotton program on the Ord has been wiped out through this reliance on pesticides, which was counter-productive in the long run because of the lack of understanding of what was involved. Not only did this scientific boo-boo wipe out the cotton venture on the Ord but it also had the effect of increasing the insect troubles in other crops. The scheme very largely came to a halt. This year there has been a much reduced apphcation of pesticides and a reliance on more selective types of pesticides. The result has been that the overall productivity of the area has increased immensely. There are still some great problems in regard to the depredations by birds. The magpie geese, even the brolga, and other birds are doing a great deal of damage and the scheme is in the doldrums. Tens of millions of dollars-mayb e many tens of millions of dollars - wort h of productivity is being lost every year through lack of proper knowledge of what to do. As the Minister for Science and Consumer Affairs (Mr Clyde Cameron) will very well know, there is a research station on the Ord. This is the point I come to-that the research station over recent years has not had the feed-in of resources and manpower which it should have had. It is very false economy to think that by ting down a few tens of thousands of dollars a year on a research station one can save anything when by so doing one is losing tens of millions of dollars worth of productivity. This is what has happened on the Ord. I still beheve in the potential of the Ord, there has been a monumental boo-boo. It should not have happened. The water resources are there. I believe that the soil resources are there. But gross errors have been made in what crops grow there, how to grow them and how to protect them. Of course I am not suggesting for one moment that everything must succeed at the first attempt. I know that in a venture like this trial and error are necessary. But what I am saying is that in this kind of situation we should be speeding up the scientific backup of the trial and error performances. What has been happening there- I do not think that it is the fault of the people on the ground; the fault is more that they have not had the backup-ha s been really rather shocking. Owing to a lack of resources in investigating new crops, in investigating ways of protecting existing crops and in investigating ways in which to miriirriise the harmful effect of the overapplication of pesticides, there has been a shortfall in all these investigations. In order to save a few tens of thousands of dollars a year we have been losing in productivity tens of millions of dollars every year. I am sure that the Ord scheme can be made a success. Unhappily, up to date its record is one of failure. That should not be the case. When we have this very big investment-w e have a very big investment in the water supply and in the other facilities there-it is really false economy to cut down, as we have cut down, on the scientific investigations to make things right. Any person who wants to economise on his motor car by not putting oil into the engine is bound to come a cropper, and that is what has happened to us on the Ord. I ask the Minister to see that this does not continue.",44
135,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,ASSENT TO BILLS," I would like to thank honourable members from both sides of the chamber who have spoken in this debate for the constructive manner in which they have approached the subject. All of them have made thoughtful contributions. All the contributions made will be studied carefully by me. Where they call for a reply, a letter will be sent to each speaker to indicate my response to their remarks. However, I begin by paying a tribute to the Department of Science and Consumer Affairs. I am pleased to note that not one speaker in this debate saw fit to level any criticism against cut- the Department or indeed against me as the Minister. I am not infallible. If I make a mistake it will be a genuine error of judgment. No one can be blamed for making an error of judgment. But so far I have not even been criticised for that. I want to make a passing reference to some but disparaging remarks, which I do not intend to repeat, which have been made against th». administration of my Department by source that have not raised their voice, I am glad to say to during the debate last night and today. I put on record that I am very proud of my Department. It is an extremely good Department, run by dedicated officers. I know those at the top and I have had more to do with them than with those lower down. The head of the Department, Sir Hugh Ennor, is an excellent Austrahan citizen with a first class record in science. He is a scientist of some eminence in his own right. He has the active backing and dedicated support of men like the First Assistant Secretary, Mr Jack Lonergan,  immediately beneath them and no doubt further down the line too, who are really dedicated to the work they are doing. They work efficiently and with great speed. They are courteous. They are at all times aware of the position that a Minister holds within the Department. They tender advice fearlessly. They accept the Minister's judgment graciously. If a Minister's judgment does not accord with their own judgment not only do they accept it but they also then do everything that is humanly and physically possible to make a success of the Minister's judgment. No public servant can do more than that. This is the Westminster system in itsfinesttradition. I put on record that I am extremely proud of my Department and of the officers in it. I am proud too of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, as everyone in Austraha must be who understands the work which it is doing. It is an organisation that brings pride to Australians travelling overseas. No matter in what country one may have discussions about scientific affairs, one will always find someone who will be loud in his praise for the CSIRO. It is a scientific organisation of world class now. It must give every Australian abroad a great sense of pride to know that something belonging to Australia is so eminendy regarded overseas. I took note of the remarks of the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth) about the Ord River scheme. I do not want to raise the question of who introduced the scheme or who was responsible for it-whethe r it was this party or some other party. History will answer that. I was impressed by what he said. However, it is fair that I should make the point first of all that the CSIRO was not consulted about the advisability of starting the Ord scheme. I think it was a pohtical judgment made by pohticians rather than by scientists. Again I say no more about that matter. We have it and we ought to try to make it work, if it is possible to do so. The CSIRO did not go into the Ord area on a full time basis until 1 July 1974.1 will look at the complaints made by the honourable member about there not being enough manpower or resource feed-into the station there. If an honest assessment of the situation leads me to support the view that the honourable member has put I will give directions that more manpower and resource feed-in be provided for the Ord River station. As I am speaking officers of my Department and of the CSIRO are making notes of what I say. They will know from what I have said that I want them to examine this matter. I want them to give me an honest, unbiased and rational answer to all the criticisms and comment made by all honourable members on both sides of the chamber and in due course I will have letters prepared and signed for dispatch to each honourable member who has raised a matter of substance in this debate. The honourable gentleman talked about pesticides and I am concerned about this matter. I am not sure that the Americans are not right in completely banning DDT, as they have done except in very special circumstances. I know that if one bans DDT one sometimes is forced to fall back on alternatives that are even more devastating. But I am convinced that there is a reckless misuse of DDT. It is being used in areas where it ought not be used and my present intention is to pursue the policy of being generally against its use that I have already indicated to my Department and to the CSIRO but if its use is to continue it must continue only on a very strictly controlled basis. For example, we cannot lose a whole crop of a particular vegetable or cereal just because we have somefixationabout DDT. If there is nothing else for it we must measure the cost of allowing the crop to be destroyed or breaking our fixation on DDT. However, the Americans have got along fairly well without it. Some honourable members might recall reading a marvellous book, Silent Spring, many years ago about the use of DDT in killing pests in forests adjoining a river. The water became contaminated. Eventually the DDT destroyed all the salmon which provided a very important industry, perhaps one even more important than the trees which the DDT was used to save. It may be that it is an over simplification of the question of pesticides to look at the solution in Silent Spring but it does call for something to be done and I intend to do it. I thank the honourable member for making a passing reference to it. The honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Eric Robinson) made a very thoughtful contribution, in my view, to this debate. I am pleased to hear that both the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) and the honourable member for MCPherson have responded to the spirit of the decision taken by me that each of them is to have access to the Department and to departmental officers, subject to proper controls. For instance, they would not expect to have access to Cabinet documents or to documents held by the Department that represented the growing stages of a policy in formation. They are endded to the maximum amount of information consistent with a government's right to make its pohcy decisions in a normal atmosphere. They have availed themselves of it. My Department has indicated a willingness to go on helping them as much as possible. If at any time they wish to have a file and they care to name it even that file will be made available to them if upon my prior perusal ofit there is nothing in it of a highly confidential nature. They can look at the file in my office should they call for it. No one could make a more generous offer. I do not mind letting people who behave and react responsibly, as these 2 gentlemen have done already, have that kind of concession. It could not be granted to irresponsible people. However while responsible people are holding positions of shadow ministers for respective portfolios I think a Minister ought to feel no reason for not letting them have full support. I am sorry that the Science Advisory Council was abolished and that so much time elapsed before something was set up in its place. I do not know enough about the original Science Advisory Council to know whether it was equipped to do the job. Perhaps there was a case for its abolition but there was no case for allowing so much time to go by before a better equipped body was put in its place. We now have the Austrahan Science and Technological Council established on an interim basis and shortly I will be introducing a Bill to give it the status of legislation so that it will be a permanent feature of government, whether the Liberal Party or the Labor Party is in office. I expect that there will be no opposition to that body being established on a permanent basis. There is a need, as the honourable gentleman said, for community involvement in science. Our community does not know enough about science. If it knew more it would become enmeshed in its ramifications just as much as I have. I have said ad nauseam that I never wanted to be Minister for Science. I had no interest, or thought I had no interest, in science and I was certain that nobody would find a way of generating an interest in science on my part. However, thanks mainly to the Department which patiently persisted in persuading me that it was an exciting aspect of life, I am now as excited about science as any scientist possibly could be. If it is possible to turn Clyde Cameron into an excited advocate for science it is possible to turn anyone else in the street, wherever the town may be, into having the same attitude. Science is an exciting thing. The whole community must become more involved. Politicians have to be made responsive to sensible public involvement in science so that they can be made to respond to demands by the public. If this had been the case there would not have been an Ord River. There would not have been some of the other decisions taken by pohticians had the community known enough about science to have made an intelligent response to demands by scientists for various assistance and for various projects. Accessibility of information, said the honourable memberforMCPherson, is absolutely vital. I agree with him. I am doing all I can in making information available to all who care to read it. I have instructed my Department that trade unions, consumer groups, academics and everybody else who can be persuaded to take an interest in science should be given copies of speeches I make. Those speeches are noted for one thing: There is practically no party political content in them. They purely contain appeals to the pubhc to involve themselves more deeply in science. The honourable gentleman made some reference to 2 Ministers controlling the CSIRO. Four divisions covering energy, solar research and mineral research have been given to the Minister for Minerals and Energy (Mr Connor) and the balance, some 32 divisions, remain with me. There is a very sensible agreement between me and my colleague and between the respective permanent heads. The matter now has been setded on a sensible basis. I think that providing sensible Ministers and sensible permanent heads continue to reign in respective areas there will be no problem. The Austrahan Research Grants Committee was mentioned by the honourable member. I am glad that he did this also because it is something that I wish to say more about later. Sitting suspendedfrom 1 to 2.15p.m.",45
136,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,ASSENT TO BILLS,"I have just suffered a rather severe shock. The Leader of the House (Mr Daly) told me that if I do not shut up he will gag me and if anybody wants to hear me I ought to call a meeting outside. I shall probably have to do that if I want to deal with all the matters that have to be dealt with. The Australian Research Grants Committee is a matter I want to touch on briefly. This question has been resolved, I think. The vice-chancellors of the universities have agreed to consider a proposal that was put to them by the Chairman of the ARGC and if this proposal is accepted we will overcome the problem in the calendar year, which is the year on which they work, by bringing into the second half of the calendar year a forward payment from the first half of the financial year covered by the 1976-77 Budget. The honourable member for MCPherson spoke about astronomy and marine science. I think it is a very nice choice to make as to whether preference ought to be given to one over the other. My own tentative position is that if we have to choose between the two, oceanography is more important than astronomy. They are both important but if I were forced to make a decision on one only, because of financial stringency, I should select marine science. I turn now to social sciences. I could not more with what was said. Social sciences will them. play a more important role as the years go by. I had a long talk with the director of the Moscow University while I was in Moscow. He told me that the Soviet Union has recognised that the changing pattern of human behaviour is such that a great deal more attention will need to paid to the social sciences than we now pay. Other people with whom I have discussed the question of social sciences say: 'Of course behavioural sciences and the study of that aspect of science that is wrapped up with the changing patterns of human behaviour under stress need to be given higher priority than we now give them. Even if we make only relatively short term .projections of social science needs for, fifteen or ten years time, we have to start ing about training people in this field now cause the first crop of social scientists will not ready for reaping until some 10 years after the students make the decision to enter the sciences.' Others will say that instead of training social scientists to manage the crazy rat race into which the world's present civilisation is developing, ought to be studying what the rat race is all about to try to prevent the rat race so that need the social scientists to make it possible for us to cope with the madness of the present pace of Ufe but that we slow down the pace of Uving. Again, they are decisions that have to be by people better quaUfied than I am and they matters which the Australian Science and Techabout nology Council could more properly take on about board and, I would hope, wiU take on board. Reverting to the question of astronomy versus oceanography, I can teU the Committee that I have already asked ASTEC to take this matter under its wing and to give a report on which field ought to have top priority and, having decided which should have top priority, then decide how much ought to be set aside for the one chosen for top priority. The honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) made a comment that I thought worthy of mentioning. He suggested that there ought to be some integration between legal aid services and consumer protection. I must confess that I see a lot of merit in this suggestion. I to have have talked to the Attorney-General (Mr Enderby) about it already. I hope he has an open mind on it, although I think he would rather see the consumer protection activities transferred to the Legal Aid Office than vice versa. I do not think it is necessarily obligatory to do either. I think that each shop front premises that are there for the advice of consumers on protection matters could also have one or two legal officersperhaps one would be enough-to act as referral agree officers on points of inquiry that come before The honourable member for Bennelong did not Uke the idea- I hope this is only a tentative position on his part-of having the integration of the various activities of consumer protection be under the one authority. I think he made the point- I hope I have correctly recorded what he said-that he did not tliink that we could marrythese were not exacdy his words but the substance of what he said-produc t safety with market regulation. He said something to that effect, anyhow. I have taken a great deal of trouble to study what is happening in other parts of the world. Ironically enough, nowhere in the world say, and nowhere in Australia have governments, thinkuntil very recendy, done much about consumer beprotection. Yet as a political instrument conbe sumer protection has enormous potential for any human being who is interested in getting votes. Why such people have only just realised that it is a matter of tremendous poltiical mileage is beyond me, although I must confess that I did not we realise the potential that Ues in consumer protection either, and I have spent all my Ufe working we do not out how to get poltiical votes. There is not any doubt that there is tremendous latent interest in consumer protection. The taken pubUc all around the Western world is now are demanding that governments do something it. Governments that fail to do something it do so at their peril. The Australian States have only relatively recendy come into the field and in that way they are no different from other countries around the world. I have had 2 trips around the world since I became the Minister responsible for consumer protection and I have seen what happens in the North American contisupport, nent and what has happened in Europe. I am convinced now that integration of these things absolutely essential if we are to get the best possible results. In the United Kingdom there is a considerable amount of integration, certainly United States. In Sweden the integration is virtually complete. The greater the integration greater is the protection that United States where there is, as the honourable member correctly said, a great fragmentation of consumer protection activities, I talked to man Simpson of the consumer protection ority there and I asked him what was the reason GOVERNMENTS for the fragmentation that has occurred in the United States. He told me that it was the inevi Mr table result of congressional wrangling which goes on under the United States system. He said: 'If you are only starting afresh then take my advice and do not ever let yourself get into position that we are in. Try to have that is completely integrated so product safety standards, so that it can control the advertising side of the thing and so that it can Campaign have market regulation, because otherwise will run into the same enormous problem have. Each of our five or six separate entities works as a law unto itself. If one chooses gard the other four or five entities represented in Phillips total consumer protection it can do so and consumer protection becomes very difficult, if not impossible'. I had with me Sir Hugh Ennor when this conversation took place.",47
137,Mr HUNT,ASSENT TO BILLS,A good man.,49
138,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,ASSENT TO BILLS,"He is a good man, an extremely good man. Sir Hugh Ennor was VI: present during that conversation with Chairman Simpson and as we left that meeting Sir Hugh said to me: 'Minister, I could not agree more with Australian the remarks made by Chairman Simpson today'. He said: 'We must have an integrated system. We would be mad if we allowed ourselves to get ACT. into the position the United States has got into'. August There is a great deal of value in a consultative approach. I take it that the honourable member for Bennelong was talking about the need for consultation between the Federal and the State governments. I would like to incorporate in Hansard with the leave of the Committee ment showing the expressions of support or, if not support, then expressions of desire from the State governments to be involved in the Commonwealth activities in consumer protecsuggestion-i tion, expressions of support and a desire involvement from various consumer organisimplied ations, a list of expressions of support or, if then expressions of a desire to become involved from private industry, and discussions is that have been held between me and representatives of various other organisations, including the Chamber of Manufactures and a whole variety of other people. I ask for leave to have that incormore than in the porated m Hansard.",49

140,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,DISCUSSIONS HAVE BEEN HELD WITH,"The reason why I incorporated that material was to answer the t was no more than a suggestion-of for the honourable gendeman because it could be from what he said that there had not not been proper consultation with industry. There has been consultation with industry. I have talked with representatives of the Chamber of Manufactures. Only last week I had a long talk with representatives of General MotorsHolden's Pty Ltd who came to see me. They complained that under the present system each of the States has its standards and General Motors has to make its cars according to the Victorian standard, which is not the same as the standards fixed by some of the other State governments. The gendeman who saw me- I forget his name-tol d me that he welcomed national standards. He said: 'Manufacturers cannot operate if there are going to be 7 different standards. We want national standards that can be enforced by a central body so that we can gear up our tool making and gear up our production line knowing that we are not running counter to some State law that was made after we had set our standards'. That is the benefit of Australian consumer protection at the Federal level. We have the power to set national standards which every manufacturer knows will be then accepted and will override any State standards that are either greater or less than those standards. If the standards are less than a standard in one State or if the Federal Government were not to fix standards, then we would be in the position of manufacturers being at the mercy of the less reputable manufacturers who have no regard for standards at all and who undercut sensible, decent manufacturers who want to supply good durable goods because their competitors are doing the thing they would not like to do. I had a letter from Philips a Utde ago saying: 'We are trying to produce dimmer switches. We have one that prevents the radioactive propagation'- I think that is what it said'which can affect very badly the reception of FM tuners and can affect colour television, but if the Federal Government is not going to make our competitors of the cheap ineffective and quite dangerous articles comply with some national standard soon we will have to reduce the level of our dimmer switches to the level of our competitors in order to sell them at the same price'. That is an easily understood position. I want to co-operate with the States. The governments have written to me saying that the field of, for example, the consumer proteczine tion magazine which we will be publishing the towards the end of the year, they wish to cofree operate with us. They would Uke us to material; they would like us to give them our material. Where we have shop front premises and they have shop front premises in the same city we wdl let them use our material and gladly distribute their material, because it is not possible for the Australian Consumers Association, the State governments and the Australian Government combined to test aU the wide range of consumer products that are on the market. Provided we do not overlap our activities then we all can do a good job in our respectivefields.I have told the ACA people who publish Choice that we will let them know a year in advance, and keep notifying them a year in advance, of the kinds of things we are going to test. They are going to let us have a year's notice in advance of all their testing programs so that we wiU not be testing the same things as they test. I am prepared to do the same thing with the State governments. Only in this way, by co-operation and by the co-ordination of our efforts, can we get the best possible results from what we are all seeking to do. It is true, as the honourable member for Bennelong says, that the Australian Parliament has not got the legislative powers to deal with some of the aspects of consumer protection now in the hands of the States. The Trade Practices Act aUows us to deal with corporations, but it does not allow us to deal with individuals who take down consumers. We have to rely on the States.",49
141,Mr HOWARD,DISCUSSIONS HAVE BEEN HELD WITH,Trad e unions?,50
142,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,DISCUSSIONS HAVE BEEN HELD WITH,"I do not know about trade unions. I am surprised at the honourable gendeman. It is a poltiical red herring to talk about trade unions at a time when we are trying to get some form of protection to help the ordiwhile nary consumer. The Leader of the House (Mr Daly) is indicating to me that I should wind off, but I am going to keep on for a Uttle bit longer. Unless he physicaUy attacks me I am afraid I will have to keep going. Unfortunately, because of the honourable gentleman's state of mind on the matter, I have to be very brief. I do not want to see consumer protection remain, as I think it is now, the play thing of the affluent middle class. The honourable member for Bennelong is to be commended for taking the same point of view. They cannot look after themselves completely, but they are better able to look after themselves than are the pensioners, the migrants, the illiState terate people, the undereducated and people in with poor incomes. When we put out our magawe will have reprints of the pages showing results of testing and they will be provided of charge to these underprivileged people have their from our shop front premises.",50
143,Mr HUNT,DISCUSSIONS HAVE BEEN HELD WITH,In difierent languages?,50
144,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,DISCUSSIONS HAVE BEEN HELD WITH,"In different languages-Gree k and ItaUan. We would like to include more ethnic groups but they are the 2 biggest ethnic groups in the community. For a start we will have to be content with covering those people only. It is true that 99.9 per cent of all voters have a far greater interest in consumer protection than they have in protecting the people who cheat the consumers. Of the 7.5 million voters in Austraha 99 per cent, as I say, are more concerned to see us do something to help protect consumers than to help protect the people who want to cheat the consumers. This Bill has not been prepared in haste, been suggested. The decision to begin prepACPA aration of the Bill was taken more than 8 months ago. When I became the Minister in June there was a completed draft of the first run of the Since then we have worked constantly on it, as the honourable member for Bennelong might have suspected. Her Honour, Justice Gaudron, who will be chairman of the consumer protection authority, has been co-operating with us. She is an excellent choice. It cannot be said that have worked in haste. We have put a lot of work into this Bill. It will be one of the very best ever brought into the Parhament. It is a very drafted Bill and we are very proud of it. I am nobody will be able to pick many holes in it. I have to conclude now because the Leader of the House is looking at me, or I can feel him looking at me. The honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Corbett) made a thoughtful contribution that deserves comment too. It is true that consumerism, as he called it- a term I do not like-ca n add costs to prices. It can add them ways. If you set standards that are unnecessarily high, for instance, a standard requiring that bathroom furnishings shall be plated with carat gold, you would be imposing an unnecessCass)ary standard on consumers and an unnecessary cost. That is a silly thing. It could also be bad we had an unnecessary level of people attending to consumer protection-if we had a whole army of bureaucrats, to use a popular term, adminisThe tering the organisation. We do not intend to that. I have told my people that the shop front premises, which will be the main public window of our activities, are to be manned by people no higher than class 4. I think a class 4 position plenty high enough. They would have clerical asIndustry. sistants to help them. They would be good, preturing sentable people who know how to handle the public, who look good, who are intelligent and who are willing to dedicate themselves to the I do not expect that the shop front premises the capital cities will have more than 2 people them, at the beginning at any rate. As more calls for more people, we will employ them. But anticipate that there will only be 2 people involved at the beginning. All told, we do not expect more than about 50 people to be employed by the Austrahan Consumer Protection Authority central authority. We will be taking over something like 35 people who now administer Part V of the Trade Practices Act which we will take over. But that gives a total of only 85 for the whole of Australia. So it will not be a great big Frankenstein monster. I am very careful about that because I know that as has the Opposition and the pubUc will condemn if it falls for the three card trick of filling itself up with unnecessary bodies. We will not allow it. My permanent head knows that that is Bill. my view and moreover it is his own view. Mr Daly-Finish off, Clyde.",50
145,Mr HUNT,DISCUSSIONS HAVE BEEN HELD WITH,Did you hear that?,51
146,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,DISCUSSIONS HAVE BEEN HELD WITH,"Yes, I did. I should we Uke to thank the Committee for the attentive hearing it has given me. I should like to thank the Bills Leader of the House (Mr Daly) too for the way well in which he extended mytime.I only hope that sure when we come to the Consumer Protection Bill we will be able to deal with some of the matters I had to leave unsaid. Proposed expenditure agreed to. Department of the Media Proposed expenditure, $137,575,000",51
147,Mr MACKELLAR,DISCUSSIONS HAVE BEEN HELD WITH,"We in 2 are debating the estimates of a Department which we on this side of the chamber believe all should not exist. Whilst I personally have some 23 regard for the Minister for the Media (Dr I am sure it gives him great pleasure to be the Minister for the Department of the Media- I if can see no good reason for the continuation of the Department. In fact I can see a great number of reasons why it should be abolished forthwith. expenditure under the estimates that we are do considering today is a very great extravagance. For instance, over $ 137m is being expended by the Department this year. For comparison's sake, I point out that that is $55m more than the is allocation for the Department of Manufacturing Yet if we look at the plight of manufacindustry and of small business throughout Australia which in many instances need a great deal offinancialhelp, and of course better polijob. cies, we can see that this is an unjustifiable in expenditure of money and an amount which in could be much better spent. The money goes to work the Australian Government PubUshing Service, I the Australian Office of Information, and the Australian Broadcasting Commission, amongst others. Before referring to the detailed expenditure, I should like to draw to the attention of the Committee the comments of a Washington legal expert, Mr Marcus Cohen, who said earlier this year. . . . the mere existence of a Media Department was alarming because of the potential for abuse of power. I think this matter concerns a great number of Australians throughout the country at present. The mere fact that we have a Department of the Media gives rise to the suspicion that the Government is turning it into a department of propaganda. Unfortunately there are some aspects of the behaviour of the Department which would give rise to some concern along these lines. The history of the Department has been' a most unhappy one. The first Minister was involved in a rather unsatisfactory affair, known as the Valenti letters. Mr Valenti, the head of the Motion Picture Export Association of America, was asked in a letter by the then Minister for the Media who the Minister should consider appointing to the Austrahan Film Board. This achieved some notoriety at the time and was made more unfortunate by the fact that a request for a job for the Minister's daughter was included in part of the correspondence. Since thattimewe have had the resignation  Board. We have had protests and unemployment I within the television industry. We have had delay in public broadcasting and community access radio. This delay really has nbt been explained away in any vahd sense. There has been no regard given to the advice of the experts in the media field. I instance particularly the advice of Dr Peter Pockley. When access broadof casting or pubhc broadcasting was introduced last year, Dr Pockley said that no clear guidelines had been established and that more time was areas, required before this form of broadcasting could be put into effective use. I believe that the points system introduced by the previous Minister has been a total failure. There is no doubt that many members of the Austrahan television industry have pointed this out. The idea of the points tem was to improve the lot of volved in the Austrahan television industry, particularly the actors and the writers. But I behevepartment it has been shown to be a total failure. The first Minister for the Media has been described by Philip Adams as the biggest ministerial disaster in the Labor Government. Of course the Minister had a lot of competition for'that title. But, as I said, the history of the Department has been a most unhappy one. Then of course we had the present Minister's accession to the position. He came into this area with a blaze bf triumph by suspending the licence of a Hobart media outlet. I beheve that any objective assessment of the reasons for this suspension would show that the offence that was allege'd to haye been committed, or which was in fact committed, was of & very minor nature. I believe that the suspension was an attempt by the Minister to demonstrate his power. If he wished to do this, I believe he could have chosen a far more effective way of doing it rather than using his muscle on this particular media outlet. There has been an uproar within the written media due to the attempts of the Minister to start a media council and particularly a Press council. Some people have suggested that this is a clear indication of a government intention to control the freedom of the Press. If this is the case and if this suspicion can be sustained, then of course all those doubts, all those worries about the ministry becoming a propaganda machine would be seen to be justified. I should like to spend a little moretimeon ethnic radio because this is a subject which has created a great deal of interest within the ethnic communities right throughout Austraha. There is absolutely no doubt in my mind about the need of for an ethnic radio broadcasting system. For who may have some doubts on this score, shall cite some relevant figures in relation tb the a matter. In Sydney there are about 295 000 people who would be very interested in and who would benefit by the introduction of such a radio. In Melbourne there would be 374 000 people; Adelaide 96 000; Perth 64 000 and Wollongong 17 000. These figures do not include the people ethnic background in Brisbane and Hobart. The Government has promised a great deal in relation to ethnic radio, but as in so many other the performance has fallen far short of the promise. Only $100,000 has .been appropriated for ethnic radio. We have people involved in the continuation of the ethnic radio experiment literally being paid a pittance for putting on programs which require a great deal of detailed sysresearch, and in many cases, many hours of hard those people inand diligent work. Wefinda situation developing where the Deof the Media has been moving into this area of ethnic radio broadcasting to the extent that a great number of people within the ethnic communities are very concerned that they-that is the people of the ethnic communities-wil l not have control over their own medium. They are concerned that they will not have access to it and will not have the rights that they believe they should have in relation to the control of programs, the decision as to what should be put on, how it should be put on and who should put it on. I beheve there is a case, as I have said, for a clear decision to be made in favour of ethnic radio. The Government is to be commended for initiation of the experiment with radio 2EA in Sydney and radio 3EA in Melbourne. However the Government has not made the decision. It did form the Bayutti Committee to inquire into all aspects of ethnic radio broadcasting. That Committee I believe has reported to the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam). As far as I know the Prime Minister has not brought the report into the House. I believe he should bring that report into the House as soon as possible. I believe that that report will show a real need within the ethnic community for an ethnic broadcasting station in order that so many aspects of Ufe in Australia can be more adequately explained to people of ethnic background particularly those people who do not speak the English language. I believe it is important to people who have arrived in Australia that they retain some sense of identity, retain some sense of bilingualism that they should have the aspects of cultural shock diminished. One of the most effective ways that this can be done is by the estabhshment an ethnic radio broadcasting system. How should it be done? I wait anxiously to view and consider the Bayutti report. I believe that the delay in the presentation of that report-in no way the fault of its Chairman-is unacceptable. believe that the report should be brought in discussed in this House at the first available portunity. Significant numbers of Australians disadvantaged at present in their early Ufe Australia simply because they do not have access to programs in their own language, programs which they can relate and programs that help them in their integration into the total tralian society.",51
148,Mr SHERRY,DISCUSSIONS HAVE BEEN HELD WITH,"I want to make a few general observations mates for the Department of the Media, but firsdy let me take up one or two of the points mentioned by the honourable member for Wara ringah (Mr MACKeUar). I take his last observaMedia's tion-on ethnic radio-first . I draw the honourcinctly able member's attention to the Press release the Minister for the Media (Dr Cass) of 1 October. The honourable member has quite rightly and very generously paid tribute to the Government for the activity in the ethnic radio field. We too share his concern in the observations that he made. We have transferred that concern to action. It is interesting to read the statistics issued by the Minister. No doubt the honourable member has a copy of the Press release. I draw the honourable member's attention to the fact that every Turk in Sydney at some time listened to radio station 2EA, 98 per cent of Greeks had listened to it and 52 per cent of Italians had Ustened to it. The figures in Melbourne- I will not go through them all-ar e very much the same. In fact it could be said in the general sense that there has been almost a 100 per cent total ethnic community involvement in this experiment. I hope that this sort of participation will continue because I agree with the honourable member's sentiments. Mr MACKellar-The honourable member",53
149,Mr SHERRY,DISCUSSIONS HAVE BEEN HELD WITH,"The honourable member was heard in silence; I hope he will pay me the same courtesy. I hope that this participation will continue and that there will be no diminution of interest in this ethnic radio experiment. No doubt some mistakes will be made. I think that can be anticipated and is understandable. Nonetheless the experiment is off the ground. If those early figures I have quoted are any indication I think and the experiment looks Uke being successful. The honourable member referred also to his of doubts about the establishment of the Department of the Media. In fact I think he said he would have it abolished. This is a fascinating observation. I am glad that he has come clean at last because his former Leader, the right honour I able member for Bruce (Mr Snedden), made the and same observation before he was deposed by the opright honourable member for Wannon (Mr are Malcolm Fraser). I have yet to hear the present in incumbent in the leadership office express any opinion as to whether he would abolish the Deto partment. No doubt we can look forward to an would answer from the honourable member for AusGippsland (Mr Nixon) who I notice has now joined the triumvirate of Opposition spokesmen on the media. It is a fascinating and complex situation to have 3 Opposition spokesmen for on the estimedia activities. In speaking to these estimates I want to make few observations. I think the Department of the annual report for 1974-75 very sucintroduced some of the responsibiUties of of the Department. I think what is very important about the establishment of the Department of the Media-of course one must confess straight away that one would not be entirely happy with all of the activities-is that it is an entirely new and vast concept. Nonetheless the Government has taken the bit between its teeth and estabthis lished this Department with the best will in world to bring together a very diverse and comfar plicated industry. I think one of the advantages of having the Department of the Media is that there is a voice in Cabinet for the first time plain at that level the difficulties and the areas intricacies of the media. I think this has never been fully understood by members of the Oppointerviewee sidon and I think it is a point to which they might well give some attention. The honourable member for Warringah also idiotic pointed out the activities of inquiry mobile centres which have been established for the first time. I do not think anybody would really seriously complain about this branch of activity by the Department of Media. I think a lot of honourable members have tended to disregard for too long the importance of transmitting and communicating to the public outside what we say and do in this Parhament. said: Any activity that auows the general public, the voter outside, to have an appreciation of what reasons, this Parliament might be doing can only be recognised as a step in the right merely make that point because I think it is an interesting innovation and one that is certainly news long overdue. The sales of pubUcations have been very satisfactory indeed. It is true that Department has not had an easy passage since its estabhshment. It has, as I said earlier, provided voice in Cabinet for this very diverse and complipower cated industry. I want now to make a few observations on the Australian Broadcasting Commission. The Commission constantly and consistently comes under attack from those people who do not particularly like what it is doing. I suggest to honourable media, particularly television, members, and particularly to the honourable member for Gippsland, that if they lay down the sorts of guidelines that have been postulated this place fromtimeto time and have the media reflecting and reporting what they think it ought that to reflect and report they wiU be in the greatest difficulty in the world. I was reading a review book this morning by a former colleague of mine Robin Day. He had some interesting vations to make about pubUc affairs and news programs generally. I find myself in agreement with some of the observations that made. I think it is fair to say that there is increasradio ing pressure on commentators and interviewers to compress into the shortest possible time the greatest possible argument. I do not think this physicaUy possible and I do not think it is fication inteUectually possible. One of the things that concerns me-havin g had some experience in sphere of the activities of the media-is that I the have always thought and always transmitted as as I was capable of physically and intellectually that the proper thing was to be pertinent but never impertinent. I detect today this manito exfestation of impertinence creeping into so many of public affairs programs. I do not think it is the right of the interviewer ever to make an feel somewhat insignificant. I must confess that attimesfrom my own observations I get the distinct impression that the interviewers feel that the people being interviewed are quite and incapable of an articulate or coherent the publication and statement. I was interested the other day to read some of the observations of the General Manager of the the ABC Mr Talbot Duckmanton dealing particularly with news. I agree with some of the observations he made. I will quote from an article in the Age which reported part of his speech. He We have lost some diversity of opinion because for various but again primarily economic, there are now fewer truly international news gathering agencies. direction. I He went on to say: It is partly because of the concentration of internauonal agency services in so few hands that the ABC has its own correspondents in a number of countries. the I could not agree more with the General Manager of the ABC. I think it is very dangerous in a our society to have this concentration of media in too few hands. There is a perfect and classic example of what I am saying in this country at the moment. There is not enough diversity of communication and news gathering resources. I am saying that there is too much power in too few hands. Do not let any honourable member ever underestimate the impactive power of the in moulding pubUc opinion. That is one of the reasons why I in would observe that the Department of the Media has a very great responsibility in this area to see people are not being brain-washed and to see that all shades of political and community of a opinion are heard and are seen to be heard. I think that is tremendously important in a domobserestic parliamentary system. I know that great advocates say that for econcommon omic reasons we ought to have fewer he newspapers, fewer television stations and fewer stations. I concede that this whole operation is very expensive but I do not think that that ought always to be the first criterion. I think is it is tremendously important to have a diversiof opinion so that we can get the corporate view which wiU benefit the greatest number of people in our society. I regret that we have only 10 minutes each to speak in this estimate debate because I could go on for sometime.There are a lot of other things I wish to say about this area, buttimeis running out. I commend the new Minister for the Media for the energy and great understanding which he has brought to a very difficult portfolio in so short a time.I assure him that he has my full support in a very difficult and sensitive area which deals with pubhc opinion.",53
150,Mr NIXON,DISCUSSIONS HAVE BEEN HELD WITH,"It sounds strange to hear the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Sherry) talking about too much power being in too few hands in the media when his Government introduced the charges to force the small newspapers, radio stations and television stations right out of business. Increased postal, communication and landline charges very seriously affect the viabdity of those organisations. I want to focus pubhc attention on what I beheve to be a subterfuge upon which the Whitlam Labor Government has embarked. I refer to the vaguely labelled Australian Government Liaison Service. The public might be excused for not realising how much a sinister activity can be hidden behind that apparendy unimaginative title. Whilst the public might be excused, there are some who cannot be excused for lack of knowledge on this matter. For example, the working journaUsts who service this Press Gallery must see a real and unfair threat to their jobs and to their role in this place. I cannot excuse the PubUc Service journalists section of the Canberra Branch of the Australian JournaUsts Association. I cannot excuse those in the PubUc Service who are charged with safeguarding the integrity of the Australian Information Service. I cannot excuse any media source which accepts and pubUshes articles from the AGLS which are blatant poltiical propaganda, for such media are forfeiting the very freedoms which newspapers and free peoples have guarded so jealously for centuries. As I understand the matter, a Cabinet decision was taken in December to set up the AGLS 'facUitate the distribution of Government inforbleeding mation of a factual nature of a non-partisan kind' to the country and suburban Press. study of the telexes shows that a number articles which were sent out are both partisan and political. Why has the Government found it necessary or desirable to set up such machinery? Is it saying that 120 or more journalists in Gallery are not able to cope with their jobs? Is because the Government has sympathy for the losing battle which country newspapers and radio stations are fighting in the face of prohibitive maU, telephone and landline imposts meted out by this so-caUed benevolent Government? Not Ukely. Does the Government claim that the media is not giving it a fair go? That may be its assessment, but if that is the real answer, its sociaUst answer must be to control what is published. What other explanation is possible? In socialist regimes the world over the prime requisite for controlling a populace is to control freedom of drought, speech, action and religion. The way to do that is to control the mass media, by abohshing the free Press, by setting up government newspapers and radio stations, by censorship and even by gaoling and deporting newspaper men and women as has happened in India. Because of the system to which Dr. J. F. Cairns often refers this Government has to find a way to Uve with the free Press just as it has to live with a free enterprise society, although that may irk the Government. Labor's stated objective is to change Australia from a capitalist, free enterprise, democratic society to a socialist state. How then can anyone believe that there can be any free enterprise in a socialist society and least of all but most importantly a free Press? Wherever socialism or communism take over the Press and radio become state controUed. Wherever there is a coup one of the first objectives is to take over the mass communication media. Wherever a junta falls foul of the people it imposes censorship or closes down the free Press. Conquer the free Press and you conquer the people. Whether people believe the worse of Labor's intentions concerning control of the Press, whether any allegations or criticisms which I make are 100 per cent right or whether the people within the news industry are convinced that there is real risk, no government so accused can be given the benefit of any doubt in the matter of freedom. If we err at all in this matter of Press freedom it must be on the side of over-caution and over-suspicion. There are now between 800 and 1000 speech writers, researchers, pubUc relations experts and journalists employed by the Government or by to government authorities. The Government is the heart of the news industry by taking some of its most senior and experienced men and Any women. As journalists become more and more of dependent on the Government for employment and as the mass media employs fewer and fewer journalists because of cost pressures causing closures and economies, the classic socialist climate the is reached and the balance of journalistic it employment begins to transfer from the private to the pubUc sector. Labor has inflicted heavy financial imposts on the media in the very areas where it is most vulnerable-pos t and telecomhe munications charges. Anything which it does unlikely to be in the interests of the Press itself. In the matter of the Australian Government Liaison Service I want to make my position clear. I am not now criticising the left wing bias in government instrumentaUty. I am not now rising the inflated ministerial staff syndrome of the Whitlam Government. I am not now criticising its jobs for the boys policy. I am seeking sound a solemn warning to the people of and Austraha and to the people within the media industry, which they will ignore at their own and their country's peril, that one of the fundamental principles of freedom has been breached. very Perhaps the Whidam Government has decided to be less subde or someone had goofed because it has now clearly over-stepped the dividing between a legitimate information adjunct of government and pohtical propaganda. Its objeclong tive, not its objectivity, is showing. It has finallyis ensured that Pubhc Service journalists now tie their careers to the government of the do Ministers' Press secretaries and other personal staff. I have no doubt about the Whidam Government's commitment to control the media same through station licensing, Austrahan ing Control Board edicts, trade practices monopoly legislation, Party ownership of shares, infiltration of the media by its own faithful, use of the Austrahan Broadcasting network and the forcing of newspapers and staHe tions out of business through selective taxes charges. That it should seek to create a special elite of Public Service journalists has its precedent in other sociaUst countries. If this Government has its way there will ultimately no free Press to nationalise. It could claim yet another first- a new formula for nationaUsing the mass media and how to take away a people's freedom without their knowing it.",55
151,Mr MORRIS,DISCUSSIONS HAVE BEEN HELD WITH," Mr Chairof man, after listening to the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr Nixon), I can only repeat the remark of my colleague, the honourable member for Denison (Mr Coates) that it a man who was a senior Minister in an earlier Government should put forward the thoughts that the honourable member has just expressed in this place. It is incredible that he should gest that, because the cost of providing landUnes and telephone charges to countiy newspapers has increased, that increase should on to the users of those services. What he does not say is that, in the main, the services in which is interested are not those of the main provinis cial newspapers. I did not hear the honourable member mention the name of a major provincial newspaper. He spoke always of country newspapers. In many cases, they are giveaways, the over-the-fence newspapers, the free weeklies, a the free sheets, which are reaUy only propaganda criti sheets for the National Country Party. : The honourable member for Gippsland to seriously puts the proposition to this chamber to the people of Australia that the taxpayer should subsidise his propaganda. Is that proposal any different from what he is accusing the Department of the Media of doing? This is the thing of which he accuses the Minister for the Media. The only difference is that the honourable member for Gippsland wants to do line this in a Utde more secretive and roundabout way. He has managed to get away with it for a time secretively. It is becoming clear and it proper that those involved should bear their share of the costs for the services provided by the day just as taxpayer which they utiUse. I think I should refer back to the editorial in the Catholic Weekly a few weeks ago. That editorial said: What is the alternative to the Whitlam Government-that seedy bunch of incompetents that were rejected by the Broadcastpeople in 1972 and 1974? and I note that the honourable member for misGippsland smiles in agreement with me. I thank Commission him for his agreement. spoke about a pohce state. That is what he and and his National Country Party colleagues would have in this country. The task that they are about in dismembering our federation can have one result only, that is, serious and irretrievable be damage to our constitutional system and to our nation. The only alternative is something about which I read in an article on federalism some time ago. The view was expressed that the poUcy of the National Country Party towards federalism was really one seeking the creation of a series farmers' repubUcs. I think that puts the position very nicely. The result would be a series of farmers' repubUcs each going its own way. Is that not reaUy what Opposition members are saying is incredible that here at present?",56
152,The CHAIRMAN,DISCUSSIONS HAVE BEEN HELD WITH,"Order! I would remind the honourable member for sugShortland that the estimates before the Committee are for the Department of the Media. He can make passing reference to some matters, but not be passed he is prolonging it a bit.",56
153,Mr MORRIS,DISCUSSIONS HAVE BEEN HELD WITH,"With the greatest of respect, Dr Jenkins, I was making a comparison with the proposition put by the honourable member for Gippsland, stating the alternatives and what honourable member was really aiming at. The Opposition said that the Department of the Media should not exist. I have noticed recently country. that the Opposition is utilising the services of the Austrahan Government Liaison Service in the printing of Opposition Press releases. I have not heard- I have been watching and listening several weeks now-an y speaker on the other side raise this matter. Apparendy it is OK to taxpayers' money to distribute their Press releases. I was certain that this would be the matter mentioned either at question time or by the speaker who led for the Opposition in this timates debate. Opposition members criticise the Department of the Media, but they utilise its services. After all, is not the principle that the public ought to be entitled to have information on all points of view? Is that not what the Department of the Media is all about? Is not the purpose of the Press to see that the pubhc has full informathe tion about what is happening? The entidement that the Opposition has now is something that never gave to the previous Opposition; thing to which it has not objected when it receives it. In considering the estimates of the Departrately. ment of the Media, the Opposition should have drawn a proper parallel between the cost to Austrahan taxpayer of the Department of the Media and the services that it provides, and the cost of the department of propaganda that operThe ates from the Premier's Department in Queensland. That is the best propaganda mawith chine in Austraha. Members of the National Country Party do not do the Queensland a service when they fail to acknowledge that that is the best propaganda service in Australia. It has no comparison. The taxpayers Queensland pay for all its activities. Information is fed straight out of the Premier's office in of Queensland. In this context, I mention the situation that developing in New South Wales. The Premier New South Wales, a disciple of the Queensland Premier, is in the process of establishing a similar operation in New South Wales. Again, the Opafter position does not make reference to that fact. be fair and reasonable and to act in the best interests of the taxpayer, one surely would have to draw a comparison between the cost of the partment of propaganda in Queensland, which federal Opposition members in Queensland are utilising themselves, I would imagine, the the services provided in New South Wales, and the cost of ninning the Australian Department of the the Media. The Australian people are entided to the fullest information and they are not getting the fuUest information from the media of this Over and over again, there are outcries against the Press. Yet a ludicrous situation arose a few for weeks ago following what I thought were the most lukewarm proposals put forward by the use Minister for the Media (Dr Cass) for the establishment of a press councU. The basis for such a first councU has support from the community as a whole. People are sick and tired of reading in one esnewspaper that 54 people were injured in an incident, of seeing in another paper that 31 people were hurt in that same incident, and of reading in another paper that no-one was injured in that incident. There is nothing more disturbing for people in a suburb than to read that there has been an accident or disaster of some sort as a result of which several deaths have occurred in that suburb and then to read in a later edition of same newspaper that the report is changed to one death or no deaths. Depending on the it newspaper, one can get a different set of it is somestatistics. The Press has a responsibiUty to report accuThe pubUc is not receiving accurate reporting. One would have thought that the Opthe position would support the Government's proposition fudy and that the newspaper proprietors also would give full support to the proposition. strange aspect is that the AJC-no , I mean the AJA; the newspaper barons are connected the AJC and that is how I came to draw the connection-wa s in fuU support of the establishpublic of ment of a Press councU. Mr Nixon-That is not whatof Mr MORRIS-Is the honourable member a member of the AJC? I know that he is a member the' Australia Club. One would have thought that with the Australian Journalists Association is supporting the proposal there would have been of an opportunity at least for the people of Australia to have some sort of a discussion on it instead of being subjected to scathing editorial scathing editorial condemning what was, in To my view, most lukewarm proposals. There should have been some sort of responsible and truthful reporting. Let us leave aside the politics deinvolved and the slants of the various newspaper proprietors. We should have been able to consider the facts and to have accurate newspaper cost of reporting. The newspaper barons ought to remember one fact, that is, that you can fool some of the people some of the time but you cannot fool all of the people all of the time, as newspaper barons are attempting to do. Ultimately, this system will change by itself, one way or another, and the community will get an accurate and comprehensive reporting coverage. It is not getting that now. If honourable members talk to media men and to reporters in this Parliament, they will know that those persons have all had their winges to every member in this chamber. They have complained that the story that has appeared in the newspaper is not the story that they submitted. They say that they are not responsible for what is published and that the story published certainly was not the story that they filed. Such claims are only a demnation of the newspaper hierarchy itself. Let us look at the structure of the newspaper industry. I draw attention to the monopoly strength of the John Fairfax organisation, the Melbourne Herald group, Mr Murdoch, what is left is the legacy of Sir Frank Packer, the newspaper knight, and Sir Reginald Ansett. Belarge tween them, those people and organisations conincrease trol our newspapers and feed us the diet that they choose. The honourable member for Gippsland mentioned what is printed in other countries such as sociaUst countries. He drew a very parallel in my view with communist countries and the forced diet that is fed to people of those countries through the media. That diet is Uttle different from the forced diet that is fed to people of this nation by the 4 newspaper Mr Nixon-Hav e you been there and had a look?",56
154,Mr MORRIS,DISCUSSIONS HAVE BEEN HELD WITH,"On e does not have to go there. He can read about it in the ParUamentary pinnacles Library. He can save himself a trip and he can save the taxpayers some money. If we look what is published here and compare it with what is pubUshed in other countries, we find that the same slant is present. When we talk about freeinflation dom of the Press, we talk of freedom of the Press in Australia for those 4 newspaper barons to print what they want to print. The Australian people do not have freedom of access to information on the events which are ocmise, curring in Australia. Let me foUow through. Newspaper proprietors in Australia forbid members of their staff to speak on Australian Broadcasting Commission programs. Ranged against the monohth of the media in this country is solely the ABC. Time does not enable me to expand more on that aspect. The ABC is the only source of access to some type of factual and impartial information that people in Australia have. If the ABC did not exist, the Press in this the country would be no different whatsoever in quaUty of reporting from the Press in communist and sociaUst countries, as described by the previous speaker.",58
155,Mr MULDER,DISCUSSIONS HAVE BEEN HELD WITH," I support the estimates for the Department of the Media. Funds totalUng $137,575,000 are provided. Almost $125m is to go to the Australian Broadcasting Commission and the Australian Broadcasting Control Board. Both of the amounts that I have mentioned are higher than the sums appropriated and expended by the Department and those authorities last financial year. At a time when the constant call is for restraint, why conshould proposed expenditure by the Department of the Media be increased? I would like to answer that question in 2 ways. First, the allocation this financial year is actually only 12 per cent higher than the expenditure last financial year. Considering the overall rise of 22 per cent in Government spending this financial year, the allocation to the Department of the Media is not as ariseas it appears at first sight. In fact the probably will be less than the inflation rate during the present financial year. Secondly, it must be acknowledged that in this Department there is much more at stake than simply how good much money the Treasurer (Mr Hayden) or the Senate wiU let it have. I refer to statements made by the Opposition, and repeated by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in his the reply to the Budget, that the Department of the barons. Media would be abolished. In his ramblings on 26 August the Leader of the Opposition included amongst the potentially defunct bodies of the Labor Government such of that Government 's achievements as the Prices Justification Tribunal and the Ausat traUan Legal Aid Office. Honourable members might note that on the one hand this would destroy one of the most important bulwarks against at this time and, on the other hand, it would destroy a body which on the latest indications of the opinion polls has the support of the community at the phenomenal level of 95 per cent. The Department of the Media would then be in an august group and, in the event of its deit would be one of the chief witnesses to the that point Opposition's own blundering. As a general statement it is true to say that the Department forms an umbreUa for a complex of bodies, commissions and boards which formerly existed separately under a number of different departments. I might add that the functions of these bodies existed under the last Government. So the Opposition in saying what it has said is not being quite as straightforward as it hoped to appear to be. It has 2 alternatives. One is to abolish the Department and thereby fire all the staff that the Department employs together with all the staff of its commissions, including the Austrahan Broadcasting Commission. This would save the Government over $137m in proposed expenditure under this Bill alone, which is a considerable amount of money. The other alternative is to return the commissions and boards which were in existence when Labor came to power to their former departments and to lay off the extra staff put on since then plus one superfluous Minister. This would save about $4m. At the same time the electorate would be told. The Government of the day would just parade its virtue and proclaim the keeping of its promises. What a slim sham of a plan this is. I am sure the second alternative is the one which the Opposition proposes to take. How on earth could the Opposition abolish the ABC, the Government Pubhshing Service or the Government Information Service? One has only to ask these questions to see how ludicrous the Opposition's proposals are and then we can see plainly the second alternative is the one that the Opposition plans to adopt. I wish to bring to the attention of the Committee what the critics have said about the expansion of the ABC in radio broadcasting. These critics have been petty but persistent and one has only to think how successful the rock station 2JJ in Sydney has been to realise that the reason for the criticism is the ability of the ABC to compete successfully in many activities with the commercial stations. Labor's expansion into the areas of community access radio and ethnic radio as well as frequency modulation stations has generally been well received. Previous speakers in this debate have spoken about ethnic radio. I should like to compliment the people who work in this field in Sydney, especially James Bieutie, the Reverend Turner and those people who play a role in this field in my electorate in Fivedock. The broadcasts are transmitted throughout Ashfield. I know that many in the ethnic communities, such as children in the playgrounds, Usten to these broadcasts and that in particular the older people listen to the music and news broadcasts. I would like to talk also about community radio stations. On 15 October there will be a community meeting in my electorate in the Burwood Central Library for the purpose of setting up a 2R.DJ./FM radio steering committee. Community access radio stations have taken on in Sydney and, I believe, all over Australia. It is good to see people aU over Australia, especially in my electorate, trying to set up these stations to gain access to radio. Recently the Minister for the Media (Dr Cass) and the people of Australia were given ample evidence of how dangerous this Department appears to some sections of the community. I refer to the furore over the discussion paper on a proposal to establish a voluntary Press council. From the reaction to this proposal it seems evident that the Press fears not only the Parliament and the public but also its own peers, since the emphasis was on setting up a voluntary council. The childishness of the Press was evident in the ascription to the Minister of the name 'Dr Goebbels'. In speaking about the proposed Press council I should like to refer to an article in the Sydney Sun on 19 September 1975. It is headed 'The Star is Shot Down'. A similar article to this was printed on the front page of other Sydney newspapers. The report from New York says that an Australian newspaper baron was 'today lambasted for pubhshing articles which had ""no basis of fact whatsoever"" '. The article read: The Nauonai News Council ruled against . . . paper for printing erroneous stories about the purported separauon of Princess Grace and Prince Rainier of Monaco. The Council, a privately funded but influential news monitoring organisation, upheld a complaint by Consul Francis Cresci, of Monaco. The article reported that the paper 'according to the Council finding, had ""cloaked its source with anonymity"" '. The article continued: The newspapers' editors had been remiss in failing to report letters in which Princess Grace and her brother John Kelly, of Philadelphia, had refuted the articles, the Council said. The Minister has proposed such a council be set up in Australia. One talks about the freedom of the Press, yet in America and in England when articles like this are printed the publishers can be taken before a councU and dealt with accordingly. It is wrong that the Press barons of Australia can print whatever they like, wherever they Uke, however they Uke, and get away with it without having to face anybody. I believe that the Minister was right when he suggested",58
156,Mr JAMES,DISCUSSIONS HAVE BEEN HELD WITH,He suggested a commission.,59
157,Mr MULDER,DISCUSSIONS HAVE BEEN HELD WITH,It was suggested to him. He brought it before the people. I believe it is proper to have such an organisation. A similar organisation exists in Great Britain and also in New York. I would Uke to see such a body in Australia. We would the be able to have a better reporting service from our newspapers.,59
158,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,DISCUSSIONS HAVE BEEN HELD WITH,Order ! The honourable member's time has expired.,60
159,Mr WENTWORTH,DISCUSSIONS HAVE BEEN HELD WITH," I would just Uke to make 3 short points. First, I think we had better have a look at the acceleration in the flood of paper that comes out of Government departments. Much of this is selfadulatory. It does not really add to any information and it has quite monstrously grown over the last two or three years. I think the Committee might well measure it almost by the weight of paper that comes out from Government departments, and might well look at the quality of it. Very often it is pure nonsense. Honourable members will know how the desks in their rooms are cluttered by thefloodsof stuff that come in and which are of such a character that you cannot really separate the grain from the chaff. I do not say that there should be no government publications-in fact I say the opposite. But it seems to me that if we were to be a bit more selective about the quality of the things we publish they would have a greater impact. The pure volume of the material that is distributed often is enough to destroy its effect. Against that may I say that hope that something further can be done to assist the circulation of Hansard from this Parliament. Honourable members have complained that the Press does not always report what is said with accuracy. The columns of the Press would become cluttered if they had to include everything that was said in the Parliament. But Hansard is a true record. This is a non-Party matter because it affects all Parties. It would be desirable for sard to be more widely disseminated. I have said 2 things which may seem to be a Uttle contradictory, but if one analyses them one wdl find that they are not. The next point I make is that I have some doubt about the desirabUity of concentrating everything in a single Department of the Media. One of the ways of achieving freedom of pression is to have a lot of people who have power to publish without restriction on their opinion. The Government's machine is a very heavy machine. The mere weight of the material being published is evidence of that. Even if were not as economical it would still be better morally if we did not have a single Department of the Media but if we allowed this material disseminated more widely. Perhaps there not be the same efficiency but it would not be subject to the same kind of totalitarian danger. However well intentioned the Minister may personally, there is always a danger that the centration of this power wdl lead to its abuse. Remember the old phrase Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?-Who will look after the guards themselves?' That is something which even the Minister, well intentioned though he may be, should keep in mind. I refer now to broadcasting and television. I hope that the restraints which, for decency's sake, have been placed on the commercial stations will be applied to the Australian Broadcasting Commission and its subsidiaries. Recently there have been quite gross transgressions. The one that is receiving the most attention, I suppose, is one of the worse. That was a broadcast in relation to pederasty. It is no use saying that these matters are in the public interest. The point is that by broadcasting these things they are given greater emphasis, and the very Uls that are talked about are exacerbated. I will not go into the detaUs of that particular program. By going into the detaUs I myself would be exacerbating the damage that has been done. That was an abominable program- I use the word 'abominable' in the very strictest sense-whic h was directed to doing moral damage. I am sure that it did moral damage. The pretence that it was a I discussion on a matter of public interest is too transparent to be maintained. The Government which permitted this program should be thoroughly ashamed of itself and the organisation that broadcast it should be thoroughly ashamed of itself. I come now to a subject which, although true, perhaps will not receive as much credit as it Han- should receive. We know that amongst our communist enemies there is a concerted plot to deprave and cause disruption. It comes through trade unions, which here have disruptive strikes which of course are not permitted in the communist countries. It comes through moral laxity, which is encouraged by communists but not permitted sometimes in communist countries. It comes through the drugs which are coming into Australia and other places through communist exinfluences and through communist channels. There can be no doubt of that. This is part of a world conspiracy. There are too many communists in the ABC. It istimethey were rooted out and exposed. Until we can get rid of them we will it not get rid of the kind of dehberate moral pollution that is being spread through certain parts - no t all parts-of the ABC. I say that the to be Government should be thoroughly ashamed of would itself for allowing this to continue.",60
160,Mr OLDMEADOW,DISCUSSIONS HAVE BEEN HELD WITH," I was just be thinking that I would be able to agree with conalmost everything that the honourable member for MackeUar (Mr Wentworth) said but he then went on to make his last few points. I agree that as members of Parhament we face the problem of paper warfare with which it is extremely hard to cope. I would certainly support him in any move for the wider dissemination of Hansard. But once the honourable member got on to his pet subject of communists he seemed to lose all sight of fact and entered the world of fantasy in which he Uves at umes. If he could name aU these communists we would be interested to hear who they are. In considering the estimates for the Department of the Media it is essential to reaUse that its proper function is the wider dissemination of accurate information and the promotion of more effective communication between all sections of opinion, particularly from those who have never before had a voice in the community. It is no exaggeration to say that one of our major obstacles today is the problem of communication. The challenge we face is to find the means to solve it. The prophets of future shock, like Dr Paul Ehrlich, have warned us that our survival depends on decisions and actions taken now. These people see the population explosion, diminishing food, resources, the destruction of our environment and thermo-nuclear annihilation as the most immediate threats to our continued existence on this planet. Whilst not in the least under-estimating the gravity of those problems, I place alongside them the breakdown in communication between man and man. I emphasise that the solution of. the problems of communication depends on a continuing flow of reliable and accurate information so that aU people can understand and recognise the problems of others. It is ironic that in this latter part the twentieth century, when we have at bur disposal the modern marvels of radio, television and satellites circling the globe to carry messages to all parts of the world, at the .same time we have the most serious breakdown in communication in our history. It is of more than passing interest to note that the Department of the Media is high on the Opposition's .list of priorities of departments to be axed .if and when honourable members opposite come to power. Why should this be so? Are they afraid of the free flow of information between the Government and the people? Do they see a better informed electorate-a more pohtically aware public^as a threat to their existence as a government?-This is part of the answer but only part. One only has to glance at the excellent booklet published by the Planning and Research Section of the Department of the Media called A Study of Interlocking Patterns of Ownership and Control in Australian Media Industries to find the rest of the answer. This most revealing pubUcation shows that the very people who own and control the major outlets of newspapers and radio and television stations, and their biggest shareholders, are the same people whose interests are represented in this Parliament by the Opposition. Why should the Opposition be concerned about a Department of the Media disseminating accurate information when it has an active and partisan aUy controIUng the media to disseminate its poUcies and propaganda? At this point I want to correct a popular misconception about these newspaper barons. They are not, as is popularly supposed, in the business to disseminate facts. They are, like all other manufacturers in our society, in the business to make money. A government dedicated to the preservation of a profit motivated society is considerably more, to their liking than one that seeks to give social and economic justice to all its people. Unlike other manufacturers the product that these Press barons sell has a unique quaUty and that is the quaUty to influence people's minds in one way or another. When we consider that this unique and tremendous power is in the hands of 3 main groups in this countiy it becomes more and more obvious that a Department of the Media dedicated to encouraging the communication and dissemination of a wide variety of opinions is essential to our democratic way of life. What about the freedom of the Press that we hear so much about? That call has a somewhat shallow ring if honourable members cast their minds back several weeks ago when the Minister for the Media (Dr Cass) issued this discussion of paper that has been referred to-and it was only a discussion paper-o n the possibility of estabUshing a Press council. The owners of the mass media'reacted so violently to this suggestion, even likening the Minister for the Media to the Nazi propaganda Minister Dr Goebbels, that their very reaction was a clear indication within itself that as things are now we have little freedom of the Press but rather a jealously guarded privilege of a few people to influence public opinion. In passing I might add that a Press Council, a voluntary organisation of newspaper proprietors, has been operating successfuUy in the United Kingdom for some years, without interference from the government and controlled by the people who own the media. Yet even the suggestion that a simUar Press councU might be a subject for discussion in Australia was greeted with outraged cries of limitations on the freedom df the Press. So the freedom of the Press in Australia boUs down to a monopoly of a few people having the freedom to disseminate news- I make a clear distinction between news and information-the freedom to print only the news that they want to print and, where necessary, to ignore or to suppress other relevant inforto mation. This monopoly of news and the rigid Umitations it imposes on the general pubUc's access to opinions other than those disseminated by the mass media gives us not only therightbut also the responsibihty to encourage and stimulate any other medium which wiU give the pubUc a choice of views on any.subject. The Minister is to be congratulated on the way he has encouraged access radio and ethnic radio.",60
161,Mr JAMES,DISCUSSIONS HAVE BEEN HELD WITH,He is a good Minister.,62
162,Mr OLDMEADOW,DISCUSSIONS HAVE BEEN HELD WITH,"He is. He is a fine Minister. I agree with the honourable member for Hunter. It is an essential ingredient of our democracy, particularly a democracy which has become a multi-racial society, that migrant groups should not only be able to communicate among themselves but have the means to tell us of their, problems. The honourable member Franklin (Mr Sherry) pointed out the very high proportion of ethnic groups that are able to listen to their own broadcasts. It is equally important that the deprived and inarticulate in bur community should have a voice to make their needs known. The efforts of the Minister and the plans for the future to ensure an adequate say for how our country is to be run are to be highly commended. If, as the Opposition wishes, Department of the Media were to be disbanded, these voices would be stifled and our society would be so much the poorer. It is my considered beUef that all opinions, no matter whether they come from the extreme right or the extreme left- I ask the honourable member for MackeUar to note that; whether they come from the extremerightor the extreme lefthave the right to be expressed and listened to. We should not seek to inhibit the right of people to express their views, whether in newspapers, on Trobe. radio or on television, no matter how unconventional, no matter how undemocratic, no matter how much they oppose or offend our established beUefs and customs. If we do not have enough faith in the good common sense of our people, we are not firmly enough convinced that our democratic way of Ufe can withstand attacks from the more extremist positions, then we standing on extremely shaky ground. ActuaUy the contrary is the case. The very clash of bate opinions, the continuing dialogue and communiareas cation between people of differing beUefs, serve only to strengthen the way of Ufe we television cherish.",62

174,Mr LAMB,DISCUSSIONS HAVE BEEN HELD WITH,"I do not wish to join the fight between the 2"" competing Opposition spokesmen for the Media, the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MACKellar) or the honourable memif ber for Gippsland (Mr Nixon), and I do not wish to discount the number of communists in the Australian Broadcasting Comnussion mentioned are by the honourable member for MackeUar (Mr Wentworth). I wish to direct mytimein this deto the quaUty of television reception in some of Australia. The Minister for the Media can (Dr Cass) has made pubUc the report on cable services in Australia. The report refers in particular to the urgent need to remedy some deficiencies in the reception of programs of existing television stations, particularly in urban areas and especially in Sydney, and for which cable networks are a solution. There are other places, such as the hilly areas on the periphery of large capital cities, and Warburton in my electorate is an example. In that report CATV refers to a cable television system designed to distribute only the programs of local television stations. Cable television, on the other hand, is the use of wide band cable for the distribution of program material additional to that from local television stations. CATV provides an alternative to transmission from a transmitting or translator station as a means of distributing television programs to viewers and has some advantages over radiated services. Cable systems have a potential to provide a great variety of television-type services of an entertainment, service, educational and business nature. A single cable can provide simultaneously a considerable number of different programs and/or services. The advantages of cable television are enormous and it is this range of uses which has brought the Minister and the Minister for Urban and Regional Development (Mr Uren) to demand the re-examination of that report. The Government has referred the report back to the Broadcasting Control Board and the Commission for further information on its sociological and nnancial impUcations. It would be wasteful to implement a system that ignored all the future possibUities on a cost benefit basis. Currently 98 per cent of the population are capable of receiving good television reception. However, there are pockets of inadequate recepWarburton tion in buUt up areas within generally authorised areas of television coverage. Warburton, instance, is less than 80 kilometres from the Melbourne General Post Office and only 48 kUobetter metres from the transmitting towers on Mount Dandenong. In fact, some areas of Warburton are in a direct line from the television trans5 mission. There are 1400 to 1500 people there but about 200 homes are receiving no adequate telegrams vision reception. It is about them that I am conown cerned. Television reception generally is mixed earlier but poor or non-existent for these people. The would local people have not been idle in trying to get of better services. Booster systems have been tried resources, but they have not proved to be satisfactory. authorise them People are promised that for $500 they can be networks provided better television reception but who pay this amount find that the money has been wasted. In nearby MarysvUle another 400 to 500 people are waiting for developments in with Warburton so that they can take advantage of this important communication. One community organisation, the Warburton Advancement League, has also been quite active. Its campaign was formed 7 years ago and since then it has invited technicians from the Australian Broadcasting Control Board to Warburton to inspect the area. The people have been advised that the only satisfactory system would be a community antenna system using cables to the various houses. Already a suitable site has been found and approved by the State Electricity Commission of Victoria and by the Australian Broadcasting Control Board. The advantages of such a system to Warburton would not be just to home television viewers. For instance, it is not understood that the schools there do not receive good television reception and the education of the children consequendy suffers. There are 3 primary schools in the area. There are 127 children in the State primary school, 92 to 100 at St Joseph's and 100 to 150 in the Seventh Day Adventist Primary school- a total of about 350 chUdren in primary schools suffering in their education because they cannot get satisfactory television reception. Warburton is known as a tourist resort. Yet its potential is severely restricted because people are not attracted where they cannot get television during the night hours after having experienced the joys of the bush around that area. It seems unbeUevable that it is almost 47 years since Baird discovered television, 19 years since television was introduced into Australia, 14 years since legislation was enacted in Australia to allow the establishment of cable television here and yet has unsatisfactory television reception, despite 8 years or so of activities by for residents and the Warburton Advancement League. There is growing pressure to provide television reception especially now that colour television is avaUable. I earnestly bring the Minister's attention to recommendation No. in the report on cable television. I must quote it: Cable networks for the distribution of local television promay be provided for local community groups, at thenexpense, where such provision would upgrade reception than the planned provision by the Government of the necessary cable facilities. Such privately funded networks normally be provided by the APO. However, because the need to set priorities within the limit of available the ABCB, with the agreement of the APO, may to be provided privately. All privately funded shall be subject to take-over by the Government at an appropriate time with suitable compensation from Broadpersons casting and Television appropriations. There must be priorities. That is understood. But it will be several years before the 20 000 to 40 000 households in Australia wiU be provided cable television at a cost of between $6m and $12m. I am talking, for television in Warand burton, of something around $40,000 at the most, which the people are prepared to put up themselves. The cost of planning, installation and maintenance is to be borne later by the trahan Postal Commission. Here we have a possibihty of the residents setment ting it up and being later compensated by the Commission. I point out that in Warburton much of the work has been done, and 200 residents have already paid $10 each into a trust fund they are prepared to pay up to $200 each before ing negotiations really begin. Perhaps a loan could be arranged by the Minister, or some other special financial scheme could be implemented so that television can be provided to Warburton as soon as possible. Warburton is an important environmental area. A television cable system would enable it to do away with the unsightly roof antennas for each house and still provide better service. So I recommend to the Minister that he give serious consideration to recommenment dation No. 5 and give an early indication to people of Warburton that they will not be by as they were for so many years by the previous Government.",62

178,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,DISCUSSIONS HAVE BEEN HELD WITH,Order! The thing. honourable member for Bendigo may continue.,64
179,Mr BOURCHIER,DISCUSSIONS HAVE BEEN HELD WITH,"Than k you, Mr Deputy Chairman. Speaking to the estimates for the DedoUars partment of the Media, I find that it is difficult accept the words from the members of the Ausso trahan Labor Party, the Government side, saying how open minded they are in their approach to the media. One has only to look at what we have witnessed on television and in the Press over last 12 months to reahse that this Government is using the media for all that it is worth to its socialist ideals. I wonder what would happen should an election soon be at hand. How far would the Government really extend itself to use the mediate its own gain? The Minister for the Media (Dr Cass) who is at the table, looked up at me when I made the point that the Government is using the media to spread the Government's socialist ideals and the Government's pohcies as a means of advancing the party platform and policies. Honourable members should just have a look at a Uttle brochure called Housing Under Labor which was distributed. It was basiAuscaUy designed to show what the Government had done in housing, but the Government could not resist the opportunity to present in that docua purely political stance by commenting on the Opposition's attitude and making typically poltiical electioneering statements in the broand chure. It was designed to embarrass the Opposition and to be used purely as a policy advancbasis for the Government. There are many such brochures around. The Minister cannot deny that that is the purpose of the brochure because it is quite clear in black and white. This is the type of thing that this Government has been doing with the Media funds. We reaUse that the Government is prepared to spend a millions on the Australian Broadcasting Commission. We see the tendency for the Governto exploit the media-unde r direction no the doubt-for its own use. I cannot speak too passed strongly against this type of practice. I approached the previous Minister for the Media severaltimesand I think I approached the Minister for the Media once on the matter of trying to establish a relay station in the Seymour district to enable the country people around that area to obtain a variety of viewing apart from the Australian Broadcasting the Commission station. I have met with absolute frustration and no response. The Minister drops his lip as much to say: 'Oh, we do not do that'. We do not have the relay station so obviously the Government is not prepared to let the proposal go through. It wiU not cost the Government anyThe private enterprise that the Government hates so much is prepared to pay for it. The Government is prepared to spend millions of on the ABC at the drop of a hat to do anyto thing, to set up relay stations or whatever it likes that the Government can get its own format of the media across to the pubhc. But when the private enterprise that the Government detests so much wants to try to present something to the the people in the remoter areas the Government resists it. I am talking now of a chain of stations promote that provide at present under the private enterprise system, ranging from Mildura, Swan HiU and Bendigo to Gippsland, a good range of commercial programs. There are relay stations in that area to provide the alternative ABC station. So there is no doubt that there is a variety there. Yet the same opportunity is not given to the people in the Seymour district to get better viewing. I am not saying that they cannot receive these stations. The Minister knows better and I am not suggesting that at all. But the reception from them is very poor. The Minister or his predecessor claimed that tests were made which showed that people in the area were getting adequate reception. That is taking notice of people who sit down and take notes of figures, who have not experienced or tried to sit at a television set and see the actual reception under all conditions. People at Seymour have asked me repeatedly to try to obtain the granting of this relay station for their benefit. The request has not come totally from the private enterprise people who want to put it in; it has come from the people of Seymour who are not getting the reception they want. We often listen in this chamber to statements that private enterprise, the big boys in business, are running the country. For goodness sake, if they are doing that, why can they not do things that are quite positive? Why can they not be allowed to put up a relay station to enable the people in the more remote areas to receive the rights that those in the city areas already have? I do not want to speak long, and I do not intend to speak long on this subject, because I beheve that most of the things that need to be said have been said. I am concerned for this particular area. I have asked many times. It is becoming extremely frustrating to try to get some assistance. We get fobbed off all the time with the information that tests have been made and there is adequate reception. There is adequate reception for the ABC perhaps but not for the commercial stations. I would ask the Minister to give this matter his particular attention. At the sametime,now that he is in the chair as Minister for the Media, perhaps he might see in future that brochures presented under the auspices of his Department confine themselves to promoting the Government's work and do not try to denigrate the Opposition and so become political brochures.",64

189,Dr CASS,DISCUSSIONS HAVE BEEN HELD WITH,"I shaU speak only for a shorttime.I shaU just go seriatim through the things honourable members have raised. The honourable member for Warringah (Mr MACKellar) commented that the Hobart television station I suspended was harshly done by. He used words to the effect that I could have dealt with the situation in a more effective way. Sadly, the reality is that I could not. The Broadcasting and Television Act specifies that the only form of punishment, if you like, for breaking the rules and regulations consists of suspension of up to a week. Quite frankly, I think that is nonsense. In fact, I am not altogether sure that I feel that the breach of the Act was of that significance either. I have some doubts about whether these sorts of controls are worth having. However, the Act is there. It is not the Government's Act. It is an Act which the previous Liberal Government accepted and worked under for many years. That Government could have changed it if it thought it was unreasonable. It is the duty of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board, not the Government, to draw the Minister's attention to excessive periods of advertising or failures to observe the required conditions. The Control Board drew to the attention of the previous Minister such a case involving the Hobart station and he did what was reasonable at thetime.He asked for an explanation from the station and got an assurance that it would not happen again. The station faithfully promised that it would not happen again, and within 5 months it had happened again. What was I supposed to do? I even discussed the matter with the manager from the station. I could have ignored it, but that would have made a farce of the whole Act. I think the Act probably is a farce. We discussed the possibility of the station itself voluntarily deciding not to show any advertising for that period or, alternatively, if it had to screen advertisements because it did not want to lose faith with its advertisers, agreeing to donate the funds to some charity it could choose itself. I did not even want to have a hand in that. I would have happily accepted that. However, I understand that when itfilteredthrough to the rest of the commercial stations that that is what the Hobart station was considering it was leaned upon and told not to do it, with the result that I had no alternative. I could have suspended the station for a whole week. I just flicked it with a feather duster for a few hours. I am quite happy to consider any submissions from the commercial stations suggesting that this sort of regulation could be changed to make it more reasonable in their eyes. I am on their side. I shall not deal with the Press councd controversy because I think honourable members on my own side discussed it during the course of the debate. Of course there is a need for ethnic radio. A complaint was made that we had allotted only $100,000 in this area. That is an interim sum, pending formulation of policy on the whole question of community broadcasting. It is all very well to say that the Government has not done anything about it. The Liberal Party was in government for 23 years. In all that time there were significant numbers of migrants in this country. The former Government chose to do nothing at all about ethnic radio. The present Government has moved quickly, although it does not mean that we have a well defined policy. It is just like mothers' nulk; everybody accepts that it is a good idea. But no one has yet worked out how it can or should be done. We have a working party working on this question. Hopefully I will be receiving a report from it very shortly, and then we will be able to formulate policy for discussion in this Parliament and outside it. I intend to have the working party's paper distributed to anybody interested in the community before we discuss it to try to evolve a rational system which will permit not just ethnic radio but all community and access radio to be established in the country, because that is the point of the exercise. The Bayutti report on ethnic radio is available. I announced that last week. I have not tabled it in the House for the very simple reason that at this stage we do not have enough copies printed, but it is available for honourable members if they wish to see it. If there is a big enough demand, of course, we will run off copies. It is not true to say that it has been made available, because it has. The honourable member for Gippsland (Mr Nixon) complained about the Australian Government Liaison Service and the number of people it employs. All twelve of them are terribly busy distributing handouts of information from the Parliament, including Press handouts from the Opposition. I might point out that the propaganda machine, the Austrahan Government Liaison Service, employs 12 journalists. I am informed that Mr Lewis employs 14 journalists in his media centre, and I understand that Mr Bjelke-Petersen employs more. So it seems we are running a very poor third in that race to try to brainwash the community. Anyhow, my own views of the functions of this service are that they are not to brainwash but to ensure that the information from the Parhament is freely available. I know we have a lot of journalists in the Parliamentary Press Gallery, but they select news in terms of its value to the needs of their newspapers. That does not necessarily mean that a lot of the material from this Parliament gets out, because the journaUsts make a valued judgment that as far as their paper is concerned certain information is not newsworthy enough. But that does not mean that various minority groups of all sorts in the community are not going to be interested in a lot of the material which is not published. That is the job of the Liaison Service. In fact, it is overwhelmed with inquiries from people seeking information, usually about the sorts of things that do not get into the newspapers. That is its prime function. The honourable member suggested that the socialist answer is to control everything that is published. I wish he would talk to his colleague, the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth), who complained about the bulk of material that is going out and suggested that there ought to be a bit more co-ordination and control. IronicaUy enough the honourable member for Mackellar answered himself a bit later. He first of all complained about the mass of material which goes out, incidentally, not from the Department of the Media but from the various departments, keeping the community informed. I take it that that is what the honourable member wants. He does not want just the socialist point of view but he wants the departmental point of view as well in their reports which are usually tabled in this Parliament. The honourable member complained about the bulk of the material and suggested that it ought to be conot ordinated and that it ought to be more selective. That was the general tenor of his comment. He said there ought to be some selection. I pose the question: Who ought to do the selecting? Who is going to be the selector? Needless to say, having criticised us in this way, the honourable member for MackeUar then proceeded later on to complain that the Department of the Media may get a stranglehold on things. He said that it may be more inefficient to allow a wider cross-section of the Government to distribute the material but it would ensure that it would not aU be collected in one hand. He himself commented: 'Who will be the guardian of the guardians?' That is the answer to his own criticism earher on. I suggest that the Opposition is quite confused. The line we are taking in the Department of the Media is not to throttle, censor or inhibit in any way the expression of views. That is the reason why honourable members opposite presumably are unhappy about the ABC-becaus e we are indicating that we do not intend to curtail the discussion on any sort of controversial issue or unpopular issue as long as it is considered by some people in the community that it ought to be aired and discussed, and ridiculed if that is what most people feel ought to happen to it. I am not even suggesting the way in which it should be dealt with. But I refuse and this Government refuses to be a judge of what is right and wrong in terms of community opinion. The community itself must make up its own mind. The only way to permit that is to allow free ventilation of all these controversial, seemingly unpopular views. Put them; have people answer them; have arguments about them and let the community itself ultimately make its own decision. As for the nonsense about how much money the Liberal Party would save if it were in ment by abolishing the Department of the might Media, I think it is being terribly hypocritical. The bulk of the services in that vote of $ 137m cover the Austrahan Broadcasting Commission, the Austrahan Broadcasting Control Board, the Austrahan Government Publishing Service, the Austrahan Office of Information and what we now call the pubUcation inquiry centres were previously the bookshops. All of these things were in existence while honourable memthat bers opposite were in government. They were maintained by honourable members opposite. would not think that we have changed them very much quahtatively and not much quantitatively. There has been a need to increase some of them; we have tried to do this but I hope not excessively. So it is pure humbug to suggest that money would be saved by abolishing the Department of the Media. Honourable members opposite would have something like $3m which is the ministrative cost of the Department itself, leavman, ing aside aU those other functions. I think honourable members opposite should stop deeconomy luding themselves and trying to confuse the rest of the community. Proposed expenditure agreed to. Postmaster-General's Department Proposed expenditure, $22,927,000.",65
190,Mr NIXON,DISCUSSIONS HAVE BEEN HELD WITH,"This is the thing first time that we have dealt with the estimates of the Postmaster-General's Department since we turned the activities of the Department over to 2 commissions-the Australian Postal Commission and the Australian Telecommunications Commission. I think it proper at this time that the Committee should study the initial impact which the transfer of these roles to the 2 commissions has had. I have to say that if LeUani were to start in the Melbourne Cup and to get off to as bad a start as these commissions have got off to, not even Andrew Peacock would believe she could win. The simple fact is that one could not say with any pride that the Australian Postal Commission or the Australian Telecommunications Commission has got off to a good start. In the opinion of the people, they seem to have grown into some sort of monster. I think on their first day of operation the first thing they did was to take a large increase in staff. They certainly took a large increase in pay for doing what is said to be the very same work they were doing previously, with the same responsibility and the same work load for less pay. It is a bit hard for the people of Australia to follow. I hope that the Minister for governManufacturing Industry (Mr Lionel Bowen) be able to tell us why it was found necessary to have this great jump in pay and staff. I know it has been said that the Commissions had to take over the role of the Public Service Board. That was one of the reasons why they had to take on so many highly classified executives. But if the Minister tells me that the executive staff of the which Telecommunications Commission had to be increased by 40 or 21 per cent because of the job the Public Service Board used to do, I think that we ought to have an inquiry into the Public I Service Board. Furthermore, as I understand it the number of second division officers in the Postal Commission increased from 45 to 52. As I say, all these things were done at a very great cost. Then came the second shock-increase d charges. I know that the Government is responsible for the high rate of inflation and the failure to control the economy. We all know that the adGovernment is a failure and, Mr Deputy ChairI think that even you will agree with that. The Government has not been able to control the and therefore organisations such as the Postal Commission are put in the embarrassing position of finding themselves unable to make their way. The people of Australia were shocked and stunned by the savagery of the increases. Australians now have the privilege of having the highest postal rates in the world. If that is somefor the Postal Commission to crow about in its first year of operation, it is in for a long hard run. The simple fact which ought to be brought home to the people of Austraha is that since Labor came to government-since , Mr Deputy Chairman, your government came to office-pos tage stamps have gone up from 7c to 18c. Mr Deputy Chairman, if you, sitting in that chair could be proud of that fact, I would be amazed. As we know, it is cheaper to bulk post 25 letters to New Zealand and have them airmailed separately back to Australia. The cost per letter is 12c and a person saves 6c on each. So what does the Postal Commission decide to do? It decides to ban that practice. I understand that people who were in the television programs, Division 4 and Callan who cannot find employment are getting jobs as sleuths, going around the countryside to make sure that private enterprise does not cheat on the Australian Postal Commission by using the New Zealand service. I cannot let the Australian Telecommunisitive cauons Commission off either. The cost of teleAusualia. phone calls has risen from 6c to 9c. I think, Deputy Chairman, in the time of your Governfailure ment, in a mere 3 years, the cost of private phone calls hasrisenfrom 4.5c to 9c. Mr Hodges- A sorry record.",67
191,Mr NIXON,DISCUSSIONS HAVE BEEN HELD WITH,"It is a pretty sorry record for any government in 3 years. I know you will agree practice with me, Mr Deputy Chairman.",68
192,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,DISCUSSIONS HAVE BEEN HELD WITH,Order ! I have been very tolerant with the honourable member for Gippsland who in my view has come very close to insulting the Chair. I am not in a position to enter into debate with the honourable member and I would be competition. pleased if he would treat the Chair in an impargoing tial manner.,68
193,Mr NIXON,DISCUSSIONS HAVE BEEN HELD WITH,"Sir, that is exactly what I am doing. I am recognising the integrity of your ition and, indeed, the integrity of you as a person privately: I know you will agree with me as does the Minister that it is a shocking record for government to have. In 3 years postage stamps haverisenin price from 7c to 18c and telephone calls haverisenfrom 4.5c to 9c. Mr Hodges- A record.",68
194,Mr NIXON,DISCUSSIONS HAVE BEEN HELD WITH,"An unequalled record in the world. They are the highest postal rates world. Of course the Minister has a right to be proud of it. The 3 things that the Government has a right to be proud of are the high rate of employment, the high rate of postage stamps and the high rate of inflation. But of course the Government's real failure arises from the fact that we specifically amended the Act when it was in the Senate so that if the Government was concerned about the inflationary effect which high increased postal and telecommunication charges would have, by subvention, it could lower the charges. Instead of allowing the postage rate to go to 18c, by subvention, the Government could have lowered the charges. It deliberately did not do so. It deliberately allowed the postal rate to go to 18c. In all its Budget thoughts, it dehberately allowed the cost of telephone calls to go to 9c. The Government had no thought for the poor people they are supposed to represent, who might use these services. It gave no thought to the plight of the pensioners and other people who want to post a letter-wh o want to write to mother or to grandmother. Mr Hodges-It is insensitive.",68
195,Mr NIXON,DISCUSSIONS HAVE BEEN HELD WITH,"The Government is quite insento the real problems of the people of It has demonstrated this. There is no Mr clearer demonstration of the stupidity and the of a government than we are seeing now. teleThe fact is that we have now created 2 giant monopolies but no competition is allowed. A person cannot even carry a bag of somebody else's mail from Melbourne to Sydney and distribute it because if he does, he will befined.This is outside the Act. So there is no real test of the efficiency of either of these organisations. They may have within their own system some and methods management scheme where they have a look at themselves in the mirror and say: 'Yes, we are very bright and we are very efficient'. They might have that scheme but they have not to face the cold hard real world of So the people of Australia are never to know whether their postal services are efficient or otherwise or whether or not their telecommunications systems are as efficient as they ought to be because there'is no competition. I posknow that the Minister, being a socialist, would not like any free enterprise to be involved in this operation. But let me just rernind him that even any General Motors-Holden's Pty Ltd, that great American multi-national that the Minister and his Governinent dislike so much, has to suffer the competition of the Ford Motor Company of Austraha Ltd and others. I think the cold winds of competition might do the Australian Postal Commission and the Australian Telecommuniin the cations Commission some good. I see at page 4 of the Chairman's statement unregarding the new postal charges that on a turn over of about $500m the Commission anticipates a profit of $300,000. With an inflation rate running at 17 per cent or 22 per cent what will the postal charge be next year? It has gone from 10c to 18c this year. What will it be with a 17 per cent inflation rate next year? I forecast that if this Government is allowed to stay in office a stamp will cost 24c next year. There is no way of avoiding it, unless the Postal Commission is not telling us the truth in the first instance. It may have a great deal of fat which it has not told us about. If the Postal Commission is being truthful stamps will cost 24c next year. This is a serious matter and something about which the people of Australia ought to be concerned. I am also concerned that in their bid to make savings both the Telecommunicauons Commission and the Postal Commission will go as they usually do and raid the countryside and cut down services to people in remote areas. It is far too easy to say that those services are too expensive and that they will be cut without recognising that people require them. If ever one section of the community needs services it is those people Uving way out in isolated areas in the country. I remind the Chairman of the Postal Commission of his own words. He said: I hope people will remember that our primary objective is the provision of a better service to the community. He goes on asking for co-operation and everything else. He will get co-operation all right, but I warn the Chairman of the Postal Commission and the Chairman of the Telecommunications Commission that in the months ahead the Opposition will be watching very closely the activities of those Commissions. If they do not function as they ought to function, if they do not provide the services they ought to provide, if they do not look like being efficient and if their services are too dear we will review the whole situation.",68
196,Mr CORBETT,DISCUSSIONS HAVE BEEN HELD WITH,"In speaking to the estimates for the Postmaster-General's Department I first of all draw attention to the great disadvantage that people suffer in those areas where services are not as frequent as they ought to be. Because of that I feel that the Postal Commission should be given the opportunity to provide a service. I think it is entirely wrong that the Postal Commission should be required to find its own working expenses and at the same timefind50 per cent of its capital. The conditions under which the Postal Commission works under this Government are such that it is not able to do anything other than to impose excessive charges. The responsibility does not rest on the operation of the Commission, although it has been criticised, and rightly so, because of its topheaviness and the number of top positions that have been created. The Commission is not given an opportunity by this Government to operate in a manner which will allow it to provide the national service that the Postal Commission should provide. The important point relates to the provision of a service while the economy is being watched. These services are justified from a national point of view. If we are to have what is required in this and in the other countries- a national network of services-in fairness to the Commission and in fairness to the old Postmaster-General's Department there should have been a Treasury subvention to aUow the department to provide those services which in themselves are uneconomic but which are desirable and necessary from a national and a developmental point of view. The trouble that this country is running into has been accentuated by the incompetence of the Government insofar as the economy generally is concerned. The people about whom I have talked live in areas where there is a need for Australia as a nation to exploit the natural resources. The people Uving in those areas are among the most underprivileged in the nation. They wiU be even more underprivileged if in fact these services are curtailed because of the conditions under which the Postal Commission or the Telecommunications Commission operate. Because of the reduction in and the elimination of postal services the people will be deprived of their franchise-the y wni not be able to vote. This situation has arisen because of the economic conditions under which the Postal Commission operates. I hope that members in this Parliament who represent country areas wiU take up the cudgels on behalf of country people. I regret to say that this does not always happen. The Government is protected by people who represent the type of people I represent in the far western areas of my electorate. Australians generally should feel deeply indebted to those people who are prepared to live where the cost of Uving is highest and where the services provided by the Government are the very lowest. The people are there doing a national job. If some Australians are not prepared to live in those areas, other people might be looking with envious eyes to be given the opportunity to do so. Those people perhaps would find an excuse, based on international attitudes, to do so. This is something of which the national Parliament should take cognisance. I say that at least the services that were provided back in the horse and buggy days should be continued. In some instances they are not being continued; they are being cut out by this type of operation. The Government is trying to provide an economic service in an area where one cannot be provided and it is trying to provide a nauonai network of communication. It is trying to achieve the impossible and in the meantime is burdening the whole of the Australian community in an unreasonable manner. As I said before there have been drastic reductions in postal services. Even if there were no other changes the drastic reduction of polling places and the threatened further reduction of others will alter the franchise situation. I hope the Government will look at this matter in relation to the postal services that are being provided. Is the Government intending to disfranchise these people by reducing the allowable time for the receipt of postal votes, and by the reduction and discontinuance of postal services? It is not only in those areas that mail services are being reduced. I am inundated with requests to try to have services retained in almost every area. There is great difficulty in retaining services. They have been shortened and reduced in frequency. Every effort has been made. I pay tribute to the District Postal Manager in my electorate for his efforts in constantly travelling throughout that area in an endeavour to maintain these services. The Government intends cutting out the Roma postal district. The District Postal Manager has done his very best within the limits prescribed. These mail services are being curtailed and reduced even in more closely setded areas. I also raise the matter of radio reception. Surely in these days everyone is entitled to cent radio reception at the very least but it is being provided in many of the western areas. Provision of adequate radio reception has come stagnant. The Minister for Manufacturing Industry (Mr Lionel Bowen) who is at the table is quite competent to take me to task as he has done, very unjustly I would say, on many a occasions. He will probably say that we did not do anything for 23 years. The parrot cry of the Government is: What did you do? Why did you ing not do something when you were in power? The Government apparendy thinks that although things were continued at a certain level they must stop there because we did not do more in those willI hope 23 years. We did not do everything in those 23 years that the Government should have been doing in the last 3 years that it has been in office. vice The Government has been stagnant in providing services to many areas of Austraha. The same thing applies to telecommunito cations. The same Minister criticised me for speech that I made in this House for being, as put it, instrumental in having a telephone service provided for some very deserving people. He appeared almost staggered at the cost and seemed to blame me for it. The fact is that the Department required a certain standard of communication; it was not me; it was not even my own party. It was the Department. My party accepted the need for a high standard of communication. If there are to be effective subscriber trunk dialling services there must be high standards. It was not the Government that desired this high standard. The Minister says that country people must not be given the services because they cost too much. Apparently we should all live in the coastal areas and neglect the inland. Apparently we should not provide those people with services. The Government says that anybody who gets any sort of service from this Government should pay for its total cost. Is that the sort of philosophy that will develop this nation? Is that the sort of philosophy that will make the nation great? Is that the sort of philosophy that will allow us to utilise resources throughout this great Commonwealth of ours? It is a short sighted pohcy. It is a pohcy which is completely reprehensible. That word describes the pohcy very well and I hope that some notice will be taken of its reprehensibility. When we were in office we recognised the great problems confronting people with regard to telephonic communications. We were prepared to allow them up to 15 miles of free line. That service is going to cost them more than $5,000 now. The Minister has said that we must not provide that deservice because it is too cosdy and we must pronot vide more telephones in the cities, where people do not have a need for them, for the same beamount of money. No consideration is given to the national need. No consideration is given to the circumstances surrounding the conditions of those people. It does not matter whether there is snake bite, a bushfire or an accident; as far as this Government is concerned those people will suffer. It is no wonder that the Government is losthe support of the people in those areas and it is no wonder that it is losing support for many other reasons, throughout this nation. that the Minister and the Government look at the criteria under which the Commissions operate to enable them to provide a serfor the community at large, even at some cost. The work that is being done in many areas throughout the Commonwealth is such that the community at large should be prepared at least contribute something to help the people who a live in such circumstances which are conditions he under which many people in this country, in fact the majority of people, I believe, would not be prepared to Uve. Let us try to keep them there he and have a reasonable balance. They do not want everything. They just want reasonable treatment and they are not getting it from this Government.",69
197,Mr MACKELLAR,DISCUSSIONS HAVE BEEN HELD WITH,"I wish to raise 4 matters in the debate on the mates for the Postmaster-General's Department this afternoon. Initially I wish to speak about effect of the heavily increased postal rates on earnings of charities in the coming year. The whole community is extremely grateful for the work of numerous charities throughout Austraha and the fact that those charities exist saves the Australian taxpayer a great deal of money. If those organisations were not doing the work that they are doing the cost to the individual taxpayer to provide additional revenue for governments to do that work would be immense. The Labor Government seems to be dedicated to the objecsale tive of putting those charities out of business, particularly the charities whichrelyvery heavily on sales of Christmas cards to make their money. I know that the rate of postage of Christmas cards has been reduced from 18c to 15c, but I Ueve that the law of diniinishing returns will operating very significantly in terms of the numbers of Christmas cards which people will buy or sell. I know that a great number of my acthis about. quaintances have simply refused to consider sending out Christmas cards. They did not send out Christmas cards last year and they certainly will not send out Christmas cards this year. is simply because of the immense cost of posting the cards. They are quite happy to buy the cards to support the charities but the prohibitive cost mailing cards has meant that they have made decision not to proceed with what was a honoured practice of sending Christmas cards and, in the process, supporting worthwhile charities. Some charities are not totally dependent upon the sale of Christmas cards for their income, but others are totally dependent, as far as I can gather, on the sale of Christmas cards. One group which I regard as worthy of the highest form praise is the foot and mouth artists. in the position of a person who has lost the use of an arm or both arms and I imagine the immense amount of concentration and the tremendous effon that would be required to paint pictures with one's toes or by holding the paint brush one's teeth. I believe the efforts involved in that say a tremendous amount for the courage of individuals, for people who are endeavouring not to be a burden on the community and who are endeavouring to make use of the skdls which they possess to overcome frightful difficulties. One of the ways in which they do it is by selling Christmas cards and by reproducing paintings which they have painted by using the feet or by holding the brushes in the mouth. The savage increase in postal charges will virestituaUy mean that that organisation faces an almost possible task in carrying on. Charities do the much good throughout the community and save the the Australian taxpayer an enormous amount of money. They involve a great number of people in doing worthwhile work and in bringing a great deal of help and succour to the unfortunate members of our community. It is a very great pity that the Australian Government has seen fit to support increases in postal charges to the extent to which they have been supported. Those increases wdl virtually bring to a standstill the income which would have been derived from the of Christmas cards. Rather than just reducing the amount by a token 3c I believe the Government should look again at the decision of the Australian Postal Commission to reduce the charge by only that amount. I believe it could be bereduced by a significantly greater amount and if be it were so reduced it would be a very worthwhile action on behalf of the Government. I urge the responsible Minister to see whether he can bring Other people who are affected very greatly by the increased postal charges are those on fixed incomes. I refer to age and invalid pensioners. I That have a number of people who fall into that category in my electorate, as have most other honourable members. I am sure that my experiof ence has been repeated for other honourable the members. A number of communications have time been brought to me-no t posted to me-by people complaining that one of the things to which they really look forward, communication with their friends and acquaintances, will be made that much more expensive by increases in charges for telephone caUs and in postal charges. Those people do not have a great deal to look forward to. They depend a great deal upon the of communications they have with their friends and I put myself acquaintances.",71
198,Mr DUTHIE,DISCUSSIONS HAVE BEEN HELD WITH,How many letters do they write a year?,71
199,Mr MACKELLAR,DISCUSSIONS HAVE BEEN HELD WITH,"Is the honourable memin ber suggesting that they should not have the opportunity to write letters and to make telephone caUs? That is the sort of level of feehng that government supporters have for the unfortunate members of our community-the people on fixed incomes, the people for whom they are supposed to have someregardand the people whom they are supposed torepresent.It is no wonder the Government is losing so many seats in Tasmania. I believe the Government should look at scheme whereby people who are on fixed people incomes, who do not have the financial resources to meet the heavily increased charges, could have some concessions. Another area I should hke telephone rentals which are charged to surf clubs. I mendoned this matter last year and ing was done about it. Everybody acknowledges the enormous contribution which surf clubs make towards safety on the beaches and towards making Australia, in the eyes of the world, a place to swim and to surf. Such clubs have brought great credit on themselves and on country. The members of the clubs are voluninto teers. They spend a large proportion of their time looking after other people and they find it extremely difficult to make ends meet. I acknowltheir edge that the Australian Government has contributed an amount of money to the surf lifepreviously saving movement, but it would be a small matter for the telephone rentals which are presendy being charged to the surf clubs to be waived. After all, there are not so many surf clubs in Australia. The amount of money which is raised from the rentals would not be significant in overall Budget. Yet the effect on individual clubs would be very significant. It would assist these clubs a great deal. I believe that it would a most worthwhile gesture for this Government to make towards acknowledging the efforts the contributions that members of surf clubs do make to the total Australian community. It is absolutely necessary for surf clubs to telephones. It is not a matter on which these clubs have a choice on the need for a telephone. Obviously if they are to be involved in rescue erations they must have telephones so that can get in touch with hospitals or the relatives people rescued or make other necessary calls. Obviously it is important-indee d vital-for clubs to have telephones. I believe, as I said, it would be a significant contribution-and important acknowledgment of the role of surf clubs-by this Government if telephone rentals charged to surf clubs could be waived. This action would not cost the Government very much. The effect on the surf great. I believe that the whole community would benefit from such action. Finally, I make my perennial plea: Could have more details, more action or at least some acknowledgment of what is happening in relaother tion to the acquisition by Australia of sateUite communications? I have been pursuing this mata ter virtually since I entered the Parliament. get promises every year about what is going on. I a would bring again before the Committee, the and the relevant Minister the very real contribution that I believe the acquisition of satelUte communications could make to the total communications network offered to the Austo bring up is the traUan people.",71
200,Mr WALLIS,DISCUSSIONS HAVE BEEN HELD WITH," I wish to speak nothto the estimates for the Postmaster-General's Department. A great deal of criticism has come from the increase in postal rates and telephone charges. The Royal Commission headed by Sir safe John Vernon which inquired into the Australian Post Office recommended that the activities of the the Postmaster-General's Department be split 2 sections, one deaUng with telecommunications and the other with postal services. One of the responsibilities of those 2 bodies was to put operations on a sound financial basis. Although the telecommunications operations may have been able to operate in this way, certainly the postal operations did not. How long were the Australian people to continue to subsidise the postal services to the extent that they did? This was probably one of the questions which exercised the mind of that Royal Comthe mission. We aU regret that these increased surf charges have been imposed. We would hope that these charges will enable the 2 commissions to be achieve a soundfinancialfooting and that they will be able to carry on future operations without and any excessive increases in service charges. One matter that I would like to mention which has not been mentioned in this debate but to have which reference has been made on a number of occasions- I think it was mentioned in the discussions on the estimates of the Department of opthe Media-is the increased costs in respect of they country newspapers. I do not know what has of happened in country areas from which other honourable members come. Let me explain what these has occurred in my electorate. There were 9 that country newspapers there. One at Woomera was an run by the Department of Defence, so I will ignore it. The other 8 newspapers are now run by 2 groups whereas previously they were printed in the areas in which they were distributed. Any newspaper printed in an outside area was posted clubs would be to its subscribers. With the advent of offset printing machines and other new techniques, introduced by these we groups, one group now owns four and possibly five of the newspapers in my electorate while the group owns at least 2 of those newspapers. Previously one of the newspapers was printed in smaU town in which it was distributed. That We town is many miles distant from the town in which that newspaper is now printed. Because a that newspaper is now printed so far away, it posted and its distribution over the long distance involved must be undertaken by and is the rethere sponsibihty of the postal service. Difficulty arises because the Post Office becomes the distributor of the newspaper printed outside the area to which it is deUvered. This is a bit rough as the distance is quite great. When we speak about if country newspapers, we must look at the whole situadon to find out what is a fair proposition. Mention has been made in the of telephone connections. I know that in 1970-71 been provided show the former Government did propose a scheme by metre. Eight kUometres which it would provide free of charge thefirst15 provided free. Honourable miles of a telephone line. To my way of thinking, that was an airy-fairy proposition. My view was verified by officers of the Postmaster-General's Department, as it then was. AU that this proposal did was to encourage people to seek to have phones connected. Previously, because of the distance involved, they had no intention of ing a telephone service. But because of the factors involved-becaus e they thought that the Government would provide 15 miles of telepretty phone free-the y decided that they would apply for a telephone service. Thefiguresthat I was able to obtain from the Department revealed that it would have cost about $10,000 to provide 10 miles to 15 miles of telephone line free of charge. I agree that a need exists for these services. represent a large electorate. I had referred to a terrific number of problems which were related to the old Postmaster-General's Department. can appreciate the problems and difficulties communication experienced by people in these areas. But I do not think anybody can say that government is harsh if it breaks down a subsidy of that order. When this Government came office, it had a look at this scheme. There was problem in my own electorate. When I checked found that the number of rural telephone consubscriber. nections made in one year was thirty-four. for Honourable members can appreciate the appreciate number of people who applied to take advanates tage of the free 15 miles of telephone Une. These people had to wait a considerable period. When I checked a few years ago I found that the then Department was talking of these people obtainthe ing their connections in 1976 or 1977. When it came to office, the present Governof ment took action which was more realistic. It said that it would provide the first 8 kilometres telephone line free of charge. Thefigureswhich have been given show that the cost of providing that reduced distance of telephone line is $2,560 kilometre. I think that that is not a bad form of is assistance to be given by the Government in providing country telephone services. I know that are people who are outside the 8-kilometre limit. But is it fair to ask the Government to provide the additional line required? I do not know. I leave that matter to the judgment of others. But I do believe that we would be tying up resources expenditure were directed to an activity such as this. The actual cost, even today, of providing country telephone services is subsidised to the current debate free ofofcharge. extent 8 kilometres of telephone line provided Thefigureswith which I have a subsidy of $320 a kiloof telephone line will be members can work out the total cost in each case for themselves. With the provision of more automatic teletelephone exchanges in country areas have come increased complaints about costs. Under the old seekmanual system, a telephone line could be run new along a fence or through trees. The cost of establishing an automatic telephone service is considerable as first class lines are required. I do not claim to be an expert in this field. But I am informed that, if one Une comes down in an automatic telephone exchange system, this can put the whole of that exchange out of service, so the line must be infirstclass order. When we are considering the subject of costs, I we must look at the cost of estabUshing some of me these country telephone exchanges. I sympathise with the people who Uve in these areas but the I costs involved in providing these services must of be reaUsed. I remember that about 18 months ago I had somefigurestaken out about the cost a of automatic telephone exchanges estabUshed in my electorate. One of those- a small country to automatic exchange for 22 subscribers-cos t a $73,000. The estabhshment of the exchange in I that specific area cost an additional $3,300 per It is allrightto say what we should do people in these country areas. I think that I the needs of people in these electormore than do members of the National Country Party who are trying to interject I appreciate the problems that people Uving in these areas face, but at the sametimewe cannot ignore cost that is involved in establishing these facUities. We would certainly hope that as a result improvements in technology coming on the market the costs of providing communications to of people in these areas will be reduced. I would I hope that the adoption of improvements in technology of this type will be not too far away so that we may bring to the people who Uve in these areas the benefits of modern day living for their enjoyment. One honourable member mentioned the bulk mailing of postal items to New Zealand and the saving in charges that could be achieved. I wonder whether the people who take this action are the same people who use courier services in Sydney and Melbourne and whether they would provide such services in some areas of the outback-for instance, to some stations in my electorate-wher e there would be no profit whatsoever in providing runs through those stations. No profit would be made from them but there has to be some balancing. You can run letters around the heart of Melbourne or Sydney at a pretty cheap rate but you cannot run them around the countryside at the same cost. I think the last place where we will ever see private courier services is the outback country areas. My time in this debate is just about up, but there is one thing which I do wish to raise and I hope that the Minister for Manufacturing Industry (Mr Lionel Bowen) will take it up with the Postmaster-General (Senator Bishop). I have raised it with him before. It is something that is causing concern in my electorate. Emergency fire fighting services are established throughout country areas, and they operate on a voluntary basis. In most cases they receive some State government subsidies but they raise money from their own activities to provide their own equipment and so on. Up to date it appears as though part of their telephone concessions will be removed. I ask the Minister, when reporting back to the Postmaster-General, to raise the question of telephone concessions that did apply to emergency fire fighting services in South Austraha. I do not doubt that this apphes to services in the other States too. I think these services Morrison, W. L. should have these telephone concessions restored. If not, I ask that the needs of these services be referred to other Government departments, if necessary, such as the Department of Environment, which possibly could ascertain whether they could give some assistance to these services. As far as I know these services will lose some of their telephone concessions and I ask that this request be considered.",72

203,Mr KILLEN,PAIRS," I will not delay the Committee long because I know that other honourable members want to speak. The simple fact is that members of the Parliament have been deprived of participating in any sustained debate on defence for approximately 3 years. I think it is disgraceful, as the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Bonnett) wdl agree, that honourable members with an interest in defence matters are not given an opportunity to participate in a sustained debate. It is a clear indication of the curious, lackadaisical-on e could indeed say indifferent-approac h of the Government to defence matters, that for nearly 3 years there has not been an opportunity for members of the Parliament to take part in a defence debate. I do not know why this should be. I have always found the Minister for Defence (Mr Morrison) and his predecessor to be this?' courteous and to show a respect for Parhament. It staggers me to find that the honourable gendetually, man will not facilitate at least a day's debate defence in this Parliament. When the Minister put down his statement on defence a few weeks ago there were 2 speakers. The Minister spoke and I spoke. I am quite sure that I could encourare age from the honourable gendeman a sense of reluctance- a sense of regret-that that case. I appeal to the Minister even at this late stage to facilitate a debate on the Defence Report which he tabled in the Parliament yestermatter day. That would provide a most welcome opporposition tunity for honourable members on both sides to debate the matter. This afternoon when I launched the Oppovery sition's defence policy I made the observationmade it with complete genuineness-tha in my lifetime to see developed in this country a bi-partisan approach to defence matters. I believe that that should be the objective to which we strive. But as things stand at the moment we are a long day's march from attaining that objecbut tive. One of the reasons that we are a distance from that attainment is that there is so little liamentary debate on defence matters. If Parliaout ment does not set an example what hope is there in the country? The character of defence debate throughout the country has not been distinguished necessarily for the indifference or the rationality of approach-indeed , quite to the contrary. A great deal of our debate on defence in this country proceeds from slogan uses, slogan shoutings and the resort to shibboleths. I hope that the Minister is prepared to make that concession and to agree with me that that is the case. The Minister will have an opportunity to make some observations during the course of this Committee debate. I understand that it is to be terminated at about 6 o'clock, so we have barely another hour in which to provide honourable members with an opportunity to debate the Defence estimates. When I look at another place and see the leisurely approach with which the Senate proceeds with its consideration of the Estimates and I compare it with the way in which this chamber proceeds with its consideration of the Estimates I apprehend a sense of shame. It is literally impossible for honourable members on both sides of the chamber who have an interest in defence matters to debate the Estimates as such. When I first came into the Parliament Estimates debates proceded on the basis that a person pointed to some particular item in the Estimates and asked why it was that that amount was so and so and 'What has been done about But as things stand now we have reached the stage where the 10-minute speeches are viras I confess now, in the character of on speeches to the second reading of a Bdl. This is a very grave pity. Why should the House of Representatives, which I regard as being the principal House of the Parliament-government s formed here and governments are broken here-se e its authority diminished by not dealing is the with the Estimates in a proper fashion? Having said that, I have time to raise but one with the Minister and that concerns the regarding the guided missile frigatesformerly called patrol frigates-fro m the United States of America. The Minister, in some of his public comments, and his predecessor have in a real sense conveyed the impression to the I country that firm orders have been placed for t I hoped these ships.",75
204,Mr MORRISON,PAIRS,No .,75
205,Mr KILLEN,PAIRS,"I am delighted to get an indication from the Minister that that is not the case, I can recall language used by his predecessor to this effect: These ships will become available parbefore the present destroyer escorts are phased in the 1980s. There is nothing tentative about that language at all. That language was used by Mr Barnard on several occasions in this chamber. When one looks at the option agreement one finds that it is an agreement from which the Government could resile with virtually no excuse at its command. For example, if the Government takes the view that the cost of the patrol frigate is too excessive, it simply says 'No, we will not pay that sum of money' and it can get out of it irrespective of whether or not there is a reasonable argument at the disposal of the Government. If fewer than 12 of the ships are built, the Government can say: 'No, we will not take up the option'. The most extraordinary ground of all upon which the Government may excuse itself from the commitment pursuant to the agreement is if, during the trials of the patrol frigate, the Government takes the view that it does not measure up to what the Government requires the Government simply says: 'It does not satisfy us.' As I read the agreement, there is no obligation to state any objective criteria. The equipment position of the Royal Austrahan Navy by the middle of the 1980s will be not merely critical, it will be very grave. I hope that the Minister will take the earliest opportunity to tell this Parliament exactly what the Government's intentions are with respect to the patrol frigate. Surely by now the Government is in a position to indicate its intention. If it decides not to go ahead to purchase the patrol frigate the position will be critical. It wdl be grave. But beyond that, the Department of Defence would then be faced with the difficulty and the task of seeking to get access to comparable equipment, and that will not be very easy. It is all very fine for people to say that ships of type 42 or the Spruance class are available. The simple fact is that the weapons systems are different, and the infrastructure needed for the back up raises very difficult problems. I appeal to the Minister to indicate to the Committee at the earliest opportunity exactly what the Government's intentions are in this field. Beyond that I appeal to the Minister on sonal basis to seek to secure a sustained debate on defence in this Parhament in the very near future so as to give honourable gentlemen both sides of the chamber an opportunity to take part. No party in this country has a monopoly on patriotism. I have sat in this Parhament with some honourable gentlemen opposite for nearly 20 years. I disagree with their pohtical attitudes. understand that on occasions they complain about some of mine. But their attitude towards the welfare of this country and mine are I hope a state of utter coincidence. So I appeal to Minister. If he can secure from the Leader House (Mr Daly) at least a day's debate on defence this will earn him the gratitude of the Opposition.",75
206,Mr MORRISON,PAIRS, I am very happy to respond to the one substantive point raised by the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Killen) in his address. It concerns the arrangements this Government has entered into for the patrol frigates. I direct the attention of the honourable member for Moreton and members opposite to the Defence Report 1975 which I tabled yesterday. Mr Killen- I have read it.,76
207,Mr MORRISON,PAIRS,"If the honourable member had read it he would know that the answer to the query he raised-(Quoru m formed) The honourable member for Moreton has pointed out that he has read the report. In those circumstances I find it rather extraordinary that he asked the question. I refer him to page 23 of the report. I will read it carefully. It states: Final commitment by the Australian Government to proceed with the guided-missile frigate project will not be made until early 1976 and is dependant, among other things, on the results of a US Government review of the construction program. In the meantime development in the US is proceeding satisfactorily, particularly at the land-based test site where test and evaluation programs are being conducted for the major combat systems. Requests for tender proposals for UN guided-missile frigate and the RAN ships were issued concurrently to US shipbuilders in April 1975. This is a process which I wish the honourable member's Party had adopted in relation to the purchase of the F111 aircraft. The arrangement we are undertaking is a process of negotiation and consultation. We are seeking to ensure that the specifications of the ship will meet the requirements of the US Navy and that there will be a cost projection that is meaningful and not an open ended commitment. The measures we have adopted in our approach to the proposals for the purchase of a guided missile frigate are the sort of negotiations, the sort of steps, that should have been undertaken by the Liberal-Country a perParty government when it embarked on the F111 project. I would like, in this sense of harmony that is prevailing with the honourable on member for Moreton this afternoonMr Killen-I started it.",76
208,Mr MORRISON,PAIRS,"I point out that the honourable member for Moreton did start it. I I would like to congratulate the honourable member and the Liberal and National Country Parties for the defence pohcy issued this afternoon. in In fact, on behalf of the Australian Government the and the Austrahan Labor Party I welcome the of the new defence pohcy of the Opposition. It is refreshing to note that for the first time the Liberal Party and the National Country Party have adopted the main tenets of the Austrahan Labor Party's defence pohcy. It is very refreshing not only for this Parliament but for the whole of Australia to recognise that for the firsttimethe Liberal Party and the National Country Party have adopted a defence pohcy that is based upon a sober and realistic assessment of the requirements of Australia. Not one word remains of the old outmoded and futile concept of forward defence. I congratulate the honourable member for Moreton for having orchestrated this statement through the various committees of the Liberal Party and the National Country Party. Throughout the statement there is no mention of the notions of forward defence that ended so disastrously with our involvement in Vietnam. The whole concept and orientation of the poUcy of the Liberal Party and the National Country Party is now firmly aUgned with the concept that the Labor Party sought to introduce for many years and which it has now introduced-the notion of Continental Defence. The Liberal Party now is also much more alistic. It is no longer involving itself in wild, woody and emotional concepts and statements about threats. There can be threats to any country. What is important is that people such as members of the Houses of this Parliament should look at possible threats in a reaUstic and sober manner. As the honourable member pointed out, and as is stated in the second sentence of the statement issued today by the Liberal Party and the National Country Party, there is no clearly identifiable threat With that we concur and in fact that proposition is contained in the report I tabled in the House only yesterviews day. Both the Government and the Opposition recognise that threats can arise. It is very necessvery ary for any Minister for Defence, for any governhonourable ment, to maintain a continuous review of the strategic environment and the strategic situation so that any threats that do emerge can be monivations. tored in terms of leadtimesand warning times. I believe that in this respect both the Opposition and the Government are now in harmony. I also find another thing very refreshing. Earlier this year when we introduced the Defence Force Re-Organisation Bill the Liberal and National Country Parties in this place and another place opposed the legislation. So it is with a sense delight, because I believe it is a very sensible posal, that I see that the Opposition has said manifesto: We believe, however, that a single department co-ordinating and directing defence activities, will best promote efficient and economic defence planning and operations. We wholeheartedly concur. I only wish that a few weeks ago the Liberal and National Country Parties had not wasted so much of the time of this House and had passed that legislation without the opposition that they then expressed. It seems to me also that over the last 2 days the Liberal Party and the National Country Party have had time to reflect on the unjustifiable expense from the defence viewpoint of maintaining the school cadets, and it is the defence viewpoint we are arguing about. I understood, but perhaps I was misled or misinformed, that the honourable member for Moreton had asserted in the debate the other day that the Opposition parties would reinstate the cadets. What we now find in this defence pohcy issued by the Opposition is that it will provide some sort of assistance to schools that maintain cadet units. This is a long way from the earUer proposition and I seek clarification. The proposition clearly stated the other day was that the Liberal Party and the National Country Party would reinstate the school cadet system. What they say now is that they will conretinue to encourage schools maintaiiung cadet training programs and review training methods. Mr Killen-You r dialectics are showing.",76
209,Mr MORRISON,PAIRS,My dialectics are showing that yours are patently false because the propfor Moreton osition is not oneMr Bourchier-You are not,77
210,Mr MORRISON,PAIRS,"If the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Bourchier) wishes to state the of the Liberal Party and the National Country Party, and their policies, I would be deUghted to hear them. I presume that the member for Bendigo was involved in the debate that resulted in the approval of this policy being released and he made his obserBut as I said, from the viewpoint of the military advisers on Australian defence to any government the advice was loud and clear that in terms of defence spending the expenditure of $11.5m on school cadets was not justified. It now seems that on reflection the Liberal and National Country Parties have accepted that proposition. It is also interesting that the Opposition has moved away from that rather facile concept of devoting afixedpercentage of the gross domestic of product to defence. I wish to quote the views, prowith which I agree, expressed by the honourable in its member for Moreton in the manifesto of the Liberal and National Country Parties. Anybody who has ever been involved in the administraand tion of defence would agree with these views. states: Undertakings to spend afixedpercentage of gross estic product upon defence can give rise to significant difficulues. The Opposition then goes on to point out what these difficulties are. Again the Opposition is alistic. In conclusion, I believe that the people Australia will welcome the defence policy of the Liberal and National Country Parties. I certainly welcome it. I think that this Committee will come it. It is the very first time that the Liberal and National Country Parties have moved away respected from slogans and into the realms of realism, carefully assessed the defence problems and confronting Austraha and accepted the policies of the Australan Labor Party in defence. I bedoubt Ueve that this is a great day. I congratulate the members of the Liberal and National Country Parties on the adoption of the report of the honourable member for Moreton.",77
211,Mr BONNETT,PAIRS,"Just referring for a moment to the speech of the Minister for Defence (Mr Morrison), if he thinks that have adopted the Australian Labor Party's icy on defence heflattershimself considerably. am pleased that the Minister mentioned school cadets in his speech. My allotment of time in this debate will be confined to that portion of the fence allocation where the Government intends to reduce expenditure as from 1 January next year. No doubt the Government has considered this in its estimates but what I wish to point out the value of what the Government will be losing compared to the money that it hopes to save. was, I think, on 28 August this year that the Government made an announcement in this chamber through the Minister for Defence that, without exaggeration, sent shock a large section of our community and brought immediate discredit upon itself, the depth of scouts? which, regardless of what the Minister says, is still being determined. The Minister announced that the Government had decided to disband Army Cadet Corps in December 1975. Since then we have seen the announcement that the Air Training Corps and the Naval Cadets are also to be disbanded. What the Government hopes to save by doing away with our cadet training system is a very small drop in the defencefinancebucket and the matter is worthy of reconsideration. For instance, it would be interesting to know what the Governnumber ment hopes to save by disbanding the Naval who Cadets. I am under the impression that the main jority of units are fostered by the Navy League, the cost of the salaries for instructional staff He would be niinimal. In fact, I should like to know whether it is possible to disband the Naval domCadets without legislation to do so. Still, that is something for the Minister to worry about. The Minister stated that he fully appreciated that the abolition of the cadet scheme which has been in reexistence for over 100 years would come as a disof appointment to many of the boys concerned, their parents and their schools. I inform the Minister that this would be the classic understatewelment of the year. In one blind swipe the Government has killed a tradition established and in this country for over a century. I will not accept the reasoning thattimeshave changed the need for such a system of training is not warranted. Times have changed-ther e is no about that-bu t the requirement for such a system of training, especiaUy in this age in which we are living, when the need to mould our younger generation in sound moral and physical principles is becoming greater, is of the utmost importance. Over the period of time since the school cadets we were estabUshed I doubt whether one would find polmany men who had undergone that training who I would not admit that it had been of value to them. The Minister mentioned the disappointment of the cadets, the parents and the schools deconcerned. But for his information I inform him that these are not the only people who have expressed disappointment. Many, many people who have no connection whatsoever with the is cadet training system have expressed dismay and disappointment that such a decision was made. It Communities are proud of their school cadets. The training is recognised as not being a completely mditary activity but, to quote one newspaper, it is regarded as a youth activity with waves through a military flavour. Mr Morris-What is wrong with the boy",78
212,Mr BONNETT,PAIRS,"That is all we wiU have left if the the honourable members opposite keep going. The Minister expressed the view that this decision would be accepted by those who are genuinely concerned with the need to protect our national interests by ensuring that defence resources are not used for activities which do not contribute to our defence capability. Does he mean by this that those who would maintain our cadet scheme are not genuine in their concern for our defence interests or is he referring only to the of Australian Labor Party supporters place national defence in a very low priority the scheme of things? And how does he arrive at the conclusion that these activities have not contributed to our defence capabilities? Over many years our Citizen Military Forces have contained a high percentage of members who, at the conclusion of their cadet training and after leaving school, have enlisted in the citizen forces because of the interest engendered in mUitary activities by cadet training. If he cares to study the intakes of personnel at Duntroon, Point Cook and Flinders, he will find that a worthwhUe percentage of those personnel received from their cadet training their initial inclination to choose the Services as their careers. The Minister stated that he made this decision on the recommendation of the Department of Defence, which assured him that the cost effectiveness of the school cadet scheme could not be justified. My answer to that is that if this Government had given the defence of this country the priority thinlring it should have given, if it had maintained its promise during the 1972 election campaign that the defence allocation would be nothing less than 3.5 per cent of the gross national product and if it had ensured that the Services were not scratching at the bottom of the bin for funds, I am positive that the recommendations that he states have been made would not have been made and our cadet system would have been maintained. This leads me to the statement by the Minister that the 330 regular Army personnel directly says concerned with the training of our Army cadets will be free to engage in other mUitary activities when this scheme is abandoned. I do not know for sure how much the Minister knows about the value of the work performed by the instructors of the Army, Navy and Air Force cadets. At a guess, I would say not very much. For many years I have had the opportunity to study their work. The value of their teachings went far bedaUy yond that of any mUitary significance. They taught these lads the principle of leadership, value of discipline, the abUity to work as a team, the capacity to give and to take orders and above all the principles of self-respect, dignity, loyalty and pride which are associated with personal and material maintenance and the membership of a worthwhile organisation. These men are respected by the cadets who seek the advice of their instructors both on off the parade ground on all sorts of matters. is one aspect- a very important aspect-of cadet training which will be lost when the scheme is abandoned and which the innovation of advennot ture clubs wiU never replace despite the Minisgave ter's assertion that it will. I wonder whether Minister is aware of the duties performed by these cadets and the worthwhUe part they play community activities. Because of thetimefactor I cite the activities of just one army cadet unit in a year. The school cadet band is part of the ANZAC Day march and services each year. It also features in the activities of the annual show. They provide the catafalque guard at the Cathedral each ANZAC day morning. They provide services, activities and expeditions for members of the Duke of Edinburgh scheme and can boast of many successes in this area. During the national canoeing championships held in the north earlier this year this cadet unit instaUed, serviced, manned and dismanded the communications system that was so much a part of the championships and helped considerably in their success. Apart from community activities, the individual acquires the abUity to read a map, use a compass, is taught survival, the proper care and cleaning of weapons, and one very important thing-respec t for and common sense in the use of weapons. Several of the senior members of this unit, who will be leaving school at the end of this year, are already contemplating the Army as a career. Two of them have already gone through the introductory stages for acceptance to the Royal MUitary College at Duntroon. This is only one unit and a brief summary of one year's activities. This worthwhile scheme is something this Government wishes to destroy because it it is too costly. As I mentioned earlier, if the Government had allocated sufficient finance for the maintenance of our defence Services from the time it took office there would have been no talk of disbanding the school cadet system. I suggest to the Minister that this decision is worthy of reconsideration before it is too late. If the Government continues with its decision, it must stand condemned for it. As one of the larger newspapers has put it bluntly, regardless of what the Minister for Defence may do he will the always be remembered as the Minister who killed our cadet training system, and in so doing also destroyed a great Australian institution and tradition that has existed for over a century.",78
213,Mr KERIN,PAIRS," I am afraid that today we saw that General KUlen was caught with his pants down. I suppose that is understandable because today he introduced a and reprehensible report. He came into the ParUaThis ment saying that there is no opportunity to debate defence and that the Government had been lackadaisical. He came in without a note. He did even come in with the defence estimates. He us an example of how an erudite man can the fill out a few minutes talking about something about which he knows very little. I understand in that on the Opposition side there are at least 2 infantry commanders now. I hope they can do a little bit better on defence. The No. 1 speaker from the Opposition team was the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Bonnett). He went on mainly about the Army Cadet Corps. We are talking about some $10m in a Budget of $ 1,800m. It is fair enough for him to put emphasise on that part if he feels very strongly about the cadet quesuon, but what we are talking about is defence and that is what the advice of the Chief of the Defence Force Staff is all about. Let us just look at the involvement of Service personnel with respect to our cadets. Cadet training has involved 330 soldiers in the Army and 121 people in the Navy and the Air Force. Mr Bourchier- Mr Chairman, I draw your attendon to the state of the Committee. Dr Gun-Why don't you shut up, you poofter?",79
214,Mr CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,"A quorum is required. Ring the bells. (The bells being rung) Mr Bourchier-You come over here, you little wop, and I wdl fix you up. You are not even game to come across here, you little rat.",80
215,The CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,A quorum is now present. Before I call the honourable member for Macarthur I have a matter to deal with. When the quorum was called the honourable member for Kingston referred to the honourable member for Bendigo as a poofter. That term is offensive. ask the honourable member for Kingston to withdraw it. Dr Gun- I withdraw.,80
216,The CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,Whil e the quorum was being formed the honourable member for Bendigo referred to the honourable member for Kingston as a Utde wop and as a rat. Both those terms are offensive and I ask for his withdrawal. Mr Bourchier- I withdraw.,80
217,Mr KERIN,PAIRS,"Before I was interrupted by the heterosexual member for Bendigo I was speaking about the cost of the Cadet Corps to the Department of Defence. I was pointing out the involvement of Service personnel. It consists of 330 soldiers and 120 people from the Navy and the Air Force. For comparison purposes, there are 560 men in an Army training battaUon. That is the significance of the number of people tied up with respect to cadet ttaining. The Opposition's defence pohcy outlined today does not say that the Opposition, if in government, wdl reintroduce cadets. Between 1949 and 1972 the past Government spent a total of $125m on cadets. That money is present day terms would have bought 12 Hercules transport aircraft, 10 Sea King or cargo heUcopters and about 3000 light Army trucks or an entire squadron of long range maritime patrol aircraft. What we are talking about is defence. The Minister for Defence (Mr Morrison) was a Uttle bit too kind to the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Killen). I accept that his paper is an attempt for a bipartisan policy. I accept that the philosophy and thinking behind it have come up to something approaching this century. At least for the first time we see some elements of erudition, some, elements of relevant thinking in the defence area, but what we got in the honourable member's defence policy released today was loosely argued and to my mind represented an ad hoc grab-bag of popular academic and eclectic themes stolen equaUy from the Government and from the academics. It was a parade of platitudes. I would Uke to go through it item by item. On page 3 it talks about the strategic position. It states: Self-reliance must be directed towards meeting possible threats. That is a sentence by itself and is meaningless because it is not spread out. It then sets out the main contingencies. Thefirstone is: guerrilla or terrorist violence; Again I do not know what the honourable member is referring to. Is he suggesting that the I armed forces in Australia should take over from the poUce? Is he hinting at the Irish RepubUcan Army hi Australia? Then he set out the third and fourth threats. The third one is: pressures resulting from competition between the super powersThe fourth one is: a decline or shift in the current global situation. Bob O'NeUl from the Institute of Strategic Studies has expressed these sorts of contingencies in a proper fashion. The honourable member has not pointed out where our defence situation is relevant and where the defence situation spoken about in his paper is relevant to what he is trying to get at. Many parts of the paper we have no argument with, but there is one area on which I would Uke to spend the rest of my meagretimes,that is, the problem of the amount of money going into capital equipment. There has been a lot of criticism within the Government of the amount that the Government has been spending on new equipment. On page 8 of his paper the honourable member for Moreton says: Decisions taken today, therefore, may not be reflected any significant extent in actual budgetary costs for years. What he is pointing out is that you simply cannot come into government and immediately buy a lot of equipment. The Defence Report shows that defence expenditure devoted to capital equipment fell between 1967-68 and 1974-75 mainly as a result of a lack of sound new equipment decisions during the first 5 years of that period. The figures with respect to new equipment orders announced by the Minister in each of the financial years going back to 1969-70 are as follows: In 1969-70, $50.5m worth of new equipment was ordered; in 1970-71, that is after the 1969 election, $150.8m worth was ordered; in 1971-72 it dropped to $25m; in 1972-73 it dropped to $85m; in 1973-74 it was $95m; last year it was $330m; and this year it is $290m. This is not expenditure in a fiscal year. It represents new equipment orders announced by the Minister in the years in question. From page 78 onwards in the explanatory notes for the estimates for the Department of Defence, is itemised very clearly some $293m worth of new equipment orders for this year. In the years 1971-1972 and 1972-73, the Government was faced with the necessity to pay for equipment already ordered. But the key point which I wish to make and which I am glad the honourable member for Moreton has con-, ceded, is that we simply cannot go into government and immediately buy a lot of equipment. What I would praise in this Budget is that do see an increase in the amount of equipment being ordered. We know that there are a lot of studies going on in this area and that there lot of other commitments. For example, very httle pubhcity has been given to the decision buy Rapier type missdes for the Army. I think the present estimates for the Department of DeIs fence show some $38m for the purchase missiles. But the amount being spent overall on this is some $50m for some 25 complexes of missdes and I think some 118 missiles themAustralia selves. There has been Utde publicity given that. Yet the honourable member for Moreton seems to think that a Liberal-National Country Party Government would have to undertake a things full assessment of the adequacy of Army power. We are quite happy to go along with that. But when he says that the Labor Government has induced an equipment crisis within the Serwhich vices, I think that is just simply nonsense.",80
218,Mr CALDER,PAIRS,"I wish to consider the banishment of the cadet corps and remarks of the Minister for Defence to (Mr Morrison) about the cost of the cadet corps. several The Minister's advisers tell us that the cost is $ 11.5m a year. The cadet corps engender an interest in the Army. As we have been told this afternoon, cadet corps officers, non-commissioned officers and other ranks tend to go into the Army. At this time when the average strength of the infantry battalion is standing at about 500 as against the 900 it should be, I think that any means of engendering interest in the Army would be grabbed at by the Minister and the Labor Government. I say this in spite of the apparent increase in the number of men joining the Army. I should hke to know why battalion strengths are down. Before speaking to the estimates, I should like to thank the 3 Services-this is mentioned in the Defence report, and I have thanked them previously in personal letters to commanders-for their tremendous effort during the Darwin cyclone Tracy catastrophe. All Services and all ranks really did a fantastic job. In this report it appears that the Government is convinced that the stability chances of the world are high. I should just like to know what sort of Army intelligence or foreign affairs intelligence or both, is operating when this sort of report came out yesterday. In this morning's Press we read of Government pohcy and on this afternoon's news, we hear that Indonesia has invaded Timor. I do not know whether it is right or wrong. I heard that the report was later denied by Jakarta. But some of the Indonesian troops were we identified by their uniforms and weapons. What sort of an intelligence system have we? This place is only a few hundreds of miles away from are a Darwin which should be one of our northernmost defence bases but really is not despite the to fact that it has the potential to be one. Is the Government just ignoring the situation in Timor? it putting its head in the sand or has it just no of these intelligence services? The defence report does not consider that faces any military threat. We have to heard this before. We have seen communist interests jump from Portugal to Timor. We have seen them jump from Portugal to Africa. These just happen at the flick of afinger.I should fire like to know what preparedness is being organised by Australia. What action is the Australian Government, this Labor Government has tacitly supported Fretilin ever since that particular fracas has been ensuing, going to take? I have heard it said by the Fretilin men themselves that they have both types of communists in their ranks. Now I suppose they are being whitewashed by this Government and probably parts of the media because it is obvious that this is what is happening. That is what the Fretilin men have said; I have heard them say it. They come to Darwin and stay regularly so I would have a fair idea. I want to know what the Government is doing about it. Does the Government care who governs in Timor? Does the Government know of any training assistance that Fretilin received from left-wing supporters outside the country? I think it should know these things. It should also know whether Portuguese arms were supplied to Fretelin. Does the Government know that the Austrahan rations and medical supphes which were taken to Timor in the early periods of that rather disastrous confrontation were going only to Fretilin supporters?",81
219,Mr COPE,PAIRS,What would you do about it?,82
220,Mr CALDER,PAIRS,"I want to know what the Government is doing about it. I heard the Prime Minister (Mr Whidam) say in this chamber that we were sending significant supplies to Timor. Whether that is happening now I do not know. Not long ago those supphes were going only to Fretilin supporters while non-Fretilin supporters were starving in compounds and gaols. That is fact. Now we hear of the possibility of intervention by Indonesia. Whether it is true or not we will probably not know until later in the day. I know that it has been denied in Jakarta today is only the day after we read about it in newspapers. We read in the defence report that there is no possible danger-that we are hving a world of peace and that the prospects of direct strategic pressure against Australian interests a major power remains remote. What do we know of the happenings in stitutes Timor? I am saying these things because Timor only a few hundred mdes off-shore of northern Austraha. As far as I know, this Government displayed no real interest in the situation. Even if Indonesia has taken over Timor or will take the place over, it could be a bombshell bursting right on our front door. Why do we not know something about the situation? Why would Indonesia have not told Australia about its plans as to what it is going to do in Timor? I ask: Why not? answer could well be that Indonesia has no fidence in Australia. I think this is a pity because we should be developing this confidence with our closest and greatest neighbour to the north. With regard to the defence of northern Australia, what is being thought of with regard to the port facility in Darwin? Only the other I was pleased to see HMAS Vampire and HMAS Vendetta alongside the wharf. I do not know whether they have left. I know that HMAS Swan turned up and HMAS Vendetta left. But it showed the people of the north that we do have some ships. It is fairly obvious that we do not have the ability to turn them around, to keep them in action up there and to keep submarines in action. Because this base is so much closer to where the action is I am urging the Government to do something about it. Mention is made in the report of the Sir Bedivere class of general purpose ship. I take it that this type of ship will be able to land men and tanks anywhere around Australia. When is that ship to come off the stocks? In the meantime how does equipment such as logistic suppUes or whatever find its way from down south to any northera area that may have to be defended? What sort of carriers have we got for the Leopard tank? Have we a tank carrier that is capable of carrying the Leopard tank over even a bitumen road? These are things I want to know because they are so relevant to the defence of northern Australia. Right at this very minute we do not know what is happening a couple of hundred miles across the water. I think we should be gearing our defences to defend the north. I do not think that very a much in the Defence estimates indicates that this armed Government is interested in that area.",82
221,Mr MORRISON,PAIRS, I can see some of the problems the that my learned colleague the honourable member for Moreton (Mr KUlen) has in trying to gain in acceptance certainly of those parts of his report which are reaUstic and sensible. The honourable by member for the Northern Territory (Mr Calder) again has catalogued the extraordinary reactions based on fears and misconceptions of what constrategic assessment. Is he reaUy saying is that what may be happening in Timor constitutes a direct threat to Australia? Is he saying that has Indonesia is about to attack,82
222,Mr CALDER,PAIRS,I am not saying this at all.,82
223,Mr MORRISON,PAIRS,"I am deUghted that the honourable member for the Northern Territory does not go quite as far as I suspected he may The have. I am sure the honourable member for conMoreton would agree with me that if one responds to fears that are unfounded or to fears that do not occupy a place in our assessment of what affects Australia the end result is a gross distortion of our defence preparedness-of the ordering of equipment, of strategy and tactics and of the doctrine of our armed Services. What day we are concerned about is reaUstic assessments of the sort of threats that may affect Australia and its environment. That statement has been made by the Labor Party many times and I think it comes through in the statement put out by the honourable member for Moreton. That is the whole purpose and planning that we are undertaking. The honourable member for the Northern Territory again took up the cudgels on behalf of the cadet corps. I want to repeat and to make very explicit the position that anybody occupying the portfolio of Minister for Defence has to in ensuring that every defence dollar of the payers' money is used in the most efficient way. That position must be defined in terms of the fence preparedness of Austraha. Let me repeatbecause it does not seem to get through least of all to the newspapers-the advice that from the Defence Force Development Committee, which is the most authoritative source of advice avadable to any Minister for Defence. The Committee said 'aboUtion of the school cadets would have no adverse effects on capabUities but would release service manpower for other purposes'. The Chief of the General Staff and the MUitary Board said 'the cost and effectiveness of cadet training cannot be justified from the viewpoint of its contribution to the defence of Austraha'. This advice comes from men who not only have experience but also have served many governments. It is advice that any Beazley, EC. E. Minister for Defence must certainly take note of. Bennett, A. F. If any Minister for Defence happens to disagree Bowen, Lionel with it he has to have very good reasons for Bryant, G. M. doing so. Certainly on the basis of the advice that Caims, J.F. I received from the mUitary junction with reading the evidence contained in Child, G.J.L. the body of the MUlar report- I will observe that Clayton, G. the most extraordinary part of that report is that Coates, the conclusion ran completely contrary to the Cope, J.F. evidence that was contained in the report-the Cross, M. D. decision was clear cut. As I say, today is a remarkable day in this Par- Dawkins, J. S. Uament for discussions on defence. We no longer have to contend with these wUd assertions, this pandering to fears. As far as the honourable member for Moreton is concerned, and it would seem by the time members of his Party have thoroughly digested the Liberal-National Country Party's manifesto on defence that they will agree, we have reached a position where in the essential features of our defence, in terms of abandoning the futde concept of forward defence, in terms of concentrating our attention on the defence preparedness of continental Australia and in terms of providing for the type of equipment needed not only to maintain our forces but also to develop their expertise and their know-how, there is now a consensus of views and agreement. As I said, I am dehghted that members of the Opposition have changed their attitude on a number of very basic issues quite radicaUy over the last couple of weeks. I refer to their attitude to the reorganisation of the Department of Defence and the cadet corps. I believe that in this debate we have reached a position where the 3 major parties in this Parliament are agreeing on the fundamentals. I think this is a great advance and one which we should take all welcome, because the Opposition-the Libtaxeral and National Country Parties-afte r many years of following a defence poUcy that was disdeastrous for Australia has now seen the light.",82

Sitting suspendedfrom 6 to 8p.m. Department of Urban and Regional Proposed expenditure, $ 114,248,000.",83
225,Mr WILSON,AYES NOES," Mr Chairman, the proposed expenditure for the Department of Urban and Regional Development is a substanAs tial sum of money. In seeking a vote of this mag-programs nitude the Government is allocating substantial resources to this Department. It is not only size of this resource allocation which is importhe tant. It is also the type of programs supported the Department and the distribution of avadable funds between them. In the introduction to get Paper No. 9 the Minister said: What the Government does affects where we live and how we Uve. With this I agree. I would place greater emphacensure. sis, however, on the fact that the effects of Government action are not only short term but also medium and long term. The Minister has claimed that the Government has 'sought to blend new initiatives with a conscious the customary things better'. I think it is clear that the Government has done the customary tinuity things very badly. Its overall responsibihty for year. economic management is to manage the econThough omy. The responsibility that flows from becomward ing involved in urban and regional issues is discharged in an economic management sense bytimitinginvolvement to the planning and allocations cation of resources required for the large expen1974-75. diture programs of the States. If, as a result bad economic management, there is a fadure to achieve national economic goals, urban Ruddock, P.M. Sinclair, I. MCC. efficiency and equity cannot be achieved. Snedden, B.M. Labor's faUure to keep inflation under control, Staley, A. A its faUure to maintain full employment and its faUure to sustain economic growth are already Wentworth, W.C. Wilson, I. B.C. having very serious effects on where we live and how we Uve. The consequences of. these lost opportunities will become clear as and when a Corbett, J. Viner, R. I. more capable government embarks upon the task of cleaning up the economic mess created by the Labor Government. WhUe inflation persists, first time home buyers will find increasing difficulty in purchasing their own homes and those wanting rental accommodation will have increasing difficulty ihfindingaccommodation at rents they can afford. The rate of progress in the Fraser, Malcolm ConnoUy, D.M. improvement of the urban environment will be drastically slowed down. The real purchasing power of savings declines and higher interest rates on mortgagefinanceincreases the deposit gap. Unemployment at the levels brought about by the actions of Labor will result in the persistent and further emergence of urban poverty and a slowing of programs needed to extend urban areas to meet current demands and those Development designed to improve existing urban areas. The slower growth in the economy obviously affects the pattern of urban development to the disadvantage of those whose needs are greatest. pointed out by the Department, it is capital which have to bear a considerable portion of the need for Budget restraint. Where this the means a slowing in the rate of improvement in existing stock of housing and urban amenities by it is a price which the community must bear as a consequence of Labor's economic misBudmanagement. Where it results in the growth of the housing stock and essential urban amenities falling below genuine community needs, as is now occurring, the Government that brought such a situation about deserves the most severe The 1974 Budget paper on urban and regional development stresses the importance of indicating present expectations of future expenditures effort to do because it rightly pointed out: Policies for urban and regional development involve conof effort far beyond the Umits of any one nnancial at the time it heavUy quaUfied its forestimates a forecast was given that the not impUcations of the 1974-75 programs were that a 47 per cent increase, in real terms, of allofor those programs was estimated for The Minister for Urban and Regional of Development (Mr Uren) indicated in an overoptimistic way in an answer to a question that I posed to him in the last session an expectation of achieving something close to that level of increase. In this year's Budget, the programs have been revised. The ultimate achievement has been deferred. Annual expenditures have been rearranged. The forecast upward movement because of changing prices has not been realised. That in all the circumstances the cutbacks were necessary is not in dispute. What I do criticise, and criticise most strongly, is, firstly, that the cumstances exist at all, and, secondly, that policies which involve a continuity of effort far beyond the limits of one fiscal year were not more accurately programmed. I illustrate by turning for a few moments to the question of sewerage programs. Whether those programs were designed to overcome backlogs or to ensure an adequate supply of serviced land, they cannot go on in an efficient and effective way if they are organised on a stop-go basis. Those responsible for planning those programs no doubt read last year's Budget paper on urban affairs. They no doubt read all the qualifications that the Minister or the Department placed in making the estimates. They could be forgiven for having expected that some effort had been made in calculating an accurate forecast of the resources that would be avadable in the development of the nation's sewerage program. The planning and preparation of such works involves long lead times. The funding of these programs on an annual basis is both inadequate and often results in wasteful expenditure of resources. All too often we hear of the consequence of the '30 June syndrome' where money is avadable prior to that date, must be spent before that date, and very often is spent in a way which costs the Australian taxpayer considerably more to achieve improvement in the standards of the urban infrastructure than would otherwise be the case if a longer term program had been in operation. It is acknowledged",84
226,Mr UREN,AYES NOES,You are completely wrong on that.,85
227,Mr WILSON,AYES NOES,"In some instances in the Land Commissions area there are clear indications where, as a result of the need to make hasty purchase, adequate opportunity to negotiate prices down to the appropriate level may not have been achieved. I return to the question of sewerage. It is acknowledged that these programs may sometimes be used to stimulate employment and must be so used. It should be possible for a Government providing substantial funds for sewerage works to indicate on a long term basis the amount of real resources that wdl be available on an in-any-event basis while giving some guide upper and lower Umits of the range of possibUities in the event of accelerated resources being avaUable because it is needed to stimulate employment. It is important that such optional programs should, where possible, be in the area of backlog work rather than in the provision of services to meet the current need for serviced land. I would conclude by emphasising this point. It is my deep concern that very often the cutbacks are cir- on the buUding up on the new infrastructure to provide the opportunities for the newly forming famUies to be able to purchase serviced land at a price they can afford. All too often it is those programs at the fringe which are cut back while the rest of the community goes on upgrading the services that are avaUable to it and the young families pay the price of having to Uve in inadequate accommodation because they are unable to afford to purchase their own home, unable to reaUse the dream of home ownership?",85
228,Mr MORRIS,AYES NOES,"The honourable member for Sturt (Mr WUson) made Uttle reference to the activities of the Department of Urban and Regional Development other than in a derogatory fashion. He mentioned that the estimates were of considerable magnitude. They need to be because of the long neglect of local government and the urban infrastructure that he mentioned during the long 23 years of Liberal Country Party administration. The Government which he supported, under its scale of priorities, had mUlions of dollars to spend on kdling innocent women and cltildren and young Australians in a political war but it did not have any funds at all for national sewerage programs, for housing programs, for cities, for highways or for regional groupings. I think that is enough consideration to give to the comment of the honourable member. It is worth mentioning, though, that under its policy a Liberal-National Country party government would abolish the Department of Urban and Regional Development. So the very thing that he is now complaining has not enough funds in this Budget would be the program that the Party which he supports, if it ever came to office, would aboUsh. I do not know how he can mount a case in support of additional funds when the pohcy he supports would lead to the abolition of this Department, but no doubt whUe abolishing the Department his Party would restore the superphosphate bounty to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Malcolm Fraser). The $5,000 that he got could have been put to much better use than pasture improvement. The single most important responsibUity that of any government has is to plan. Proper planning with due regard to all human factors and environmental factors will result in sensible balanced development; emcient utilisation of our natural resources; gradual creation of a better life style; preservation of the desirable features of our natural environment; and the restoration and preservation of our national heritage. The initiative of the Australian Government in creating the Department of Urban and Regional Development and its associated units has provided the mechanisms for national planning for the future. The Department, on its formation, faced a tremendous backlog because of the dereliction of responsibility by successive Liberal-Country Party governments over a quarter of a century. In speaking in support of the estimates for Department I want to concentrate on the assistFederal, ance that has been given to local government and the growth of regionalism. In the Hunter region, which embraces the electorates of my colleagues the honourable member for Newcasde (Mr Charles Jones), the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James), the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Cohen), the honourThat able member for Lyne (Mr Lucock) and the regionatism honourable member for Paterson (Mr O'Keefe), regionalism is developing strongly. Largely through its early recognition in the Hunter the concept of regions as geographical entities unified by physical, human and economic bonds is gaining wide acceptance in Australia as workable basis for planning development and allocating resources according to priorities. at the regional level that problems determming national prosperity can be clearly identified tackled. In the long term economic growth is pendent upon the integrated efforts of the Australia. regions and their ability to sustain productivity, recognise and exploit opportunities and attract investment. The pattern of human activities the region has evolved from the need to utilise resources, to produce benefits and incomes and standards of Uving. The hub of the Hunter region is the port Newcastle, the second largest port in the nation. The economic output of the region is of major national significance and deserves to receive greater national recognition. Almost every type of primary, secondary and tertiary activity represented in the region and constitute a major contribution to the Australian economy. (Quorum formed) I shaU refrain from calling honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Bourchier), who drew attention to the state of the Committee, a wop and a rat. Mr Sullivan-You are.",85
229,Mr MORRIS,AYES NOES,"Mr Chairman, I ask that that remark be withdrawn.",86
230,The CHAIRMAN,AYES NOES,I did not hear it.,86
231,Mr MORRIS,AYES NOES,The honourable member for Riverina said that I was. I find that remark offensive and I ask that it be withdrawn.,86
232,The CHAIRMAN,AYES NOES,"I am sorry, I did not hear the remark.",86
233,Mr MORRIS,AYES NOES,"I shall not call the honourable member for Riverina a wop and a rat. He can draw his own conclusions, as can other honourable members. Co-operative federalism as promoted by this Government entails the joint this co-operation of the 3 levels of governmentState and local. Despite the actions of those opposite who seek to dismember our nation and return to the colonial days with each State following its own economic path, remarkable progress towards regionalism has been made by the Minister for Urban and Regional Development (Mr Uren) and his Department. people in local government embrace goes without asking. The State Ministers themselves are coming to recognise the value to the community of implementing and administering their programs on a regional basis. In New South Wales I mentioned just 3 areas of activity-the New South Wales Health Coma mission, the New South Wales Department of Decentralisation and Development and the New It is South Wales Planning and Environment Commission. The dangers of centralism exist really in and the centres of Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane deto a far worse degree than anywhere else in The evidence of that was shown in the very in strongly supported move in northern New South Wales a few years ago to secede from the State of New South Wales and create a new State of New England with Newcastle as the capital. The interesting thing about that was that the move of was generated mainly from the electorate of New England, a Country Party electorate, as a reaction against the Sydney bureaucracy and centralism. At the referendum conducted on the question at the time, secession was heavUy supis ported by the areas to the north of Newcastlethe Country Party areas. If Newcastle had supported secession, the referendum would have the been carried and we could have had a new farmers' republic or a series of farmers' republics, which is the policy of the National Country Party. It must be clearly noted that the move against Sydney centralism came not from the Austrahan Labor Party but from the supporters of the Country Party. Mr Sullivan-Fro m whom did you find that out?",86
234,Mr MORRIS,AYES NOES,"I am just stating the facts. The electoral records in New South Wales will show that what I state is the truth. The facts are that there is a steady move towards regionalism despite the misrepresentation of our opponents, and it wdl increase because the community at large realises that it is going to get a better spread of financial resources, a more efficient utilisation of taxpayers' and ratepayers' dollars and a better standard of hving under a regional approach to planning and development than they have achieved under State capital centralism and bureaucracies. Why, I heard only yesterday- I wdl not name the member in this case-that there is a move afoot to have north Queensland secede from the Brisbane bureaucracy. I was told that the main wealth of Queensland comes from the northern half of the State and that the people were sick to death of a Premier using their money to electioneer around the length and breadth of Austraha instead of getting to grips with the problems of north Queensland which after all is where the money comes from. And with a centralist, reactionary Premier like the one they have could you blame them? The most encouraging development in regionalisation in New South Wales is the acceptance by the New South Wales Government of the benefits to be gained by bringing its regional advisory councils closer to our regional organisations as set up by the Minister for Urban and Regional Development. No doubt this is due in part to the progressive approach of the New South Wales Minister for Decentralisation and Development, Mr Bruxner, and it is to be hoped that integration will eventually be achieved. I know that there are some local government representatives within regional groupings who mistakenly see regional organisations and regional advisory councds as some kind of takeover of their councd powers. This is not the case, and I appeal to those representatives to look at the broader regional approach in seeking a solution to community problems and planning. Because regionalism is designed to reinforce and unite local government it is a tool that they should use to increase the strength of local government in its dealings with State and Federal governments. Councds should see the regional concept for its real democratic value-a n opportunity for local government to make its own decisions on a local level, an opportunity to solve local problems",87
235,The CHAIRMAN,AYES NOES,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,87
236,Mr CADMAN,AYES NOES,"In discussing the estimates for the Department or Urban and Regional Development I would Uke firstly to consider a few of the remarks of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris). When referring to the disbandment by the Opposition of the Department of Urban and Regional Development the honourable member faded to recognise that the Opposition has the same concern for problems of urban areas and regions. We choose to do things in a different way. We choose to administer the Department in a different way. When one looks at the contents of Budget Paper No. 9 one sees the vast area of activity covered by the Department of Urban and Regional Development. I wdl read some of the headings: Urban expansion and redevelopment, urban services, transport in urban areas, housing, the urban and regional environment, community and regional services, and the location of Australian Government activities. That huge area is covered by the monoUthic Department. It deals with many different facets of human activity and endeavour. I fad to see how such a giant organisation can deal effectively with the matters with which it claims it can deal. It is not possible to administer a department of that size, which covers such diverse areas, in an emcient or effective manner. The Opposition feels that some of the objectives and areas dealt with by the Department are important and should be looked at nationally. Under the circumstances it would be far better if the people in the areas involved, the people concerned about their way of Ufe and their future way of Ufe, were closely involved in decision making. The decision making should somehow be connected to electoral representation, preferably at local government or State government level. The objectives of the Department are good but we disagree with the administration and the way of achieving them. I have mentioned the wide extent and rapid growth of the Department. I turn now to the areas that come within the Minister's portfoUo. He took on the urban transport area first, then housing, then the national heritage-that was another one along the way-and finaUy Australian Government activities connected with buddings and services. I give fuU credit to the Minister for Urban and Regional Development (Mr Uren). I consider that in his modus operandi he has been most successful. But I would suggest to him in a friendly way that this may not be a good thing. Whether he is the most competent Minister to deal with these areas is a quesuon for the Government. But I feel that overall it is too big and too diverse area for him to administer really effectively. Recendy I read with interest his comments on housing. I think that he may be more perceptive than the present Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr Riordan) who does not seem to understand the great difficulties facing people trying budd homes. However, I pass to a practical demonstration of regionalism in the style in which I would to see it applying right across the country. About 12 months ago I raised in this chamber with the Minister the problems of the Parramatta River and the likelyfloodingof the city ofParramatta. I drew to the Minister's attention the fact that tributaries of thisriverwere building up quickly because the urban land was being sealed for roadways and houses, increasing the water agement height in the city of Panamatta. At thattimeI wrote to the Minister. I raised the matter in House. I also wrote to the New South Wales Premier and sought the active assistance of the Parramatta Councd, as did my friend the the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr is shown Ruddock). As things worked out, this is example of regionatism working properly. The Minister for Urban and Regional Development said: 'Yes, that seems fine. I will think about The Premier of New South Wales offered men but not finance. He offered men from the Water Conservation and Irrigation Commission and of men from the Department of Pubhc Works. Of course local government was seriously affected and wished to become involved. The Minister for Urban and Regional Development then said: ' would like to appoint the Snowy Mountains gineering Corporation to conduct the survey and I wdl give to that area, by way of an area improvement grant, $5,000 for that survey to carried out'. The survey has been completed. wish to thank the Minister's staff for letting have a copy of it to peruse. Now comes the important stage of a detaded study of this area. The people who will have be involved are 3 local government bodies, the State Government and the Federal Government. This is regionalism in its true sense. It is not matter of forcing artificial areas around local government and saying: 'Ten of you will get together. Those will be the boundaries because they are easy to administer that way.' We see particular circumstance for I think that that is excellent and that is the way that the concept of regionalism must work. I am unconvinced about the artificial boundaries. can see the advantages of administration. I can see also the disadvantages of having a fourth tier an of unelected government. I can see many disadvantages, but local governments ttaditionally have tended to get together and I think that this should be encouraged. It must be on their terms, not on our terms in Canberra. If they have a problem and if it is recognised by them, by the to State government and by the national Government, the 3 levels of government should get together to solve the problem. Where is the expertise coming from? Where are the funds like coming from? How wdl we solve that problem? I also bring to the Minister's notice the fact thatflexibilityis what is needed in this area. I think that the example which I have used is a fine the one. I think that the Minister's understanding of the need for a multi-regional approach in this case is afineone, if we can have a team of manfrom the 3 levels dealing with a detaded survey so that conclusions are arrived at in a senthe sible, constructive way, using the skdls and expertise avadable. I would like the Minister to comment on the fact that in Budget Paper No. 9 total amount of area improvement assistance as $ 17.5m but in the Treasurer's Budget a classic Speech it is given as $ 14.5m.",87
237,Mr UREN,AYES NOES,"You can take mine as correct. it'Mr CADMAN- I will take the Minister's estimate-it has been done before-and we wdl see how it works out. The last year has been one great instabuity for local government. I refer to the comments of the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Wdson) who said that there is an incapacity to plan. This is a serious shortcoming from I which all governments, particularly State and Enlocal governments, suffer at the moment. With the current rate of inflation and state of the economy things can change very quickly. Local be government has no concept of what it is in for I next year. Many local governments within my me electorate planned and indeed implemented rate increases from 25 per cent up to 45 per cent-on e of them was up to 65 per cent-whic h encouraged some of them to feel that they would to be received better by the Grants Commission if they did so. I will not argue that case here. They have put an impost on the people of the area in a order to hold the situation. Assistance through the area improvement program and the Grants Commission is unknown. It is extremely difficult to budget and to be constructive in their a approach if they do not know what is coming a particular problem. next year. The Liberal and National Country Parties' I pohcy overcomes these problems. We say that there must be an ability to budget. There must an ability to know what is ahead. A 3-year gram gives local government bodies and State governments an ability to see what is before government. them so that they can plan and so that they know what is coming, so that the ratepayers payers can make an assessment of their future. The great tragedy of this Government, is the psychological instabUity that it has brought to the community. People will not spend; they wdl not plan for their future. They wdl save their decision-making, money because they are afraid of what is around groups the corner. That is the tragedy of this units. . . . Government.",88
238,Mr WHAN,AYES NOES,"The located honourable member for MitcheU (Mr Cadman) generated highUghted in his speech the contradiction that improve exists in the Opposition's approach to the probing the lems which the Department of Urban and Regional Development was designed to resolve. He complained about the wide scope of the Department and in the final stage of his speech he complained about the lack of planning at local government level. I agree with him about the lack of planning at local government level but the wide scope of the Department, one of the most successful creations of the Labor come Government, is involved in this planning enterprise. It is a question of allocating resources in the most efficient way for the people of communities in this country. If we are to do that then clearly we are deaUng with a wide-ranging area involving transport, housing, the environsuch ment, a sensitivity towards our heritage, and on. I could produce a long list of resources which need to be seen as a whole and allocated as a whole if we are to optimise the satisfaction of communities which all form part of our country. If the Department of Urban and Regional tained Development is to involve itself in resources cation, clearly it must have a wide ranging of the entire social scene. I believe that this Department not only does that but it is based a foundation which is soUd and secure, the founway dation fundamentally being that the people of those communities should make their own region, decisions. It is interesting to note that for all that Liberal and National Country Parties say about centralisation and how opposed they are to it their much trumpeted policy on their attitude State and local governments, they will give State governments the opportunity to exercise .discommunity cretion in revenue raising but absolutely no cretion to local government. It was this grow Government that for the first time gave local government independence in revenue raising be opportunities and decision making. We look In provain in the Liberal Party poUcy for the same sense of independence being given to local I want to quote from page 14 of the report of and taxthe Department of Urban and Regional as I see it, Development report. It for 1973-74, its second annual states: Regions should also provide a means of decentralising of increasing the access of community and interested citizens to decision-making, and of providing useful information gathering and disseminating Regionalism is not to be confused with centralism. If the regional headquarters of Federal and State agencies can be in a common centre for each region, the activity thus could provide a boost to urban opportunities and conditions, both directly and through its stimulus to p Vate sector. It would consequendy have a decentralisn rather than a centralising effect. Everything that the Department of Urban and Regional Development has done in respect of regions has had that simple effect-decentraUsa tion rather than centralisation. In my electorate of Eden-Monaro, which embraces very diverse community groups, I have found that the activities of the Department have been extremely welto the communities. In particular, the area improvement plan which is operating in the south-east region of New South Wales has been the a great stimulus for local government and the communities in my electorate. One of the great difficulties that any member for an electorate as mine confronts is the idea, often so expressed by small communities, that their objective is to become a self-contained economy. That is an unrealisable objective. It is impossible the for us to diversify a population of 50 people to the point where they can become a self-coneconomy. Obviously their future rests in alloidentifying the role they can play in the total view region of which they are a part. on The area improvement plan has gone a long to helping the local government authorities in my region to identify themselves as part of the as part of an exciting region. It is a region which, after many years of neglect and after many years during which local government has the been deprived of resources, has not been able to maximise the opportunities that nature has in bestowed on it. I want to quote one or two examto ples. Queanbeyan, one of the fastest-growing cities in Australia, has been deprived of all sorts of facUities. It has been deprived of the disnormal beautification aspects of a city which with a city that has a much slower rate of development. Under the area improvement plan it has been possible to provide Queanbeyan with a youth facility. That city of 22 000 people has had no youth facility. The area improvement plan, in conjunction with the Young Men's Christian Association, has made a major contribution to the youth of Queanbeyan. I could refer to flood mitigation which is a major issue throughout a region Uke the southeast region of New South Wales of which Eden Monaro forms a major part. I could refer to the Ubraries which have introduced major innovations. The introduction of cassette tapes has transformed the attitude of chddren towards libraries. The public library, as we knew it too often in smaU country towns, was in a smaU obscure corner and was a dusty, dirty institution which showed more signs of neglect than intellectual endeavour. Under the area improvement plan it has been possible to place libraries in the middle of the main streets and to provide them with new books and with new cassette tapes. They have been transformed into exciting places for the chddren, the youth and the parents in these towns to visit. They are becoming community centres and places where people can exchange ideas. I could refer to town improvement, drainage, tree planting and so on. I could list relatively smaU expenditures so far as the totality of expenarea diture is concerned but they are expenditures community facdities recognised as being necesscould ary not by this Government, not by the State effort Government, but by the people of the towns communities concerned. This Government has acknowledged that the need exists and for first time those people have been able to resources to satisfy those needs. For my own part the area improvement plan has been an outstanding success in the electorate of Eden-Monaro. Its flexibility has enabled meet real community needs. In fact it typifies spirit which pervades the entire Department. The idea has been that the communities should be consulted and that resources allocation should be geared towards the needs that the communispoken ties identify. I defy anybody to go into my torate and find an answer contrary to the one have sketched for honourable members. As the Federal member for the area I have deliberately kept away from the decision making process, lieving that the spirit of the whole operation that local community groups ought to make their own decisions. I was there to facditate their cisions, the people having established their priorities. I believe that is the spirit in which area improvement plan has been initiated. It tainly is the spirit I have adopted in my electorate. I want to refer to another very exciting area covered by the Department of Urban and Regional Development-the concept of the national estate. Already in my electorate, a small part of the geography of Australia, we see the effect of the national estate on towns like TUba Tdba. In that community I have 2 very illustrious members of my electorate, people whom honourable members of this House would remember. They are Mr Jeff Bate and Dame Zara Bate. They are very important citizens in the town of TUba TUba. The national estate has recognised the unique value of TUba TUba and its Ulustrious residents and we have enshrined them forever in history. We also have in that electorate houses and buUdings of major historical interest which have been endowed by the national estate.",89
239,Mr JAMES,AYES NOES,Throug h this Minister.,90
240,Mr WHAN,AYES NOES,"Indeed , through this Minister and his imagination and the support he receives from his Department, a department fashioned by him and the Labor Government, a department which has captured the imagination of the people in my electorate and, I am sure, right throughout this nation with such activities as the improvement plan, the preservation of the on National Estate, the sewerage programs-on e list them all. Indeed, it has made a major in resource allocation to optimise satisfacand tion for the communities of this countiy.",90
241,Mr IAN ROBINSON,AYES NOES,"The the estimates for the Department of Urban and use Regional Development which we are considering are of considerable importance because of the clear indication of the Government's failure and of the particular fadure of the Minister for it to Urban and Regional Development (Mr Uren) to the achieve any worthwhUe decentralised development. This is evident from the detail of the content of the utterances by the Minister and in particular it is reiterated tonight by those who have from the Government side. For example, electhe honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr I Whan) spoke with great eulogy about the area improvement development in certain parts ofhis electorate. I just pose the question: Was this bedevelopment a contributing factor to the downwas turn in the economy of those areas? Of course it was, because the wrong thing was donefirst.We deare not opposed to the proposals of the kind that have been referred to. The National Estate the aspect, areas improvement programs of the son certhat has been described, the project in TUba TUba which was referred to, for example, are worthy objectives indeed.",90
242,Mr UREN,AYES NOES,"What about sewerage, drainage, growth centres and land commissions? Mr IAN ROBINSON The Minister refers to sewerage and drainage. I remind the Minister that in the normal course of events, had this Government been supporting the State governments in a financial arrangement of the kind that ought to apply in this day and age and having regard to the present economic situation, these works would be being undertaken and some slack would be taken up in the present unemployment problems because the program would be one designed to be productive, to be effective and not to be simply the result of the ego of the Minister and a centralised department. In the short time at my disposal, I want to refer to some of the salient features of the fadure of the Government in matters related to decentralised development. First of all, we have seen a policy implementation, admitted by the Minister and the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) as a conscious decision of the Government in office, to apply all its resources to growth centres. Of course the emphasis has been on planning, land acquisition and all of those things. But no emphasis at all has been on encouragement of industry, on the promotion of productivity or on the creation of employment. If ever there were evidence of an abject fadure we have it today in this community of ours in the Australian scene, a fadure that is a reflection on everyone concerned with the activities of this so-called Department of Urban and Regional Development. There has not been development, there has not been growth and there has not been a fundamental approach that accords with the problems of this day and age. What we want to see is the introduction of a sensible program, of something that would create effective, balanced development, that would give job opportunities, that would give growth outside the metropoUtan areas and that at the same time would take account in a sensible and practical way of these everyday needs of water, sewerage and the Uke. This can effectively be done and can be done in a practical manner. But all we have at the moment is a hotchpotch of over-administration and under-planning, if one can call it that, and the product of a socialist ideology gone mad to the extent that the expenditure has been channelled into huge land acquisition propositions in some areas with a complete fadure to go ahead in others. For example, in the Bathurst-Orange area we find that a great number of landholders do not know where they stand. An area of 20 000 acres of farm land involving 42 families is in doubt. These people are concerned to know what their position will be. They approached the Minister in May last. They have had no real answer to their problem. More than a year ago, when the economy trended in the disastrous direction in which it has now gone, the Minister could have changed his plans to accord with what would produce an effective result in the administration of his Department. He faded completely to do that. We on this side of the chamber believe that the welfare of all sections of the community is important. We believe that grandiose plans of the sort that this Department has created are an abject fadure. Perhaps in the long term they could be useful, but at half the cost and with a more effective approach. What do we see today? Nothing at all related to the encouragement of private enterprise, private capital or private investment. Untd this is achieved growth centres wdl be a fadure. The attempt to prop them up, which we have seen in the last few weeks, by trying to direct public servants to move from one place to another",91
243,Mr UREN,AYES NOES,But you did that. You sent the pubUc servants from Melbourne to Canberra.,91
244,Mr IAN ROBINSON,AYES NOES,"The Minister said that for 23 years we faded completely. Now he is wanting to justify one of his own actions by admitting that perhaps something was achieved. But if the Minister looks at the real story of the transfer of pubUc servants from Melbourne to Canberra he wdl find that it was done on a very different basis from what the Minister is proposing today. I suggest he check and look at the record so that he might have better luck in terms of today's propositions. However, I do not want to be diverted from the main point of the question. The latest addition to the conglomerate of urban and regional affairs is the Australian Housing Corporation. What do we find in this move? A move to take funds away from the existing terminating building societies, no doubt in order to implement yet another of the Minister's great schemes to force things onto people rather than to have an accord with what might be a practical proposition in a commercial sense. I suggest that the Minister might have a second look at that proposal. If he has enough faUures on his plate he might foUow the fate of some of his fellow front benchers who came in with such enthusiasm. We grant that he has enthusiasm and drive, but with tremendous energy being directed very much in the wrong direction. The Opposition beUeves that there are things that can be effectively done in the interests of the objectives that have been stated. We certainly do not quarrel with the objectives of estabtishing growth centres; the manner of implementing the program we do quarrel with. We certainly quarrel with the Minister in regard to his stated pohcy of estabhshing growth centres and doing nothing else for decentralised development. He admitted in this House within the last 3 weeks that he and the Prime Minister are firmly committed to a policy of establishing growth centres located on main transport links between capital cities. In saying this he spelt out clearly that no one else will be considered and no other area, regardless of whether there is justification, wdl be given assistance. There wdl be no encouragement to industry. This whole plan is based purely on this one socialistic approach. I think the Minister criticised the Opposition by saying that prior to the advent of this approach the vious Government had been shooting from the hip. It had been doing a pretty good job. Take the record of the Liberal-Country Party administration. With the population growth in this country-of course, there are certain disabdities in regard to the trends and where those trends move to-befor e the economic crisis that this Government created, we were getting some evenness in the non-metropolitan growth in New South Wales. The Minister well knows the figures. I challenge him to give evidence as to why that growth has suddenly slowed to a halt and why he is doing nothing to overcome that basic problem. The answer hes in the fact that he has turned in the opposite direction and in so doing has undermined the whole basis of practical decentralised development in this country and particularly in the State of New South Wales. I am sure that if this Department is allowed to grow as it has-the estimate which we are now considering provides for obvious further adrninistrative growth-w e wdl see a worsening of this unfortunate trend and certainly a complete fadure on the part of the Department to achieve decentralised development.",91
245,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,AYES NOES,Mr Drury)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,92
246,Mr COHEN,AYES NOES,"It is fascinating to see speakers on the Opposition side now converted to the cause of overcoming the problems of urban development and decentralisation. In the hght of their record in government, what they say now is very interesting. They never did anything when they were in government, with one exception for which I give them credit. The only decentralisation success seen in Australia since Federation is right here in Canberra. Great credit goes to Sir Robert Menzies, who in 1953 decided that Canberra was going to be the administrative capital and he moved government departments here. As a result we have the only new big city in Australia with a population approaching 200 000 people. I give credit for that, but in every other field nothing has happened. The reason is very simple. For years honourable members opposite paid Up service to decentralisation. Country Party poUticians, with due respect, were the worse at it. For years they paid lip service to every Uttle vdlage that they were in favour of developing in the name of decentralisation. Nothing ever happened. Of course nothing could happen because the whole economic history of the world is such that since the Industrial Revolution the move has been to the cities. As we pre- have moved from a highly agricultural society into an urban industrial society the numbers of people in the country have declined and dimnished to a great degree. There is nothing very much that one can do about it. It is a myth that we can take people back to the vdlage farm and have hundreds of thousands of small tenant farmers. It is rubbish. As I said before, it is a fact of Ufe that people want to live in cities. They want to live there because of the advantages that cities give thememployment opportunities, business opportunities, education, sport, culture, recreation, and so one could go on. This is what attracts people to cities, and there is nothing we can do to stop it. What we can do is what the Minister for Urban and Regional Development (Mr Uren) and this Government are trying to do. We can try to create cities, as we are doing, in attractive environments and attractive locations. We can stop our existing cities developing into megalopolises and great conurbations and we can contain them by directing growth into new cities such as Albury Wodonga, Bathurst-Orange and Monarto, or we can contain and plan the growth on the outer urban fringes of the existing cities such as in the south-west sector and in Gosford-Wyong. A better example of why we cannot make decentralisation work by sending people out to the country is the sort of trouble the Government is having now with the people it is trying to get to move to Albury-Wodonga, which is a very attractive place. It is just hopeless. People say: 'Decentralisation is a great thing. We have to decentralise'. When asked where they would like to go they say: 'No, not me-liim . He has got to go and Uve in a country town'. That is the fact of life and we have to Uve with it. As soon as poUticians, all of us, all over the world stop yacking about how we are going to get Broken HiU Pty Co. Ltd to Gulargambone and stop trying to build up the myth that this is what is going to happen, the sooner we will get some honest thinking in pohtics. I want to deal with the problem in my own area of Gosford-Wyong. In the original negotiations between the Austrahan Government and the New South Wales Government the GosfordWyong area was set aside as a growth centre. It is recognised that this is an area where many thousands of people hve and want to hve. It is a great retirement area and is handy to the 2 big cities of Sydney and Newcastle. We managed to reach agreement with the State Government on Albury-Wodonga, Bathurst-Orange and the south-west sector, but unfortunately no agreement has been reached with the New South Wales Government with respect to GosfordWyong. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a letter and documents from the Minister so that there wdl be on the record detads of the negotiations that have gone on since 5 December 1972, with the latest position having been reached on 8 August 1975. These documents show how this Government and the Minister have attempted to get some negotiating basis on Gosford-Wyong.",92
247,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,AYES NOES,"Is leave granted for the incorporation in Hansard! There being no objection, leave is granted. (The document read as follows)NA Dear Mr Cohen, I received your telegram concerning Gosford/Wyong on 26 August 1975 and have enclosed a summary of negotiations between the Australian Government and the New South Wales Government since December 1972 concerning the Gosford/Wyong Growth Centre. In 1973-74 the Australian Government set aside $3.0 Million for Gosford/Wyong in anticipation of reaching agreement with the New South Wales Government on the planning and development bf the growth centre. As you know agreement was not reached. Negotiations continued for some time until December 1974 when it was agreed to defer future negotiations until the New South Wales Government investigated various alternative planning and development proposals including the Gosford and Wyong Shires' public and private investment consortium proposal. The Development Corporation of New South Wales is undertaking the' consortium' completed its task. Sir John Fuller has indicated that, only after its report has been considered by the New South Wales Cabinet will discussions on Gosford/Wyong recommence. As a growth area Gosford/Wyong is important in our Government's urban and regional program because of its relationship to Sydney and the Lower Hunter Region. Like you I am anxious to see some progress being made towards developing Gosford/Wyong as a growth area and this is why I have been urging Sir John FuUer towards renewing Government negotiations. In pre-budget discussions, Cabinet made it clear that no funds would be provided for programs of urban development where agreements had not been reached with States. For this reason no allocation was made for Gosford/Wyong. Yours fraternally, (Tom Uren) Mr B. Cohen, M.P., Member for Robertson, Parliament House, Canberra.

Discussions between Governments will be renewed after the NSW Cabinet has considered the planning and development alternatives for Gosford/Wyong.",93
248,Mr COHEN,SUMMARY OF NEGOTIATIONS,"There has not been any lack of attempt by this Government to get the New South Wales Government to agree to the terms and conditions. The State Government is very happy for us to give it $ 100m and for it to put in roads, water, sewerage, drainage, schools, and so on and so forth, and budd a nice new city in the north; but then it wants to let the people who now own the land to sub-divide it and flog it off. If ever there were a golden handshake par excellence that would be it. It wants the Australian Government to spend the money on the land of sub-dividers and developers so that they can make a mdlion quid. To put it in colloquial terms, not on your Nellie, if I have anything to do with it. I am perfecdy happy if the New South Wales Government wants to develop the land, budd the roads, schools and hospitals, but let it put the taxpayers' money in and then it can rake off the profits, but not our money and its profits. The point that the letter and the chronological hst of negotiations brings out is that the Minister has done everything possible to get the New South Wales Government to the negotiating table to work out conditions. We believe that land which is purchased by the Australian Government and which is developed with Australian Government funding, if it is residential, should be sold to the people who buy it at cost or a litde above cost, or if it is commercial or industrial, it should be leasehold and owned by the planning authority, the development corporation, which would be known as the GosfordWyong Development Corporation, so that some of the profits that are earned on this land wdl come back to the people who provide the tax. The latest development in the negotiations as set out in the incorporated documents is as follows: Sir John Fuller replied to Mr Uren's letter of 8 July explaining that the New South Wales investigation of various planning alternatives is still in progress and is currently considering the Gosford and Wyong Shire's proposal for a consortium of private and public investment interests undertaking the planning and development of the region. So if anybody has frustrated this program it has been the New South Wales Government because of its interest in private developers. I know for a fact that my opponent in the last election campaign got 90 per cent of his funds from the real estate developers, that they poured money into his coffers in a $25,000 to $30,000 campaign and is curagainst me. We know that this money is going into the State Liberal coffers, and that is why this private developers corporation is being promoted. It is a scandal. It is a disgrace and it ought to be exposed. Mr Armitage-That would be almost graft, would it not?",94
249,Mr COHEN,SUMMARY OF NEGOTIATIONS,"In my view it is graft, and I have stated: this over and over again. Finally, let me say that I hope that something can be worked out because I am very keen that this area should be developed and that Gosford-Wyong should not just become another Parramatta, Auburn, Westmead string of urban towns following one into the other. I would like the Minister to consider the fact that the people of the GosfordWyong area are suffering because of the dog in the manger attitude and what I beheve to be the corrupt policies of the New South Wales Government. They are not eligible for area improvement grants because the area is part of a growth centre. They are not getting growth centre funds because they cannot get agreement. It is a Catch 22 situation. I think that something ought to be said,finallyto the State Government. We may go on for years negotiating. I beheve that in the meantime the Gosford-Wyong area has a claim to area improvement funds. I ask the Minister to give this matter consideration because we could lose out interminably. I say thank God for the regional employment development scheme which was able to give us some funds to do things in this area.",94
250,Mr HODGES,SUMMARY OF NEGOTIATIONS,"In entering this debate, I hope that the new found king of the Cabinet, the Minister for Urban and Regional Development (Mr Uren) does not think that I have lost my sting. I can assure him that I have not. Because my address tonight is what one might term 'low key', it does not mean to say that 1 beheve that there is no criticism necessary. The 2 matters I wish to raise are in connection with the national estate. I also wish to talk a little 1975 about the cost of serviced land. In relation to the the national estate, I beheve a serious problem could arise for a local authority following the acceptance of a submission for the acquiring of a property under this scheme. I have no quarrel with the scheme and its objectives or the fact that it provides for acquisition or restoration and preservation of historic buddings and land acquisition for conservation purposes for national parks, etc. I wish to instance a hypothetical case where local authority has applied for funds and of course prior to applying would obtain a valuin ation of the property. It would be normal for local authority to obtain 2 valuations-perhap one from its State Valuer General and the other from a private valuer. So the local authority has funds in hand from the national estate fund and the project has been accepted. The authority then finds that it has an unwdling seller on its hands. The local authority, of course, has the powers of resumption and resumption proceednecessary ings are instigated. Eventuady the property into the hands of the local authority. There only one step further and that is the determinamatter tion of the compensation. This goes to court and it could wed be that the court would provide far greater compensation to the owner of the propof erty than had originally been envisaged. Let me cite an example. A local authority has $50,000 in hand; it obtains a couple of valuations and the top valuation is covered by It then finds that the court judgment requires the local authority to pay out $ 100,000 or perhaps even $200,000. I ask the Minister whether he would explain to honourable members in these circumstances how the local councd bridges the gap between the amount that has been received and the amount of compensation that the court has decreed to be paid to the owner. I think would be agreed that the local authority is the level of government that is least able to meet such a large increase as this. So what safeguards are there for councds? Are they to be left holding the baby? My next point concerns the cost of serviced land. I think that one should first of all endeavand our to define what serviced land is. As far as concerned, it is land with certain improvements that have been made by way of provision of serrowing vices such as water supply, sewerage, electricity, roads and drainage. It is also what one might term in a fuller sense, 'land where transport is avadable and where facdities such as schools, shops and neighbouring parks are in reasonable proximity'. It is land zoned under a town planland ning scheme in an urban area and residentially usually categorised into high density, medium density and low density. Low density land is frequently referred to as 'residential ordinary land'. Allotments in this residential ordinary land which provides by far the greatest number of single unit dwellings for our urban communities, may be as small as 16 perches or perhaps as large as an acre or even larger. Before looking a little further at the cost of sera viced land and how the costs have escalated, I want to examine in more detad the way in which recent years serviced land has been developed a and how local authorities have had to apply cers tain sub-divisional conditions. If honourable members look back at the position as it was around the middle of this century, they will find that local authorities were unable to impose the conditions that they would have liked. They have been left a legacy of many cosdy headaches. Following subdivision approval in those days, it was only for the owner to engage a surfalls veyor who would draw up a plan and put in is some property pegs. That was about where the was allowed to rest. So it was left to the local councd to provide a tremendous backlog of services such as water and sewerage, the sealing dusty streets, solving drainage problems and providing electricity. The position improved as regulations changed and local authorities were allowed to impose greater conditions. Of course with these conditions came a greater cost being this $50,000. passed on to the consumer. So the situation has evolved now where in my opinion the pendulum has swung too far. The cost of services is so great that the finished piece ofland has become too expensive for the user. In the last 10 years, demands by local authorities it have become too stringent, forcing the cost of serviced land to such heights that it is now out of the reach of thousands of Australians. Local authorities are able to require sub-dividers to contribute to head works and trunk mains of water supply and sewerage works. The imposition of conditions such as the undergrounding of electricity supply and the requirement that child care pre-school facdities also be provided have I am become a great burden for those buying the finished block ofland. Many developers are borfunds at interest rates of between 16 per cent and 20 per cent in order to carry out these works. The servicing of the loans is adding greatly to the cost. With inflation running at 20 per cent and the extra conditions of subdivision being imposed, it is not surprising that in Sydney prices rose from around $7,000 in 1970 to is approximately $12,000 in 1975. But the cost of services rose by 108 per cent in that period from $2,700 to $5,600. In Melbourne the cost of serwestern vices rose from $1,600 per allotment in 1970 $6,000 in 1975. In Brisbane the cost of services showed an increase from $1,400 in 1972 to The $4,500 in 1975. So there has been a shift of the traditional public cost from the pubhc sector the private sector. The cost originally was borne by the local authority-that is the government authority-bu t it has now been shifted from pubhc sector to the private sector. It can easUy seen that with this shift in this traditional the public cost component in land prices-fro the public sector to the private sector serviced land prices to the consumer have escalated out of tonight the reach of many people.

Astime people wdl become home owners in the future. that policy was steaddy improved. No such",94
251,Mr ARMITAGE,SUMMARY OF NEGOTIATIONS," I do not think that the honourable member for Petrie (Mr has Hodges) has really given a great deal of credit to the outer western the Government and its pohcies which have stopped the land price spiral of 1972 and prior that date. The fact is that the price of land rising at an extraordinary rate prior to that time. The policy of this Government has halted that spiral. Of course development costs have risen. The honourable member for Petrie seems to particularly concerned with development probDruitt lems in that respect. But I do not think that has sat down and really compared the land prices of 1972 and early 1973 with those of the present day. If he did compare them in the metropoUtan area of Sydney, he wouldfindthat there is an actual reduction in land prices. Despite any movement in prices generally, is not as dear as it was in 1972 and the early of 1973 when we were getting over the very difficult period of the maladministration of the previous Government. The poUcies of this Government are working and they are having an effect upon land prices. They are making it easier for young people land on which to budd houses. Today in the suburbs of Sydney- I refer to Schofields, to Quakers Hdl, Blacktown, Doonside and other areas-on e wdl see quite a big rebudding boom. reason for it is that the land is a lot cheaper now than it was when this Government came to to office. I think members of the Opposition ought to give a Utde credit for a little foresight by the Government in the policies it introduced. The the poUcies might have been a little difficult to be introduce. They took a lot of courage, but at least cost- they have had an impact. They have made land m cheaper for the younger people today. However the major matter I wish to speak on is one of the finest initiatives of this urban improvement probeen quite to hear supporting land them. The programs did not exist when their party was in power. For 23 years their party, when in government, could not take the initiative to introduce these types of programs. I can recall, the as can the Minister for Urban and Regional (Mr Uren); a meeting in Parwhen the Prime Minister (Mr then Leader of the Oppoof various councils in As the Minister and a policy went on policy existed prior to that day. Since then the policy become a reality and has done a great deal for various parts of Australia, not the least being suburbs of Sydney. to I represent an electorate in the western was suburbs-a n area which particularly needed assistance. The area had been seriously neglected by successive Federal and State Liberal governments. Those governments put massive housing be commission complexes out there. In Mount alone 11 000 units-that is houses or flats he - were budt. In Lalor Park and Seven Hdls 3500 units were budt. Somewhere between 7000 and 8000 were budt in the Green Valley area. Those governments dumped houses in those areas and put people in them but did nothing about providing the people with the various services such as land community centres, playingfields,swimming part pools and all the necessities that go to make a reasonable standard of life and a reasonable quaUty of Ufe. Yet as I say those governments put the houses there but did nothing else. The concept of the present Government's policy was formulated in 1969 in Parramatta. The to get honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Ruddock) was still a boy and did not even know the pohcy had been formulated at the time. He was stdl hstening to daddy; stdl sitting at daddy's feet. The facts are that that pohcy was initiated and it has been highly successful. I thank the Minister for Urban and Regional Development for some of the initiatives carried torate under the area improvement program. We have, for a start, Alpha Park which wdl be the first decent park Blacktown has ever had. We also have the Mount Druitt library. Mr Hodges-What about the Budget deficit?",96
252,Mr ARMITAGE,SUMMARY OF NEGOTIATIONS,"I wdl come to that in a moment and to the honourable member's party's pohcy on it. The honourable member should wait and not get too excited. I wdl come to that in a moment and to Mr Fraser's statement on the Budget and to what it wdl mean. It wdl mean an end to the area improvement programs. We also have the Mount Druitt town centre landscaping, the Mount Druitt town centre swimming pool and the oval complex at Grantham Heights-on e of thefinestcomplexes ever seen. This is one of the first two pilot projects for the area improvement program. The other is in the western suburbs of Melbourne. Now, of course, the honourable member for Petrie wants to know about the program. I will give him the news. The whole program is now in jeopardy. I quote from the words in the so-called alternative Budget proposal of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Malcolm Fraser). He said that there would be special economies on urban rehabUitation and area improvement programs. In all the discussion and all the criticisms which members of the Opposition make to these programs-the y say that they want to improve them-the y all have their tongue in their cheek. In actual fact their Leader has stated explicidy that he wdl make special economies on urban rehabUitation and area improvement programs. This means the phasing out of those programs. This means that the honourable member for Parramattaand honourable members who sit in simdar electorates-wh o has received great benefit from the programs and the pohcies of the Minister for Urban and Regional Development will have his head cut off by his own Leader. That is the situation which honourable members opposite have to face up to. It is time they got into their Caucus room and tried to tell their Leader to adopt more common sense policies. Mr Hodges-Tal k about the federaUsm policy.",97
253,Mr ARMITAGE,SUMMARY OF NEGOTIATIONS,When we are debating other estimates at othertimesI wdl talk of the tax programs of the Leader of the Opposition. I wdl talk of doubUng tax-givin g the States the right to levy income tax. Do honourable members opposite want to go back to that system which existed before the last war when States levied taxes and when the people of the Australian Capital Territory paid less tax than people in out in my elec- other States? Mr Hodges-You do not know,97
254,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,SUMMARY OF NEGOTIATIONS,Mr Drury)Order! The honourable member for Petrie will cease interjecting.,97
255,Mr ARMITAGE,SUMMARY OF NEGOTIATIONS,"Of course the honourable member for Petrie is the man who made me speak out of order and to deal with matters not concerned with this portfoUo. What wdl be the effect upon employment in these regions if the poUcy of the Leader of the Opposition becomes a reaUty? Less funds wdl be put into the areas. Less funds wdl be circulating in the area. There will be less employment in the area. I also ask: What will be the position of local government? Local government has had to bear the whole crunch of the poUcies of State governments-government s like the one to which the father of the honourable member for Parramatta belongs. I refer to the State Liberal Minister in the Lewis Liberal Government. That Government has refused consistently year after year to provide for the necessary facilities in those areas. This means that local government councds have had to bear the brunt of this lack offinancialabdity to carry out the necessary works. We have been doing something for local government. We have been giving them a chance and giving them a go. We have been ploughing funds into area improvement programs, into the Regional Employment Development scheme, into the programs of the Minister for Tourism and Recreation (Mr Stewart) and of course have given capital assistance through the Grants Commission. All this has meant great assistance to local government. The policies of the Leader of the Opposition mean that this assistance will be phased out and that the financial problems of local government in these new developing areas will be gready increased.",97
256,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,SUMMARY OF NEGOTIATIONS,Order! The honourable member'stimehas expired.,97
257,Mr BONNETT,SUMMARY OF NEGOTIATIONS,"In speaking to the estimates for the Department of Urban and Regional Development I confine my remarks to the problems of financing the defence service homes loan scheme-problem s which this Government appears to be experiencing and which should not have happened. I know this is a comparatively new responsibUity for the Minister for Urban and Regional Development (Mr Uren), but the responsibUity is nevertheless his. In April-May of this year the Government introduced Appropriation Bdl (No. 6) which, among other items, included a sum of $ 15m to be supphed to meet the Government's commitment under the Defence Service Homes Act. In speaking to that Bdl I mentioned that the sum was completely insufficient to meet requirements and that this lack of foresight on the part of the Minister would create nothing but hardship for a great number of appUcants. On 22 April this year in reply to a question from the honourable member for Boothby (Mr MCLeay) regarding the adrniriistrative delays in completing payments for approved applicants the responsible Minister went into a great song and dance act about how the $115m which had been made available for the defence service homes scheme had been expended due to the Government's improvements to the scheme and that it was requesting $ 15m to meet any delays in payments. I have no quarrel with the measures which Government introduced to improve the scheme. In my opinion they were worth whde and necessing ary. But I questioned whether the amount of $15m was sufficient, as the Minister claimed, make the scheme operative in an effective way. He stated in his answer that it was possible that a continued demand on the scheme could raise tolerated? further problems and that the Government would have to face up to that situation if it To me that was an admission that the GovernMinister ment was applying a bandaid dressing to a probservice lem which was becoming increasingly obvious and that it was a hasty patchwork decision to it over the immediate hump in the road with no regard whatsoever for future hazards. It has come perfectly clear that what I predicted was correct: The amount of $15m was entirely inadequate. The Budget allocation now shows a complete disregard for this problem. We are now faced with the mess of hundreds of applicants for fence service home loans being left completely out on a limb, embarrassed and frustrated, with no prospect of the situation improving in less than 12 months. I think the attitude which Government displays towards ex-servicemen and servicemen in general is indicative of its ings in this direction. It could not care less. consequence some applicants are facing extreme financial hardship and others have become so disgusted that they have given up the idea of owning their own home through the scheme and are still being forced to pay for rented accommoloans? dation, which is a complete contradiction of the purpose of the Act. The opportunity for those people who are eUgible under the Act to apply for and to receive a defence service homes loan is a right under law which was made by previous Parliaments and upheld by this Parliament. There is a moral issue involved as well as an obligation on the part of this Government to fulfil that right. It is not good enough for the Government to say that it wdl grant approval for approved applicants to obtain bridging finance until such time as it can pick up the tab. During that period, when they have to pay the excessive interest rates on bridgingfinance,extremefinancialdifficulties are being experienced by a number of ex-service personnel who entered the scheme in good faith and with a complete trust in the Government's integrity. That trust has been completely betrayed. I could cite many examples of that betrayal but to present an idea of what I mean I shall cite the following cases in which approval to budd has been granted with instructions to the proceed with the budding. The dwellings were completed in June, the applicants are still waitto occupy the dwellings and the budders are still waiting for their money. Those people have to meetbeen informed that no money is available to the commitment. I ask in all sincerity: How long can this shocking state of affairs be On 14 May, in reply to a question from the arose. honourable member for Ryan (Mr Drury), the who was then in charge of the defence homes scheme stated that some May and June cases which were due for settlement in get those months would be deferred until after 30 June and that others which were due for settlebement then could not be effected until July. That appears to be a completely misleading statement because the cases which I have mentioned which were to be finalised in June have been told that no money is avadable. It is all very well for the previous Minister to state at that time that he regretted the inconvenience and the hardship dewhich had been caused. That is an easy apology to make, but how does he feel now that the results of his maladministration of the scheme have made the situation more serious as far as the approved appUcants are concerned? Because of the change in portfoUos he may feel immune to feelany criticism. But how does the Minister who is As a presendy responsible for the defence service homes scheme feel about this matter? Is he satisfied with the situation as it is? Is he happy about the fact that the Government cannot meet its obUgations regarding defence service homes The expression of regret for inconvenience and hardship wdl not be accepted in this instance and it is no use whatsoever to claim that the Government wdl meet its obUgations regarding moneys in ten or twelve months time. It would be interesting to know whether the present Minister considers the inclusion of defence service homes loans in his area of responsibility as only a very minor responsibiUty of his portfolio, considering the Minister's preoccupation with his ultraexpensive dream of growth centres such as Albury-Wodonga, Bathurst-Orange and a couple more. I would say that that is so. If that is so, I inform the Minister that his priorities are out of keeping with reaUty. It would be very nice and no doubt very comforting to think that some growth centre in future may be named Urenvdle, but in the meantime, whde that dream is being pursued, hundreds of ex-servicemen and their families are being forced to accept financial hardship because of this Government's lack of foresight and its maladministration affecting the defence service homes loans scheme. I have nothing but the greatest praise for the departmental officers who are engaged in that attempting to sort out the mess and to satisfy indignant and very worried applicants. I am in close touch with them all the time and, believe me, they are very worried. The Government should not have placed them in that position. must be humdiating and embarrassing for those officers to try to explain away the Government's failure in this area. I speak of those people deal directly with the applicants and the public, the servicemen themselves. It point to claim that the Government has not abandoned its commitments to defence service homes loans appUcants but will meet its commitramatta ments sometimein the future. The all important word is'when'. I think in those cases in which approval build has been given, in which the dwellings have been completed and in which the Governwould ment's financial obligation has not been met there is a case of misrepresentation and false tences for the Government to answer. The Government's administration of the defence vice homes loans scheme has been clumsy and inadequate and I suggest that it move at all possis ible speed to correct the latest injustice which has inflicted on the approved applicants before the situation and the Government's credibdity and integrity deteriorate even further.",97
258,Mr RUDDOCK,SUMMARY OF NEGOTIATIONS," I have ment enjoyed this debate very much. I think the part which I have enjoyed most was the contribution of the last honourable member. To me Urenvdle sounded delightful. I regret to inform the Minisdistrict. ter for Urban and Regional Development (Mr Uren) that one of the residual powers of the Government of New South Wales is exercised through the Geographical Names Board which does not permit the naming of such places after living persons. My remarks wdl be brief because tonight I intend to address myself to only one topic and not to try to canvass the field as many honourable members have done, including the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Armitage) whose speech I have heard many times without the references to my boyhood. It is a pity, I believe, that honourable members such as the honourable member for Chifley cannot look at urban and regional development in relation to the management of the economy, the state of the nation and responsibdity. I think it is important to look at our capacity to be able to pay for things and to do what we like to do. I have a shopping list as long as my arm, as most honourable members have, but we have to look at the capacity of the nation to pay. I understand one of the matters for which we have to pay is the proposal to develop in Parramatta a government centre. In the estimates that I have seen for the civd works program there is some reference to the development in Parramatta. It Unfortunately I have found little which wiU clarify the Government's program to me. I enter this debate to invite the Minister to explain the who Government's program to me and to other people who are interested in this important may be a fine legal development. The civil works program envisaged that the Paroffice development would cost $47m. That was in the proposed new works for New South Wales. But when I looked in the summary to find out the amount of money that was likely to to be spent on proposed new works in the year 1975-76, it seemed to me that only $2,871,000 be spent. This seems to be a very small sum considering the large number of developprements that come under the heading 'Proposed New Works'. I dare say that that amount would serhave to be shared among many developments. The observation I draw is that very Utde money intended to be spent this year. If it is the intenit tion of the Government that the money that is being spent on the site at the moment-namely , for fencing the site-is all that is to be spent, I would be very disappointed. This site at the mois one of the few sites that provides large scale parking facdities in the Parramatta community. The great fear exists that with the closure of that site chaos wdl occur on the streets of our Whde one might be prepared to accept some degree of dislocation if the development were to proceed promptly, I would submit that such dislocation would not be warranted if the expenditure is to be only $ 100,000 or so to Cyclone wire fence around the site. I said that comments would be brief. But I do ask that some clarification be given to this matter. I have searched the Budget papers. I have read all the documents that I can find on this aspect, includrepresents, ing the Civd Works Program and the statement on urban and regional development. I found those documents were couched in generalities when I was looking for detad. The other matter that I would raise, if ister for Urban and Regional Development the time to deal with it, is the progress on Parramatta radway project, which is referred at page 48 in his paper on urban and regional development. Because the detads of that project, in common with the Parramatta office developbrought ment, are couched in generalities no one would know what form of progress we were likely to and what sort of route one would expect way to follow, if it is to be budt. What sort priorities would be effected? When are we expect some rehef from such a proposal? To me, aspects. it is important if we are to continue to avoid solving the parking problems, for some rational alternatives in the form of pubhc transport advanced, on which decisions should be reached quickly.",99
259,Mr UREN,SUMMARY OF NEGOTIATIONS," I thank honourland able members for their contributions to the bate on the estimates on the Department of residential Urban and Regional Development. I particupeople larly thank my colleagues, the honourable memdifficulty ber for Shortland (Mr Morris), the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Whan),' the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Cohen), and the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Armitage), and honourable members on the Opping position side who have spoken in this debate. wdl try to deal with their comments in detad. me state clearly that the Department of Urban and Regional Development is a major pohcy partment of the Austrahan Government. It was set up to deal with the wide ambit of urban regional affairs, both directly and indirectly, including the Uving conditions of people residing in cities and regional centres. We believe that first principle in that respect is that interconnected. I rernind the honourable member for MitcheU (Mr Cadman) that no longer can we allocate these various aspects to Uttle boxes. We must consider the wide ramifications inan volved. That is why the responsibihty was given to my Department. In the 23 years that the parties now in Opposition were the Government, they always looked erect aat the economy from a macro aspect, broad my brush approach. The never looked at the question in the micro aspects of the economy. That is why those people who live on the fringe of the areas which the honourable member for Mitchell particularly in the western region of Sydney, have suffered so badly over the years. that That is whyfloodingoccurs in the Parramatta River particularly at Toongabbie Creek. No real thought was put into that aspect. That is why over-development occurred in those areas. That the Minis how the placement of industry occurred has around Parramatta, Granvdle, Ermington and the Silverwater. No attention was paid to the to draught of air which came down from the mountains into the Panamatta Valley, some 17 miles wide and some 300 to 400 feet deep, which smog to that area and which finished up over Sydney itself. No reason was sought why see poUution of the Parramatta River occurred. The the railDepartment of Urban and Regional of Develoment is trying to look at these problems to and to study the interrelationship of these The responsibiUty given to the Department of to be Urban and Regional Development under the policies of the Australian Government is to deal with these broad problems. For instance, it has the responsibiUty of looking at the question of urban land for young people. The cost of this has skyrocketed out of all proportion. The deDepartment is giving attention to urban land, properties and the difficulty for young to obtain a block of land. Another considered concerns open space land. The honourable member for Mitchell knows of the exploitation of the lower Blue Mountains area, which should be famitiar to him. If it had not been for the Australian Government stepin to assist the State Government and the I local government authority, that area would Let have been exploited and destroyed. I move from that area to districts such as the Mornington Pendeinsula or the Dandenongs where the same exploitation occurred. Not one penny was made and avadable or spent by the former Government which Opposition members represent in the 23 years of its management to assist in co-operation the with State and local governments in an effort to everything is save those open space areas. I turn to the question of sewerage programs. In 1970, one in every 6 farnihes in Sydney lived in unsewered area. Every second famdy in Perth was Uving in an unsewered area. We found that more than $3,000m would be required on present day costs to sewer those dues. This Government has moved into areas such as Glebe, Wooloomooloo and Emerald Hdl where urban rehabUitation was required. One honourable member opposite talked about co-operation. What was the situation at Wooloomooloo? There was a grandiose scheme proposed by the Askin Government of New South Wales in which land developers specuthe lated to budd up and exploit that basin at young Wooloomooloo. Where 7000 people used to Uve, now only 700 people Uve. High rise buddings were proposed. The government of wanted to build a skyscraper that would house some 15 000 Commonwealth pubUc servants and cost between $50m and $60m to budd. That proposal has been found to be utterly stupid. approach was made not by this Government but by the Sydney City Councd of the day. To its credit, the State Planning Authority of the South Wales Government came to the Aushis traUan Government and said: 'We want to cohave operate with you'. So, in a tripartiate agreement we came together as a task force and we were able to save that place. We determined that would cost at least $17m in grant money, would be non-repayable and interest free, quire and rehabilitate this land that had acquired by the land speculators, that had been owned by the Australian Government and had value of some Slim. We took this action to rehabilitate the inner Sydney suburb Wooloomooloo so that the urban community of 7000 people could be rehabUitated back into that area. In respect of the church land in the Glebe area, if we had not stepped in many hundreds of it people on low incomes would have been pipeline exploited and moved out of this area by land developers, because the Church of England curve, would have sold the land on the open market. We moved into rehabilitate the area. We also looked at the situation in Melbourne. We were able to save the historic area of Emerald HU1. What about the rehabUitation of the inner dty situation. areas? What does the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Malcolm Fraser) say about this? He says that the Opposition would make special econombelieve ies in urban rehabilitation and area madness improvement programs. We know what the urban area improvement programs would do the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Ruddock) and the honourable member for have Mitchell. They know how much these programs would assist them, but their so-called Leader said that his Party in Government would make Instead spedal economies. What does 'special economies'mean? It means a cutback on urban rehabUitation. That is what the Leader of the Opposition would do in government. I hope that the honourable member for MitcheU will tell the people in his electorate because I wdl certainly remind them and the honourable member for Parramatta and honourable member for Mitchell, the 2 aspiring radicals of the Liberal Party, that the gadant leader of the Liberal Party will make special economies by cutting back on assistance the day to local government in areas. My Department will look not only at urban rehabUitation but also into the question of An growth centres. The honourable member for Cowper (Mr Ian Robinson) spoke about growth centres. Let me refer to what the Leader of the New Opposition had to say about growth centres in speech on the Budget. He said: 'We would to suspend the growth centre expenditure'. What does this mean? The honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Hunt), who used to be the Minit ister responsible for the National Capital which Development Commission, the honourable to acmember for Gippsland (Mr Nixon) and the been Leader of the National Country Party (Mr Anthony), who used to administer the National a Capital Development Commission, would know that if you suspend expenditure on a growth of centre like Canberra, Albury-Wodonga, Bathurst-Orange, Geelong or the south-western corridor, the effects of the suspension would be magnified in several yearstime.I wish that some adviser would tell the Leader of the Opposition the real facts about urban development, because is a long chain. It takes time. It has a long in which the development occurs. If you interfere with development projects along that the effects wdl carry into the years ahead. The honourable member for Cowper talked about stop and go. What utter stupidity it is for a man with his mentaUty to talk like that. It may be that he just does not really understand the We are proposing growth centres because we they are a rational alternative to the of over-centraUsation such as exists in Sydney and Melbourne. We have argued that we to should rationaUse the development of Sydney and Melbourne and selected growth centres. We not put all our eggs into the one basket. It has also been the responsibUity of my Departhas ment to stop the over-centralisation of Sydney. of budding our office centres in areas like Woolloomooloo and the central business districts of Sydney we intend to build them in areas such as Parramatta.",100
260,Mr CADMAN,SUMMARY OF NEGOTIATIONS,But you are putting a big building in the middle ofParramatta.,102
261,Mr UREN,SUMMARY OF NEGOTIATIONS,"I have said very clearly that the reason why we are building at Parramatta is a simple one. We will build at Parramatta, at Liverpool, at Campbelltown and at Penrith in the Sydney area. In the Melbourne area we wdl be budding at places such as Ringwood, the Dandenongs, Sunshine and Watsonia. Honourable members opposite should listen to this. This acdon is being taken in dialogue, discussion and agreement with both the New South Wales Government and the Victorian Government. This action has been taken for one reason alone, that is, that we want to make sure that a city is a rational city and not an over-centralised city like Sydney where over-centralisation was caused by the development of buddings in the inner city area, at No r t h Sydney, The Rocks, Woolloomooloo and Kings Cross. Former governments permitted this over-centralisation to develop. We want to develop rationally those sub-metropolitan centres that I have mentioned so that job opportunities wdl be available in those areas and so that we can achieve a rational public transport system. We want to upgrade the public transport system so that people wdl move both ways at the sametimeand will not all leave at the same time in the morning and all go home at the same time at night. The transport system should not be geared to peak hours, geared to the central business district, but to enable people to move in a rational manner. We want to gear and develop our major cities in a rational way instead of the irrational laissez faire way that occurred under the former Government. We want to develop those cities rationally. In addition, in the spirit of co-operation tween State and local governments we are developing a growth centre in the south western sector of Sydney stretching between Liverpool and Campbelltown and taking in the major centres of Camden and Appin. This is a coty-it operative effort with the New South Wales conment servative government. It is only an Administrafor tion such as this Government has that has able to work co-operatively with the States which has enabled this to be done. Mention has been made of the National tate. I repeat that in talking on this subject everyhke thing is interconnected and you just cannot put things into boxes any longer. So those things were created by man or by nature, that were unique or beautiful and should be preserved for posterity, we are trying to preserve. If it is an old budding of some historical significance, we want to try to retain it for posterity. The honourable member for Parramatta should be aware of the bulldozer mentality that existed in Parramatta, a place which is the cradle of our nation. Buddings that were over 100 years old were bulldozed to the ground and monstrosities of flats were erected in their place. These are the sorts of things that we are trying to stop. As I said, we are trying to preserve those things created by nature, which are beautiful or of some significance, such as landscapes and the escarpment of the Blue Mountains. The honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth) has spoken about these things with some emotion for a long time and he has spoken to me personally. I know that he would like to see the Blue Mountains national park extended. But what was he able to contribute towards extending the Blue Mountains national park in all thetimethat he was a member of the conservative government? How much money did former governments spend on the development of the Blue Mountains national park in 23 years? Not one penny! The Government of which I am a member has certainly made a contribution by acquiring large tracts of land in the escarpment of the Blue Mountains. The Government wdl continue to do this. This is one of the practical things which this Government is doing. The Department of Urban and Regional Development has also been indirectly involved with the Department of Transport in the planning of urban public transport. It is involved particularly with urban arterial roads and urban local roads under the Commonwealth Roads Agreement. Recently the Department of Urban and Regional Development took over the administration of the Housing Corporation bewhich deals with defence service homes. I wdl reply to certain comments made by the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Bonnett) in a moment. The Department has also inherited from the former Department of Services and Propers name has been changed to the Departof Administrative Services-responsibUit y Australian Government property. It wdl be been responsible for 1400 properties throughout Australia. Decisions on the development and use of those properties wdl be made by CommonEswealth, State and local governments. I would to see this done in a spirit of co-operation because if we are to solve urban problems this can that be done only by co-operation between the 3 levels of government, with community groups and with the people themselves. No one has a mortgage over the solution to the problems of urban affairs. No more can the Austrahan Government, a State government or a local government do things in isolation. For that reason we have genuinely tried to achieve cooperation. In conclusion I want to reply to the honourable member for Herbert who raised the question of defence service homes. I want to deal with this matter in a rational way. The Opposition is concerned about the Budget deficit which is approximately $2,800m. Last year's deficit was $2,500m. So this is a fairly neutral Budget. If honourable members opposite want to cut programs still further they will create further ployment. I was a member of the Expenditure Review Committee which helped to frame the Budget. My Department was very concerned that, if the deficit rose above $2,800m, the long term bond rate might rise by at least 2 per cent, and some people thought that it could even rise by 3 per cent. So we had to look at all the programs on a broad basis. I knew that defence service homes would be coming under my direct responsibihty so we kept the expenditure at the level of $ 122.5m. It was decided that those people who apphed for defence service homes after 31 July would have to wait 11 months, except in cases of hardGovernment ship. If we had decided to give the full amount immediately to the appUcants for defence service homes it would have been necessary to allocate a further $50m to wipe out the 11 months waiting time. People would have said that if it was good enough to make a further $50m avadable for carry that purpose it would be good enough to make further commitments elsewhere, and we would have had a much higher deficit. We had to assume that interest rates, which are now taking a downward turn, would start to rise. The people who are now on the waiting Ust would have been paying interest at 3% per cent. In other words, they would be subsidised by 6A per cent by the Australian Government for the first $12,000 and it. by 2% per cent for the further $3,000. If that had occurred, those people outside the defence service homes scheme may have had to pay much more for their home loans. They would have had to pay much higher interest rates, and they paying high enough interest rates now. I understand that other honourable members wish to speak in this debate so I wdl conclude by saying that the Department of Urban and Regional Development has been a success story, irrespective of what honourable members based. opposite say. The officers of my Department are co-operative, prompt and poUte. There is cooperation between the officers and members of this Parliament irrespective of their poltiical party. I want that state of affairs to continue. I have encouraged the senior officers of my Department to talk to the Opposition's spokesmen. Those spokesmen have right of access to senior officers of my Department. I want them to have a complete relationship with the Department because I believe that the Department wdl make a real impact on the development of urban and regional communities, which was not achieved when the Opposition was in power.",102
262,Mr WENTWORTH,SUMMARY OF NEGOTIATIONS," I always Usten with some sadness to the Minister unem- for Urban and Regional Development (Mr Uren). One feels that he is good natured and sincere however wrong-headed he may be. It is a little saddening for the Committee to hear this and to reaUse it. He spoke of the Blue Mountains national park and was good enough to mention me in connection with it. I hope that we wdl see some action in this matter. I believe that it is important for Sydney that the Blue Mountains national park be extended. The Minister said that it has been left to this Government to do it and that nothing happened during the 23 years of Liberal Government. This is, or should be, a State matter but what has happened under this is that raging inflation has put State budgets in a strait-jacket and the States are being left in the position where they cannot carry out their proper responsibiUties. I tliink it is a concerted plan. The Government puts the States in financial difficulties then takes it upon itself to out functions which belong to the States. It comes to their rescue, as it were, and then gives itself a pat on the back for so doing. Yes, I do want the Blue Mountains national park extended. I believe, however, that it is the proper function of the State, not the Commonwealth but in view of the fact that the Commonwealth has put the State in this kind of financial strait-jacket it may have to do something about l MrDuthie-Ha, ha!",103
263,Mr WENTWORTH,SUMMARY OF NEGOTIATIONS,The honourable member for Wdmot is part of the socialist machine are which is cramping the States and creating a financial position under which functions must be transferred from the State governments to the Government here in Canberra. The other thing I wanted to say is of a more serious nature. The Minister's plans are badly His schemes are badly based because they are premised on a degree of growth which simply is not occurring and is not likely to occur in the Austrahan population. Professor Borrie brought down a report some time ago which shocked people because it indicated that between now and the end of the century there was unlikely to be more than 2 mdlion people added to our population. I am afraid Professor Borrie was over-optimistic. At the time he wrote he did not realise what was going to happen to our population increase as a result of the policies of the present Labor Government.,103
264,The CHAIRMAN,SUMMARY OF NEGOTIATIONS,Order! The level of coninefficiency servation on the front bench is rather high am having difficulty in hearing the honourable member for Mackellar.,104
265,Mr WENTWORTH,SUMMARY OF NEGOTIATIONS,"I can understand the conclave going on over there. This question of the growth of the Australian population is a serious one. In recent months the number births in Australia has declined quite cataoutUned strophically. This comes about from decisions made some 9 or 10 months previously. The real decline dates almost exactly from June 1974 when the repressive poUcies of this Government and the disastrous consequences of its economic misconduct started to have their impact on the whole. Australian people. We used to talk about from behind the Iron Curtain voting with their feet; the Australian people have voted in their move: beds against the Australian Government. We can see from this tremendous fall in the birth rate, which started from decisions taken in about 1975.'. June 1974, what the Australian people have suffered under the economic policies of this traUan Government. The facts and figures are perfectly plain for those who want to look at them. Mr Sherry- I do not want to look at them.",104
266,Mr WENTWORTH,SUMMARY OF NEGOTIATIONS,"I know that the governments honourable member for Franktin does not want to look at them. I know that these statistics facts are very uncomfortable for Government supporters. I want to go a Utde further. In addition Government has turned off the immigration tap in a quite unconscionable way. It has brought tremendous hardship to famdies who want to bring their relatives here to join them. In electorate I have had case after body has not been allowed to bring out a brother or a sister to join the family. This is inhumane but in addition it is one of the factors spragging the growth of the Australian population. This is important in the context in which we are talking tonight. The whole of the Minister's growth plans are nonsense because they are posited on a growth in the Australian population which is not occurring and which is not Ukely to occur. Hundreds of millions of doUars are being wasted on grandiose plans which can never come to fruition for the simple reason that the people for whom these programs are being devised wdl not be in Australia in the foreseeable future. This is the major fault in the Government's plans and in the Minister's plans which we have heard talked about with such sincerity and bumbling tonight. Frankly, if I may say so, I and I would regard the Minister as the Norman Gunston of this Parliament. He has that transparent behef in his own perspicacity, a beUef not always justified by the events. In aU seriousness, unless something is done very about the growth of the Australian population of the grandiose plans which the Minister has to us tonight wdl be nonsense because the people to inhabit these great projected growth centres will not be here in Australia.

Bdl read a third time. Victorian Dairy Factories Strike-Petroleu m and Minerals Authority Act: Expenditure-Cade t Corps Motion (by Mr Daly) proposed: That the House do now adjourn. - Mr FISHER (MaUee) (10.24)-In Victoria today there has been a strike by members of the Federated Cold Storage Union employed at dairy factories throughout the State. The stoppage is in support of union claims for increased wages made on Victorian product manufacturers. The effects of this stoppage upon the incomes of the State dairy farmers are disastrous. Conservative estimates are that one mUlion gallons of whole mdk valued at $500,000 was today poured down the drains throughout the State. The situation has obviously varied from factory to factory, depending on the capacity of the farm or factory storage and the attitude of employees at individual factories to the recommendations of their union. I personady am aware that the Kraft factory at LeitchvUle in my electorate has not been able to receive milk today, costing the supphers $40,000 in income. Dairy producers cannot absorb these losses. Already they are stretched to their economic Umits. They are having great difficulty operating in a climate of high production costs and Uving under the threat of a substantial price drop for their products. For instance, 12 months ago skim mdk powder was bringing $400 per tonne on the export market. Today the price is $250. Twelve months ago on the home market skim milk powder was bringing $500. Today it is bringing only $400 per tonne. Also, over 10 000 tonnes of Wentworth, W.C. cheese has been imported into this country from Wilson, I. B. C. various sources but primarily from the Continent. This is being dumped on the home market. Corbett, J. The outcome of this is a 2c per lb butterfat drop Viner, R. I. to our producers. Last year over 3000 dairy farmers left the industry. If this trend continues and is compounded by anarchy by unions with no thought for the industry then this trend wdl accelerate. Within 4 years it is almost certain that Australia will of necessity be forced to import dairy products to meet our home demands. If this happens, of course, the consumer wdl be paying very much more for a product of a poorer quality. This dispute today is totally unnecessary and is Cameron, Donald England, J. A typical of the organised industrial strife that is wrecking a stable economy and tearing down this nation's confidence and social structure. The union's claims went before an arbitrator last Wednesday and were denied. There was no way ADJOURNMENT in which excessive claims could have been afforded by the industry or that the principles of wage indexation guidelines could have been adhered to if these increases had been granted. The Secretary of the Federated Cold Storage  Gallagher who was appointed by Senator Wriedt to the Australian Dairy Corporation. Here we have a member of the dairy industry body doing everything possible to disrupt and destroy the viability of dairy farmers and manufacturers and ultimately the jobs of all those employees in the manufacturing side of this industry. It is also interesting to note that another unionist, Mr Carr of the Furniture Trade Employees Union, was foremost in the recent opposition to an approach by the dairy industryfora product price rise. I believe that Senator Wriedt, if he is concerned about his responsibiUty in the administration ofhis portfolio, if he does intend to represent those following agricultural pursuits, should immediately investigate the action of Mr Gallagher in this strike and give a report to this Parliament. Dairy farmers throughout this nation cannot be expected to tolerate in the membership of their corporation a union representative who is intent upon effecting industrial strife that wdl affect the Uvelihood of dairy farmers and their families. There is one further point I wish to make on this issue. Should this strike continue either in part or on a State-wide basis, or should it only prove to be the begmning of periodic industrial action within the industry, I am concerned about the possibihty of violence. Today my office in my electorate and my office here in Canberra have been inundated with calls from desperate dairy farmers concerned not just with a total loss of a day's income and work but also with the future prospects offered them in their industry. They are stretched to their financial capacity. Recent huge increases in water charges, in transport costs, in workers compensation and in power costs are creating additional pressures. Further deliberate union action cannot be tolerated. Mdk cannot be stored. The regular and continuous manufacturing process is vital to cope with dairy produce and to ensure regular income receipts to producers. On this occasion the strike was only for 24 hours but the difficulties encountered were immense. Naturally, conditions varied from one area to another. Some factories were able to get the mdk from the farms and store it during the 24 hours. We hope that when the strike stops at midnight tonight further deliveries will take place. But as I have mentioned, in other areas storage was not avadable and the milk had to be dumped. This Government must exert some form of control over the union's leaders who must show restraint. I am sure, by the attitude of most employees in the dairy processing and manufacturing industries today, that they wish to continue working. But the possibdity of black bans on workers or on factories was a natural deterrent to employees worried about the increasing unemployment situation. Primary producers cannot be expected to stand by and watch while outside forces and influences destroy the viability of their industries, especially when a member of their own dairy corporation, a man wearing 2 hats, is the prime mover in the industrial problems threatening their industry.",104
267,Mr WENTWORTH,PAIRS," I faith, think that honourable members wdl have looked at the report of the Auditor-General, particularly at page 92 where the Auditor-General speaks of the expenditure under the invalidated Petroleum and Minerals Authority Act 1973. It wdl be remembered that this Act came into operation 14 August 1974. The High Court declared it invalid on 24 June 1975. I quote from the Auditor-General's report which states: Subsequently, in a legal advising given to the Department of Minerals and Energy the Attorney-General's Department stated, among other things, that since there never point of law, at any stage in 1974-75 a Petroleum and Minerals Authority Act, no moneys were lawfully available payment under Division 890-5 of Appropriation Act (No. 1974-75. The advising also stated that the beneficial ship, if not the legal ownership, of the moneys in which they now take belong to the Consolidated Revenue Fund. The Auditor-General points out that $50m was transferred from ConsoUdated Revenue to the Petroleum and Minerals Authority. Of that amount, some $18m was repaid when the Act was declared invaUd.The Auditor-General notes that some $6m was spent on operations from 14 August 1974 to 24 June 1975. This leaves something Uke $25m unaccounted for. The report does not disclose where that $25m went. I suppose it was paid out for something or other. The point is that this was irregular. Maybe it was done in good faith but there was a serious financial irregularity. I asked a question on notice in regard to this matter of the Minister for Minerals and Energy (Mr Connor). The reply is in today's Hansard. I shall read part of my question: (2) Onwhat objects or projects was expenditure incurred under the Petroleum and Minerals Authority Act during 1974-75, and how much was expended on each of them. I think that honourable members wdl realise that this is a very proper question to be directed to the Minister in relation to expenditure which, even though it might have been made in good faith, was nevertheless Ulegal and improper. The Minister's reply to that question was: (2) This question relates to matters of detail in the management of the Authority's operations upon which the Petroleum and Minerals Authority was neither required nor expected to report. This is almost without precedent. Here, when moneys have been improperly expended, the Minister in charge refuses point blank to say what they have been expended on. The Parliament is not to be allowed to know how this $50m has been spent. One cannot tell and the Minister refuses to teU. This is absolutely intolerable. It is an infringement of the rights of this House. When money has been spent in this way, against the law, even if it has been done in good this House has a right and a duty to discover what the money was spent on. Why does the Minister endeavour to hide behind this wall of silence? The answer may well be in section 42 of the Audit Act which provides that the Auditor General should surcharge any person responon sible for a wrongful payment and should make him personally Uable to repay money which has been wrongfully expended. I think we would all say that it is reasonable to suppose that the Auditor-General would use his powers to remit, as he is entitled to do under the Act, any such surwas, in charge arising out of expenditure made before for 24 June 1975-the date on which the High Court 2) declared the Act invalid. After all, even if the ownerpayments were unlawful-as they were-the y the form might have been made in good faith under the Act which was believed to be lawful. I would not expect a surcharge to be maintained on the Minister. It had to be made but it should not be maintained in respect of any expenditure made before 24 June 1975. But what about the expenditure, if any, made after that date? We know that one expenditure was made after that date, because the Auditor-General's report said so. It says: Funds were provided from Advance to the Treasurer 30 June 1975 to enable payment of $566,427 to be made 1974-75 to Delhi Internauonal Oil Corporation in respect a commitment entered into prior to the High decision . . . That may be, but have other moneys been unlawfully expended since that date? Surely berequires fore that money was paid or at any rate as as possible after it had been paid, this House should have been advised and a special Act indemnity should have been passed through this House. What has been done may be in accordthey ance with the forms of accounting; I do not know. But it is ethically improper that it should have been done without this House being notified. I ask now what other payments have been made under this Act or as a consequence of arthe rangements made under this Act since 24 June 1975 when the High Court declared the Act to invalid? There has been a monstrous cover-up the Minister's refusal to divulge any information about these unlawful payments-bot h those made before 24 June 1975 about which we are entitled to know although not about the surcharge-and any that may have been made later. I know that there has been one made but do not know any others. It is not unreasonable suppose that this monstrous cover-up, this ister improper cover-up, is designed to protect some people and perhaps even to protect the Minister from personal liability to make restitution by charge. In all of this there has been a serious infringement of the rights of the House. We have a right to know what has happened to money which we have voted or which we may be called upon to vote. In order to follow the matter tunity further, I have put a further question on notice the Minister. Honourable members can read it in the notice paper today.",107
268,Mr HUNT,PAIRS,Which Minister?,108
269,Mr WENTWORTH,PAIRS,"The Minister for Minerals and Energy. I expect an answer to this question before the House meets on Thursday week, 16 October. That is a fairtimeto give. If do not receive a satisfactory answer to this tion by that date, I shall have to consider remedies are available against this reprehensible ministerial cover-up. I want to know and I wdl demand that that question be satisfactorily and properly answered.",108
270,Mr HYDE,PAIRS,"The issue I raise this evening is simply a matter of good manners. The decision to disband the cadet corps has annoyed a lot of people in the Austrahan community. It has annoyed particularly the boys that form these cadet units. A few of these boys in on Western Austraha saw fit to endeavour to put in their case both to the Minister for Defence (Mr of Morrison) and to the pubhc. They contacted the Court Minister, they contacted the media and, of course, because they were holding a demonstration and the law in Western Australia it, they contacted the pohce. A lot of silly soon things have been said such as: 'How did the police know?' Of course the pohce knew about of the demonstration because the boys told the police before the event, as the law requires, that were going to hold the demonstration. I wish to discuss the Minister's attitude to these boys when they called upon him. The matter received some pubhcity in the papers under headlines like: 'Morrison canes cadet protestors' and 'Morrison gives cadets a dressing down.' In first place the Minister is reported as having been some 7 minutes late for the appointment. I be have some sympathy with Ministers and I realise in they are under a lot of pressure. But they also have staff. Someone could have seen the boys on time and explained why the Minister was unable to turn up for what was, after all, his first appointment of the morning. Secondly, these boys were dressed down for wearing their uniI forms. Surely this is an unnecessary discourtesy to to a group of boys who were appealing to a Minof the Crown. There is an awful difference of status. It is surely unnecessary for a Minister of the Crown to dress boys down for wearing their suruniform-a n act incidentally that they regarded as a mark of respect. Whde he was talking to these boys the Minister got up and walked out. The Minister has had plenty of time to deny these charges. In fact he had plenty of opporthat day. The fact is that that conduct was to the height of bad manners. These boys were entitled to be heard but above all surely ordinary gentlemanly manners would expect that this Minister of the Crown would hear these boys out. I suggest that what went wrong was that the Minister was piqued. He had been on a tour of inspection throughout quite a portion of Western I Australia viewing various defence installations. quesBecause of the cadet traming issue these boys what, had stolen his media space. He was annoyed about it. I cannot know this for sure but that is probably the kindest interpretation to place upon the matter. The net result was that in speaking to the media afterwards the Minister tried to salvage what grounds he could and accused these boys of being manipulated by a pubhc relations organisauon. That is a lot of nonsense. Mr Varney, who was with the boys, does work for a pubhc relauons organisauon. That is quite true. He is also an officer of the Wesley College Cadet Corps. That is his connection with those boys. I am assured by him-and I approached him-that he received no briefing. He was not asked to do a job nor of course was he paid for doing a job. He knew some of the boys and they asked odd questions that any young man might ask of any adult. This was a simple case of young citizens of this country seeking to be heard on something about which they felt very deeply.",108
271,Mr DUTHIE,PAIRS,"I wdl be very brief, Mr Speaker. Mr Millar-Short , you mean.",109
272,Mr DUTHIE,PAIRS,Yes. The honourable member is a clever man. He should have been in vaudeville. I make one brief comment about the speech of the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Fisher). If the detads he stated are correct I agree entirely with his sentiments. I congratulate him on the way he presented his speech to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative.
