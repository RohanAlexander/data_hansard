One of our major recommendations fishing policy statement for fisheries, aquaculture the industry to start setting its goals for regional get a national overview of what we want to do down some markers in that space, and then let goals. I think we need to do that. We have heard about statistics in fishing. statistics. ABARES have told the committee report on the state of fishing in Australia. It that we can build on it. But, of course, Commonwealth working together to build that fish. We do not have very good statistics about the investment in aquaculture. It would There is also the issue of having the take mentioned this. This is becoming a much bigger now very large boats of recreational fishermen women as well-with a lot of technology on their of what that take is being brought back. There taken but in a lot of times there would not opportunities to use that in some scientific Maybe some of the states have licences, therefore of that science work and to build knowledge We need to build on what is the take from recreational licensing or other survey ways is up to people so. The complexities of fishing in Australia committee has recommended that the Productivity fishermen, or fisherwomen, may have state with regulations from both areas; quota is traded some years without being used. I do not know-and on-whether the consumer of fish in Australia an effective industry or whether we do not. relation to that. The maritime park area was dealt with mixed, as one would expect. The overall issue strong issues proving that you should not have with the proposition that we now need monitoring and the science that is done over some reporting on the pluses of having maritime parks in the world. I am sure there will be a supertrawler became an issue while we were took place around Australia. Issues concerning guidelines because of public pressure became of our report we can grow fishing even is developing a national regional and recreational fishing which would allow fishing agreements. There is a need for us to with fishing and the fishing industry, and lay the stakeholders have input into reaching those We certainly do not have very good fishing that this year they had to bring down a national will be very good to have that sort of report so in Australia, we need to have states and the statistical base on the different species that we aquaculture, the research that is going on or be better to have some of that as well. from recreational fishing.

In Commonwealth waters, there are that go out fishing-there might be fishing boats, and there probably is not any record may be some regulations within what can be be any records kept or recorded for future way. So we need to do that. How do we do that? giving some income to be able to do some in that space. We need to do that in Australia. fishing. Whether we do that through to work out, but there is an urgent need to do need to be given some consideration. The Commission should look at this. State and federal licences; they may have to comply and sold; quota sometimes lies dormant for the committee could reach a conclusion pays a price for that or not; whether we have That was one of the recommendations coming in by our committee. The evidence we received was was that the evidence we received was not of maritime parks, but the committee came down to make sure that we prove their worth. The the next 10 years or so should bring us back parks-and some of the biggest maritime lot of work done in that space. The subject of the doing this report. That was a public debate that guidelines for fishing and changing those a discussion within the committee and we certainly gave consideration to that. However, principle and trying to find certainty when possible. For some people, 'precaution' means dollars on science to prove that there will be really about making decisions about risk, and letting kids climb trees or not letting kids for the kids. If they go too high, that is a do-falling from too high would not serve them judgements. We made recommendations in precaution means and that would be very good We need to also make sure that we understand Australia. We have some broader science in this on what would happen in some spaces if fish would certainly have a devastating effect on So we need to have work done in that space some preview of the future and what Though we have some of the overall pictures, regions and issues like that. Our current having national reporting of fisheries information decisions about where the fishing industry will into the future. This inquiry has been a good opportunity committee. We were able to pull a lot of complexities of our Federation and the way we and Commonwealth decision makers to drive Commonwealth take up some of these recommendations There are great opportunities for Australia. good people and good institutions. We just need and make sure we work it in a direction in the do that and I look forward to that occurring.",205
11,Mr MITCHELL,COMMITTEES," I rise to the Standing Committee on Agriculture, Resources, so eloquently outlined. I give the Chair the hotly contested thing to talk about where we this country love fishing. I know I love to get of frustration when you can sit on the water, stop at the shop and get a steak on the way fisherman probably have had similar experiences when you started out. The importance of underestimated. The population across the world good source of protein for people. With more health benefits-and maybe I should eat more-it and make sure that we capitalise on the world-class aquaculture because that will be the next phase it came back to things like a precautionary you make decisions, which I do not think is doing nothing unless you have spent a billion no adverse reaction to what you are doing. It is what risk assessment is. I write that down as climb trees. Kids climbing trees is probably good risk that you probably would not want to let them very well. So we have to make those sorts of relation to getting some guidelines on what for people making decisions into the future. what climate change will do for fishing in area but we do not have a lot of good science started to move because of current changes. That some communities and on the fishing industry. and we need to continue to look at that, gaining might happen with climate change. we certainly do not have them for different efforts are not enough. The committee felt that would be critical in order to make better go in the future. We need to build that base for us. I really enjoyed working on this good information together. Because of the govern Australia, we should pull together state this forward. I hope that the states and the to give us a direction into the future. Our sciences are so far advanced. We have very to coordinate that better, not let it get siloed interests of the nation. I am confident we can speak on this report, Netting the benefits, by Fishing and Forestry, that the Chair has tick for that particular heading because it was a should start with this. Many people right across out fishing-there is nothing better than a day come home empty-handed or end up having to home! I am sure you, Deputy Speaker, as a keen where you went home more frustrated than fishing and our fisheries stocks can never be is growing. We know that fish products are a and more people eating fish because of the is important that we protect our fisheries fisheries that we have, and develop our for the fishing industry. Ocean stocks are being depleted due to a range factors. We have weather patterns and water currents, and what A lot of the water currents start in the Northern Tasmania, and with that they bring the recruitment grow, and that we fish. In my previous life before the privilege government and my responsibilities related fishers work with the resources we have. It like, with competing interests for the resources amongst both the recreational and the commercial agree that we need to protect our fish stocks. future generations, but we all like access to have some wonderful fisheries: the scallop and good feed of snapper. They are usually on the It is not uncommon even for recreational fishers 500 boats lining up to get out and enjoy a day's catch. We have to make sure that we have the correct Most state waters where a lot of the recreational line from shore. Outside of that line are the not like cattle and sheep in that you cannot understand that they may be going from a versa. So we need to have guidelines and precautions with the stakeholders, to ensure we have regional that look after the fish stocks and that continue fishers and, importantly, a livelihood I have done a lot of work in the past with Bay and Westernport Bay netters-all a very on things and we did have some animated discussions. achieve an outcome to keep the resources available for them because it is their livelihood. I have do something that takes away someone's livelihood, commercial fishermen are second, third and fourth is what they know, and they do it very well. cautious in what they do to make sure that always improving their gear and their equipment, best to stay within the rules. The rules cause states that have different size limits and different you have licensees who run across state borders. fiveor 10-millimetre difference in different states. they protect their stocks for the future. climate change, we have to look at the Our aquaculture industry is very small What I can say is that the quality of the product countries produce. The quality of things like heard about climate change and the effects on that does for fish stocks right across the globe.

I heard the member for MCEwen talking fishing done there. I say to the member for over it, mate. A friend of mine, Jason Collins, just up the road from Townsville. He noticed family watching him. He had picked up a beautiful then put it back out there. The husband of wouldn't mind telling you that we'd have kept mate.

That is the nature of the were saying-they are always prepared to To get onto the subject of the science Queensland that we are surrounded by great Institute of Marine Science which, although in set areas. This was brought to a head recently inquiry. We had quite a few people, particularly having a boat of that size with a net of that on local stocks in a very short time. Minister Burke and Minister Ludwig went so heavily, because it is a science that lets us in the area of fishing when it comes to using a Rightly the government said we need to put while doing the science. We have to get the both at the Commonwealth and at the state and size limits, bag limits and these sorts of things. the weather and fishing impacts. We need to sustainable. If you think of a supertrawlerVictoria in tuna season, that is probably during some of the areas around Portland. If such boats thousands and thousands of people who rely on tackle shops and the like, would see their a boat of that size? Who knows. That is the the science is right. We have been able to start putting the science together. but they should read it to see how all sides of together and get some recommendations out that going to benefit our fish stocks from now into our aquaculture and grow these things we will both recreational and commercial fishing. It is in this bipartisan way to bring outcomes such as this report. These outcomes will benefit all I commend the chair for his great work in everything working.

The Australian the area and do the baseline research again, to those areas. That is what using scientific things. If I was to say anything to this parliament Northwest shelf. If we commissioned the Australian honest broker and do the proper baseline research doing anything we would have the information where the science should go. If we can get you will discover it. I think you will find will be very much on the side with that, We also have James Cook University, which the tropical world. If you are talking about tropical realm, because you have places like that where they are severely outfishing their James Cook University with the ARC, under Hughes, is one of the most published areas out of JCU is second to none worldwide.

Those are the issues that we to the table with the realisation that we do need and Terry Hughes will be very upfront with people like myself who do not-I put this in the degree, regarding the way that they can explain things to me, the way that they take risks. Also Mr John Gunn, and before him Dr Science, can explain things that way through to you. We also have the Great Barrier Reef Marine the challenges of having Magnetic Island, and one of the most beautiful places in the There are massive challenges that we have are massive challenges there that the Great have to deal with.

This particular Victoria, South Australia, the Northern When the committee visited Victoria, we visited we also visited the Melbourne Museum. Some taken by the committee were from BirdLife impact that climate change was having on bird the history museum and looked at the importance disseminating information. We had representatives BirdLife Australia, and they talked about the between them and other organisations. It would not even bother anchoring to protect it green zones should be undertakento make sure that they are exactly what research from the fishing public.

The committee also visited of that museum in collecting and from the Melbourne Museum and collaboration and cooperation that takes place was great to see the way children and families actively engaged in interaction within the related exhibitions. It was very pleasing to note change among those young people was very impressive. One of the most important and impressive learnt about citizen science and how it is working scientists within the broader community feeding institutions. It gave the committee a lot of approach to collecting information involving overall body of scientific information. BirdLife important role. They have several projects to and help them adapt to climate change.

The wetlands are located sea on a site that previously consisted of hypersaline level, which historically made industrial and Overdrawing from aquifers in the area had resulted intrusion into the aquifers.

14,Mr TUDGE,COMMITTEES," I rise to Representatives Standing Committee on Education we just want it to stop. As a member of the and note that the chair of that committee is stepped down as the acting deputy speaker. This was an important inquiry dealing prevalence of workplace bullying is not known-there how prevalent it is. Regardless of the precise know that it does occur and that it occurs needs to be done to stamp it out. We also know the individuals concerned. For many individuals, bullying can be completely debilitating for them and their general well-being. I will quote just one of the people who woman said: As a result of my combined two experiences I have afraid to go back and put myself in those situations resilient person but the stress that was caused by had an extreme impact on me.

That is the seriousness of the matter. very difficult subject matter to regulate against. bullying can be defined differently by to it. In that regard it is different to other we often heard the analogy of not having proper not having a safeguard on a machine. In some whereas you can easily see that a safeguard is not has caused an injury, it is more difficult in the bullying may occur without any witnesses-it may be things that are said from one person says may be seen by some as an ordinary managerial bullying. That is the contextual difficulty organisations raised that contextual The Victorian Automobile Chamber of It is a common experience for VACC members that have actually been either disciplined or just reported an employee in tears because he had been his workstation. The worker complained to the This is the difficult contextual element of this not occur anywhere, but it is exceptionally difficult contextual element that we had recommendations. Within that context, however, there was come together and present a unified report. agreement. There are many recommendations members all agree on. Some of that agreement discussion about the seriousness of the topic concerned about the need for national definitions greater clarity about what bullying actually some sensible guidelines to adhere to. We all for both employers and employees so that they all agreed that we need better educational particularly for employers-so that best practices particularly for smaller enterprises which their workplaces. We also agreed on the particular field. The coalition members are broadly in agreement not most of the recommendations. We do have significant. I would like to flag those. We disagree serious; to the contrary, we share the government's can have deadly consequences. But the coalition believe that the best way to address workplace compliance regimes but to create circumstances regimes and the regulations as a way to improve flexibility to adapt and share best practices. their practices. Our concern is that, if we are overly prescriptive, this as a box-ticking exercise rather than a genuine their workforce. We had submissions and evidence burdensome and is added to all of the other becomes a box-ticking exercise rather than something about for the productivity of their business. differences that we had with the government members. to another.

One VACC member asked to stop distracting other workers and return to human resources manager that he had been bullied. topic. Yes, it is deadly serious. Bullying should difficult to define in regulations. That is the to deal with as a committee in proposing our a lot of goodwill within the committee to try to In many instances, the committee has come to that the coalition members and the Labor was around, for example, the general and the need to do more. The committee was and codes of practice so that we can all have is so that employers and employees can have agreed that there is a need for greater services can get assistance and share best practice. We materials for employees and employer can be shared across enterprises, and are already dealing with so many other issues in need for accredited training programs in this with the government members on many if some disagreements. Some of them are quite not because we think the topic is any less view that this is a very serious topic that members on the committee fundamentally bullying is not to introduce inflexible in which employers see the compliance their overall organisation, giving them some That will give them a direct interest in improving smaller organisations particularly will see need to try to address this serious issue in in relation to this. If it becomes overly regulations that businesses have to deal with, it that they should be seriously concerned That is, if you like, one of the philosophical There were also several recommendations government members. One of them concerned practice that was put forward. We support defining more clearly for employers and employees however, that we do not endorse the draft code and territory governments. We are particularly seems to contain some elements that do not make for example. The draft code of practice, which form of indirect bullying, along with setting code also lists eye-rolling responses that possible bullying. Some of these, we think, are very subjective that, if someone rolls their eyes in a workplace, seriously examine that. We do not want to rolling their eyes and immediately run off to that diminishes the seriousness of real bullying we are in favour of a code of practice; we believe current draft is right and we think that we need parliament's formal endorsement. There were some other recommendations are quibbles rather than direct disagreements. bureaucracies where we think that, arguably, particular function could be done inside an or one of the employer organisations. So we dissenting report. With recommendation 10 we had some concerns economic benefits and positive working experience bullying. Again, the intent is good, but the be done through the new Centre for Workplace about. We think this is potentially a $12 recommending that this centre does that is the the ones that are dealing with businesses on a So we make some suggestions in our dissenting recommendations. In closing, I would like to reiterate the seriousness not agreed with every recommendation of the moment think that the topic is any less slightly different philosophical approach to where possible, government bureaucracy is possible to get on with their job. But, ultimately, where people can be free of bullying. We need we have outlined is the better way to go about it.",219
15,Ms ONEILL,COMMITTEES," I rise very important pieces of work undertaken that we did not precisely agree on with the the immediate support for the draft code of the concept of having a code of practice and what bullying means. We are concerned, of practice before it is finalised with the state concerned because the draft code of practice sense, in our view. I point out some of them is public, lists not providing enough work as a time lines that are difficult to achieve. The draft might diminish a person's dignity as a form of in their nature. If we are starting to suggest it constitutes bullying, I think we need to create a situation where workers see someone the regulator to put in a bullying claim. I think that does occur in the workplace. So, again, that we need one; but we do not think the to have it properly fixed before we give it this which we have some disagreements with. Many They concern the establishment of new we do not need a new bureaucracy but that existing bureaucracy such as Fair Work Australia express our concern about those matters in our about how you go about promoting the of having a workplace which is free from detail of the recommendation says that this should Leadership, which we had some concerns million white elephant, so we do not think right way to go; rather, employer organisations, daily basis, are the ones that should be doing it. report which we think would improve those of this matter.
