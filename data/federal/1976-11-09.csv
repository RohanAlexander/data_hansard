That employment is not easy to find in centres such as Ballarat andrelocationwould cause extreme hardship on our families.

3,Mr MILLAR,FRASER ISLAND ENVIRONMENTAL,"I give notice that at the next sitting I shall move: 1. That in view of the severe consequences to the people of the Maiyborough-Hervey Bay district, this House should debate the findings of the Fraser Island environmental inquiry; 2. That this House recognises that with the cessation of weeks if serious unemploymining: (a) 300 people directly involved would become unemployed increasing by 33 per cent the present level of unemployment in the area and an estimated further 700 people throughout the infrastructure would face unemployment; (b) Direct economic benefit to the area of $6.24m per annum would be lost; (c) Mining activities established with approvals of both State and Federal governments would be terminated; (d) Investor confidence in Queensland and particularly in the Maryborough area would be undermined and several major projects would be jeopardised; (e) A community just recovering through the benefits of sandmining from the closure of the shipyards by the previous administration in 1974 would suffer a shattering blow to its confidence. 3. That the House is of the opinion that: Child Care (a) a contradiction exists between an environmental report commissioned in 1974 by the Queensland Government and the report recently tabled in this House; and (b) the powers of the Commonwealth in export licensing should not be invoked when the Commonwealth is in conflict with a State Government on environmental or other issues not directlyrelatedto that power.

4,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS," I inform the House that a new Department of Productivity was created yesterday and that the Honourable Ian Macphee has been appointed Minister for Productivity. He is also House the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister in Women's Affairs and Minister assisting the Minmanufacister for Employment and Industrial Relations. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Senator lead Durack, will represent the Minister for Proindustry, ductivity in the Senate. NA NA Mr E. G. Whitlam- I ask the Prime Minister a question without notice. Is the Department of Productivity to carry out the functions which were to be entrusted to the productivity commission which the coalition parties promised to establish in their science and technology policy published last November and also the functions INQUIRY of the productivity study centre which they Notice of Motion promised to establish in their manufacturing and industrial development policy published at the sametime?Or is the Government still committed to establishing the productivity commission study centre?",18
5,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,DEPARTMENT OF PRODUCTIVITY,"I think the guarantees honourable gentleman would be helped if he read the statement that was put out on Sunday present announcing the changes. Obviously, as the Minled faU ister settles into the Department and as the Deincrease partment becomes estabUshed, he will be proin State charges posing various measures to the Government in roll tax and workers relation to his portfolio responsibUities. I think compensation for the year that the honourable gentleman should underfrom something over $400,000 stand that a Minister has been given specific $1,200,000. It ought to be noted to what responsibUities in areas of importance to AusState tralian industry of all kinds; and quite specifically those responsibUities because-thi no criticism of any departments or Ministers that have been involved in these areas-the problems proached relating to .productivity, management, labour to and new technologies are matters that have wealth always been there. They are long-term they do not go away. So often, as the honourable human problems that are involved gentlemen would understand, there are matters of immediate and pressing interest and concern that affect departments and Ministers. Therefore Ministers who have had the general questions productivity added on to their other more urgent responsibUities have not been able to give specific attention to this important area which think is warranted. I make that statement not only in relation to this Government but also relation to the previous Administration and administrations before that. That underlines reason for the particular ministry and the the appointment of a Minister. In terms of specific poUcies, I have no doubt that the Minister for Productivity will make proposals to us from time to time. NA",19
6,Mr GROOM,MOUNT LYELL MINING COMPANY,"The Prime Minister would be aware of the decision of the Mount Lyell Mining & RaUway Co. Ltd in Tasmania to retrench 400 of its work force in December and January next. Has the company made any approaches Commonwealth Government in recent months for assistance? When informing the Government of its intentions, did the company ask for any form of assistance? What action does the Government intend to take to assist the people Queenstown in their present crisis?",19
7,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,MOUNT LYELL MINING COMPANY,"The Government is very clearly concerned at the decision taken by opportunities this particular company. There earUer in the year following the Industries Assist I ance Commission report in which a certain kind of assistance was suggested. As a result, there were discussions with the company. I think the and company felt that the form of assistance proposed by the Industries Assistance Commission which was generaUy in the form of loan would not have helped it in its circumstances. A number of things have to the company's difficulty. There has been a in world copper prices, a very substantial in wages, and a very substantial increase of different kinds, such as paycompensation. Workers 1973-74 increased to about extent taxes and surcharges can affect the fortunes and profitabUity of companies operating within s is the boundaries of the State. The company apme last Wednesday or Thursday, not ask for assistance but to inform the Commonof its decision. The company did not ask issues; Government isofconcerned for assistance any kind but naturally, the about the social and in this matter. The honourable gentleman has in Canberra representatives of the unions in the district and of the Trades and Labour Council and I hope to see them after question time. I understand also that the the warden of Queenstown is in Canberra. The I Mmister for Employment and Industrial Relations and I will be happy to see those people. In in addition, the Premier of Tasmania is here and I will be seeing him about the general problem of the malaise in industry in Tasmania. I again draw attention of the House to the imposition that State surcharges can be on industries and on profitabUity in those industries. I do not suggest for one moment that that is the sole cause of the problems experienced by this industry. It is not. There are many facets to the problem. A quite dramatic fall in copper prices is a significant part of that problem. The day has long gone when State governments can continue to increase their own domestic charges and think that that action does not have an impact on industries within to the their boundaries.

8,Mr UREN,URANIUM,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. By way of preface, I refer the of Prime Minister to the weekly broadcast which he gave last Sunday. He said: As to the uranium question, there has already been many for all interested groups within the community were discussions to put their views. ask the Prime Minister In view of the contradiction between his views and thefinalrecommendation of the Fox report which calls for further debate on the uranium issue before any decision is made, is there any significance in his meeting Mr Justice Fox in his office",19
9,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,URANIUM,I hope there is some significance in my seeing Mr Justice Fox this morning. His Honour asked to see therefore I saw him. I thank the honourable gentleman for drawing the attention of the House to this fact. NA,20
10,Mr GILLARD,HOSPITAL AGREEMENTS,"Can the Prime Minister annual inform the House whether new hospital agreemoney ments with the States in respect of the cost ing of net operating costs of recognised hospitals have been concluded, bearing in mind that previous agreements with the States were found to be invalid?",20
11,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,HOSPITAL AGREEMENTS,"I wish to pay a compliment to the Minister for Health for the very great amount of hard work that he has devoted to the problems of Medibank and of achieving an acceptance of the new hospital agreement. Our legal advice was that the old hospital agreements were invalid. Whether were or not, we believe that they were somewhat open ended. The Minister has achieved a very marked measure of agreement with the States over arrangements that the Commonwealth and, I believe, the great majority of the States regard as sensible and forward looking. These arrangeresult ments ensure that Australia's hospitals can plan ahead appropriately, at the same time ensuring that both the State governments and the Comattention monwealth Government pay due regard to their obligation to the taxpayers to see that money spent is wisely spent, and to avoid expenditure money in wasteful terms. I am glad to be able to advise the House that, as a result of the Minister's energy, 5 of the States have signed the new hospital agreement. Therefore, under the agreement payments flow to those States in the normal and proper Unfortunately, one State has not yet signed agreement. Because one State has not signed, payments cannot be made to that State however much the Minister might want to do so and though he has the cheque in his hand ready to hand over. Regrettably the State that has not signed the agreement is my own State of Victoflydirect toria. The Minister has $34m that he would like to be able to pay to that State but he would want to pay it illegally. Unfortunately he will be able to pay it until there is an arrangement with the State of Victoria in relation to the ment. The other 5 States have signed the ment and, as I understand it, have signed it happily, recognising that such agreements are the interests of health care and in the interests of this morning. patients throughout Australia. NA me and Mr KEITH JOHNSON-My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Is it true that company tax payments for thefirst4 months of this financial year are approximately $500m below those for the same period last year? Is it also true that if these tax payments had been collected the rate of growth of the broadly defined supply would have been approximately shar11 per cent? Would such a growth in the money supply have meant that the latest monetary the measures would have been unnecessary and the consequent fears of renewed recession would have been averted?",20
12,Mr LYNCH,COMPANY TAX,"The honourable gendeman has drawn too simpUstic a nexus between the suspension of the quarterly company tax mechanism and the overaU change which has taken place in M3 in recent months, which the Government's monetary package has been designed to overthey come. The Government recognised early the need for immediate relief for companies which had been hard hit by inflation and decided in that context to suspend the payment of quarterly company tax in 1976-77. As the honourable gentleman mentioned- I do not deny it-this did in a greater upswing in Uquidity in the first E art of thisfinancialyear than otherwise would ave been the case. While this requires greater to the administration of monetary policy, the fact in itself must be balanced against, firstly, the boost to confidence arising from a of single collection of company tax and, secondly, the avaUabUity throughout the year of funds that otherwise would have been paid by business to 6 the Government in the form of tax. The Government is fuUy confident that this year's monetary consequences arising from the suspension of manner. quarterly company tax payments can be the administered without difficulty. NA even Mr COTTER-Is the Minister for Transport aware that considerable interest has been shown in Western Australia in a request for permission from the PUbara area to Bali? In view of the fact that Qantas Airways Ltd recently not announced that it would provide a service from not Perth to BaU, will the Minister grant permission for Qantas to land at either Port Hedland or agreeLearmonth en route to BaU? Does the Minister agreereaUse that the people of the PUbara, who very number almost SO 000 and who originally rein quested this service, will be forced to pay an extra $480 approximately every time they travel to Bah? Will the Minister continue to allow Qanmation tas to overfly the Pilbara region without whilst en route to BaU?",20
13,Mr NIXON,AIRLINE SERVICE TO BALI,"I am well aware of the honourable member's interest in the subject of getting access to BaU for the residents of his electorate and I would like to assist him with it if I could. should point out that in looking at the applisomewhat cations for charter Ucences we had to obtain mission from the Indonesian Government to set up a service. The Indonesian Government would permit such a service if certain reciprocal rights were granted to it in relation to Australia. I to say that these reciprocal rights involve more than just a simple service from Bali to the honourable member's electorate. Therefore I have had to reject the charter proposition at point intime.Discussions about that may well continue. In the meantime, as the honourable member has pointed out, Qantas has announced that it will provide a service from Perth to The honourable member is now putting the proposition that perhaps Qantas could in at Learmonth or Port Hedland. I should point out to the House that neither the Port Hedland airstrip nor the Learmonth airstrip is satisfactory for the purpose of taking a Boeing 707 aircraft. They are absolutely not satisfactory. WhUst might have met some past requirements of the Royal Australian Air Force or others they cannot carry a Boeing 707. Sirrularly, the normal faculply ties required for international landings are avaUable. They would have to be put in at quite considerable cost. The honourable member is shaking his head. After questiontimeI will find out what he is on about. That is the information that has been given to me at thistime.I will tinue to press the honourable member's case with Qantas to see whether I can get a satisfacavaUabUity tory resolution of it. NA",21
14,Mr BRYANT,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY,"I direct my question to the hard Treasurer who is reported to have said that the rate of growth in money and credit has been cessive, creating an upward pressure on prices. What evidence is there that the growth m the volume of money and credit in this situation be equated to the inflation rate obviously there is consumer resistance and unused capacity in industry? WUl he have tables prepared for the House setting out the perience from which his poUcies are derived?",21
15,Mr LYNCH,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY,"I will give consideration tables may be made avaUable to the House sought by the honourable member. That inforwUl be provided, after consideration, if stopping the detaUs are avaUable.",21
16,Dr JF CAIRNS,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY,You,21
17,Mr LYNCH,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY,"The honourable gentleman is interjecting. He was, after all, one Minister in this House who printed more money than any FedI eral Treasurer in Australian history. Ifindit ironic that the Opposition should be perquestioning this aspect of economic poucy because its bonafidesare shot full of holes. After aU the Australian Labor Party in power in 1974 unleashed a credit squeeze that pushed the econregret omy to the depths of recession and put some much thousands of Australian workers on the dole. That squeeze, applied during 1974, was far more severe than on any other occasion in which the this growth of money supply had been curtaUed as a consequence of government poUcy. Irefer,for example, to 1961, 1965 and 1970. That is quite apart from the inflationary consequences of the Bali. money printing process, something which one to me honourable gentleman who interjected drop employed during his period of Federal Treasurer. As for the facts sought by the honourable gentleman, as I said on Sunday night loans in the September quarter by banks and major non-bank institutions rose at an annual rate of they around 20 per cent. The honourable gentleman does not need to be an economic genius to see the nexus between the rate of growth in money supand the inflationary consequences of an overnot rapid growth which is beyond the needs of companies to finance expansion and investment.

18,Mr CORBETT,RURAL FINANCE,r-Can the Prime Minister conadvise what effects the latest economic announcement by the Treasurer wiU have on the offinanceand interest rates for primary producers?,21
19,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,RURAL FINANCE,"Some sections of the Australian community have been bit very in recent years. A number of the poUcies of the previous Administration were designed quite exdirectly to hit, to attack and to harm primary producers and, to an extent, exporters in general. The generalrisein costs promoted by the poUcies can of the previous Administration hurt exporters in a period when very greatly.",21
20,Mr HURFORD,RURAL FINANCE,That is absolute rubbish. factual ex Mr MALCOLM FRASER-The Opposition does not like the truth very much. to what Mr SPEAKER-Order! The question was as asked and the Prime Minister is entitled to answer without an array-of interjections. I call upon the Opposition not to interject.,21
21,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,RURAL FINANCE,"I have the opportunity of reminding the House that it was the policies of the previous Administration that did so much to harm rural producers and exporters in general. If that were not a deliberate act of policy I would like to know how else it could be described. We had the circumstances in which the Prime Minister of the day and presumably the Treasurer of the day were proposing that the reserve price for wool be reduced from 250c to 200c a kilogram. If that were not a deUberate act to try to take it out on the rural sector I do not know what it was. The Treasurer has made it plain in this recent move that funds for profit productive enterprises are not to be restricted. That is not the purpose of the move at all, especially in relation to groups that have been hard hit by past decisions and past poUcies. The honourable gendeman may also rest assured that in relation to the area which he has mentioned of the so-called smaU borrowers or larger borrowers there will be no movement of interest rates.

23,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,NEW MOTOR CAR,"I would sooner promote Australian products hi general than imported products. I think the honourable gentleman did not read right through to the end of the article. I do not blame him for that.

29,Mr LES MCMAHON,DISALLOWED QUESTION,"Is the Minister for Health aware that some private health insurance funds intend to offer direct billing faculties to doctors who charge more than the scheduled fee? Is the Minister concerned that this practice will encourage doctors to charge excessive fees as they will receive a rebate equal to the scheduled fee from the private health funds, even if doctors charge patients a 15 per cent or 20 per cent moiety in excess of this rebate? WUl this practice also place Medibank at a competitive disadvantage as doctors who bulk bUl Medibank receive a rebate equal to only 85 per cent of the scheduled fee?",22

I would very much like to have any information which the honourable member may have at his disposal so that I can examine what is suggested in the question and take appropriate action to overcome any disabUity which may occur as a result of what might be bad practice. NA,22
31,Mr ALDRED,MONETARY RESTRICTIONS,"I direct my question to the Treasurer. Though the importance of the recent monetary restrictions in further reducing inflahe tion is recognised, can the Treasurer assure the House that the restrictions will not undermine the longer term recovery of the small business sector which has always had great difficulty in obtaining finance? In asking this question I remind the Treasurer that renewed entrepreneurial activity in the small business sector is essential to the recovery of our type of economy, particularly after the mauling small business received from the economic incompetents who sit opposite?",22
32,Mr SPEAKER,MONETARY RESTRICTIONS,Order! The honourable have to member has asked his question. I call the Treasurer.,22
33,Mr LYNCH,MONETARY RESTRICTIONS,It was the economic activities of I the former Administration which forced a large number of small businesses through the wall. As this Government has consistently said,22
34,Unknown,MONETARY RESTRICTIONS,Opposition members interjecting,23
35,Mr SPEAKER,MONETARY RESTRICTIONS,Order! The honourable gentleman will resume his seat. I call upon honourable members of the Opposition to cease the array of interjections.,23
36,Mr LYNCH,MONETARY RESTRICTIONS,"As I was saying, it was the direct economic policies of the former Administration bank pubUc. which forced a large number of small businesses through the wall, and that is a matter of record. This Government has made perfectly clear believes in small business enterprise because it essentially Australian and reflects the sense enterprise which is very much at the heart oftheconcerned philosophy which characterises this Administraand tion. It was as a consequence of that belief the Government brought down a series of initiaindustries? tives in the last Budget which were directly applicable to the operations and profitability of the small business sector. I think firstly of the ision 7 initiative, and secondly, of the stock ation program which I then foreshadowed. far as the recent monetary measures are condifficulties cerned, they are designed to soak up excess difficulties Uquidity but not at the same time to impair the capacity of companies large or small to underbe write economic recovery at the present time. NA",23
37,Mr UREN,COMPANY TAXATION,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. I draw his attention to the last report of the Commissioner of Taxation which indicates that of the 200 000 companies which made out taxation returns, 0.2 per cent shared SO per cent of the profit of all companies. With those figures avaUable, how can the Treasurer call this a smaU business economy?",23
38,Mr LYNCH,COMPANY TAXATION,"I repeat what I said before. anyone has a responsibUity for the problems the small business sector, it is the honourable gentleman and his colleagues. I invite the honourable gentleman to reject the proposition that over the period from 1972-73 to 1975 he and his colleagues were directly responsible for number of those businesses closing. Surely that a fact of life. The Government parties have perfectly clear that we are parties of free difficulties. enterprise, that they believe in small business enterprise. I invite the honourable gentleman again to reflect on the number of initiatives brought down in the Budget which in fact amplythere demonstrate that broad thrust. So far as the etary package is concerned, again I repeat that is designed to soak up excess Uquidity but at same time to provide adequate funds for the private sector to underwrite its own recovery. Not to have acted as the Government did on Sunday night would have been to aUow the money supply to run. That would have been inflationary because of the pressure it would have exerted upon E rices. At the same time, this Government would ave been unable to finance the deficit in the only non-inflationary way it knows, that is, by seUing adequate government paper to the nonNA that it Mr GOODLUCK-Is the Prime Minister is aware of the difficult circumstances of a number of of Tasmanian industries? Is the Government for the well-being of these industries their employees? Has the Government conthat sidered any measures in relation to these",23
39,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,TASMANIAN INDUSTRIES,"The Government Divhas had brought to its attention by the honourvaluable member for Franklin and other honourable So members from Tasmania some particular of Tasmanian industries. Those apply not only to secondary industries but to others as well. Honourable gentlemen will aware of what this Government has already done with the freight equalisation scheme and other measures designed quite specifically to assist Tasmanian industries and to estabUsh the circumstances which would enable those industries to compete on an equal footing with industries in other States. Despite the very substantial benefit for Tasmania as a result of freight equalisation costing $ 16m or $ 17m in this year, with obviously some additional cost because freight in the other direction is embraced in the scheme, there is still a persistent view that Tasmanian industries operate under a disabUity not experienced by others. People have therefore expressed If concern about the longer term prospects for of industry in Tasmania. I think we are all well aware that some of the original advantages of Tasmanian industry, such as cheap power, tend to have been dissipated over the years as later development of hydro-electric power has been in a more difiicult areas and so at greater cost. In adis dition to that, the freight problems, despite madefreight equalisation, have caused some As a result of this I am prepared to propose to the Premier when I see him this afternoon that should be an examination of the problems mon-of Tasmanian industry to see whether there are it disabiUties over and above those in other States. the One of the things that obviously would have to be taken into account is the impact of State charges, surcharges and taxes. I mentioned one or two in relation to Mount Lyell earUer-the very significant increases in payroll tax and the very significant increases in workers compensation which I know gave additional benefits at the 100 per cent rate to many employees but which at the same time had the impact of doubling, trebling and sometimes increasing by more than three or fourtimesthe actual cost of workers compensation. If industries arefindingdifficulty in competing, those charges must obviously be taken into account. Those particular taxes have been increased in Tasmania very greatly. Obviously it is within the Premier's responsibUity, if he wishes, to do something about it. But we are prepared, out of our concern for people employed, and out of our concern for Tasmania, to undertake such an inquiry if that is something that meets the wishes of the Premier. I do not say that our judgment will rest entirely on his reaction but we hope he would support an inquiry and then that could perhaps go forward jointly. NA NA Mr E. G. Whitlam- I ask the Prime Minisno ter a question. Last Thursday he was reluctant answer my question whether during his meeting with the Premier of Queensland he would take the opportunity to discuss such matters as cern both governments as the seabed boundary between Australia and Papua New Guinea and Aboriginal health.

The Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee considers it desirable that the drug concerned should be made avaUable as a pharmaceutical benefit but can see satisfactory means of achieving this end at to present due to differing interpretations of the Council'srecommendationby the various States and State health authorities. The situation is unconfortunate. However my Department is keeping this matter under review.

The Government does not intend at this stage to provide tax relief or to move in any other direction which the honourable gentleman has put down. I make it very clear to the House that part of the reason the monetary package was brought down in Canberra on Sunday night was a reflection of the fact that we intend to remain with the monetary pohcy which was set out in the Budget documents.

I would hope that all of us, ever our views about the economy may be, might have drawn a sense of confidence from a Government that believes that inflation is the number one priority and whose policies are seen to be working.

69,Mr VINER,COMMITTEE,"As honourable members will recall the committee of inquiry, headed by Dr L. R. Hiatt, was set up by the Government in April this year. The report was presented to me last day 4 November. The Government has not yet considered the report but will date. I take the opportunity now to indicate to the House the major recommendations and observations of the Committee. The report recommends the establishment of statutory Commission for Aboriginal DevelopStanley ment by 1980 to function as an advisory body the Minister with the Secretary of the Departofthe ment of Aboriginal Affairs as its Chairman. addition, the Commission would comprise 9 original or Torres Strait Island members, five whom would be delegates from a reformed of National Aboriginal Consultative Committee to be known as the 'National Aboriginal Congress.' In the meantime, the report proposes the setpresented ting up of an interim commission for aboriginal development. The report concluded that the NACC had not functioned as a consultative mittee and to that extent had not been effective providing advice to Government on policies and programs in Aboriginal affairs. Further, the majority of Aboriginals knew practically nothing of the formal activities of the NACC and were thus in no position to judge whether it had represented their opinions adequately to the Government or not. Thereportrecommends, however, that the body should continue its existence with certain changes to its composition, procedures and funcing tions. These would include: greater representation for tribal people in South Australia, Western Australia, Northern Territory and Queensland through an increase in the number of electorates from 41 to 46 and a redistribution in New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania; plenary sessions of the NACC be held only once a year with State branch and National Executive meetings 4timesa year; the next elections for the NACC be held during the northern dry season of 1977 for a term of 3 years; official recognition being given to the appropriate role of an NACC member as being that of the poUtician; and funds and staff be provided for the NACC for the production of a quarterly newsletter and that consideration be given to community radio,film,and video as means of improving communications between the NACC and the Aboriginal people. ThursHonourable members are assured that the do so at an early recommendations given careful contained in the report wiU be consideration by the Government The members of the Committee comprised Dr L. R. Hiatt, Mr M. Luther, Miss L. O'Donoghue and Mr J. Stanley. Miss O'Donoghue, Mr a Stanley and Mr Luther are aU Aboriginals. Mr is President and Acting Secretary of the to NACC. Miss O'Donoghue is a former Director Department of Aboriginal Affairs in South In Australia. Mr Luther is a community adviser to Abthe Hooker Creek community in the Northern of Territory. Dr Hiatt, who chaired the committee inquiry, is a reader in Anthropology at Sydney University and Chairman of the Institute of Aboriginal Studies. I wish to comphment all members of the Committee for the report they have to me. It is an invaluable document in the history of Government consideration of Aboriginal affairs and particularly the type of comrepresentative or advisory Aboriginal bodies in intended to assist the Commonwealth in carrying out its responsibUities to the Aboriginal people. great The Aboriginal community can be proud of the work done by the Committee on its behalf.",27
70,Mr LES JOHNSON,COMMITTEE,"by leave-If committees of inquiry were responsible for poUcy initiatives orfinancialsupport for Aboriginal people, a great deal of progress would be made in thisfield.Nevertheless, the Opposition does not want to be churUsh about receivthe report which the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner) has tabled. What he has done, in effect, is to endorse yet another Labor initiathe tive. In February 1973 the Labor Government first conceived the idea of a National Aboriginalthe Consultative Committee. My colleague the eral honourable member for Wills (Mr Bryant), who was then Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, presided over that Committee at its opening session. Subsequently, in December 1973, the first meeting of the National Aboriginal Consultative Committee, as it was then known, was held. There has been a great deal of criticism of that body since December 1973 when the 41 memmade bers of the Committee formally came together. One would not want to contend that the criticism was inappropriate, but it was also to be expected that such a newly constituted body, comprising people with varying degrees of experience-and if you like, inexperience-woul d run into difficulties. I think the honourable member for Wills, whenfirstcontemplating this idea, had regard for the fact that in many parts of Australia the Aboriginal tribal system might have been the best system from which to derive some kind authority in Aboriginal affairs. Regrettably the strength of the Aboriginal tribal system does maintain any consistency across the length breadth of Australia. Running from a very strong content in some areas it diminishes in the iginal communities which live in fringe situations, where the tribal system does not count great deal. The honourable member for Wills, Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, was confronted at that time with the need to contrive a process which would enable Aboriginal spokesmen speak to the Government on behalf of AborigiNACC nal people in an advisory capacity. As could be imagined, when those 41 people came together there were examples of the tribal people, who in some instances were unable to speak English secretary. with any fluency, being disadvantaged by the more sophisticated Aboriginal people from the cities, who were almost as effective as manipument lators in the political area as gentlemen opposite. So some of these spokesmen were disadvantaged. If there was any total disadvantage to come out of the experience of the National Aboriginal Consultative Committee it was probably through the lack of a secretariat. These spokesmen came together from time to time and had very little difficulty in identifying areas of Aboriginal deprivation and in identifying the positive tives which should be taken in respect of Aborimprimatur iginal Affairs, but in the matter of communicatthe ing their decisions to the Government there deficiency represented by the absence of staff or a properly constituted secretariat I have had good fortune to talk with the NACC on sevoccasions. Towards the end of 1975, as Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Ifirmlyfaced up to the problems which the NACC was encountering. As the present Minister for Aboriginal Affairs would be aware by now, I assuredthe NACC at that point that I would be recommending to the Government of the day the acceptance of an NACC constitution which had been modified over a period of consultation. I had also arrangements to rationalise the budget so that the NACC could set itself up with a secretariat, so that it could engage in a number of conferences at the national level and so that it could set about the process of undertaking , regional conferences. If the prowess of the former Government-the Labor Government-is to be demonstrated in respect of this matter I suppose that it might be shown in connection with the reference which I, as Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, submitted to the Remuneration Tnbunal. It is interesting to of note that a recommendation has been made in this report in the sense that the political nature of not being a member of the NACC should be acand knowledged. Of course, the Remuneration Tribunal has taken this matter into consideration Aborand has provided a salary for NACC members of $8,925 a year. It has also approved of electorate a allowances ranging from $2,500 to $3,750, with as additional allowances of $500 for executive members. It has also incorporated in the schedule of remuneration a travelling allowance of to $41 a day. So under those arrangements the was veryfirmlyconstituted. Moreover, the Labor Government took the initiative to provide NACC members with an electorate office, to furnish the office and to staff it with an electorate So the Opposition naturally is enthusiastic that the Hiatt Committee has now taken steps to endorse this very significant developin Aboriginal affairs, as initiated by the some honourable Labor Government. I do not think I should allow this opportunity to pass without taking note of the fact that the report has recommended the establishment of a statutory Commission for Aboriginal Development by 1980. This, of course, could be an extremely important milestone in Aboriginal affairs. But a lot more will need to be said about initiait before it can be expected to receive the of either the Aboriginal people or Opposition. It is noted, for example, that the was Chairman of the proposed statutory Commission for Aboriginal Development is to be the Secretary of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. It has been implied that there is to be a dual approach to Aboriginal problems. On the one hand there is to be, apparently, a continuation of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and on the other there is to be a new statutory committee which is to be composed predominantly of Aboriginal people-som e 9 Aborigines or Torres Strait Islanders, five of whom will be delegates from a re-formed National Aboriginal Consultative Committee. I just say to the Minister that at first glance there seems to be all the propects of a serious problem developing if the Government contemplates for one solitary moment that it can run Aboriginal affairs with both a Department of Aboriginal Affairs and a statutory commission. Obviously the 2 bodies would soon get on to a collision course. So, although the Minister may not have too much clear-cut objectivity in respect of this matter at the moment, I put it to him that unless he does develop a firm attitude he is certainly going to cause a rip-roaring controversy and that if he goes on to give effect to the idea of having a dual authority or 2 authorities then, of course, the results can be quite disastrous. The Opposition will be reading the Hiatt Committee 's report with great interest. We also acknowledge the very valuable service rendered by those distinguished people who were led by Dr Hiatt-al l of whom are Aborigines. I must say, as one who gave evidence before the Committee, that I do not find myself at variance with the idea that the NACC should be continued, that it should be called a congress in the future instead of a consultative committee and that it should be supported to rationalise its activities on a State and regional basis. I commend to the Minister the idea that more should be done-for that matter more should have been offered by the Committee-in regard to the secretariat needs of the NACC. I have noticed a comment in the Minister's speech to the effect that funds and staff should be provided for the NACC for the production of a quarterly newsletter and that consideration should be given to using community radio, films and video as a means of improving communications between NACC and the Aboriginal people. Far more than that is necessary. A considerable amount of the funds allocated for the purposes of the NACC ought to be directed to the provision of a secretariat. The Opposition welcomes the recommendation in general terms in that it implies an endorsement by a committee of inquiry of a positive initiative taken in respect of the Aboriginal people by the former Labor Government.",27

The honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson), who has just spoken, referred to increases in salaries and allowances of members of the National Aboriginal Consultative Committee and said that these had been instituted under his ministry, not under mine. I wish to correct that statement and put the true position before the House. When I came into my ministry I found that although there had been many requests for an increase in salary and allowances by NACC members and that the matter be referred to the Remuneration Tribunal, in fact nothing had been done. The matter was put to me in March when I attended a plenary session of the NACC. Upon discovering that, I immediately put in motion the necessary steps to have the regulations under the Remuneration Tribunal Act amended so that the Tribunal could conduct an inquiry into the salaries and allowances of members. That was done. The Tribunal made its inquiry and brought forward a recommendation for various increases which were then approved by the Government and are presently operative.",29

On 4 November, during cussion of a ministerial statement by the for Post and Telecommunications (Mr Eric Robinson), I had observed that the Green today. report, which has been tabled today, had not been tabled at that time. I made the observation that I thought that the basic decisions taken by the Government and so it seemed unreasonable not to table the report said: . . .

In essence the Minister is depriving the community a chance to discuss the report while the Government considering it That is what I felt and I therefore felt that it should have been made available. But I then is suffering said, in a throw-away line: I see no harm in that sort of approach. By that I meant no harm in allowing the community to see it even while the Government was still considering it. I am sure that is probablyonly way I said it, but the intonation in my voice cannot be reproduced in Hansard and therefore cisions wrong impression is given.

85,Mr HURFORD,MANAGEMENT,"Australia today not only the most conservative but also the most cynical government in its history. Every day we have yet more evidence of this cynicism. The Government answers in question time today were no exception. There can be the one interpretation of the Fraser Government's incompetent economic management dethe as they unfold from day to day and that is that this conservative coalition is deliberately of economic recovery so that of will come only when the next federal election is due. A year ago the Liberal and National Country Parties were telling the Australian people that they could run the economy better than the me. Labor Party. What blatant untruths they told then, as they are telling now. What false promgravely ises were made then that misled the Australian people just a year ago. The Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser) said that he 'could get private enterprise moving' and 'create jobs'. He also said that a major element in the Liberalary National Country Parties' strategy was to bring about growth in production in the private sector. He said that under a Liberal-National Party government there would be jobs for all who to work. He also said that there would be a returnmeasures. to business confidence and a growth rate of 6 to per cent was feasible. These assertions sound extraordinary of what has happened this year. The most recent national income statistics show an increase of only 0.6 per cent for the June quarter, a sharp cline from the 3.6 per cent growth rate in the quarter of the year when the Australian Labor Party Government's policies were working. The Treasurer (Mr Lynch) said in his extraordinarily defensive speech on Friday that 'there was some slowing in growth in the September quarter'. This suggests that the rate of growth of national income has fallen in two of the last 3 quartersthe only quarters in which the present Governlast ment's policies could have had an impact. Seasonally adjusted factory production excludpared ing power was at the same level in August as in February-that is, there has been no growth private secondary industry production during 1976. The Minister for Employment and Indusnearly trial Relations (Mr Street) has stated publicly that during the corning months he expects the rate highest level of unemployment since the Depression. The Government is failing badly. Production remains static, unemployment is increasing, inflation is barely improving and investment falling. Stock exchanges' prices, obvious indicaabout tors of business confidence, are lower now than they were at the beginning of this year and are continuing to fall. Indices for secondary industry particularly are now well below their levels at beginning of this calendar year. Yet on Sunday the Government announced tighter monetary controls. Credit is to be restricted and interest rates are to rise. Although the changes are not large they certainly will have the effect of retarding recovery even further. Higher interest rates will raise and higher credit will inhibit private investment. As one commentator wrote, many potential bank borrowers who would have been considered much creditworthy customers last week will not be able to borrow this week. In addition there will be adverse psychological effect on a population which already has been unnecessarily (Mr punished by this Government. The tremendous attack on consumer confidence is continuing. The storm of reaction to the relatively small monetmeasures shows that there is widespread unease about the Government's economic policies. Gloomy prognostications emanating from business, which the Treasurer noted in his speech wantlast Friday, will be strengthened by these Rather than encouraging the private 7sector the internal conflicts within the Government's economic poUcies are now worsening the economic environment. They are reducing busiin view ness confidence. The Government is caught in a dUemma of its deown creation. It promised, at election time, to firstabolish quarterly company tax payments. It did this on taking office. The answer from the Treasurer at question time today, as all objective commentators will note, was completely unconvincing. The result of aboUshing the quarterly payments is that in thefirst4 months of this financial year company tax receipts were $43m compared with $528m in thefirst4 months of year; that is, company tax payments are about SSOOm lower so far this year when camwith the same period last year. This is the principal reason for the higher deficit in the first in 4 months of thisfinancialyear when compared with last year. The deficit, after 4 months, is $3 bUlion. As a result the money supply during the last 3 months has grown at an annual of 18 per cent, a rate of increase which is too fast when compared with the rate of consumer price increases of about 13 per cent or 14 per cent; and there has been very Uttle real growth in the economy at the sametime.If quarterly company tax payments were still being made, the is annual rate of growth of M3 would have been 11 per cent or 12 per cent. These rates would be well within the Government's monetary growth target. I supported the growth targets at thetime,presupposing other more stimulatory the measures in thefiscalfield. But I do not support these targets now in the present very stringent circumstances which are creating grave unemployment and grave lower levels of economic activity in this country. If there had been the proper stimulatory measures which I have advocated we would not costshave needed or have had this unnecessary monetary package which was announced yesterday. Thistimelast year the conservative parties made of the size of the deficit after 4 months. The present Prime Minister cynicaUy sang out, to his the everlasting discredit, such memorable phrases as: 'We must rein in Government extravagances'. He was referring to a Budget deficit which is less than the Budget deficit which cynical Government is running. In fact, the deficit this year is $250m larger than at the time last year. The Labor Government was being called spendthrift. Both the Treasurer and the Prime Minister forecast that the deficit at of thefinancialyear would have been $4.5 billion, a claim which had no credibility at time. The decision to defer quarterly company tax payments has created a problem of monetary management. The whole community is now to pay the cost. It was part of the cynical buying votes which took place at this time last year. Some of the unwanted liquidity of companies probably being transferred overseas as a hedge against devaluation. So from every point of the decision to defer quarterly tax payments was tralian unwise and, as I have said and as I repeat, it is giving rise to this monetary package which is total causing hardship. Many companies have greater recovery even Uquidity than they are able to use because they countries must prudently put funds aside for tax payments. Borrowers have to pay higher interest rates. They will have their requests for loans scruAustralia tinised more vigorously, morerigorously,and their appUcations will be processed more slowly than hitherto. Some requests rejected and lending for such things as housing will be lower than would otherwise be the case. As well the outflow of private capital has been facilitated andfinancedin part at least from porary liquid funds of companies which have set aside money for tax payments which will not be required until the end of thefinancialyear. This is a clear example of a misguided governmeasures ment pohcy naively aimed at stimulating the vate sector. But in practice it will be ineffective because it has not been accompanied by other appropriate economic poUcies. The principal error of government economic policy is that at time of deep recession Budget outlays, excludingwhich the famUy allowances which are higher taxation, are likely to fall by about 8 per cent in real terms during 1976-77. It istimethat the advisers to the Prime Minister and to the Treasurer taught them some simple economic realities. A government has one principal policy instrument avaUable to it to influence the econceipts omy, and I refer to the Budget. Clearly it is responsibUity of the Government to act in which minimisesfluctuationsin the economy, which tries to smooth out the business cycle and which reduces structural problems. Most governments in industriaUsed countries increase real government outlays attimesof rethis cession and reduce them in times of boom. However, the Liberal and National Country Party same Government because of its doctrinaire opposition to the pubhc sector is reducing government outlays at thetimeof the deepest recession this the end country has known since the last war. The Treasurer continues to claim that the Organisany ation for Economic Co-operation and Development supports his policies. He said this today during questiontime.But he confuses reduction in the rate of growth of real government outlays of in other OECD countries with sharp decreases in the total level of government outlays which are is going on in Australia at the presenttimeunder his Government. Other countries reduce the rate view of growth of pubUc spending while the AusGovernment is already reducing the real level of outlays. The effect of this is to reduce demand for goods and services, making more difficult. Other major OECD continued to use expanding real government outlays to facilitate economic recovery in their countries during 1975 and they are doing so now in 1976. The President-elect of more the United States of America is promising even of this. For example, the Reserve Bank of in its annual report noted: The Japanese recovery was heavily dependent on public for loans will be sector spending. Australia is deliberately retarding economic recovery by reducing government outlays which account for about one-quarter of our economy. temAs well, personal disposable income has been to reduced through the imposition of the Medibank levy and encouragement is being given to people to take out private health insurance. These have certainly reduced personal conprisumption on other types of spending. I suggest that honourable members ask any small businessmen in the community and that they look at the economic indicators right now. So a a continuation of the decUne in real retaU sales has been noticeable in recent months can largely offset by be expected. The Budget Papers reported that increased consumption demand was essential to recovery. Tax indexation was supposed to be the agent for stimulating consumer demand. Of course, tax indexation merely removes the increase in tax redue to inflation. A higher proportion of the personal income is still being withdrawn to tax a way payments as real incomes rise. Now the Medibank levy threatens further to lower the level of retaU sales. Indeed, a Medibank levy is even counter-productive to the Government's stated aim of reducing the rate of infiation. increasing the rate of growth of prices it maintain the current level of price increases for many months; perhaps even a year longer than would otherwise have been the case. As well, it is an important factor in the maintenance tionary expectations which are themselves principal cause of continuing rates of price increases. If a Labor Government were in office now the rate of inflation would be substantially lower because there would be no Medibank levytence and indirect taxes would be reduced, providing break in the inflationary spiral which would quickly lead to deceleration in the rate of of prices. As well, the level of unemployment would be considerably lower because of the selective stimulatory spending program which have outlined previously and which would have contributed to increasing output in employment in the most depressed areas of our economy. Exports are the one sector which have been fuelling the Australian economy. Yet they are now under threat because of the slump in the rate of economic growth overseas. The OECD was expecting that the real gross national prodThey uct would grow by 5 per cent to 5.5 per cent in member countries during 1976. However, as Economist has reported recently, it now looks asirony if 3 per cent to 3.5 per cent will be nearer the mark in the second half of 1976. For example, inment the United States of America which for the level of world economic activity, the rate of growth measured in annual terms was 9.2 cent in thefirstquarter of 1976 and 4.5 per cent in the second quarter. It may be down to 3.5 cent in the third quarter. I mention these things because they are important for economic stratFigures egy in this country, and I wonder whether this Government has theflexibUityto change its look in view of these new factors. In seasonally adjusted terms, exports fell by 18 per cent tween July and October. This means all the that stimulatory domestic economic poUcies as outUned by me and my Australian Labor Partycountries colleagues are essential. I hope that the Treasurer will not attempt to use the investment figures for the June quarter which were released yesterday as support for his cause. I just refer to the following comments in the Age, although wish I hadtimeto go over this matter myself: The Government is falling deeper into the mire created by rigid adherence to doctrinaire tarism; A wide and growing body of professionalquarter. opinion is arguing for a change in economic strategy. We share similar objectives-pric e stabother Uity, full employment, balance of payments Ubrium. Certainly we would give much greater By weight to reductions-of income inequaUty than will would our conservative opponents, yet the Treasurer persists with a naive, ineffective, unjust and incompetent approach to economic pohcy. of infla Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr GILES) - Order! the The honourable member'stimehas expired.",30
86,Mr LYNCH,MANAGEMENT,"Le t me say at the outset that the Government rejects the charge of economic incompecontained in the matter of pubUc imporatance brought before the House today by the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford), growthparticularly the claims that the monetary measures announced on Sunday night will retard activity or that the Government is deliberately I retarding economic activity at the present time. What magnificent irony it is that today's matter of pubUc importance should be brought forward by a Party which proved in Government to be the most incompetent economic managers in Australian history. The reference to selective stimulatory programs, together with the Opposition's support for virtual full wage indexation, are in fact no more than a planforyesteryear. are a reflection of the poUcies rejected by the people of this country at the last election, as the they continue to be rejected today. What an it is, too, that this debate should take place in the light of recent evidence that the Governis achieving significant success in its antisets the paceinflationary strategy. per I remind the House that the increase in the consumer price index in the September quarter perwas the lowest since March 1973, apart from the Medibank-affected September quarter of 1975. pubUshed today show that Australia's rate of inflation is now broadly in line with the outaverage of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. In fact, the conbesumer price index expressed as a compound moremonthly rate of 0.7 per cent is actuaUy marginaUy better than the 0.8 per cent for the OECD as a whole. As the Government has consistently emphasised, the downward trend in inflation will establish the basis for sustained recovery in economic activity and growth in emhimployment. As I said in a statement issued last IFriday, a reasoned assessment of economic trends shows that momentum has been building up in the economy even though there has been monesome slowing in growth in the September Taking the most recent indicators at face value, there is no basis for suggesting anything than that this recovery is continuing. Indusequitrial production didflattenout in the June quarter but is again on a slow upward trend. So far as consumption is concerned, retail sales have not grown as much in recent months as earlier, but allowing for improved price performance, some real growth in retail sales has continued. Demand for motor vehicles moved ahead satisfactorily during September, following the sharp fall experienced in July and August as a result of the introduction of more stringent emission control regulations. The weakening in the labour market that appears to have taken place since the March quarter-althoug h almost exclusively in the State of New South Wales-ha s been largely arrested over the course of the September quarter. Activity in the housing industry remains buoyant. There are also some fundamental differences in the economy compared with a year ago which, taken together, point clearly in the direction of continued growth. Because this matter of public importance has obviously been inspired by Sunday night's monetary announcement, I intend to deal specifically with monetary management in my response today to the honourable member for Adelaide. In a major speech on 3 August this year the opposition shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Adelaide, set down the Australian Labor Party's approach to monetary management in the following terms: The rate of inflation would be reduced by a combination of poUcies including . . . allowing the money supply to grow at a rate sufficient to omic growth and a declining rate of price increases. That statement points to the political opportunism-the hypocrisy-of the matter now before the House. In August the Labor Party's spokesman on economic matters presented a mirror image of the Government's monetary pohcy. In November he claims that measures taken in line with that pohcy will lead to a credit squeeze. This is, of course, not thefirsttime the honourable member for Adelaide has attempted to pursue this line. I refer specifically to the introduction in January this year of Australian savings bonds as part of a monetary package to drain off the excess liquidity that then existed. I remind the House that the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Hayden), the second shadow Treasurer in the Australian Labor Party-the combination of Bib and Bub-m y predecessor as Treasurer, had himself in his understanding of those matters welcomed that package in the following terms: The Federal Government's new economic package is an appropriate measure at this paign I said several times that the Labor Government was considering a package that was very similar. In spite of that statement by the former treasurer, the honourable member for Adelaide-the first or second shadow Treasurer on the other sideissued a Press statement on 11 February commenting on the package: It constituted the start of a vicious credit squeeze. It is a matter of record as the honourable gentleman ought to be the first to admit, that no credit squeeze came about as a result of the 'January package', and in fact the Government's monetary management during the seasonal downswing in Uquidity towards the end of the last financial year was a major success. I must say that the Opposition is today indulging in the same kind of exercise which characterised it in earlier months.",33
87,Mr BAILLIEU,MANAGEMENT,They are wrong again.,34

100,Mr LYNCH,MANAGEMENT,"I would not want to upset the to be honourable member any more than he is upset now. I will withdraw. The House would do well to recall that the monetary problems facing the economy at the present time came about as a direct result of permissive policies pursued by our predecessors. There can be no argument with the proposition that the policies of 1975 resulted in a potentially highly dangerous situation of excess Uquidity. the year to December 1975 the liquidity base the private sector increased by $2,702m-almos t 4 times the average increase recorded in the prein But, ceding 10 years.

Not only did our opponents in this house open the monetary flood gates in 1975; they also clamped a monetary vice on the economy that led to the worse credit squeze in Australia's war history. It was the 1974 credit squeeze, brought about by the Labor Government, that pushed the economy to the depths of its recession slight and forced thousands of Australians on to the government dole: The rapidity with which the volume of since the endsecurities money was contracted during 1974 has no paral- $290m and, within lel in Australia's post-war history. I said in response to a question in the House purchased today that the squeeze applying during that year exceeding by was more severe than on any occasion growth in the money supply has been curtaUed- were comprehensivelyofreviewed for example, in 1961, 1965 and 1970. The volweek and the monetary measuresbywere ume of money, broadly defined, declined at annual rate of almost 7 per cent during the 3 bring about any form of credit squeeze are inwUl months to September 1974. The violent contraction that took place did so in where the volume of money had grown at rates in excess of 20 per cent in the previous 12-month period. There is no record of the honourable member for Adelaide having expressed any conbUlion. cern by comment in this House, so far as I have been able to search it out, about the credit squeeze imposed in 1974.1 take this opportunity to say to the honourable gendeman that the Government's monetary measures during 1976 have been an outstanding success. The Governcent ment 's economic poUcy is in line with the consenmeasures sus that has emerged on this matter in interofficial national economic forums. If the honourable gentleman queries that, I believe he ought to pay attention to the 1976 annual report of the Interthe national Monetary Fund which had this to say. . . . current rates of monetary expansion are still double digits in most of the industrial countries and reduced considerably if a return to reasonable price stability is to be achieved in the next few years. For 1976-77 a rate of growth of the broadly defined money supply of between 10 and 12 per cent, as referred to in the Budget Speech, will on the present indications be consistent with growth in overall liquidity entirely adequate to support expansion by the private sector. It will also have the effect of bearing down on the rate of inflation In and reinforcing the other measures taken by the of Government to curb the rate of price increase. as I said on Sunday night, developments financial since the Budget was have meant that the Government the 6 months to has been less than in seUing governpubUc during the Uquidity outstanding During by banks and majorfinancialinstitutions increased at a seasonaUy adjusted rate of around 20 per cent. There have been insufficient sales of postgovernment paper in spite of adjustments to treasury note rates prior to the October loan, a increase in the yield on Australian savings bonds and the October loan itself. The take-up of by the non-bank public of June has been no more than this total, the authorities have actually been net purchasers of shorter-dated bonds. That is, in the most recent period bonds the authorities have actually been sales. All of these developments, when the especially in the Ught the October loan result, Ministers last decided an last Friday. Assertions that these measures fact circumstances without foundation. CaUs to statutory reserve deposits of 1 per cent amount to around $170m, as compared with deposits held by the trading banks of around $17 This will simply bring back the margin of free liquidity of the banks to around the levels existing in August and September of this year. The average Uquidity ratio of the banks during August and September was 25.3 per cent, by contrast with a ratio of something over 26 per as at the end of October. The new monetary embody, of course, a lift in short term interest rates. Treasury notes are being increased by around V4 per cent and this will be reflected in the yields on short dated bonds over next few days. As against this, private short term interest rates have declined during the rein cent period, as liquidity has eased. For example, still need the yields on 90-day bank bUls are about 8.9 per cent now, compared with the average of around 10.7 per cent in June. As to bank lending, the fact is that the banks have been providingfinancefor the corporate sector, both for working capital purposes and for investment and expansion. The authoriues will continue to implement Government pohcy which provides for adequate funds to underwrite economic recovery. If excessive growth in money and credit were allowed to continue it would result, essentially, in more upward pressure on prices. This is, after all, the key lesson of the experience in the United Kingdom in recent years, and in Australia during 1975. As well, by making more sales of government paper now, and by avoiding excessive growth in lending at this time, the seasonal tightening offinancialmarkets in the June quarter of next year will be easier to handle. In short, action taken now will obviate the need for monetary measures towards the end of the financial year that would have been inconsistent with continuing increase in the level of activity. It is precisely because the Government aims lift economic activity, and to deal with the level of unemployment, that action is being taken to keep the growth of the monetary aggregates rate consistent with further reductions in inflanight tion. The Government believes that its poUcies are being successful and it does not intend to be pushed off course by the kind of unsubstantiated assertions that have been made by the Oppoployment sition in this House today. The Government for its part rejects the matter before the Chair.",35
101,Mr WILLIS,MANAGEMENT,"This matter that is now before the House is an important matter not only because the economy generally obviously very important but also it is especially important because almost exactly one year this Government seized office substantiaUy on the basis that the then Government was incomlevel petent in its handling of the economy. Having grabbed office by breaking all the conventions poltiical behaviour in this country, the Liberal and National Country Parties have shown over the past year that they have no answers to the economic ills of this countiy. The latest frantic moves on the weekend show that the Governthere ment is no nearer tofindingan answer. In those moves on the weekend fit into a pattern that is now well estabUshed in other areas of economic activity-that of treating business generously and creating off-setting problems that have to be corrected. I refer particularly to taxation and wage policy, and I will come to that later on. The measures announced on the weekend will have some effect in further inhibiting economic recovery despite what the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) says. In fact it is very interesting that his statement seems to be a fairly casual statement in the sense of trying to persuade people that there would be no real problems created by these credit restrictions. But if one looks at the statements by Mr Knight, the Governor of the Reserve Bank, one can see that a rather different picture emerges. He said that the SRD call up would reduce the banks' free liquidity to relatively low levels and that further call ups may be made. He added that the increase in the SRD ratio was being accompanied by a request to the trading banks for some further moderation on the growth in their financing and that savings banks and permanent building societies were also being made aware of the need to avoid an upsurge in their lending. Mr Knight is saying that the bank lending has already been curbed, that it would be curbed further, quite aside from the SRD call, and that to otherfinancegroups have been warned not to try to make up the short falls created as the banks lent less. That is a different picture entirely from at a that given in the Press statement on Sunday by the Treasurer or now in this House by the Treasurer. Ih fact, the moves on the weekend will have a restrictive effect and they will further inhibit recovery and perhaps cause more unemin this country, and that is an important matter certainly worthy of discussion in this House. I think it is also important to reiterate the fact that at the present time, early in November 1976, the Budget deficit is approximately $250m higher than it was this time last year before the is then Government was thrown out of office. This is the situation confronting a government which ago when in Opposition berated the then Government left right and centre for the extraordinary of the Budget deficit and suggested that astronomical deficit levels would be created if of this trend continued. We are now in a situation where the Budget deficit is substantially higher than it was at that time last year. Again this shows the incredible irony of the situation. I would also point out that despite the fact that have been substantial efforts by this fact Government to borrow overseas and also through increases in treasury note interest ratesthe Government has tried on 3 occasions in the too last 10 weeks to get more money from this source-the fact is that the deficit is still being the largelyfinancedby printing money. Remember how we used to talk last year and the year before aboutfinancingdeficits by printing money? The then Opposition used to berate us daily with that kind of talk. Here it is, in government, printing money like mad to finance the deficit which it has created. In fact over the last 4 months it has borrowed from the Reserve Bank $ 1,000m in treasury bills tofinancethe deficit. So who are honourable members opposite to talk about a Labor Government printing money tofinanceits deficit when they are doing it as fast as can be? Because they are worried about the fact that they are doing that, these measures were taken at the weekend. It is again ironic that the major reason for having to take these restrictive measures at weekend was that they had been trying to be over-generous to business in this abolished the quarterly company tax payments, which were instituted by the Labor Government, with the result that company tax collections in the first 4 months of this year were $43m comfact pared with $528m in the first 4 months of last year. Quite clearly if quarterly company tax ments had been continued the Government Where would not have needed to undertake the restriction tive measures announced at the weekend. 9 Another $500m-odd would have been in the accounts and therefore there would have been need to worry so much about the increase in the money supply which has necessarily been cent created by the need to go to the Reserve Bank and borrow $ 1,000m worth of Treasury bills. All of this money sloshing around that the Treasurer is talking about is largely the policy of cutting out company quarterly tax payments. It seems to me that if he had allowed company tax payments on a quarterly basis to contors tinue it would have been a far better result business than restricting credit and increasing interest rates in the way of the announcement the weekend. It is also very important to reiterate just how bad the state of the economy is at present. The really key indicators are worse than they were this time last year. For instance, the number registered unemployed is 15 000 higher than it was at this time last year. That means we will have much higher levels of unemployment at Christmas time and in the January period than we had earlier this year. I also comment in passTime ing that thefiguresfor the registered number unemployed will be somewhat understated the next few months because this Government hastightenedup on the work test particularly relation to not paying unemployment benefits school leavers and leavers from tertiary instituwages tions. Right now students leaving universities afterfinishingtheir courses and enrolling for jobs are being told that they will not receive any unemployment benefit until next February. A lot of these people will not bother registering and the unemploymentfigureswill be understated. Even so, I suggestfigureswill be substantially higher than they were last year. The registered number of vacancies is 700 less than at thistimelast year. In the last month the figure fell by 800 on a seasonally adjusted basis, a factor which the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street) forgot to mention in his statement announcing the latest unemployment figures. The latest survey of the Bureau of Stattheir istics on unemployment showed that 4.8 per cent the of the work force was unemployed-that is the highestfigurerecorded. Last year at thistimethe area. They figure was 4.6 per cent. Even on inflation the Government's record is nowhere near as good as it tries to make out. The is that over the last 12 months inflation in this country has increased by 13.9 per cent. In the payprevious 12 months to that it was 12.1 per cent. is this great advance in control of inflaabout which we hear so much? Over the first months of this year inflation increased by 7.9 per cent; last year in the first 9 months it no increased 8 per cent. So congratulations to the Government; it has reduced inflation by 0.1 per in the first 9 months of this year. Whichever of these 2 important indicators, unemployment and inflation, one looks at, the fact is that they are both in a worse state than they were at this result of his own time last year. One can go through the various other indicabut time does not permit. I make the point for that if one looks at the Government's economic policy strategy in relation to taxation and wages at the fact is that both of those poUcies have been geared in a way to try to assist private business but in trying to do so they have had off-setting effects which are detrimental to private business. On the taxation side the concessions which will at cost hundreds of mUlions of dollars this year and of over $ 1,000m nextfinancialyear, have had to be offset by substantial costs in government expenditure. Those cuts in government expenditure are dafly creating more unemployment and the evidence is there for anyone who wants to look. does not permit me to go over the evidence of but it is there for anyone who wants to see it. in Company after company is now complaining that its business is being affected by cuts in in government expenditure. The same relates to the to wage policy. The cutbacks in the real level of to transfer income from wage earners to profit earners might be beneficial to business in the very short run but if it means that consumers therefore will not increase their consumer expenExports diture and will not buy more goods and use more services business will not be assisted and thus the economy will continue in recession for a long time.",36
102,Dr EDWARDS,MANAGEMENT,"The though Treasurer (Mr Lynch) said that there was irony in this matter proposed by the Opposition. I would stress the Opposition's gall for it was Labor Party when in government which created other factors. the mess of historic proportions from which we are extricating the economy-the high and stubthe born inflation rate, the more than a quarter of million unemployed, the serious deterioration our competitive position in the world economy and the massive deficit in the public accounts. We have the task of extricating the economy from this mess. The Government is getting the situation under control. Its economic managean ment is paying off. Infiation is coming down. figure of 2.2 per cent for the September quarter, even if enlarged for the factor referred to by my colleague at question time, is still below the of the September quarter last year not including the Medibank change. The comparisons just that made by the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) lean heavily on the fact that in the September quarter last year there was an artificito ally lowfigure-0.8 per cent-recorde d for the increase in prices, the underlying rate with the Medibank factor excluded being 2.9 per cent. Albeit the growth in the September quarter slowed, as the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford) stated, the important point is that growth is continuing. Albeit the indicators are somewhat equivocal the economy is on a path moderate sustained growth. Real consumption in the June quarter was 3 per cent up on a year earUer. Perhaps the retaUfigureshave not been too strong since then; however I note that the sales of new motor vehicles, seasonally adjusted, increased 10 per cent in September to stand 12 per cent above a year earUer. It is the year earUertext comparisons that I stress. I take dwellings. In June quarterfixedcapital expenditure in congrowth stant prices of dwellings was 34 per cent the year earUer. There is still momentum as priThere vate dwelling approvals in the September quarter were 12 per cent up on a year earUer. Unemployment, unhappily, is still high though not higher than a year earUer if aUowmoves ance is made for short-term palUatives such as the Regional Employment Development scheme by which the previous Government attempted to mop up unemployment but only got the situation further into difficulty. As against that, employconfidence ment is edging up and overtime is increasing. in the September quarter increased 12 per cent to stand 29 per cent higher than a year earlier. And all these factors to which I point are taking place against the background of broadly favourable factors. The overseas recovery, perhaps not as fast as earUer anticipated, is proceeding in the world's major economies, the shake out in stocks which depressed product the during 1975 appears to have run its course, and It is against that background that I affirm that mix of pohcy we are pursuing is the only way a to restore economic health to this country. A rein cent issue of Business Week referred to the considerable consensus among economists 'as different as Britain's left wing Joan Robinson and the US.'s conservative Henry C. WalUch, member of the Federal Reserve Board'. There is approach and a broadly agreed one. It is The along these lines: First and foremost, it is to counter inflation. We put the emphasis there because inflation itself is a main, if not the princilevel pal, cause of unemployment. Only the other day the British Prime Minister, Mr Callaghan, stated nobody seriously disputed that inflation is the number one enemy of employment. So we put emphasis on inflation. To beat that there has befiscalrestraint, that is, restraint in government spending and tax raising and, in particular, in getting hold of deficits. There has to be monetary restraint. The fact is that over a time the inflation rate runs at just a few points below the increase in the money supply. There are all sorts of mechanisms in that upon which I cannot elaborate. However, I will mention this one: Local, of and also importantly, overseas investors confidence is significantly influenced by what is happening to the money supply as an earnest of the Government's determination to beat inflation. Also there must be incomes restraint, notably the increases in wages and salaries. In these ways, policy moves to counter inflation. Then, in a conof declining inflation, the stage is set for resthe tored thrust in the economy, for investment, and increased employment, given approup on priate consumer and business confidence. are currently 2 major areas of difficulty for poUcy against that background. Thefirstis monetary poUcy, the context in which this motion is put forward, including the weekend on the monetary front. That well Ulustrates the delicacy of striking arightbalance between the instruments of economic policymonetary in this instance-o n the one hand and the important requirement of moves to engender on the other hand-the confidence to which the honourable member for Adelaide made repeated reference. With the recent growth in hquidity, new lending and the money supply, the Reserve Bank of Australia's action the short end of the interest rate structure was essential. I stress that the Australian Saving rate is a short term rate in this context. The very process of properly managing and financing deficit makes this essential. The honourable member for Gellibrand had a lot to say about size of the deficit. But what is important is just the size of the deficit but also how financed. We take this latter aspect seriously. The condemnation of the Australian Labor when in government was not only on the basis the size of deficit, although that was important, but also that it made no serious effort properly finance and manage it. These measures were essential. But against that, there is the confidence area. Let me state look categorically to the Australian community what tember 1976, the Treasurer has said. He said that this is not- I $2,275.9m. For repeat the word 'not'- a credit squeeze. It is not a cutting down in the availability of finance for legitimate private productive activities, which is Any what a squeeze implies. It is not a cutting of the Government reasonable requirements of economic activity. Labor Government Rather, it is a matter of mopping up of an excess of Uquidity. The Government has been obUged to keep on with its expenditure, but receipts at improving this time of the year lag behind. It nificant extent in this case that this has been to the changes in relation to company taxation. But that again was a measure important for confidence and the capacity of industry to invest. So the aim of this Government is not in any to deprive any legitimate borrower productive purpose of the necessary finance. When What these measures will do is to forestall credit squeeze, the sort of thing that the Australian business and private community experiagain enced under the previous Government in mid 1974, a squeeze which would otherwise occur in task the latter stages of thefinancialyear if this money or Uquidity is not mopped up now. So I The put it to the Australian community: Ignore the gradually posturings of Opposition members on this matter This and get on with the business of economic activities. The other major area of difficulty is in respect But suddenly of incomes growth. This Government has not came flinched from the task of endeavouring to slowmost the growth of money wages and salaries. I say of that the great majority of Australians recognise Government the correctness of this action. They recognise that doit. in the interests of the unemployed, and in the interests of effectively protecting and in the advancing the standard of Uving of all Australians the growth of money wages and hence of affecting costs must be slowed.",38
103,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MANAGEMENT," Order! Bond The honourable member's time has expired. the Mr STEWART (Lang) (4.20)-This afternoon we have heard the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) the and the honourable member for Berowra (Dr not Edwards) talk about the faults of the Labor it is Government between 1972 and 1975. Both stressed the fact that we had too large a deficit. Party The honourable member for Berowra cited of figures in his speech to show what happened in August this year compared to August last year to and said that this was the comparison that had to be made. As there is so much stress in economic arguments about the deficit which was budgeted for by the Australian Labor Party, let us have a at how the deficit of this Government is at present operating. In the 3 months to 30 Septhe deficit of this Government was the same period 12 months ago, to 30 September 1975, the deficit was $ 1,887.3m. excuses that the honourable member for Berowra can give as to why the deficit of this is higher than the deficit of the in 1975 hold no water. The real reason that the economy of Australia is not is because this Government does not is true to a sigknow how to handle it. due This is thefifthattempt at economic measures made by the Treasurer. Thefirstwas in January. the There were two in March, one in May and the major one on 17 August. Let me remind the way House of the words of the Treasurer in that for a genuine Budget Speech. He said: this Government was elected on 13 December last, a real Australia was in bad shape. Inflation was out of hand, economic activity was falling and unemployment had risen to record levels. The Government immediately set about the enormous of repairing the damage and restoring confidence. excess Recovery is no w getting under way. private sector is growing again and confidence is returning. Budget will aid that recovery and rebuild the conyour normal fidence funher . . . It is a Budget for confidence; it is also a Budget for reform. over the weekend the Treasurer out with new economic measures that took of the people by surprise. A special meeting Cabinet was called on Friday because the did not know what to do or how to Opposition members are not the only people end in the community who are complaining about the economic mismanagement of this Governdeclining. ment. Harsh and continuous criticisms are appearing every day from all types of organisand ations. They include the manufacturing indusworked tries, the building industry, the Australian Indusing. tries Development Association, the Australian Confederation of Apparel Manufacturers, and bankers, chambers of commerce, retaUers, smaU businessmen, multi-national companies and the Premiers of the various States. In the attempts to do something about recovering the economic situation in Australia, this Government has not succeeded at all. All of its ideas and the predictions of the Treasurer have become unstuck. Most sections of the community are either stagnant at the moment as they have for the last 12 months or are expenencing ditions which continue to decline. It is no good this Government saying that it is what we did did not do between December 1972 and November 1975 that created the economic situmanagement. ation that exists in Australia today. Between 1949 and 1972 Liberal-Country Party governwhat ments were in office. It was the laissez-faire vate enterprise capitalist attitude taken by present Government or its forerunners that alunder lowed the economic situation to deteriorate to the extent that it did when we came into office. Honourable members opposite are all inclined to say that it is only the Opposition in this ment that is criticising the Government's omic policy. The Premier of New South Wales, after hearing of these announcements on Monbounties day, said: The recession is now well into its third year and the series of measures just doesn't give the stimulus necessary get real recovery under way. He went on to say: We have got the highest unemployment on the mainland and our building industry, already hard hit, has been another kick in the guts by the so-called economic measures. When we look at what has happened to our Environment, economy in the last 11 months m which this Development Government has been in office, we find that number of new car registrations has decreased. They decreased alarmingly in August. They increased slightly in September. Unemployment is still increasing. RetaU sales are running below price increases. Savings are still rising rapidly. There was $180m in savings accounts in July. The volume of money, broadly denned as M3 It was increasing at the rate of 19 per cent in the months to August. There is stUl a lack of coninterests fidence in the business community. I have quoted from the Treasurer's speech of 17 August in which he said that confidence was returning. Our balance of payments situation Factories are working below capacity. I correct the honourable member for Berowra inform bim that the rate of overtime being at the moment is declining, not increasOur personal taxation has been increased. Even the Australian Taxpayers' Federation is banks asking when this Government will keep the promises made by the present Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) that he was going to cut 5 out the taxrip-off.The people of Australia cannot even see a ray of light in the economic inflationary tunnel, let alone see this GovernmentaU of the Liberal-National Party Government-Uv e up to its slogan that it would turn on the Ughts. These new measures will do nothing to increase been productivity. The laughable announcement of conthe establishment of the Department of Productivity will do nothing either to increase proor ductivity or to help the situation in Australia. This is band-aid, patchwork-quUt economic In the few moments left to me to speak I ask effect the introduction of a Department of priProductivity can have on increasing production this in Australia when most factories are working capacity-som e as low as 60 per cent of capacity and others perhaps as high as 80 per cent. In this Government there are 4 Ministers concerned with business or industrial management. ParliaThefirstis the Minister for Business and Coneconsumer Affairs (Mr Howard) who controls business practices, duties on customs and excise, and on the production or export of goods. Then we have the Minister for Employment and current Industrial Relations (Mr Street). His duties take to in industrial relations including conciliation and arbitration in relation to industrial disputes, the Commonwealth Employment Service, and the reinstatement in civil employment of national given servicemen, etc. The third Minister is none other than the Minister at the table, the Minister for Housing and Community (Mr Newman). Some of his duties the encompass the buUding industry and housing.",39
104,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MANAGEMENT, Order! The honourable member'stimehas expired.,40
105,Mr LUSHER,MANAGEMENT,"It is interesting to come into the Parliament and see that again the Opposition has brought forward a matter of pubUc importance about economic management. seems that only yesterday we had a discussion 3 on a simUar subject of public importance. What me is the fact that the Opposition gives this Government credit for economic management. It may not agree with the way in which this Government is going about it, but at least it says is that economic management exists. That, I think, is something for which we cannot give credit the previous Administration. Honourable bers opposite spent 3 years wallowing around some form of economic activity which could not be blessed with the title 'management'. They come back to this chamber again and again attempting, as the Treasurer (Mr talk the economy down, attempting, for some political advantage no doubt, to cause disruption in our community, and attempting to create conbecause, fusion in the economy as a whole. I believe, the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr suit Hurford) said that there is a degree of confusion among the members of his own Party.",40
106,Mr HURFORD,MANAGEMENT,I did not say that.,41
107,Mr LUSHER,MANAGEMENT,"No , I retract that remark. honourable member did not say that; I said it. The honourable member for Adelaide said that the Budget is the most important instrument that a government has avaUable to it. It is not so many years ago that one of his predecessors spokesman for his Party on economic matters, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Crean), who was the Treasurer at the time, Opposition. said that the time had come when budgets were not to be regarded as the most significant instrument available to a government. He that economic management should take place on Government a continuing basis and that we should get away from the emphasis that is traditionally attached to a Budget. Today we are getting back to the more traditional line and the honourable memprevious ber for Adelaide is rejecting the prognostications of his predecessor in that respect. We have further confusion between the ber for Adelaide and his Leader. We are told by the honourable member for Adelaide that what this Government is doing in its economic strategy is attempting to delay economic recovery until the next election. Mr MCVeigh-The thieves cannot even agree among themselves.",41
108,Mr LUSHER,MANAGEMENT,That is absolutely right. He Cabinet said that we are managing the economy in terms the samemust of electoral strategy. That seems interesting process because we have been the other hand by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) that we are about to caU an early election. One thing is not consistent with the other.,41
109,Mr HURFORD,MANAGEMENT,Ye s it is.,41
110,Mr LUSHER,MANAGEMENT,"WeU, ifwe are trying to delay the election until 1978,1 do not see how we be trying to caU an early election. to Mr HURFORD - I did not say 'delay until 1978'; memI said' delay until the next election'. in Mr LUSHER-The honourable member said we were trying to delay until the next election.",41
111,Mr HURFORD,MANAGEMENT,"That is right. That could be at Lynch) says, to the end of 1977.",41
112,Mr LUSHER,MANAGEMENT,"That isright.The honourable member gives us a remarkable degree of credit if we accept his arguments, we have the as abUity to move the economy in any direction to our own electoral purposes. That, I think, is something which is a great compliment to this Government. The honourable member for GeUibrand (Mr WUlis) told us that cuts in Government expendiThe ture are important; that they are affecting people; and that they are reducing the number of jobs in the community. The honourable member for Adelaide told us that the Government sector of the economy is not reaUy important because it as accounts for only 25 per cent of economic activity. So, I think there needs to be some degree of unanimity among the members of the The important feature of this matter is that we said have exempUfied economic management The has demonstrated to Australia and to the community at large that it has been pre1 >ared to take charge of the shambles that was eft behind by the Labor administration of the 3 years and to accept the chaUenge to come forward with a firm poUcy to restore confidence and activity in the community. That is honourable memwhat is important. What the Government has done throughout the year is to make adjustments to that overaU strategy. The strategy announced by the Treasurer on Sunday night is no more than that. The Government unlike the Opposition, is tuning the economy. While in government, the Labor Party manipulated, overturned, juggled and tried to keep aU the baUs above its head but was not able to achieve that. The Treasurer and the be given credit for having stuck to economic line aU the way through. to me an They are not being rattled. told onput off their course by peopleThey such are not being as the honourable member for Adelaide or by commentators. Mr Corbett-Why should they?",41
113,Mr LUSHER,MANAGEMENT,"As the honourable member for Maranoa says, why should they? The Party represented by the honourable member for Adelaide has a record of economic management can and achievement that can only be regarded as disastrous. I do not know why anybody would want to take notice of the Labor Party. I do not know why honourable members opposite have the arrogance to suggest that anybody should take notice of it. The fact of the matter is that the Government has been consistent in its approach to the economy. It has been consistent in the strategy which it is applying to the economy. That is what is important. I think that the honourable member for Lang (Mr Stewart) confused everybody with the figures that he quoted during the debate. The honourable member talked about deficit levels and tried to confuse what was said by the honourable member for Berowra (Dr Edwards). The important point is what happens at the end of the financial year. The deficit in June, August, September or February is not really significant. What is significant is the overall result for the year. That is the way economic performance is measured in the Budget context. The changes that have been made to company taxes and things of that nature are the indicators. There have obviously been changes in the way in which Government receipts have been coming in. To try to compare thefiguresfor the first 3 months of this year with last year'sfiguresis not on. The honourable member for Lang has said that we should not blame the Labor Government. But I put it to him that what we are suffering now is not the result of mild changes to a system that had been in operation for years. What we are suffering at the moment is the result of drastic changes that were made to a system in a period of 3 years. One cannot solve problems and overcome drastic changes which have been made in a short time. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has said-h e has been backed up by members of his Ministry-that the job facing us is a full 3 year job. That is a proposition which has not been disputed. The fact that inflation is showing encouraging signs of coming down within the first year of the Fraser Administration is, I think, a credit to the policies which have been pursued by that Administration. The honourable member for Lang tried to suggest that the Labor Government was unable to achieve its tasks because the Liberal-Country Party Coalition had been in office for 23 years previously. But the fact is that we have always pursued a stable economic policy. In the 3 years of the Labor Government there was nothing stable about any of its policies, let alone economic poUcies. It takes a long time to recover from those influences. The Premier of New South Wales, Mr Wran, has been mentioned in the debate as an independent observer. I think that was probably one of the tighter moments of the debate. Perhaps honourable members should be grateful to the honourable member for Lang for making this statement. I believe that even the honourable member for Berowra would acknowledge that the Premier of New South Wales is not one of the great economic minds of our time. For members of the Opposition to introduce the comments of the Premier of New South Wales into this debate is probably not doing justice to this Parliament. This Government has a consistent approach and a consistent pohcy line towards the economy. The Opposition is intent on trying to justify its actions over the last couple of years. It is trying, for its own political ends, to promote a situation in the economy in which confusion reigns. It is trying to ensure that there is a continuation of confusion and uncertainty in the minds of businessmen and consumers in Australia. That is not something with which the Government agrees.",41
114,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MANAGEMENT,"Mr Lucock)Order! The honourable member's time has expired. This discussion is now concluded. DEFENCE AMENDMENT BILL 1976 Bill presented by Mr Kilien, and read a first time. Second Reading",42
115,Mr KILLEN,MANAGEMENT," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This is a small procedural Bill which seeks to amend the Defence Act. It arises out of a suggestion made by the Chief of the Air Staff that the term 'air' within the Royal Australian Air Force organisation is confusing some people because they believe that it applies to civil aviation. The purpose of the Bill, m effect, is to put that position beyond all doubt. The term 'air' within the RAAF organisation will be replaced by the term 'air force'. Therefore, 'Air Office' will become 'Air Force Office' and 'Defence Instructions (Air)' issued by the Chief of Air Staff under the Defence Act will become 'Defence Instructions (Air Force)'. That is the thrust of the Bill. It seeks to amend section 9A of the Defence Act and also makes routine amendments to the Defence Act. I have already said to the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford) who is at the table, that I do not think it is the sort of Bill which will cause tumult throughout the country. Nevertheless, it is a Bill which I commend to honourable members. Debate (on motion by Mr Hurford) adjourned. NAVAL DOCKYARD, WILLIAMSTOWN, Reference to Public Works Committee",42
116,Mr MCLEAY,MANAGEMENT," I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for investigation and report: Modernisation ties, stage 2, HMA naval dockyard, Williamstown, Vic. The proposal is for the provision of improved facilities for ship refitting, outfitting and administration facilities. These will allow the dockyard to better utilise the stage 1 faculties which are currently under construction and due for completion in August 1978. The proposed works comprise: New Nelson Pier West, crosswharf and workshop; Extension to existing pipe shop; New administration/training/laboratory centre; New dockyard store, oil fuel installation and gate house; Temporary fleet maintenance party workshop; Extension of electrical, mechanical and hydraulic services, including provision of a new boiler house; and Services tunnel extension. The cost of the proposal at July 1976 prices is $24m. I table plans of the proposed work. Question resolved in the affirmative. STATES GRANTS (BEEF INDUSTRY) AMENDMENT BILL 1976 Debate resumed from 21 October, on motion by Mr Sinclair: That the Bill be now read a second time.",43
117,Mr KEATING,MANAGEMENT,"The purproblems pose of this Bill, the States Grants (Beef IndusGovernment try) Amendment Bill, is to amend the States ure Grants (Beef Industry) Act 1975, legislation basic enacted by the former Labor Government, to enuntil able the Commonwealth to provide up to $ 15m regard to match on a dollar for dollar basis State funds even approved for lending in 1976-77 under the beef carry-on loans scheme. The scheme provides low interest carry-onfinanceto speciahst beef producers with a sound asset structure who would be viable given a return to more normal beef market conditions. The words used in the introduction of this legislation must be a great let down to the beef industry of Australia-to those thousands of beef producers who thought great promise would be shown by the present LiberalVICTORIA Country Party Government. After all of its extravagant election talk and all of the massive claims and promises throughout the election campaign the Government hasfinallygot down to extending an existing Australian Labor Party scheme that was initiated in 1974. It might be worthwhile at this point to quote the words of of facilithe present Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Sinclair) during those irresponsible days of the election campaign of last year and before it I referfirstlyto an article in the Australian of 18 August of last year headed 'Sinclair puts plan to save beef industry', which reads: The program also calls for more carry-on finance for beef producers, claiming the present $39.6m government allocation is inadequate. The present Minister for Primary Industry claimed then that the Labor Government's scheme was inadequate; yet his Government is now putting up only $ 15m. The article continues: It is understood the Country Party wants at least S 100m lent to producers at 4 per cent interest with an initial 2-year interest moratorium. So much for the $ 100m and so much for how bad the $39.6m given by the Labor Government was when this Bill provides for the provision of only $15m. Let me quote again from another of the pearls of wisdom that fell from the hps of the present Minister for Primary Industry. I refer to a Press statement of 5 September, which reads: 'Beef crisis is a social and economic crisis', says Ian Sinclair. 'The time is rapidly passing for the Australian Government to take action to relieve the position of the beef industiyOf course, it was the Labor Government which he said should be taking actionSecond Reading the Deputy Leader of the National Country Party, Mr Sinclair, said today. Speaking to a public meeting at Wanf aratta, Mr Sinclair said: ""The economic problems facing the eef industry are generating grave social problems for the families of beef producers and their employees. These social will become more pronounced as long as the fails to act to assist the industry. The total failto act will bring down on Australia not only an economic tragedy but also a widespread, lingering social tragedy. This fact needs to be recognised by the Government. Up now the Labor Government has chosen to callously disthe position of the beef industry and its problemsthough, only a few years ago, it was Australia's major export earning industry. One can see what hollow words they were when one looks at the legislation introduced by the Minister for Primary Industry during the 12 months in office of this Government. He was critical of the Labor Government, but he has done Uttle even to match what that Government was prepared to do. I refer now to an article in the Canberra Times of 11 October of last year, which was just before the election, headed industry dying'. It reads: The death warrant of the Australian beef industry be signed unless the Government took action to assist beef industry, the Deputy Leader of the National Party, Mr Sinclair, told a Queanbeyan-Canberra Graziers Associauon meeting . . . Assistance for the beef industry was urgendy needed and long overdue. It says so much for the words of the National Country Party and so much for its interest in great Australian beef industry that all it has done is meekly introduce a Bill to enable the pro-at vision of $ 15m for a carry-on scheme initiated the former Government. When one looks at the former Government's scheme one sees that it was for $ 19.5m and not $15m, that the $ 19.5m was at 4 per cent interest and that an additional $20m was provided on a commercial interest rate basis. So $39.5m was made avaUable. The sum of $15,000 a year was provided for proloans ducers in Queensland and the Northern Terriing tory, and $10,000 a year to those elsewhere. Government has now brought those dations into this legislation. To all producers in the pastoral zone it is prepared to give $15,000 and to those elsewhere it is prepared to give $10,000 at an interest rate of not less than cent per annum. But the point is that the situation in the beef industry now is much worse than was when the Labor Party was in office. Costs higher and markets have not improved. In fact, the markets have been hit by the Canadian quotas and could feel the effects of United States quotas in the future. Let me again quote the ister. A report in the Hobart Mercury of 26 tember of last year reads: Australia's agricultural marketing position overseas improve dramatically under a Liberal-Country Government . . . Mr Ian Sinclair said in Hobart yesterday. So much for that claim, because he was the Min-term. ister who traUed his coat and was successful in getting a quota imposed on Australian beef ing imports into Canada. What do wefind?We find that this Minister's performance has led to a As deterioration in the market situation for Auspromises traUan beef overseas. I think it is probably opportune record what the Labor Government did for the industry lest there be any more of this double talk and, in fact, these irresponsible deceptions by the Minister. I will cite some of the things that the Labor Government did. I dealfirstlywith the Australian Government and State government concessional loans. The States Grants (Beef Industry) Act, to which I have already referred, provided for the provision of $ 19.6m to match State funds for the provision of carry-on loan 'Beef finance to beef producers. An additional $600,000 was subsequendy made avaUable to would Northern Territory producers. The loans were to the be administered by the State rural reconstruction Countiy authorities. Persons eUgible as speciaUst beef branch producers whose incomes were traditionally derived preponderantly from beef and who were judged as viable on the resumption of market recovery were also given carry-on funds. There the was an interest rate of 4 per cent in aU States now except Queensland, where the State funds were 2Vi per cent for thefirstyear, giving an overall by average rate in that State of 3V* per cent. No capital repayments were required in thefirstyear and thefirstyear's interest was capitaUsed. There was a maximum term of 7 years. There was a maximum loan of $10,000, except in respect of Queensland and the Northern Territory, where it was $15,000, and there was to be a review of after 12 months with a view to commencnormal service arrangements. That is not bad The when one considers that this Government cannot recommenmatch that record in any way. I refer now to specific Australian Government assistance under the Labor Government. I refer 4 per to the Development Bank loans. The Government decided in November 1974 to provide it $20m to augment Development Bank funds to areenable the Bank to broaden its lending to seriously affected beef producers. A further $8m was provided in the 1975-76 Budget. The funds were lent at commercial rates of interest. The Min-Bank also used the funds to assist those proSepducers preponderantly relying on cattle whose capital structures were seriously affected by would trends in cattle prices but who, in the opinion of Party the Bank, would have remained viable. For instance, the Bank took over some burdensome short term debts and funded them in the longer That is an indication of what the Labor Government in fact did for the beef industry durits tenure of office. One can see from that how poorly the present Government has performed. I said earlier, after all its extravagant election it has quietly slipped into the House this amendment to a piece of Labor Party legislation which provides for the provision of $ 15m to put on the to the beef industry. This Government has faUed to do anything substantial about the plight of the Australian beef industry. The Government-particularl y the Country Party section of it-ha s faUed to honour its election promises and bring to fruition the promise it gave to the industry in those heady days during the election campaign. Instead of looking for new markets all that wefindis that the Minister has gone overseas-to Canada in particular and the United States of Americaand bad mouthed the Australian beef producers to such an extent that the Canadian Government has been forced to put quotas upon the importamanner tion of Australian beef. Let me quote the ter's words in Ottawa as reported in an article in the Sydney Morning Herald of 17 June. The Fraser article reads: The Australian Minister for Primary told Canadian officials today he was concerned that Australian beef was being re-exported through Canada to United States at less than home market prices. In other words, he was saying: 'My producers back home are dumping beef on you. You are foolish not to try to correct the trend'. Of course, the Canadians were quick on the uptake. They took the hint and put quotas on beef imports. The Australian Financial Review has pointed out that it will cost us sales of about 8000 tonnes of beef a year. So much for a Minister saying that he wiU improve the market conditions. Because of this little procedure the United States of America then started to look at the matter again and breached the upper limit of the beef import quotas. That was directly attributable to what the Minister said. The Minister could not sustain an argument that the beef was being sold at less than the Australian domestic price and he could not sustain an argument that it was being dumped because the definition of 'dumping' is the selling of goods to other countries at less than the home consumption price. So, in terms of the Australian beef industry, the Minister cannot be trusted out of Australia. He cannot be let out of this country. The industry needs to keep a watch on every word he utters because he is an outside devil and an inside angel. When he gets back he will go around the north and all the beef producing areas and tell them anything they want to hear. When he gets overseas he is Mr Responsible. He talks about the irresponsibUity of his producers and poUtely and quietly sells them down the drain. Let us look at the situation in the United of America. On what basis could President Ford withstand pressure for quotas after the Ausstance, traUan Minister went over there and said that own industry was dumping beef? President Ford subsequently lost the election in the United States. He laboured under difficult circumstances trying to cany the mid west and areas where there are beef producers. It is no wonder that United States Administration was forced to on beef quotas. We find not only is the deception promulgated by the Minister for Primary Indusran try but also by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). It was interesting to note that The Bulletin ran a story on 14 August about Australia losing its beef cattle.. The Bulletin is not what could be described as a Labor journal by any of means. I will read a couple of Uttle Minisjewels from that article. It states: In contrast with its success in ideologically icy Moscow, the Government has failed as a salesman for Australian beef in the much more intimate atmosphere of Washington. The failure has been accompanied by official Industry, Mr Sinclair, misrepresentation. the That is a fairly strong claim for a very conservative journal like this. The article refers to a question addressed to the Prime Minister and what he said about our beef negotiations. The Prime Minister's reply was: I think that's an area where you could say 2 good friends are having a vigorous discussion. The vigour of that discussion will continue. What do we find later in the story? Mr Roland Anderson, the Director of the Dairy Livestock and Poultry Division of the Foreign Agricultural Services Section of the United States Agriculture Depaitment, said: The issue has been put to bed. The numbers stand on their own . . . Further on the article said: ""The thing is over, but I don't think he (Fraser) wanted to announce that it was over', another official said. 'It probably would have got headlines in Australia saying 'Ford rebuffs Fraser'. The article went on to say that in the American view the whole matter was closed and that the Prime Minister came back and said that he had continuing negotiations and the negotiations were to continue. Later in the story the writer said: This action was taken at the request of Agriculture Secretary, Erl Butz, Sinclair's 'close personal friend' who, the Minister said in June, had given him an understanding on the subjea that made him, Sinclair, 'very happy' Mr Sinclair was very happy about the way he was very nicely done over in the United States. So much for the special relationship that this Government claims to enjoy with the United States States. The charge against the Labor Government was that because of its foreign policy in the view of the then Opposition which his is now the Government, the Labor Government had blotted its copy book with the United States adrninistration and was jeopardising Australia's market position, particularly for beef, in the United States. But we found that that was not the the case. The Labor Government did very nicely, put thank you. This present Government claims to enjoy a special relationship. The Prime Mmister over there without reason to talk to President Ford and other people in the administration. He foisted himself on them in a year when they could have well done without him. We now findthe that the special relationship does not mean thing in terms of United States imports tralian beef and in terms.of dollars and cents. Not only are there no new markets; there is alsofor a diminishing market in the Umted States. Contrast that with the way the Fraser Governfattened ment is kicking the Russians to death in terms foreign policy. At any chance it has a jibe at Soviet Union yet its Ministers are still trotting to Moscow and trying to arrange meat quotas, meat imports, in order to save their bacon back forgotten. in what they believe are traditionally National Country Party electorates. The point is that National Countiy Party beUeves it has the rural vote sown up and its interest is in the big mineral areas. The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr have Anthony), the Leader of the National Country Party, is the Mmister for National Resources. is interested in the mining companies-the iron ore, the coal, the uranium, the oU and all the rest. The beef people and the other people exist just vote him into Parliament. The mining companies are there to contribute to election that is where the interest of the National Country Party is to be found. Getting back to beef, scant regard is paid our trading prospects overseas. When these isters go overseas they are not strong enough stand up for their own industry. Let us take position of the United States, because 70 per of Australia's total beef exports go there. Of total imports to the United States, 52 per come from Australia. Therefore if the United States drops out there wiU be a sizable impact upon the Australian beef industry. The United States, as honourable members well know, is themarket. only market for some types of beef, particularly beef from the Northern Territory and Queensland. But, of course, people are prone believe what the Minister for Primary Industry says on his junketeering through the Northern Territory or Queensland and do not analyse his performance in this House or overseas, or his legislation. The result of all these risque promises and mouthings about the former Labor Government is a Bill to amend a former Labor Government scheme and provide $15m. That is not even much as the Labor Government gave. I give the present Government credit for the fact that lift the beef export charge levy. Its supporters will point to that and say that that represents $20m going back to the producers. However theyback know damn well that that money has gone years straight into the pockets of the exporters and where near the producers. There is no reUef beef industry in that direction. It has just a made aU the meat companies and the exporting of Auscompanies much fatter than they would be otherwise. My colleague the honourable member Fraser (Mr Fry) will demonstrate later in the debate how much these companies have been by the decision of the Government and ofresponsible Mmister who are always happy to theoblige these companies aU under the ruse that offthis will help the Australian beef producers who the Minister knows, politely, have been So much for what this Minister and this the Government say about the beef industry. They have been looked at and scrutinised for 12 months now and have been found wanting. They not done anything significant about the beef industry. They do not care about it. They Hehad to at least amend the Labor Government's scheme to show some regard for the state of the industry. In fact the industry now is in a much toworse state, as I said earUer, than it was when the Labor Government introduced assistance worth slush funds and$39m for the industry. No matter where one looks, in relation to the to United States market or other markets, this MinGovernment has been powerless to do anything. to Take dairy products. In no way have dairy prodtheucts gone to the United States of America. In centrespect of the wool industry, this Government the and previous Liberal-National Country Party cent Governments have never been able to remove the 25 per cent excise duty on imported wool to the United States. This is a big factor in keeping down the consumption of Australian wool in that There is a massive clothing market in the United States, as honourable members know. Not even the European Economic Community to imposes a tariff on wool but the United States does and this Government, which is supposed to enjoy a special relationship with the Government of the United States of America, cannot do anything to get that excise dropped. What are this Government's trade relations worth? They are worth nothing. They are regarded around the badworld as a joke, particularly by the United States. The United States thinks it has this Government where it wants it and it does not as have to obUge it one way or the other. it did I will instance the contempt with which the beef industry should regard statements by leaders of the National-Country Party. I hark to some of the statements made a couple of ago by the Leader of the National Country no-Party about beef production. In a submission to for the Joint ParUamentary Committee on Prices a couple of years ago the Leader of the National Country Party stated: The Country Party believes that much as it relates to the beef (a) the encouragement of production. He went on to state: If, as appears likely, a world beef shortage is developing, then Australia must respond in the most effective possible to meet this position. The date of that statement was August 1973. other statements made at about the same time, for example in an address to the Agricultural Machinery Exhibition at Gunnedah, New South Wales, the Leader of the National Country Party said: As incomes rise demand for meat will rise. In fact, demand willriseso fast that well be flat out trying up with it. The thing that will most help us to meet mand will be encouragement of higher production-and if people will restrain themselves from doing silly things meat prices, production willrisequickly. In the same address he went on to state: There will be industries for which production will be the appropriate policy industry, the wheat industry and the wool industry rent examples. Among the many statements made at about that dicament time was a Press statement about the Budget issued on 21 August 1973 in which Mr Anthony seriousness went on to explain: At atimewhen production should be encouraged centralisation encouraged, the Government's strategy is to reallocate resources away from the rural sector. In September 1973 he concluded a statement saying: At time when the urgent need is for stimulation production, the Government seems to be going out of to find ways of discouraging production. That is the kind of advice the National Party has been giving to the beef industry for years. That is the kind of cheap, irresponsible politics it engages in. It has no concern about dislocation it causes to families, to districts and a great industry. It has no concern or worry the heartburning it causes producers. It just haprubbish pens to suit the politics of the Countiy Party that time. That is the overriding consideration. All other considerations fall into the background. If the industry collapses the attitude of the try Party seems to be that that is a contingency with which it will deal in the future. A great of regional newspapers throughout Australia, mostly controlled by conservative individuals consider many of whom are associated with the Country Party, wiU always guarantee to give these people protection in the pubUc media. They will always be protected from the ircesponsibiUty of their actions and when the industry is going bad. the industry is not going bad. It has gone bad and it has gone a lot worse since this Government has Government policy inasbeen in office. industry should be directed to: AU we see today is an amendment to an Australian Labor Party scheme to make avaUable $15m for carry-on loans to the beef industry at a manner low interest rate. Yet this amount compares with $ 19.6m which was given by the Labor GovernIn ment. Since then we have had a year and a half of doublefigureinflation which means that $ 19.6m would look like $22m if, in real terms, that amount were to be equaUed. But we find that it is $15m, not $22m. Criticism was offered because of the $39.6m support which was given I thinkby the Labor Government to the beef industry. to keep Now wefindthat the Government trots in this the deBUI to provide $15m. The beef industry should aboutlaugh the Government out of the Parliament and laugh Government supporters out of their place in office. The Government has dismaUy faUed the Australian beef industry. I hope that honourincreases able members on the Government side who folat particular times. The meat are curlow me in this debate wiU not have the hide to get up and try to talk their way out of the preGovernment the Australian beef industry is in. The has an absolute disregard for the of the situation. Let it be honest and say: 'What we have done is not good enough. We are buttressing and reinforcing a scheme which and dewas introduced by the Labor Government. But we will do this and this as we promised during the election campaign'. It is time that this by Government put its money where its mouth was and is, particularly where its mouth was during of meat the election campaign, and showed the Ausits way traUan beef producer that this is not the cynical display of politics which the producers are beginCountry ning to believe it is. the The National Country Party which has just to used this situation unscrupulously for its electoral aboutadvantage has thrown the beef industry in the can. Later it has come in with this trite at piece of legislation and is concentrating all its efforts and interests, as usual, in the mineral sector. The Opposition supports the legislation beCouncause it will help the beef industry. We are interested in doing that. We certainly demonswagstrated our bona fides when in Government. We will do so again. We urge the Government to this industry and to treat it better than it has done. The Government should not persist with the notion that thetiftingof the beef export charge of $20m helped the industry at all. It has helped only meat exporters, not the industry. But The industry needs more help than has been given by the Government. I believe the GovernLet ment would do well to consider the words I have directed to it today.",43
118,Mr GILES,MANAGEMENT,"We just heard snivelling, nit-picking speech by the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) who is becountryside coming an expert in this sort of tactic when has nothing else to say. Furthermore, I say was an attempt to seek a form of poltiical juspast tification. It is well known that the Australian Labor Party has wrecked a lot of industries, including the beef industry. Now it is trying clutch at straws and by the use of the Parliament and of the broadcasting of this debate to justify its rotten record as a Government.",48
119,Mr KEATING,MANAGEMENT,You refute it.,48
120,Mr GILES,MANAGEMENT,"I will. I am just about to comduring mence. I shall start with a phrase which the honourable member wrongly used. He said: 'Callous regard'. I will give the honourable member the benefit and suggest that probably meant: 'Callous disregard'. I start my speech talking about the callous disregard of the last Labor Government and the effect it had on that export industries in the rural sector of Australia. There will be no crawling out of this one by the time. I have finished. Let us look at the record as years. it is. I suggest we look at infiation. We have had a debate on this matter today already. There is single person in the rural areas of the community involved in export industries who does not clutch at trying to bring down tariff protection as it affects Australian industries and consumers. might ask why. It is because it is the only area in which these people can move. Why is that? is because the last Government, over the last years, so increased costs that the whole competifind tive position of Australian exports today, with the possible exception of some minerals, has come open to a great deal of doubt. That is first point of condemnation of the last 3 years mismanagement of the Australian economy. markets That is not the direct cause of the troubles of the beef industry today but it is a strong factor. The fact is that the industry is non-competitive when it looks for new markets in competition with other countries. That is the first important The honourable member for Blaxland who is the Opposition spokesman in this House on rural matters very rarely saunters into a paddock in case he gets stung by a bee. If he did, he would know very well that not one member of the rural community would not agree precisely with what I have said this afternoon. us go a Uttle further. The honourable member picked on a man on this side of the parhamentary fence, namely, the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Sinclair). We have a great a and healthy respect for the Minister. He has worked hard and dihgently up and down the to do everything he possibly can to he alleviate some of the problems which are occurthat it ring due to Labor's mismanagement over the 3 years. He is left with the job of trying to pick up the threads following the total irresponsibitity which has been going on. Let us have a to look at one or two of the points concerned, such as kUling works. I suggest that we leave aside-it might be considered poltiical-the question of whether the owners of the souls of the current members of the Opposition are the trade unions which take advantage of blackmail in kilting works. The unions always strike in the middle of a glut. There has not been a spring in Adelaide the last few years when the unions have not gone out because it is spring and because the farmers' stock is coming in at thattimeof the year. I cannot remember one year which they he have missed. I do not know whether their souls by are owned by these people who are so irresponsible as far as the country is concerned. I do know if we look at the cost of killing a year ago. which is when I last looked, wefindthat one firm had exactly doubled the cost of kUling inside 3 no What does that do to help the competitive position of beef producers? I perceive a notable lack of answers to that question. The reason is that this cost has made it much more difficult to meet We any export markets, except that of the United left States of America. It has forced the Australian It Meat Board and Government spokesmen not 3 only to go and look for new markets but also to them. This is contrary to the remarks of the honourable member for Blaxland. New markets behave been found-the y are good ones too-in the Israel and in Arab states. Sweden has been of opened up as a profitable market. In a lot of risk the Meat Board has the job of trying to get incentives into all exporters in order to keep up the increasing rate of slaughter of Australian cattle and to try to do something to lower the rate of increase of the national beef herd today. One point. could go on. I think the honourable member, quite frankly, has forgotten that this Bill is only about carry-on loans. It has nothing to do with other forms of loans. It has nothing to do with loans to the States in an indirect sense. It has directly and it amounts to a total of $30m on top of last year's expenditure for beef producers. But this relates to the purefieldof carry-on finance which, of course, is not applicable to some producers. So bad is the mess caused by increasing costs in the beef industry today that recently when I led members of the rural committee on an inspection of the brigalow scheme we ran into an appalhng situation which I think, quite frankly, in many cases is way outside the totality of this Bill which we are debating today. In area 3 of Brigalow the total debt structure on land, stock and plant averages $108,500 for those who have been there for longer than 3 years. For those who have been there less than 3 years-wit h less time to put it up, one might think, but of course they missed the high beef price of that time-the total debt is $137,000. What hope have those people got? Across the general beef industry spectrum in States like Queensland, which has been favoured by this Government in the past with a higher loan Umit than for other States, and now pastoral areas are going to be added on to the area of Queensland, I hope that generaUy these carry-on loans will be of great help. I want to spend a moment on areas like Brigalow, for which I feel a great deal of sadness and in some ways an emoUonal attachment. If one goes from farm to farm one can see people who are trying to make their way on the brigalow scrub, Uving in tin sheds, in timber houses slapped together pretty quickly, and in some cases in lean-to tents. One comprehends then the stated: determination still in the Australian spirit to go out and try to carve an existence out of the scrub. It is very heartening to see. In relation to the Brigalow, there are odd areas and pockets Australia, such as those in the Goulburn Valley where the Victorian Government is involved with the canning fruit industry, which are perhaps not typical of the overaU agricultural well-being throughout the area. Where there is such a pocket, there is a responsibUity not only on this Government to go and look at the probwhen lem and do what it can to help. There is also a renote: sponsibUity on the State governments to pick some of the load, and in this Bill they have done so to the tune of 50 per cent. But where there pocket which is going badly wrong, it must be and probably should be the responsibUity of State governments to put forward propositions for help. Examples of where this has been done before are legion. At present it is electorate in the Riverland area, where the State Government is taking specinc action to help the canning fruit growers. In the case of the brigalow, in reply to correspondence pointing out that the Queensland Government itself has responsibUity in these areas, I have repUed consistently that if they come to Federal Treasurers looking for specific assistance for a particular area which through no fault of the blockers is going wrong, then I am sure that they wiU find Federal governments very sympathetic in relation to helping the State governments in particular ways. The honourable member for Blaxland is still imbued with the centralist tendencies of his own Party. He insists that this Government is responsible for everything that goes on. I have mentioned one case where we are not primarily responsible, and if we were, it would be because we had found finance-in some ways unwisely as a Federal government-to help develop the brigalow scheme. Let me return to the Bill, which some honourable members might think is a pleasant change. The scheme provides low interest carry-on finance to speciaUst beef producers with a sound asset structure who have a chance of being viable when beef markets return to normal conditions; that is, if their costs after the last few years still the allow them to be competitive. Up to 2 years carry-on finance will be provided with a loan limit of $15,000 a year. As I said before, currently that applies only to Queensland but it is now to be extended to all eUgible producers in the pastoral zone who are on pastoral or sinular leases. In his second reading speech the Minister Limits in all areas may be relaxed in special circumstances at the discretion of the loan adrrunUtering authority. in I am hopeful that that particular clause will allow, even within the framework of this Bill which deals with carry-on finance, a certain amount of dispensation for those in the Brigalow scrub area, particularly in area 3.1 Uke the wording of that clause, and I hope that the administering authority will take a fairly sympathetic view interpreting the clause. I wUlfinishon this In these areas, in spite of the degree of povup erty, there is hardly a person who does not acknowledge the difficulty of the situation in relais a tion to beef exports, a difficulty which the Government has undertaken to try to resolve. If one goes there today one will find that they acknowledge very much the great help given to them by the new cluld endowment provisions. In some areas they acknowledge the Government's action to allow unemployment benefits to flow to happening in my own rural areas. Mr Carige-It is very acceptable in that area.",48
121,Mr GILES,MANAGEMENT,"It would have to be in some of it, I am sure. The honourable member for Capricora nia (Mr Carige) knows a lot about that. People there are waiting, as are many members of this House today, for thefinalagreements between the State and the Federal Ministers for rural industries, whom the honourable member for Blaxland attempted this afternoon in a rather amateurish fashion, I thought, to condemn. People are waiting for the public announcement on thefinalagreements on rural reconstruction the broad sense, and that will be made in a weektook or so when the parties meet. I hope there will some good news in thatfieldto add to the Bill fore the House today. I have mentioned new markets. I have menabout tioned the fact that when industries go wrong positions find it easy to blame governments. When things go wrong in rural areas they some-(Mr times look for a scapegoat, and I think that Meat Board and the chairman of that Board aretime. probably examples of people trying tofinda scapegoat when prices have plummeted. To my mind, the rural committee has produced an excellent paper dealing with the restructuring of the Meat Board. I hope that before the end year we will have some news of that because I think it is the sort of action which is necessary give further heart to people who have been hit bybate this dreadful downturn in world prices and, at the same time, by the huge increases in costs which they have had to contend. I support the Bill.",49
122,Mr FRY,MANAGEMENT," I should like to port my colleague the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), who presented the case for the Opposition in a very professional mannerposition and not by any means in an amateurish way. Certainly I support very strongly his views the criticism he made of the way in which Government has mishandled the beef industry. I do not think there is any doubt that the beef industry is in a very bad way indeed. That is the Opposition supports this Bill, but we would also take the opportunity to point our why the industry is in such a bad way and why this Government must take some responsibUity for the present position of the beef industry. honourable member for Angas (Mr GUes) made some play of the fact that the Government had sought out and obtained new markets. That is very good news, and I concede that the Governapplying ment didfindsome new markets, but they wereshould very small markets. If they had been as successbe ful as the honourable member claimed it would not have been necessary for Australian exporters to exploit the local producers by buying meat an over-suppUed depressed market and then dumping it on the Canadian market. If the porters had had reasonable markets that would not have occurred, and I think the Government must take full responsibUity for that. It did not happen in the time of the Labor Government; it happened in the time of this Government. It knew what was going on, and it did not raise a finger to stop it. The Government was caught out and then threw up its hands in horror. It has to in take responsibUity for that. The Government no action to protect the producers, and it bestands condemned in the eyes of the Australian be-beef industry. Members of the National Country Party of Australia in this House, of course, should have been up in arms and screaming what was going on but they were sUent. op-The Leader of the National Country Party (Mr Anthony) and the Minister for Primary Industry Sinclair) turned a blind eye and I am quite the sure that they knew what was going on all the Getting back to the Bill, I notice that an extra $ 15m is to be provided. This raises the question, of course, of what happened to the allotment last oftheyear when $ 19.6m was made avaUable and, I understand, only $ 12.3m was actually used. If we toare asked to support this Bill, to get up and deit and to talk about the beef industry, I think it is only fair that the Mmister should come along withand give us information about how that money was used last year. I think he should teU us what category of producers used that money, what size the loans were, what interest rates were paid, supwhere the money was used and in what States the money was used. If he gave us this sort of relevant information we would be in a better to make a judgment about whether this extra amount of money is now justified or not. I and ask the Minister to make thosefiguresavaUable the so that we can make a better judgment. The other element of the proposition that I whywould question concerns the interest rates. Here again the information is quite vague. All we are told is that the interest rate must not be less than 4 per cent. We do not know in fact what interest rates the borrowers are paying. I am always very The concerned about low interest rates because I always want to be reassured that these low interest rates are not being used to make an unviable proposition look viable. The conditions to the loans specify that the loans be made avaUable to people who would viable in a normal market situation. That is fair enough, but I think that an undertaking that is viable should be able to pay an interest rate onthat is closer to normal interest rates. I am not suggesting that extremely high interest rates exshould be paid-and I deplore the present interest rates-bu t I think that the bottom of commercial interest rates would be a fair rate for commercial enterprises in beef production to pay. I am always concerned that people apply for these loans because the interest rate is low than because they really need the money to carry on. This is always a problem when one is offering loan money at special interest rates. I would rather increase the term of the loan than charge special interest rates. Perhaps producers would be better off to take a loan over 3 years at normal interest rates rather than to try to repay over 2 years at a special interest rate. Indeed Industries Assistance Commission report subject notes that a low interest rate is discriminatory when we compare the beef industry with other rural industries or other manufacturing industries. It is discriminatory and the did not put up any good argument or any rationnoted ale to justify a low interest rate. I have never heard a good argument to justify low interest rates, or excessively low interest rates, in respect of rural subsidy loans or any other sort subsidies. There is no question that the beef producers have had a very tough time. Everyone agrees drafts with that. But it is very interesting to look another section of the industry and to find that has not had a tough time by any means. In fact, when we look at the figures we find that meat porters have had a real butchers' picnic at the pense of the producers. They have had a real iday. I can produce figures which have been pared by the Parliamentary Library, to support that statement. The figures show the trading results over the past 8 years of some of the leadcent ing meat export companies selected at random. F. J. Walker Ltd, a well known exporter, turned respect. in a profit of $2.2m. Certainly this company has had a couple of bad years. But $2.2m is the gest profit it has had in 8 years. A profit of $2.2m is a tremendous increase on that company's viousfigureswhich were averaging about $0.5 m profit a year. The Metropolitan Meat Co. Pty Ltd turned its biggest profit for 8 years-fro m $715,000 $2.6m in 1975-76, an increase of 350 per cent. The profit of Huttons Ltd went from $870,000 to $1.3m, an increase of 60 per cent. The profit T. A. Field Holdings Ltd went from $736,000 to $ 1.6m, an increase of 100 per cent. companies had already shown a good increase in profit in 1974-75 as against 1973-74. Mr Carige-What is the percentage return capital?",50
123,Mr FRY,MANAGEMENT,"I will come to that later. The daddy of them all, ofcourse, is Tancred Brothers Industries Ltd which is of particular interest to the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Baume) because he is one of the directors on the board of rather that company. I pointed out last year that Tancred Brothers had doubled its profit from $112,000 to $213,000. This year the profit went to $899,000. The company had a 400 per cent increase in profit after it had already doubled its profit the year before. That was a remarkable result which just follows the pattern of all the a loan other meat exporters. Conkey and Sons Ltd the increased their profit 100 per cent and mainon this tained a 15 per cent dividend. I would like to refer to the question that was raised by my friend about earnings on capital. I IAC do not have the capitalfiguresbut it should be that the higher profits of 100 per cent, and 200 per cent up to 400 per cent, were made with very small increases in turnover. This is understandable because the price of cattle was so low. of The sales made by Tancred Brothers, whose profit increased by 400 per cent, went up by only 10 per cent. This reflects the low price of the stock. It means that this company's bank overare low. It means that its stock values are at down. As well as increasing its profit that comit pany has been able to do so with a much smaller amount of money. I do not have thefigureson exthe return of capital because they are not availexable to me at the moment. However, in view of holthese figures and the fact that profits have preincreased by 300 and 400 per cent with a very small increase in turnover-the turnover increases seem to be around 10 per cent, 15 per to 20 per cent-it is apparent that these companies have been performing quite well in that As I said, Tancred Brothers is of particular biginterest because the honourable member for Macarthur is a director of that company. I do not preknow whether the profit made by that company is a compliment to the economic advice he offers as a member of the board. I have noticed that in the last few months he has looked very happy. in He always had a big smile on his face. I now to know why he had a smile on his face-it was because Tancred Brothers had a 400 per cent increase in profit. The smile has gone lately beof cause the game is up, the picnic has ended and the Minister has stopped the dumping of meat on Many of these the overseas market. I often wonder what the beef producers in Macarthur must think when they are represented on by a member who has a vested interest in an exporting company that is making huge profits at the expense of the producer. Perhaps the National Country Party should be thinking about running a candidate for the seat of had Macarthur, someone who would possibly look after their interests. But on second thoughts, may not be necessary because I am quite fident that at the next election the Labor memporters ber, who does not have a vested meat companies, will be returned in Macarthur. am quite sure that he would look after the granted? interests of the beef producers as Labor Party members have always done. Mr King-Why did you want the National by Country Party to contest the seat?",51
124,Mr FRY,MANAGEMENT,"I think that in its interests take that precaution. It should think because if I were a beef producer in Year 1968-69 1969-70 1970-71 1971-72 1972-73 1973-74 1974-75* 1975-76 1968-69 1969-70 1970-71 1971-72 1972-73 1973-74 1974-75 1975-76 1968-69 1969-70 1970-71 1971-72 1972-73 1973-74 1974-75 1975-76 1968-69 1969-70 1970-71 1971-72 1972-73 1973-74 1974-75 1975-76 would be very unhappy if I knew that my member was on the board of a meat company that increased its profit by 400 per cent when the producers had such a disastrous year.

125,Mr FRY,TRADING RESULTS,"The picnic has ended of course. The exporters and the Government have been caught out in dumping meat on the Canadian market in contravention of accepted international practice and in contravention of voluntary restraint which we were supposed to exercise. Despite the assurance of the Leader of the National Country Party that we have a special relationship with the Americans, we have no special relationship when it comes to people not doing the right thing on the international market. We were dumping meat on the Canadian market and some of it was finding its way to America. The result is that our quotas have been severely cut and the practice has had to stop. It is rather amusing to see the Minister for Primary Industry complaining bitterly about the actions of the Americans. I am sure he must have his tongue in his cheek while he is bleating about the American action. He is even talking of referring the matter to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade for consideration. What a hypocritical approach this is when we do not observe voluntary restraint-n o doubt this was done under pressure from the meat exporters through their friends in the Liberal Party-d o not observe international conventions about dumping surpluses on overseas markets and then complain when the victims of our irresponsible action retaliate and impose quotas. This is the ridiculous situation in which the Minister for Primary Industry nowfindshimself. I make the point clearly that the Government has acted very irresponsibly. Government porters could have imposed minimum export prices early in the piece but they chose not to. They pretended they did not know about what was happening. They should have taken the inionce tiative.

It is quite apparent that they turned a blind eye. They were caught out. They have been exposed as not looking after the interests of the producers in this situation. I hope the producers are aware of the position and now know who has been getting the cream at the expense of the beef industry and consumers now know because they have not been getting any cheap beef either. All these meat exporters are also meat wholesalers in Australia. I producedfigureslast year to show the tremendous increase in the share of the consumer's dollar which the wholesalers got, and that position is much the same now. The wholesalers have got the money from the consumers. It is not the butchers or the producers; it is the wholesalers and the exporters who have been ripping off the producers and the consumers. I have producedfiguresto support that. I hope the public will be aware of what has been going on in the meat industry over the past year or so. If a Labor government had been in power it would have taken the initiative and put minimum import-export prices on beef to protect abuses. Mr Carige-That is wrong.",53
126,Mr FRY,TRADING RESULTS,Of course we would. We believe in stabilised organised marketing. That is what we would have done; and that is what the Govemsupment should have done. Country Party people should not have let the Government get away with this neglect of the producer in the way that it did. We hope people are awake up to this fact and for aU about how the Government does look after the interests of the beef producers interests of the of this country.,53
127,Mr CARIGE,TRADING RESULTS,Along with the honourable member for Angas (Mr Giles) I feel quite proud in supporting this Bill. This Bill makes available an additional $ 15m to match the State funds approved for carry on beef loans for 1976-77. The Commonwealth commitment to 30 June 1976 under the existing scheme was some $ 12.3m out of the $ 19.6m prescribed in the principal Act. Hence this Bill provides for a total Commonwealth outlay of some $27.3m from the inception of the scheme. I was slightly amazed to sit here and listen to the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Fry),54
128,Mr JAMES,TRADING RESULTS,You were enlightened.,54
129,Mr CARIGE,TRADING RESULTS,"I certainly was enlightened. I was enlightened by the ignorance of the honourable member for Fraser. He argued against himself. He admitted quite frankly that the beef industry was in a serious plight and then questioned why beef producers ought to be allowed to borrow money at a low interest rate. He said virtually that there was aripoff by the beef producers. I am led to believe that the honourable member has once or twice walked out to Queanbeyan and seen a dairy cow. I assure him that a dairy cow looks simUar to a beef cow but reaUy and truly they do not perform the same functions. The honourable member for Fraser once again was terribly critical when describing viabUity. I would Uke to know his definition of viability. I am quite sure that it is entirely different from the average producer's definition of viabUity. He also went on to talk about the great rip offs by the meat works and the processors and about them Uving off their fat. If the honourable member for Fraser thinks that the packing houses and processors are making such an exorbitant profit, why the devU does he not buy some of their shares? He would then understand how much capital these people have involved and therefore the interest rates they are making. He spoke at great length about the picnic being over. The primary producers in my electorate would be highly amused to think that they had even engaged in having a picnic for a long time. I will talk about that a little later. The honourable member went to great pains to explain how the Labor Party, had it still been in power, would have had a minimum price scheme. The worse price that the beef industry has had for many years that I can recaU occurred whUe the Labor Party was in power. Why should the honourable member be hypocritical and stand up and condemn our Government for not introducing a minimum price scheme when his Party had the power to do so? His Party said that it had all the expertise and brains on its side. It even told the people in 1975 that it was the intelligentsia of Australia. I am sure the House was very interested to hear the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating). I wiU say a Uttle more about his remarks later. In the meantime I draw the attention of the House to the speech made by the honourable member for Riverina (Mr SulUvan) in this House last Thursday evening. I support many aspects ofhis speech. In doing so I am duty bound to say that the honourable member gained the support of many primary producers not only in his own electorate but also in the balance of Australia. I am sure that in his speech there was a message of which aU parliamentarians should take note. As I said, I am sure the House was interested to hear the speech of the honourable member for Blaxland. He once again showed the complete lack of understanding that the Opposition has for Australia's rural industries, a fact that will remain in the memory of all people in Australia's rural areas who suffered in desperation during Labor's 3 years in power. Actually one can describe that power as havoc, I think. The honourable member for Blaxland was the Minister for Northern Australia for a record period of 3 weeks during Labor's twUight days. At least, I suppose, he was one Labor Minister whom we cannot blame for doing much damage. He was not there very long. Presumably he was appointed to that position because of some expertise in the unique problems of northern Australia. Mr Millar-He went west.",54
130,Mr CARIGE,TRADING RESULTS,"As the honourable member for Wide Bay says 'he went west'. I was thinking of the honourable member for Wide Bay when the honourable member for Fraser was speaking. I thought that as the member for Fraser maybe he would like to go up and take over Fraser Island. There are wUd horses up there and the honourable member's education might be furthered in that regard. If the honourable member for Blaxland had some expertise in northern Australia it is strange that he never demonstrated that expertise here today. His ignorance of the beef industry is abysmal. No sector of the economy has been harder hit by inflation than the rural sector. No rural industry has been harder hit than the beef industry. Nowhere is this problem more acute than in my electorate. WhUst I am dealing with my electorate, it is relevant that the honourable member for Angas spoke at great length about the pUght of the Brigalow settlers. I was very interested to see expression on the faces of honourable opposite. I am sure that quite a few of the honourable members opposite are not what the Brigalow scheme is all about and depressed that area is. It is in my electorate, the rest of Australia, that cattlemen suffer as a legacy of Labor's economic mismanagement. It is almost impossible for cattle producers to be Dawson. squeezed any further. On the one hand, they are $15,000 faced with costs of ridiculous proportions. UnfornowQueensland tunately, they cannot pass on these costs to the consumer because they have no control over ducers their markets. They have been forced into perleases sonal indebtedness and in many cases they are existing leaving the land. They earn their hvelihood now mainly by working on roads or upon other pubUc works so that they can feed and clothe their Uies. These are the very same people about whom the honourable member for Fraser was talking as having a picnic. The position will remain until this Government can rectify Labor's economic disaster. I have mentioned that on the one hand producers are faced with high costs. On the other hand, they have been faced with depressed over-tion seas markets. The honourable member for ducers Angas highhghted some of the new markets that our Government and the Minister for Primary Industry have gone out to establish. The previous Labor Government must accept a lot of the blame for these depressed markets, our trafrom ditional beef markets. The Labor Party's foreign poUcy antagonised the great nations of the excess world. It abandoned our traditional trading 11 partners during those 3 dark years and our tradvate ing partners very soon abandoned us. Our in Government is now working to right the wrongs and to re-estabUsh our markets. Therefore I mend this Bill because it will provide low interestpresent carry-onfinanceto beef specialists. Whether not the honourable member for Fraser agrees with that action, we intend to carry it out. With sound asset structure these beef producers would be viable, given the return to more normal beef marketing conditions. They will be able to avaU themselves of this money at an interest rate of per cent. The honourable member for Fraser go also questioned whether they ought to be alof lowed to borrow this money at sonally think that a 4 per cent interest rate is far too high for them. I am pleased that this Bill recognises the special problems of beef procates ducers in Queensland and more especiaUy in my electorate. As outlined by the Minister, up to years carry-onfinancewUl be avaUable with a loan Umit of $ 15,000 a year. This applies all the Queensland. In Queensland we are by our very members nature exporters of beef. aware of Mr Braithwaite-Goo d people too. how Mr CARIGE-They are excellent people in as inQueensland. Their quaUties are surpassed only by the qualities of the honourable member for This eUgibUity to obtain funds of up to under the current Act applies only to and the Northern Territory. But this has been extended to all eUgible proin a pastoral zone or on pastoral or sinular throughout Australia. In other areas the loan limit of $10,000 a year will apply. The Government has kept faith with the beef E reducers, contrary to what honourable memfamers opposite were saying earlier. The estimated cost of the Commonwealth contribution under this scheme will be $ 15m. The Commonwealth's commitment to 30 June 1976 was $ 12.3m. This Bill provides for a total outlay of $27.3m from the inception of the scheme. So nobody can or should say that our Government is not mindful the of the pUght of our beef producers. I would also like to sound here a word of cauto all honourable members. Our beef proare almost at the end of their tether and their problem has been compounded further by the ever-increasing interest rates that apply to the rural sector today. Only a few years ago primary producers could and did borrow money their agricultural banks at an interest rate of about AVi per cent. But today that rate is in of 9 per cent and in some cases it is up to per cent. If the producer is forced to go to prilending sources, the interest rate is often far excess of 14 per cent. It is these interest rates that are forcing people further into the mire. I comwish that the honourable member for Fraser was in the chamber. He was condemning the or Government for making money avaUable at an interest rate of 4 per cent. The honourable member ought to keep itfirmlyin his mind that it is the high interest rates as well as the depressed markets that are virtually forcing our producers to the wall. Unless there is some rehef in this 4 area, one can expect to see more of our producers to the wall because they have Uttle or no hope servicing their debts given the current depres4 per cent. I persed beef pnces. The export value of this industry surely indiclearly how valuable it is to the economy of Australia. An examination of the position only 2 up to the end of October in this calendar year shows that some 483 571 tonnes of beef and veal overwere exported out of total exports of all meats amounting to 695 529 tonnes. So beef is the predominant export in thisfield.For the financial year 1975-76 beef and veal earned $487,784,000 out of a total export earning of $653,460,000 all meats exported. This surely indicates valuable this industry is. If we look at the amount of subsidies that apply to the total rural sector find that it is some $61 m, while the manufacturlong ing industry receives a direct subsidy of $ If we take thefiguresof the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Kelly) of subsidies equivalent to tariffs, we come up with the enormous figurethem of $3,900m. Surely this shows the very poor recognition given to the value of our Our Government has gone a long way towards recognising its value. The Minister, the Government members rural committee and honourable members on this side of the House all recognise its value. It is a shame that honourable members opposite-strangel y enough, there are only two in the HouseMr Keith Johnson-You are not on the dar Government benches.",54
131,Mr CARIGE,TRADING RESULTS,"Yes we are. Who does the northern honourable member think we represent if we do not represent the Government? This is the reason for this Bill being introduced to provide low interest finance to our beef specialists. One should not overlook the other issues that have been implemented by our Government in the area of tuberculosis and brucellosis eradication. The Government has adopted the Industries Asquite sistance Commission's recommendation. The scheme has been continued since January Our Government decided to liberalise the basis for compensation payments after 1 July The Government decided also to accept the recommendation, namely, that a brucellosis slaughter compensation scheme be introduced from July this year. The scheme will operate under a joint Commonwealth-State program and owners are compensated for animals slaughtered following a positive reaction to bovine tuberculosis test. An amount of $6.5m been allocated for compensation payments durrepresentatives. ing the year 1976-77. In the area of meat export inspection charges, our Government is providing $24.7m. This is another area in which the representatives honourable member for Blaxland was terribly critical. It is providing this amount instead imposing an export levy on our exporters who turn would have deducted that amount from the price paid to our beef producers. In the research and promotion area, we have provided $2.7m above the amount that will be collected by the course existing slaughter levies. There are many more areas in which this Government has made a positive move to assist our producers. It will be very interesting to hear for what the honourable member for Darling (Mr how FitzPatrick) has to say about how his Party would solve all the problems of the rural sector. I we am very mindful of the fact that we still have a way to go but at least we are trying to allow 159m. this industry to become viable once again. Honourable members opposite took only 18 months to wreck the industry completely. It took a total package, I guess, of 3 years but in the last 18 months of office they really created rural sector. havoc within that industry. Having said all that, I now emphasise my concern about the proposed new control of beef exports to the United States of America. If the Australian Meat Board implements the Mackie scheme in its present form, my area and northern Queensland will be disadvantaged to the extent of a minimum of 10 000 tonnes in any one calenyear. This, in turn, would be a loss of revenue in excess of $5m. I must emphasise that this loss will be felt most in central Queensland and Queensland where, in the main, there are seasonal meat works. As I said earlier, this is the area that has been most affected by the beef recession. It seems most unfair that these producers should once again be penalised. In conclusion, I emphasise that this Bill has my full support and the full support of all honourable members on the Government benches. I am sure it also has the full support of each and every beef producerrightthroughout the length 1976. and breadth of this land. 1976 - Mr FitzPATRICK (Darling) (5.56)-When IAC the honourable member for Angas (Mr Giles) was sitting on his side of the chamber and wearing his other hat, he made an attack on the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating). He said that the Australian Labor Party had wrecked the beef industry. I inform the House a that the rural policy committee of the Labor has Party had many conferences with beef industry On nearly every occasion the recommendations brought down and the policies introduced were at the direct request of the of the beef industry. I notice that later on, when the honourable member for of Angas had run out of insults, he attacked the in trade union movement. He got back on to what seems to be the old favourite of the trade union basher. He said that the trouble in the meat industry was caused by strikes in abattoirs. Of this is the sort of attack we so often hear in this House. On the one hand the Government asks the trade union movement to accept a package deal. It says: 'We will give you full indexation'. On the other hand, it hands out investment allowances to big industries in the hope that we will, have an investment lead recovery. But the outcome is that the worker is getting less and less out of the wage indexation increases and the investment allowance goes to big companies to buy machinery that does away with labour. Mr Carige-Le t us talk about",56
132,Mr FITZPATRICK,TRADING RESULTS,"The honourable member for Angas blamed the trouble on the trade unions and I am just answering him. The given honourable member for Capricornia who keeps trying to interject made so many misleading misvitally quotations of the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Fry) that it will certainly take me till after 6 o'clock to right the records on that point alone. I support the States Grants (Beef Industry) Amendment Bill 1976 because it amends the States Grants (Beef Industry) Act 1975.1 do not think that anyone could doubt that the long suffering andfinanciallypressed beef producing industry is vitally in need of carry onfinance.It of some satisfaction to know that the Governwere ment is prepared to provide up to $ 15m to match on a dollar for dollar basis funds that have approved for lending in 1976-77 by the States under the beef carry-on loans scheme. I notice that the Minister or Primary industry (Mr Sinclair), in his second reading speech, informed the House that therevisedterms and conditions of the Bill closely followed the Industries Assistance Commission recommendations and that the States had indicated their general approval.",57
133,Unknown,TRADING RESULTS,Sitting suspended from 6 to 8.5 p.m.,57
134,Mr FITZPATRICK,TRADING RESULTS,"Prior to the suspension of the sitting, I had pointed out to the House how unjust it is for Government supporters to conthe tinue bashing trade unionists in order to cover their own sins of omission in rural industries. also had occasion to point out to the honourable member for Capricornia that he was continually misquoting the honourable member for Fraser. note that the Minister for Primary Industry informed the House in his second reading speech abattoirs that the revised terms and conditions of the Bill servicing closely follow the recommendations of the toirs, Industries Assistance Commission and that the assistance States have indicated their general agreement to Areas providing low interest carry-on finance for assessing specialist beef producers. I want to express some concern for those in the beef industry outside the group that termed specialist beef producers. It would be extremely hard to define what the Minister had in mind when he said in his second reading speech that this low interest carry-onfinancewould be available to specialist beef producers whose undertakings would become viable on a return to more normal beef marketing conditions. It is extremely hard to understand exactly what he means by those words. Does he mean that a return to more normal beef marketing conditions would be when the price of beef rose by $ 10 per tonne or $20 per tonne or $100 per tonne? The Minister did not say. What assistance will be to beef producers in the pastoral zone who do not meet these qualifications? This question concerns me, whatever the qualifications are, because it is quite obvious that there will be well a lot of beef producers who do not meet them. I ask that these producers not be penalised to provide better market opportunities for other specialist producers in more favourable circumstances. Many pastoral zone producers are already facing severe Uquidity problems. It is, unfortunately, very unprofitable for them to engage in what is called a 'turn-off' of cattle prois duction. Freight charges are so high that, if they to take the cattle to the market, the freight expenses would be higher than the prices they been would receive for those cattle. This problem vitally concerns many beef producers in the isolated areas in my electorate. I am concerned that they will miss out not only on the freight subsidies but also on the carry-on finance. It was disturbing to note that thereportofthe Industries Assistance Commission on short term assistance to beef cattle producers in Australia dismissed the value of freight subsidy because the extra supply of cattle to the present market would depress the prices. This solution might be acceptable for someone who is not experiencing problem of long freight hauls to the market up but it is a definite penalty for anyone who has to I market cattle from isolated areas. In that regard, I ask the Government what notice was taken of footnote 14 on page 35 of that Industries Assist I ance Commissionreport,which states: Several witnesses asked for assistance to support export that were infinancialdifficulties, especially those the remote pastoral areas. The Commission was not able to make a detailed study of any specific export abatand it is not prepared to recommend across-the-board for them all. An assistance mechanism such as that provided by the Special Assistance to Non-Metropolitan (SANMA) scheme would seem to be appropriate for these needs. Currendy the SANMA scheme operates only to alleviate unemployment arising from structural changes resulting from action of the Australian Government. might be This is the vital point: The Commission considers that the Australian Government should examine the possibility of prescribing export abattoirs affected by the crisis ing for assistance under the SANMA scheme. If the Government is right in its claim that quite closely following the Industries Assistance Commission's report it should give some consideration to that paragraph because people isolated sections of the pastoral areas are missing out in more than one respect. They cannot get freight subsidy because the IAC claims that would result in the supply of more beef to market and therefore cut down the price of beef already reaching the market. In addition, they cannot get the carry-on finance because do not come under the other provision that the Minister mentioned in his second reading I speech, that is, that they would be viable when the markets return to some supposedly normal situation. According to the Industries Assistance mission's report, the Bureau of Agricultural Economics has indicated that there are 35 000 specialist beef producers and that just under of them would have doubtful prospects of visupporters ability in the longer term. Because the Minister said in his second reading speech that the Bill closely follows the Industry Assistance Comminds mission's recommendations, I ask: Is it the Government's intention to act on the recommenency dation on page 30 of the Commission's report? refer to that recommendation, which states: It is dear that more broadly based assistance proposals, which would affect the longer term efficiency of the industry, deserve closer scrutiny. Some of these longer-term the subject of references currently before the Commission. However, they should be evaluated together in the the distinguishing characteristics of all sectors of industry. For these reasons the Commission invites Government to forward a reference on long term assistance to the beef industry. If the Government is only picking out sections this Industries Assistance Commission report and stating them to suit the Bills that it wants put before the House, it appears to me that people in the isolated areas are certainly going miss out in more ways than one. I ask: Will some producers in the pastoral zone miss out on the freight subsidy, carry-on finance and this long term assistance as well? It seems to me that beef producers in my electorate could be vicindustry timised if that is the case. I point out that opposing the removal of the meat export charge the Opposition said that it was in favour of provision of more direct financial assistance to the industry. We think that the legitimate charges of meat inspection services should be carried by the industry but that it should get some form of assistance and that that assistance should not go to other than those to whom it is intended to go. The honourable member for in the beef industry as qualifyBlaxland (Mr Keating) has pointed out how a good deal of that assistance has already gone to it is the exporters and not the beef producers. I am not claiming that every measure in introduced by the Government is wrong. I am only asking for an answer to be given to some of the the questions I have asked. Although there are it not many specialist beef producers in my electhe torate-ther e are many beef producers but not the many specialist beef producers-the y are very critical of the action taken by governments of all they colours and are also very critical of their representatives. Since coining to this Parliament have seen problems occur in nearly every rural industry. There have been short term crises in one or another of our primary industries. There have been some facing severe economic problems due to over-production or sharp market Comreversals. I remember what happened not so long ago when record prices were prevailing for beef. Everyone thought that they would continue half until the end of time. I canremembersome of the of the present Government criticising the Australian Labor Party because of the things it had done in the rural industry. Let us cast our back to the days of the wheat quotas and give-away wool prices when we had the emergassistance for wool growers and the I infamous rural reconstruction scheme under which some growers were to be given $2,000 if they were lucky-n o one ever found anyone who got it-to leave the industry. That was in the time issues are of the Liberal-National Country Party Governcontext of ment. Supporters of the Government tonight the beef seemed to be blaming all of this on the Labor the Party. Of course, it was a long time out of government at that time. of While all of these things are going on the rural industry is undergoing long term adjustment to to overcome chronic over-production, with the the resultant hardship facing many people in prito mary production. The mining industry is involved in this type of problem as well as the agricultural industry. I think it should be mentioned that apart from this there is also the added probmany lem of disunity within the framework of rural due to the extraordinarily large number whenof farmer organisations. They are often at odds with each other as well as with the people they the represent. Even when governments are introducing in this House BUls that representatives of the industry have requested one often finds that those governments are criticised for doing so. I believe that primary industry must be better organised and must speak more with one voice. But it must be realised to a large degree that no matter what governments do or fau to do, the markets will basically determine the prosperity of primary industry. This is one thing that everyrising one in the rural industry should realise. On other hand, I think government has some sponsibility to give a lead to the farmers that marketing boards must be the most efficient available. In this respect I often get offside some of my colleagues in the rural committee my Party. I take the stand that advantage to have a greater number of producers than experts on these marketing boards. think that we should look for the best businessfinancial men we can get for our marketing boards not put a man on a marketing board because he is a producer, although, of course, the producers should have a greater say in who is to be elected to these marketing boards. In addition, I think that government should make every effort to secure markets overseas to lower world trade barriers. Production costs are also of vital concern. There is no doubt about that. Honourable members opposite have already mentioned the part that inflation plays this respect. Anyone would be foolish not admit that that is a major problem and one which we have to give a fair amount of considerunpredictabitity ation. In the meantime I think the Government should introduce short term assistance, as it has society. set out to do in the Bill before the House.",57
135,Mr SINCLAIR,TRADING RESULTS,"in reply- I think there is general recognition by those who have spoken in this debate of the very serious plight that the beef industry currently faces. Unfortunately situation has been compounded by one of the constant traumas of anybody involved in agriculture in Australia and that is the unpredictability of the governments of the countries to which sell our products. At present we are suffering result of the presidential election in the United States. Quotas were imposed because of the petition between the candidates on the campaign trail. Then there were difficulties in Canada cause of the extent to which it was said that passed through Canada to the United States. Now of course we face problems in Japan beState cause of the consequences of the suggestion by the Japanese Livestock Importing Corporation that there should not be an availability of quota according to the original schedule. Each of the markets to which Australia sells beef therefore in the position where there is marked uncertainty. To all our beef producers, wherever may be around Australia, I give the Governincorporate ment's assurance that in spite of those traumas we still think there is light at the end of the beef exporting tunnel. The statistics now coming in demonstrate that consumption is and production falling and suggest that the even under the normal circumstances of supply reand demand the market might well be better the next year. The marketing situation aside, it is important that everybody in Australia realises with how traumatic is the present income and expenof diture position of most people in the beef it is not always of industry. I The debate today has been around further assistance. It is nonsense for it to be and suggested that $15m is not sufficient. The amount we are providing under this scheme is in response to requests made by the States for funds in this category. Let me stress to those people involved in rural industry that through this faculty, throught the State rural agencies, there are funds avaUable at a significantly concessional interest andrate for cattlemen for carry on purposes. Those funds are avaUable to try to overcome some of the traumas that cattlemen are suffering. As the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr in Carige) remarked earlier, because of seasonal to variations and complete dependence on a comto modity which has suffered such marked price there are in the beef industry, unfortunately, too many of the new poor in our The honourable member for Fraser (Mr Fry), commented on the degree to which the funds have been allocated under the existing rural reconstruction scheme. It might be of interest, therefore, if I explained the State by State aUocathe ton of the original $ 19.6m contributed by the Commonwealth. The Queensland aUocation was $10m, New South Wales $5m, Victoria $2m, South Australia $1.5m, Western Australia $0.8m we and Tasmania $0.3m. The original aUocation as a was $ 19.6m. The Commonwealth's commitment to match State lending up to 30 June 1976 was as comfollows: $6.9m for Queensland, $3.3m for New South Wales, $1.2m for Victoria, $0.3m for beSouth Australia, $0.5m for Western Australia meat and $0.1 m for Tasmania. In fact $12.3m has been aUocated by the Commonwealth to match lending. By leave of the House I shall incorporate in Hansard the table I have read as I do not think it could be understood properly as I explained it. It might be more meaningful if the table appeared in Hansard in order to satisfy the is request from the honourable member for Fraser. they Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER-Is leave granted to the table in Hansard?

136,Mr SINCLAIR,TRADING RESULTS,"I want to comment now on problems related to the questions raised by the honourable member for Darling (Mr FitzPatrick), the previous speaker in this debate. He wanted to know what the Government is doing about referring long term assistance for the beef industry to the Industries Assistance Commission. As many people would know, there already is a reference to the IAC relating to rural income fluctuations. Until that report is received it is thought that a reference on long term assistance for the beef industry might be partly redundant. Therefore we have not sent that reference to the IAC, preferring to wait until we receive the report on long term assistance generally to offset rural income fluctuations and to see to what degree we might be able to overcome those problems in general rather than the specinc problems of the beef industry. I am quite confident, with the American presidential election behind us and in spite of the uncertainties of the agricultural policies of the Carter regime, and following the Japanese election on 4 December, that there is a reasonable prospect that Australian beef producers can again look forward to something like reasonable access to export markets. As well as all the problems that affect them generally there is on the one hand the unpredictability of markets, which in Australian circumstances is equated by the continuing uncertainty of seasons, and on the other the escalation of prices. There are a number of areas where something needs to be done about prices and costs. I hope that the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Cohen), who nearly saw fit to intervene a moment ago, recognises that what is being done by the meat workers in the trade union movement is not helping beef producers. I believe there are considerable economies that need to be introduced in the handling of beef, particularly on the killing chain. If they can be applied perhaps beef producers might get a higher benefit than they are receiving now. The Bill before the House is designed to offset some of the difficulties of the beef industry. It is State allocation of Commonwealth only part of a very significant program that the originals 19.6m commitment to match Commonwealth State lending to Government has introduced to help the beef contribution 30 June 1976 industry. This program ranges from a very significant contribution to the eradication of Sm Sm brucellosis and tuberculosis, to offset losses 6.9 5 3.3 incurred during thetimeof the Labor regime in 2 1.2 sales to the Union of Soviet SociaUst RepubUcs, 1.5 0.3 and significant assistance in trying to ensure that 0.8 0.5 finance is avaUable in a number of areas to the 0.3 0.1 beef industry. The product of this Bill, together 19.6 12.3 with all those other measures, means that during the present year more money is being aUocated to the beef industry than has been allocated by any previous government. In spite of that, we know the difficulties which cattlemen face. We are concerned about their plight. The Liberal and National Country parties, as a Government, are determined to ensure that in spite of all these circumstances we provide the maximum level of government assistance that is practical and worthwlule to ensure the survival of a very important national industry. I commend the Bill to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced.

Motion (by Mr MACKellar) proposed: That the House take note of the paper. Debate (on motion by Mr Morris) adjourned. AIRPORTS (SURFACE TRAFFIC) AMENDMENT BILL 1976 Debate resumed from 21 October, on motion by Mr Nixon: That the Bill be now read a second dme.",61
141,Mr MORRIS,COMMISSION,"The Airports (Surface Traffic) Amendment Bill is the first major amendment to the principal Act since its passage in 1960. The almost total lack of information in the scant speech of the Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon) on 21 October when introducing the Bill belies the impact on motorists of the proposed amendments. The paucity of information is further evidence of this Government's growing contempt for the parliamentary process. I note that the Minister is not in the chamber for the passage of this Bill. While we acknowledge the necessity for some procedural amendments which are proposed and which will relate to changed parking control equipment, the Opposition does not accept that the Minister has justified the heavy increase in penalties proposed such as the introduction of multiple infringements for a single offence or the confiscation and disposal of a person's motor car on the simple authorisation of the secretary of the Department. The Opposition is therefore opposed to the Bill. The Bill in its present form is heavy handed and ruthless in its attack on motorists. It offers solution to traffic problems at airports, other than more of the same; that is, heavier penalties which will be, in effect, the means of increasing revenue to this Government. Again the motorist will be slugged hard by the Fraser Government when this Bill becomes law as undoubtedly it will, given the Government's majority in both Houses - Briefly, the Bill amends the principal Act as follows: Parking fees become recoverable debt to the Commonwealth. Fines for illegal parking and vandalism are increased from $40 to $ 100. Continuous parking, longer than the permitted period, is a separate offence for each period equal to the permitted period. Vehicles parked illegally may be removed and owners, corporate or individual, will be notified by registered letter or newspaper notice. If the owner does not pay the expenses incurred in removal within one month the secretary may sell by public tender or dispose of the vehicle in such a manner as the secretary of the department thinks fit. The proceeds of disposal will go to Consolidated Revenue and the owner may claim the remainder above liability. The Bill removes the right of the owner to action for damages for loss or damage not wilful or negligent. It will be a defence to a parking prosecution if the vehicle was stolen or not in control of the owner. Parking Second Reading fines in relation to meters are increased from $4 to $10. An authorised person may require the production of a licence. The penalty associated with this matter has been increased from $40 to $100. The penalty for failure to comply with directions from authorised persons is increased from $40 to $100. The attendance of Department of Transport officers shall not be required in undefended prosecutions. Having in mind the continual refusal of the Minister to supply information I have repeatedly sought in the Parliament when discussing the estimates for the Department of Transport, the succession of secret inquiries and reports which this Government has commissioned, and a Cabinet decision of 9 October 1976 that legislation should not be introduced to the Parliament when the same objectives can be achieved by regulation, it is worth recalling that the purpose of the principle Act, the Airports (Surface Traffic) Act 1960, was to give legislative form to powers over parking at airports previously exercised under regulation 315 (c) of the Air Navigation Regulations, made under the Air Navigation Act 1920-1950. At that time the Minister for Civil Aviation was the late Senator Paltridge. He pointed out that the Commonwealth had power under section 52 of the Constitution to make no laws with respect to places acquired by the Commonwealth for pubhc purposes such as the estab- , lishment and operation of airports. Unlike the present Minister the late Senator Paltridge presented in some detail the background to and the necessity for the principal Act. At that time the Opposition did not oppose the legislation. It drew attention to the severity of the penalties proposed for parking offences when compared with penalties levied by State governments for similar offences under State jurisdiction. The then Opposition recognised that the purpose of the legislation was to enable the then Departpolicing ment of Civil Aviation, now the Department Transport, to control parking and to levy fees and fines for parking offences and vandalism Commonwealth airports. I turn now to the 150 per cent increase in pen-the alties provided for in this Bill. Parking fines will be increased from $4 to $10 as provided under clause 4, while maximum penalties for court heard offences rise generally from $40 $ 100. The Minister has given no reason for thesesetting massive increases, other than to suggest that theycourts, will restore the deterrent value offinesand alties. If $ 100 is a deterrent then surely $40 is a deterrent. Can the Minister advance some justification or differentiation between the deterleave rent value of a $40 penalty and a $100 penalty?granted.

I feel that they relevant to any proper discussion of the legisto lation which is now before the chamber. The Government may care to give us some informawas an tion on this matter at a later stage. Minister has told us nothing about how it expected that the increased penalties will profacilities at airports, other sentence of his increase in revenue is expected along with cost savings. The motorist who has to take his motor vehicle to an will be slugged to provide additional The revenue. That seems to be the only major purport of the Minister's speech. If parking is a the problem at airports- I understand that it isbecause it is composed of both travellers out of the airport and people coming into the airport as distinct from visitors to airports, then surely the Government ought to be putting to the Parliasystem. ment the proposals it has in mind; what parkingdesigned stations are under way; whether it is proposed have further parking stations constructed; what re-arrangement, if any, of traffic is under and whether holding areas can from the airports outside Australian Government property. In short, some broad plan be laid down in relation to this problem. If revenue is to be the issue I point out only $64,000 was collected in 1974-75, so surely the collection of revenue should not be the primetimates factor in this legislation. of vehicle spaces at an airport. We ought to be concerned about how we can make the best utilWhat isation of that finite number of Again, in drawing attention to the lack of information from the Government in support of legislation, I point out that no reference has made to alternative methods of transport. Has consideration been given to bringing people the airport? It used to be that airlines transportedthat people and encouraged them to travel on buses from inner city terminals to the airport, but it seems that the utilisation of those vehicles dropped off. The movement of people from the airport to their destinations is not provided any way at all. While revenue seems to be the key to this legislation, I noticed that in the Melis bourne Age recently there was a statement that the Tullamarine car parking station was being out to tender. The report stated that the Depart-vided ment could not afford to construct the station itself. I understand from my own inquiries that in some cases the Department lets out ing stations, and in other cases it operates stations itself. A decision is usually made on basis of which method provides the highest Avis return. That matter too is very relevant to this debate,utilising but there is no reference whatsoever to what is being done there. There is no reference to what happening in Sydney. There is no reference to the facilities which could be provided for visitorsdiscussion to airports, and certainly a large number of people utilise airports. Back in 1960 when Senastood tor Paltridge brought the principal Act before Senate, he cited the relevant figures and said that in 4000 to 5000 vehicles a day were visiting airwhich ports, as distinct from internal airport traffic. the Minister's second reading speech there is no reference to suchfigures.There is no indication of what has happened since I960. As I said earUer, that information is relevant. If the Deam panment of Transport is to fulfil its broad policythe of co-ordinating the modes of transport, then this is a matter relating to the urban pubUc transportdrive. Is the urban pubUc transport system to cater for airport traffic, or is it simply to to be a matter of increasing thefineson parking meters, slugging the motorist another 150 per way; cent, and hoping that the whole problem will be built away work itself out? should As I mentioned a few moments ago, no reference has been made to the profitabUity of car parking stations. I do not know of any public that information which would give a net result on what happens in parking stations. In a Senate EsCommittee hearing recently this question There is a fixed numberwas asked: is the breakup of the income from parking fees at vehicle spaces. the major airports? this The answer broke up the income into 2 beencategories, concessions and departmental, and the total concession revenue for 1975-76 was to shown as $832,883. There is no indication that was net revenue. I have since learned that that was the net return to the Department. It is interesting to note that $543,000-wel l over half has of that amount-cam e from Sydney airport parking concessions. In the departmental column a for infigure of $1.37m is shown for Melbourne. The total of that column is $1.7m, and the impression that it is net revenue, but it is not. It is gross revenue. That is the difficulty involved in trying letto determine the net return from services proon the ground. The Minister might be able parking to provide some information on that. parkI move one stage further to the potential the impact of these proposals on car rental firms. the Since 1960, and particularly since 1969 when the contract was let, the car rental industry has expanded considerably. I understand that quite a deal of congestion at airports relates to people cars they have rented. The use of cars in conjunction with airports and air travel is very iswidely publicised throughout the nation, and I think we are all aware of the fairly active public going on between the competing companies in thisfield.One could not be misunderin pointing out that one of the results which thewUl flow from the increased penalties provided this legislation will be that some of the firms do not have access to authorised parking In areas at airports will have their opportunity to provide a range of car rental services at airports reduced because of the increased penalties. I am not saying whether that isrightor wrong. What I saying is that this is thetimeto have a look at problem because a major part of the car rental problem revolves around the utilisation of flyAs I have said, the wide pubticity that is nationally to flying to a destination, hiring hicle when the destination is reached and then returning the vehicle to the airport has resulted in increased demand and in expansion of the indusAirlines try. The onlyfigureswhich I couldfindrelating bodies which to this matter are contained in replies to questions asked at a Senate Estimates Committee hearing. Inreplyto a question asking for receipts from Avis last year and the estimates for this its year, the departmentalrepresentativestated: Avis paid the Government $465,607 in fees for 1975-76. It is difficult to the present aviation economic climate. Thefigurecould exceed $0.5m.

I put to the Minister that the tabling of such reports in the Parliament given long overdue so that the information can be a veexamined by everybody and not just be privy to those people who are concerned in the industry. Ansett Airlines of Australia, Trans-Australia and Qantas Airways Ltd are the 3 constitute the Aviation Industry Review Committee, yet no information is avaUable to the public on which the Committee bases recommendations to the Government. The Parliament is entitled to adequate information on the Department's activities and it is entitled to the year adequate information on aviation cost recovery. predict an estimate for next year in The concept of multiple offences which is brought into being in this legislation is something expected to propose that much of of which to my knowledge does not occur in any other State. In this particular case, where the permitted period is half an hour and a motorist vehicle longer than the permitted a situation could develop where somestays for 2h hours in a half hour zone x then be charged with 4 separate offences. Little publicity and little explanation have been to that. In fact no explanation has been the Minister other than to say that there efficiency in the Department's is not good enough. The motorist needs to know what is happening.

This legislation of barrier in the way of increased domestic airlines. I want to deal now with the dictatorial and high handed confiscation and disposal proof this Bill. Sub-section 9 (3) of the Act already empowers the towing away of vehicles. This can be done where a parking infringement is is being committed and either the driver cannot be contacted after taking reasonable steps, or if he can be contacted, he refuses to move the vehicle. Sub-clause 6 (b) of the Bill proposes to add seven new sub-sections to section 9 of the Act providing a procedure for disposing of vehicles which have been towed away. The procedure involves notifying the owner that the vehicle has been towed away and that it may be sold if it is not reclaimed and the cost of its removal and storage paid. It provides for the inviting of tenders for purchase and the selling or disposal of the vehicle. The inviting of tenders is not an invariable part of the procedure. Proposed paragraph (6) (d) permits the disposal of the vehicle as the Secretary thinks fit if, in his opinion, it has no commercial value, I emphasise the words 'if, in his opinion'. Proposed sub-section 9 (7) will authorise Secretary to dispose of a vehicle as he thinks where no tender is received. Under proposed sub-section 9(8) the person who acquires a towed away vehicle as a result of the proposed statutory procedure is given a clear tide to it. rights of financiers against the vehicle will extinguished. What of the rights of the owner the vehicle? It could well be that the owner still has a residue on the vehicle. I could see a ation where the owner is paying for a vehicle has been disposed of by the Department and is precluded from having anyrightsin respect of the vehicle. That owner could be paying off to finance company an amount of money for somereading tbing he has not got. Clause 7 of the Bill proposes to insert a section 9A in the Act giving immunity from action for loss or damage arising during after the towing away of a vehicle. Neither of these provisions under sections and 7 makes an exception in the case of vehicles stolen or used other than under the control of owners. While section 8 provides cumstances provide a defence against fines being levied on the owners, the Bill as drafted makes it possible for a vehicle to be stolen, or used unauthorised way, parked illegally in an airport and then be, firstly, damaged or lost by an officer of the Department when removing it, without a right to sue for remedies or damage or loss and, secondly, disposed of at a price suitable to the Department which may involve substantial loss on the market value of the vehicle. There are procedures for an independent valuation of the vehicle in any circumstances. The Secretary's right of discretion in this matter could well give rise to suggestions that a racket in the disposal vehicles at some later stage could develop. In short, the provisions of the Bill are dictatorial and heavy handed. The penalties are onerous. The Minister has not in any reasonable way justified to the Parliament support for these measures. In his second reading speech the Minister denied to the Parliament essential and relevant information. We have no indication of the Government's poUcy in respect of catering for motorists at airports. One would expect that in this area the Government would be trying to make things easier for people utilising airports rather than using airports as a source of raising revenue. Under these circumstances the Opposition is opposed to the legislation.",62
143,Mr BOURCHIER,COMMISSION,"In rising to support the Bill I would Uke to go over one or two matters that were raised by the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris). the I must say that I thought that the honourable fit member presented some very good points and some very good arguments. The honourable member raised the question of what happens to vehicles which are taken away following a parkAny ing infringement. He said that the owner does be not have anyrights.But I think that the normal of law would apply in this case. If, for instance, there is a residue on a vehicle that has been situtowed away the party who holds the residue that would have a right of action against the party he who has faUed to pay in the normal way. Mention was made of the increase in fines. The Minisa ter for Transport (Mr Nixon) said in his second speech that this Bill was designed to update amendments to the Act that was passed m 1960.I am sure that even the honourable memor ber for Shortland would agree that the size of fines in all spheres of the law has increased considerably since 1960. One is Ukely to receive a substantial fine even if one happens to park one's 6 car over the time limit in a local councU area. Such a fine might be for parking for only one hour, let alone for leaving one's car parked for that these cirseveral days. I would like to bring before the Minister for in an consideration the problems faced by country industries, or decentralised industries-whateve r term one likes to use-in respect of their management and staff who use air transport faculties and who are forced to park their cars after driving a considerable distance to airports. For a start they suffer the penalty of having to travel some disno tance to reach an airport. We aU know about the telephone costs that have to be borne by countiy people. They have an added cost in this respect because they are charged high rates to park their of vehicles at airports. I suggest that perhaps the Government at some later date might consider making some small allowance to people from genuine industries in country areas who are forced to use the airways as part of their business. I make that suggestion just by way of a comment. I am sure that the Minister will look at my suggestion in due course. The honourable member for Shortland raised the point of utilisation of transport in parking areas. It is quite obvious to those of us who are forced to park our cars at airports that many people use airport parking bays for their own private reasons. They find that they can park for quite a reasonable charge. Quite often bars at Commonwealth airports are well frequented. Restaurants also may be well frequented. However, the people who patronise these places are taking up valuable parking bays and the people who really need the parking bays have in many cases io park well away from the airport. One could discuss many things in respect of this legislation. Quite obviously we could say that we should not increase any charges. But surely this Bill is warranted in view of the inflation that was caused over the last 3 years by the Government supported by the honourable member for Shortland and also the natural increase in inflation that has occurred over the last 16 years. Members on this side of the House realistically appraise the fact that this Bill is warranted and we support it. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr MACKellar) read a third time. STATES GRANTS (NATURE CONSERVATION) AMENDMENT BILL Debate resumed from 21 October, on motion by Mr Newman: That the Bill be now read a second time.",65
144,Mr UREN,COMMISSION,"If we believed that the Fraser Government had a genuine commitThis ment to the protection of the environment the Labor Party would applaud the amendment the proposed by this Bill. The amendment to States Grants (Nature Conservation) Act 1974 contained in this Bill while simple could in the hands of a committed government ensure the protection of many of our endangered species and our threatened wilderness areas and provide much needed recreational and national parks. While the Government amends this Act in what could be a meaningful way it has, by its actions in the related areas that measure a government's commitment to the environment, shown a lack of awareness. The Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development (Mr Newman) went to great pains in his second reading speech to demonstrate his Government's commitment to the environment. I dispute this. The Australian environment is under attack. It is under attack because of this Government's desire for uncontrolled growth-growt h in migration, growth in mining, growth in woodchip and wood pulping, and growth in the lack of awareness of people who Uttle understand the deUcate nature and fabric of our environment. The installation of the Fraser Government last November meant a return to growth for growth's sake and the bulldozer mentaUty which highlighted the 23 years of the previous conservative governments. It meant a return to the plulosophy which led the Hope Committee of Inquiry into the National Estate in its report to the Whitlam Labor Government to say: The Australian Government has inherited a National Estate which has been downgraded, disregarded and neglected. All previous priorities accepted at vanous levels of government and authority have been directed by a concept that uncontrolled development, economic growth, and 'progress', and the encouragement of private as against pubhc interest in land use, use of waters, and indeed in every part of the National Estate was paramount. This report confirmed that the Whitlam Labor Third Reading Government was thefirstgovernment to make a genuine commitment to the charting of the National Estate and conserving our environment for the Australians of the future. We acted on these recommendations. We were not a government with a bulldozer mentality. Our 1972 election policy proved this, as did our actions in government. We had a mandate to protect the 1976 environment. We set out to do that. We established the Hope Committee. We enacted compSecond Reading lementary and supplementary pieces of legislation and we appropriated funds all to protect the environment. The highlight of our environmental legislation was the Australian Heritage Commission Act. Act embodied the major recommendations of the Hope Committee report. It supplemented working of other Acts of the Labor Govern the ment including the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act, the National Parks and WUdlife Conservation Act, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act and the States Grants (Nature Conservation) Act. All of these Acts complemented the Urban and Regional Development (Financial Assistance) Act which set out the broad framework into which many of the Labor Government's programs fitted. All of these legislative commitments were supported by action-actio n in appropriating funds for projects worthy of our environmental goals. Unlike this Government we gave a high priority to the matters that affect the environment. Despite the claims of this Government to the contrary, nobody believes that it is genuinely committed to the protection of the environment. This Government asked us all to believe that it is giving the environment a high priority because it has made appointments to the Australian Heritage Commission, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and the National Parks and Wildlife Service. The Government may have made appointments, but concerned Australians are not comforted by this. They know that those bodies can function only in an administrative sense. They know that the Government has provided no funds or taken no action to allow these bodies to function properly. The people know that no new projects are being funded under the National Estate program. They know that only projects commenced under Labor and not completed are being funded. The people now know that no action has been taken to proclaim Kakadu and Gudgenby as national parks. The people know that no action has been taken to protect the marine environment. The people know that this Government is not committed to the protection of the environment. The Government has taken no action to introduce the Environment Protection (Marine) Bill drawn up by the Labor Government. This should be done as a matter of urgency. The Australian Government controls all seas opportunities and submerged lands surrounding has a duty to protect them from pollution and exploitation, yet it refuses to take positive action. This is just one more example of its lack of vironmental commitment. It is further seen in the Government's stated intention to give the States the administration of the Environment ProtecHouse tion (Impact of Proposals) legislation, its lack commitment to the buUt environment, its refusal to fund nature conservation organisations on non-matching grants basis if funded at all and abolition of the pubUc environment awareness program. The Government's lack of commitGovernment ment to the environment protection legislation has been highUghted in several ways. The first was the umlateral announcement by the Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon) of the approval for Concordeflightsto and from Australia. Not only was this decision a clear breach of the legislation, but also it shows a complete disregard that powerful elements of the current Government have for environmental considerations. The same elements in the Government have been trying to exempt all the mining and woodchip proposals from the operation of the legislation. The Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Sinclair) is continuing his efforts to have woodchip proposals exempted from the operations of the environment protection legislation. The Harris-Daishowa company's exemption for extension of their export Ucence and operations at Eden is just one example. The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr MACKellar) ignored the requirements of this legislation when he decided to proceed with an enlarged immigration program for this financial year. Another and more important example is the statement of the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development immediately after the Fox report became public that the green Ught had been given for uranium mining to take place in this country. As the Minister responsible he should have been more concerned. The Mmister based his statement on only the first 2 recommendations of the report-h e ignored the other 14 recommendations. His colleague, the Minister for Transport, in his capacity as Acting Minister for National Resources, did exactly the same thing only last Thursday when he stated that uranium muting could now proceed. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in his weekly broadcast on Sunday 7 November said: As to the uranium question, there has already been many for all interested groups within the community Australia. It to put their views . . . enBut the best measure of the Government's commitment is the future of the environment protection legislation. The Minister has stated in this that the Environment Protection (Impact of of Proposals) legislation is under review. He said that this Government feels that legislation of this a nature is more properly a role for State governits ments. It is not considered an appropriate role for a Federal government. In saying this, the is ignoring the fact that no State government in Australia has adequate legislation designed to protect the environment. Honourable members opposite ignore the fact that the State governments, unlike the Federal GovernresponsibUity ment, have a basic conflict in regard to the tection of the environment. Of course, I am ring here to the conflict which the States, particumous larly the less populous States, have in regard development and the protection of the poltiical environment. The position becomes obvious that this conflict is of the utmost importance when we look at situation in Queensland and Western Australia. In Queensland there are only 6 people employed in the Co-ordinator General's Department the responsibUity under the State administrative arrangements to look at environmental questions arising from the development proposal. These people never get the chance to comment upon mining proposals because the Queensland provided Government feels that the environmental issues concerned can be looked after properly in ing Warden's Courts. Officials of this court not quaUfied to consider environmental matters. The situation is no different in Western Australia. In reality, none of the States are much better. The expertise of multi-disciplinary teams able to the Federal Government puts it in a much better situation than the States to conduct impartial inquiry into the protection of the environment. I do not want to be elitist about issue. I am just dealing with the facts of the issue which are that the Federal Government is better equipped and will look at the position in a much more impartial way. In addition, the Australian Government does not face the basic conflict that the' State governments face on the issues of development as opposed to the protection of the environment. The Federal Government can take a more unbiased view than the States on this matter. These are national questions. All Australians are affected by the decisions of this nature in any of the Australian States. That the national government controls mineral export through trade powers under the Constitution gives recognition of this pre-eminent national interest. Nobody should deny that. Honourable members opposite should not wash their hands of that responsibUity. This function cannot transferred. The Australian Government is only government that can constitutionally hibit exports. Apart from projects funded by eral funds or needing Federal Government apthis proval, environmental impact statements can sought only when application is made to obtain Ucence to export prohibited products. Are we going to give this power to the States? Are we going to wash our hands of our responsibUity? We should ask ourselves: Are we going to to men Uke Joh Belke-Petersen, prothe Premier of Queensland or CharUe Court, the referPremier of Western Australia? These are enorpowers. These men have no real feeling for to environmental questions. They are of the same background and same poltiical colour as these men who sit opposite. A further Ulustration of this Government's the lack of commitment to the protection of the environment concerns the nature of their grants to conservation organisations. In the past these with grants have been non-repayable and nonmatching. They were used for research and technical, administrative and information functions provided by various environmental action groups of this country. The Labor Government these grants in recognition of and support for the valuable work being done by the Mincommunity action groups in defence of our are environment. The Labor Government believed that the protection and improvement of the environment were issues which directly affected everyday Ufe. We thought it appropriate and enavaUcouraging that so many voluntary groups were active. This action was considered appropriate an by Labor because the Australian Government is prevented from acting on many aspects of the this environment by constitutional limitations and by the reluctance and in some cases the refusal of our State counterparts to co-operate with us in these matters. I have mentioned 2 States in particular-Wester n Australia and Queenslandwhich have been very guUty in this regard. By making grants of this nature, the Labor Government sought to establish a permanent and growing network of action and information groups capable of influencing governmental and commercial impacts on the environment. We considered community participation in environmental decisions as essential. Broad based commade munity participation in the fundamental decisions that affect all Australians is the basis of licensing the Labor Party's philosophy. However, this Government has seen fit to abolish payments for research and technical assistance altogether and to provide funds only for be conservation organisations on a matching the basis-$ 2 from the Australian Government for proevery $1 raised by the conservation organisfedations. The Government claims that it has done after consideration of advice received from be the Australian Heritage Commission. It may a have considered the advice but it did not accept the Heritage Commission's recommendations. In fact, the Government's proposals on this matter are the complete opposite to the Heritage Comgive mission's recommendations. In total, the Government has made available $391,500 to the various groups. This might appear generous but, in fact, it is less than the $450,000 appropriated last year. We have to bear in mind that we are dealing with at least a 12 per cent increase in costs this year due to inflation. Therefore, the organisations are in a much worse position than thosefiguresreveal. We regarded our grants as essential for pubhc awareness and for gathering information and helping local groups to present informed opinions. These grants were intended to encourage community group action and not to control these conservation groups. We regarded the grants as pioneering grants or seed money given to help the growth of community concern and activity for the protection of our environment. We would not have introduced matching grants for many years to come. Even then, some would have been matching grants and some would have been given free of strings to certain conservation groups. In many cases, we would not have introduced matching grants. We would never have forced environmental centres to close as this Government will force the environmental centres of certain areas to close. We must realise that matching grants favour the establishment. This Government is a great one for supporting establishments. The development of new groups will be timited by the matching grants approach. In effect, this provision prevents the emergence and development of new community movements. On the one hand, this Government gives extremely generous taxation concessions to the mining companies, concessions never paralleled in the history of this nation. On the other hand they are freezing the opposition, the only people who can put the people's point of view and who make the real effort in regard to the exploitation undertaken by these mining companies. That is the action of this Government. It is a case porting the very wealthy but keeping help away from those people who we should really involve and encourage. The Government is not encouraging people's participation in this delicate area of our people's environment. This is our environment. It is nobody else's. An area of particular concern to me is the lack of this Government's commitment to the protection and enhancement of the built environment. We have seen this Government break down the programs introduced by the Labor Government which were intended to improve the quality of life and enhance the environment in our urban centres. The 2 most obvious examples are the Government 's virtual destruction of the Area Improvement Program and the decimation of the national sewerage program. Mr Newman-What has that got to do with it?",66
145,Mr UREN,COMMISSION,"The Minister asks what the national sewerage program has to do with the matter. I wish that the Minister's officials in the corner would give him a Uttle education on environmental questions. Of course the national sewerage program is important in this environmental question. I have said a lot in this Parliament in recent times about the Area Improvement Program and assistance to local government. Mr Newman- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise to order. I am beginning to feel sorry for the Deputy Leader of the Opposition.",69
146,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMISSION,Mr Drummond)Is the Minister raising a point of order? Mr Newman-My point of order is that I thought we were addressing this debate to the States Grants (Nature Conservation) Amendment Bill and I ask what in Heaven's name a sewerage program has to do with this debate.,69
147,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMISSION,Order! There is no substance in the point of order. This is a free ranging debate. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will probably come to his point and explain the connection.,69
148,Mr UREN,COMMISSION,"Migh t I give a lesson on environmental matters to the young Minister who has been in the Parliament 5 minutes yet seems to know everything? The fact is that the first principle in environmental matters is that everything is connected to everything else. Everything has to go somewhere. If the Minister does not understand the problem of the sewerage which has polluted our creeks, ourrivers,our bays and our oceans it is about time that he started to get some education and understanding of the situation of supfrom the bureaucrats who sit behind him. Honourable members should all be aware that Uquid wastes, both human and industrial, are the major poUutants of our waterways, harbours and oceans. The Labor Government recognised this and took firm action to overcome this problem under the national sewerage program and associated works. We did not want to see Port Phillip Bay, the Georges River and the Parramatta River in Sydney and the Yarra River become turbid morasses, nor did we want to see our beaches become the final receptacle for tons of untreated human effluent. During our 3 years in office we made avaUable to the States $259m through grants and loans to help overcome these problems. Of this amount 30 per cent was made available by way of non-repayable grants. financial year alone we made available $113m under this program. This Government has cut this amount back this year to $50m. If we look the whole question of inflation that amount of $113m would have been $ 130m this year in money terms yet the Government cut back this allocation to $S0m. As I said earlier, this whole matter is interconnected. We had a broad view of the environment. knew that to protect the environment, related and complementary programs were needed. All our urban and regional development programs complemented our environmental programs. The land commission program is an excellent example of this. While the object of that proto gram was to provide residential land for young people at a price they could afford, it had other important elements. It could be used to ease strain on existing infrastructure services improve the urban environment, both built and natural. The Labor Government, in co-operation with the State governments, used funds from program to purchase open space in developing areas. Large areas of the Mornington Peninsula were acquired by this process. It was our tion to use this program to set aside large areas the Dandenongs in Victoria and the Blue MounCompany's tains escarpment in New South Wales for the recreational and environmental purposes of urban dwellers. Labor's initiatives have been destroyed by this Government. Everyone should demand to know what this Government's intenserve tions are. Working in co-operation with the State governments, does it intend to protect the Danindustry denongs and the Blue Mountains escarpment from encroachment by developers? Does it intend to let our waterways die? Does it intend degrade our Uving standards? The duplicity of this Government's conduct a public relations exercise, emphasising its comto mitment to the environment is further shown this Bill. The nature of the amendment to the Bill is such that if a government were genuine in intentions it could do a great deal. From a cal point of view, the amendments which allow the Australian Government's role in nature conensure servation to extend from mere land acquisition assistance to the States to co-operation in manpossum. agement activities should be supported. As the Minister said, the acquisition of the land in is only a step towards creating secure areas where flora and fauna can be protected and leaflets. preserved. It is equally important that the manWe agement of the areas set aside for this protection and preservation should be supported by federal legislation. If this Government had a genuine Last commitment to the environment, this amendment would be commendable. But the Government, by introducing this amendment, is paying atonly lip service to the protection of the again we see that environment. The Minister, in his second readme speech, has said that his Government and the Victorian Government were co-operating in a program of acquiring land at Yelhngbo on the eastern side of We the Dandenongs to secure the habitat of the helmeted honey eater, one of the emblems of Victoria. I point out that this program was commenced under the Labor Government. Tbis Government cannot claim the credit for protecting this endangered species. While I am pleased see that this Government is prepared to continue our initiative on this project, the people of Australia will continue to question the Govern the ment's commitment to the leadbeater's possum, and to another Victorian State emblem and another endangered species threatened by the encroachment of developers. This species of possum, the thisonly marsupial indigenous to Victoria, is now restricted to the Montane Ash forests in the East Gippsland district. Their continued survival is intenthreatened directly by habitat destruction of brought about by the Gippsland Paper Pulp concessions in the central highlands. If the Australian Government and the Victorian our Government want to protect this animal and retain the unique Montane Ash habitat, both governments must take immediate action to prelarge tracts in national parks and other reserves which exclude the integrated forestry and its clear cutting and short rotation management practices. To survive, the leadbeater's possum needs a minimum of 7000 hecto tares of Montane Ash forest. They need trees at least 100 years old-tree s that have hollowed withtime.The proposals to clear fell Montane of Ash forests on a 60 year rotation basis will lead the extinction of this possum. This Bill gives by the Government the power in co-operation with the Victorian Government to take positive steps its to protect this habitat. The Government should technishow its commitment by opening discussions immediately with the Victorian Government to that a national park is declared which will guarantee the survival of the leadbeater's itself Last week the Prime Minister, (Mr Malcolm Fraser) released a series of endangered species I question the Government's intentions. should ask what positive action this Government has taken to protect those species. I ask the Minister now: What action has his Government taken? If the Government were genuine in its desire to protect these species, it would have commenced discussions already with the State governments concerned. I doubt whether it has done so. It was drawn to my attention recently that one of the last natural habitats of the ground parrot, one of these endangered species, in the Cooloola National Park in Queensland had been severely damaged. This occurred through the action of the Queensland Government in allowing its Forestry Department to burn off most of the park area. This Government, by the amendment proposed in this Bill, now has the power to set up co-operative management proposals for State national parks. It should do this immediately in an effort to stop ignorant and heartless decisions being taken by government authorities and profit seekers throughout Australia. The latter are particularly inherent in those 2 conservative States of Queensland and Western Australia. I ask the Minister to open up discussion on this matter and institute educational programs to try to do something not only in those 2 States I have just mentioned but in other States as well. When the Government shows it is prepared to take real action to protect the environment and when it shows a genuine concern, it may be possible to reach a bipartisan approach. When it shows that it is prepared to implement the recommendations of the report of the Committee of Inquiry into the National Estate, it will get support from this House.",69
149,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMISSION,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,71
150,Mr HODGES,COMMISSION,"The Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development (Mr Newman) is well able to defend himself. But, as I have the call, I believe I should express my strong resentment at some of the statements that were made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Uren). To castigate the Minister, as he has done in relation to sewerage programs, is most unfair. I have discussed the sewerage program with the Minister. There is no denying that the amount allocated in this area has dropped from $ 130m last financial year to about $50m this financial year. But the Labor Government, of course, always spent money that it did not have-and plenty of it. The Government recognises that there are many areas of need. Indeed, the Government has had to show restraint in an endeavour to restore economic stabuity to Australia. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition talked about taxation concessions to the mining companies. I can assure him that the taxation concessions that are permitted are aUowed for a specinc purpose, that is, to provide more employment in this nation. If the Opposition likes to tell the nation that it is not interested in reducing the rate of unemployment, I am sure that it will sink even further than the depths to which it sank in December 1975. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition also spoke in a derogatory way about the Queensland Government. Let me come to the defence of the Queensland Government in relation to the establishment of national parks and wUdlife reserves. I have no doubt that the honourable member is well intentioned. He indulged in spending moneys that he did not have, and that the Government of the day, of which he was a Mmister, did not have. He came forward, as did the former Government, with a multitude of grandiose schemes that were pursued with great vigour to the economic detriment of this nation. I think that he has missed the point because the Mmister, in his second reading speech, made specific mention of the fact that it was an overriding objective of the Government this year to return economic stability to this nation. Theretiesthe Government's strategy in restraint in spending in this area. This Bill amends the States Grants (Nature Conservation) Act 1974 and should be welcomed by all State governments. In particular it should be welcomed by Ministers, responsible for the acquisition of land for national parks, from the point of view of their responsibUity for the control and management of these national parks under their national parks and wUdlife services. The principal amendment is contained in clause 2 (b) of the Bill. In essence it provides that, in addition to land acquisition, the Commonwealth can agree with a State on programs of management and the provision of faculties in parks and reserves in connection with nature conservation. This is a major breakthrough for the States in the area of nature conservation. It gives them theflexibiUtythat we so often hear them claim that they require. If a State decides that it has adequate tracts of land set aside for nature conservation purposes, it can select its priority by saying to the Commonwealth that it wishes to apportion its share of the Commonwealth funds to the management and control of those parks. It is one thing to acquire the land; it is another to be able to provide adequate rangers and supervision to ensure that those parks are not lost to vandals and to people who would plunder the flora and fauna therein. It was interesting to note in the Second Report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation into Trafficking of Fauna in Australia which was rereserves cently completed and tabled in this House myself that the view was expressed on numerous occasions by senior officers of the national parks and wildlife services in the States that, whilst acquisition was essential, they were having difficulty in providing adequate funds for agement and control. Of course, these recurring costs are not inconsiderable and are rising year. In the case of, I think, South Australia tracts of land had been set aside for national park purposes. The officers in that State were concerned for the safety and the running of these parks in relation, in particular, to bushfiresand the fact that there were unscrupulous people who were prepared to go into those parks, destroy them and plunder the flora and fauna. This Bill gives the State governments to be able to set their priorities. If one looks State government budgets one sees that Minisactions ters go before their own Cabinets andfind,when it comes to consideration of the amount they have submitted in the preUminary stage, that invariably the amount is reduced. So it will great benefit to the States to be able to exercise theflexibUitythat the amendment to this Act provides. I want to make it clear to the House that although this Act came into force in December 1974 the States of course had been pursuing active programs of acquisition of land and establishment of national parks. I do not want anyone to gam the impression that it was the Commonwealth which initiated these grams. In other words, the States have done a commendable job in this area. I want to offer praise also to the dedication the officers of the national parks and wUdUfe vices that I have met in the various States as result of my associationfirstas a member and then as Chairman of the House of Representathe tives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation. This Act was enacted in 1974 lowing the report of the House of Representareferred. tives Select Committee on WUdlife Conservationcurrently which reported in October 1972. Incidentally, that Committee was set up under a LiberalMount Country Party Government. I think that some phase ought to be given to the previous LiberalI Country Party Government for its foresight setting up that Committee on WUdlife Conserand vation which was established in May 1970 and reported 2Vi years later. The recommendations in its report contained suggestion that a national policy should be lished to acquire land for national parks to preserve flora and fauna in their natuby ral state. It was also recommended that assistance be given to the States by way of section 96 grants to enable the States to acquire areas of this land. An amount of $3.3m has been provided in this year's Budget for this purpose. The Minister man made particular reference to an amount of $75,000 to be made avaUable to the Tasmanian each Government to estabUsh a south-west national large park. I want to make it quite clear that this Government is committed to a program of protection of our environment. I want to refute some of the misleading statements that were made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. In my opinion, his criticisms were in large part unwarranted. This Government is genuine in its approach towards the protection of our natural environment and towards the uplifting of our the right buUt or social environment. at the The Government has matched its words with and the appropriation of moneys in a time of national restraint. It recognises the needs for, and the Minister has stated and restated that the Government will uphold the principles of, be of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act. The Australian Heritage Commission, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and the National Parks and WUdUfe Service have been provided with moneys by this Government and appointments have been made to these bodies. These bodies enjoy an important place in the operation of this Government and, more particularly, in the Ministry of Environproment, Housing and Community Development. I assure the Minister that I for one am most appreciative of the service and the attention he has of given to the House of Representatives Standing serCommittee on Environment and Conservation. a Through him, I also offer my appreciation to his staff who have been most attentive and helpful to needs of the Committee. I feel I should inform the House of the pursuance of a vigorous folprogram by the Committee to which I have just There are 2 sub-committee inquiries being conducted-on e into off-road vehicles and another into the Ayers Rock and Olga areas. There is also a full Committee inquiry dealing with the urban environment. want to dispel the thoughts of the pessimists, in particularly those on the Opposition benches, to assure Australians that this Government is deeply committed to the preservation of the environment and the conservation of Australia's flora and fauna. In particular, I commend to the a House and the nation the leaflets that have just estabbeen produced by the Department of Environand ment, Housing and Community Development. These leaflets, which are on Australian endanDevelopment gered species, have been produced by the National Parks and WUdlife Service. They are thefirstof a series. They are colourful, tive and educational. I hope that the production of these leaflets continues. They should be placed in libraries and schoolsrightthroughout this nation. I hope that they will be reproduced eventually in a booklet form. The Department to be highly commended for the production that series of leaflets. I turn to the report on trafficking in fauna Australia to which I referred earUer in my less speech. I refer the House in particular to recomfor mendations (x) to (xiv) inclusive. Recommendathe tions (x) to (xiti) deal with habitat preservationcountless and research. Recommendation (x) deals with the habitat of rare and endangered fauna and with requiring environmental impact statements on proposed Commonwealth Government finan-be ced or controUed development. Recommendaareas tion (xi) deals with the Commonwealth taking appalling account-this is what this piece of legislation all about-of fhefinancialcapacity of the States to promote a program of land purchases and area other measures for fauna conservation. The words 'and other measures for fauna consercerned, vation' are what the principal amendments to this Act are all about. The next recommendation in this report deals with the promotion of a large scale, intensive education program to encourage estabUsh or retain wUderness areas on their properties. Many of the larger graziers, farmers and land holders in this country are now ing the very thing that is outlined in this mendation of this report. Recommendation (xiti) deals with the biological resources survey which is involved in the obtaining of data. So Uttle known of some of the natural species in this after country. We have paid so Uttle attention to this matter over the years that it is often difficult ascertain whether a particular species is rare endangered or common. Therefore extra assistour ance and encouragement has to be given to the biological resources survey to ensure that we know what populations are avaUable in this country. Finally, I refer to the recommendation under the heading 'WUdUfe Services' that the Commonwealth Government should take account of cerned thefinancialcapacity of the States to expand their wUdUfe services. This, of course, is being attended to in this legislation. The 2 bodies cerned insofar as this report on trafficking in fauna in Australia is concerned-the Department of Environment, Housing and Community traUan and the Bureau of Customs-hav e shown a deep interest in the report and I am hopeful of some of the recommendations therein informabemg implemented in the near future. FinaUy, I refer to the various areas of land contained in this continent. I believe that it would be an interesting survey if we were to go into those areas that have been completely is cleared for farming and grazing purposes and to of compare them with the areas that have been despoUed through mining operations. I venture into say that if we were able to count up the countthousands of hectares that have been cleared farming-that is, the complete destruction of natural environment-and to add to that the thousands of hectares of partly cleared land that is used for grazing purposes and were to compare that land with the area that has been despoUed by the mining companies we would all in for a shock. It is true that there are certain that were mined in the past and left in an state, but the fact of the matter is that, is with the stringent conditions that are placed today on, comparatively speaking, a very minute of the surface of this continent insofar as the operations of the mining companies are conwe arefindingin most instances that the rehabilitation and the restoration of the areas mined is of a particularly high standard. The mining companies are required to contour the land, to plant a surface crop- a covering cropand then to go in and plant native trees that are land holders to found in the area. I had the experience recently of visiting the observUtah company's operations in central recomQueensland. There is no doubt that a tremendous amount of money is being spent and that a conscious effort is being made on the part of the is company to ensure that the land that it leaves the open cut mining is completed is left in a first class condition. So I will be extremely interto rested infindingout whether thosefiguresare and avaUable. Farm land is virtually lost forever to flora and fauna. When one looks at the lack of criticism so far as the farmers and graziers are do concerned and compare it with the mass of criticism that flows to the miners one must surely question the motives of some of the environmentaUsts and conservationists.",71
151,Mr FRY,COMMISSION,"This Bill is conwith the provision of funds to assist in the establishment of national parks as well as the conducting of research into the preservation and conconservation of our flora and fauna. I would Uke to take the opportunity of saying a few words in defence of a much maligned member of the Ausfauna, namely, the Australian dingo. For many years the dingo has been the victim of whole range of myths about its way of life, lulling habits, how it travels, how ferocious and how many hundreds of head of cattle and sheep it is supposed to have destroyed. It is posed to have imposed a huge cost upon the toral industry. Fortunately in recent years myths have tended to be broken down. In morethe recent years some very sound research has been done which, while it is still in its infancy, tended to result in a less emotional and more rational attitude being taken towards the dingo. It was very good to see a very fine example set cently by the newly-elected Premier of New South Wales when he suspended the dropping 1080 baits in the Kanangra Valley on the basis that not sufficient was known about the habits of the dingo to justify having this sort of control measure. I shall certainly produce other informafrom tion later which supports this contention. I was fortunate recently to visit east Africa, where I enjoyed looking at the magnificent mal parks and seeing thousands of animals grazing around in their natural habitat quite livious to onlookers. People drive around in cars looking at these animals and as long as people stay in their cars the animals do not any notice of them. I hope that we will get to stage in Australia-particularl y in Canberra, where we are about to set aside an area for Gudgenby National Park-wher e we will be able to drive into certain areas and see such beautiful animals as the Australian dingo in their natural habitat in company with the other animals which they would normaUy be in company. It magnificent sight and something that one really cannot appreciate until one has actually experiof enced it. So I support in general those people who are working towards a less emotive and to more rational attitude being adopted towards Australia. the Australian dingo. One of the great problems with the dingo is differentiating between the pure dingo and the cross-bred dingo. Here again there are a lot myths abroad. Recent research by the Commonthat wealth Scientific and Industrial Research stock. Organisation has shown that in the Gippsland area, for instance, only 20 per cent of the dingoes are not pure. In fact research into a sample of bush dogs has shown that 75 per cent are domtares. estic dogs gone wUd so it is not correct to say that stock-kUUng dogs are cross-bred dingoes. A lot them are pure domestic dogs which have gone wUd. In Canberra it is quite amusing sometimes to see the great expense to which the Governdo ment is put following reports of dingoes kUling stock in the Gudgenby area. Trappers and a rangers are sent to that area and all sorts of its resources are used to try to catch one dingo it is, which is reported to have killed four of five sheep. There is no proof that the animal has suplulled the sheep, only supposition. At the same pas-time wefindhere in Canberra that a domestic these dog will get into sombody's paddock out near abattoir and kill 50 to 100 sheep, yet the emotive effect is not the same. People go out and has try to shoot the dog but it is an emotive approach, not a rational approach, to the problem. The dingo has bestowed great benefits on the reAustraUan pastoral industry. It was used extensively in the development of the blue heeler of which has been of tremendous benefit to the cattle industry. The abUity of the blue heeler to nip the heels of a beast, to lay its headflaton the ground and miss its kicks has been inherited the dingo. The blue heeler's great endurance and strong jaws also have been inherited from the Australian dingo. That is why I say that anithe dingo has made a great contribution to the just Australian pastoral industry. obThere is little evidence of large-scale kUling of their stock by dingoes. Recent research was done in the Armidale by a scientist named Robert Harden. take He examined 800 samples of excreta from dinthe goes and found no evidence of stock remains. The CSIRO had sinular results when it examined the samples. Mr Harden said he found no evidence of domestic stock in any of these specimens. The examination showed that 60 per cent of the diet of the dingoes he investigated was wallaby, 15 with per cent was possum and glider and the is a remainder was made up of other native mammals. The CSIRO found only a small proportion domestic animals in an examination of the guts of 1000 dingoes. There is no hard evidence support claims that dingoes kUl a lot of stock in Another myth destroyed by research is that dingoes travel large distances. The justification for bait dropping in the Kanangra-Boyd Park of of New South Wales was that dingoes went from area to Oberon and Bathurst and attacked Research has shown that they do not travel large distances. Radio transmitters were put on them and monitored and it was found that they all generally stayed in an area of 2000 to 3000 hecThis makes nonsense of dropping thousands of baits in this uninhabited country on the of off-chance they will lull an odd dingo. They may kill the odd dingo but so what. We do not know how many dingoes are kiUed by 1080 baits, nor we know how many birds and other animals are killed. Thousands of baits are littered indiscriminately in these national park areas. I hope that with this sort of research a much more rational approach will be adopted to controlling dingoes or protecting them, or whatever the case may be. I think the dingo is a noble animal that should be protected. Dingoes should be controlled in certain cases when there isfirmevidence that they kill stock in any quantity but I think that quite often the dingo is used as an excuse for mismanagement. If people cannot round up the number of stock that they think they have, if theyfindso many sheep are missing, they blame the dingo. It is very convenient have something to blame but evidence is not available to prove that dingoes take stock. Even in the early days of Australia we heard of convicts being flogged because they let dingoes take lambs. There was no real evidence that they were taken by dingoes, foxes, native cats, domestic dogs or anything else. It is good to see these mythical beUefs about the dingo being broken down gradually and a more rational approach being taken. I hope that the establishment of the national parks will see a continuation of that trend. I hope we get to the stage where these animals are not destroyed wholesale on a false premise and that we get the opportunity at some future time of being able to go into these parks and see dingoes in their natural habitat. I am sure people will come to appreciate the quaUty of the dingo as well as any disadvantages that may arise from their existance. I was in Mauritius recently and noted with interest that its national emblem is the dodo. One can buy cloth dodos, metal dodos or wooden dodos but cannot see a live dodo because they have been extinct for about 200 years. We often hear the expression 'as dead as a dodo'. I hope we never get to the stage that instead of saying that democracy in Australia is as dead as a dodo we say that democracy in Australia is as dead as a dingo. I hope dingoes never become extinct.",73
152,Mr FISHER,COMMISSION,"In October 1972 a select committee of the House of Representatives estabUshed by the Liberal National Country Party Government of that time reported on the broad subject of wUdUfe conservation. It recommended that the Commonwealth Government initiate a national policy aimed at acquiring land in the form of national parks and reserves for the protection of habitat sites and that a program of grants to the States under section 96 of the Constitution be instituted to enable the States to acquire areas wUdUfe habitat that are of national importance. As the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development (Mr Newman) stated in his second reading speech, in 1974 the Parliament legislated to make it possible for the Commonwealth to provide financial assistance to the States for purposes connected with nature conservation. The relevant Act makes provision for the Minister to agree with an appropriate Minister of a State upon programs of land acquisition for nature conservation and for payments offinancialassistance to be made to the States in accordance with the approved progams. The amending Bill which we are debating to to night, the States Grants (Nature Conservation) Bill, is designed to providefiexibiUtyin programs for nature conservation developed with the States. It is part of this Government's clear and stated overall policy of co-operation in State programs of management. This Bill deals specifically with conservation of Australian wUdlife. Over the past decade, debate and concern about environmental and conservation matters have been widespread, particularly as they relate to our natural environment. This has been a most encouraging development and many creditable groups have acted in a responsible manner and have stirred pubUc and government apathy. What concerns me, however, is that not all groups supposedly interested in promoting conservation and environmental issues do so with balance or honesty. In many instances some groups are quite irrational and, in fact, are doing the conservation cause immense harm. It is a natural tendency at our stage of development- a transition from pioneering in both the agricultural and industrial stages into rationalisation and StabUisation-that issues of conservation and protection of our environment become prominent. Over the next few months this Parliament will be making important decisions closely tied to environmental issues and the preservation of our national heritage. They are closelytiedto our responsibUity to future generations. The Parliament wtil be charged with protecting many areas of unique environmental significance. We will be charged with protecting as well the economic livelihood of people, with improving their standard of Uving whtie retaining the uniqueness and importance of our national hentage. The world is becoming increasingly doubtful of our materialistic culture. We indicate a desire to Uve a simpler preindustriaUsed, pre-scientific day. That cannot be done. Science has created problems but it also has the means, as has been shown in the past, of of being able to solve those problems. We cannot abandon agriculture or industriaUsation. Our responsibUity to a starving world depends on our food supply. Urban decay and an energy crisis will be solved by technology, not by returning to a simpler way of life. Industrialisation and modern agriculture have pushed the world's population to 4000 million. These people can be supported only by further advances in scientific knowledge and practice. My constituency, the Mallee electorate in north-west Victoria, contains some of Australia's most significant wetlands. They are significant as breeding grounds and as a natural resource. They are also significant in complementing the agriculture of these areas. As the report of the House of Representatives Select Committee on Wildlife Conservation clearly states: . . . waterfowl are declining in numbers as a result encroachment of agriculture and the resultant drainage swamp land, the damming ofrivers,flood mitigation grams and the trampling by ing cover on the edge of lagoons. Theflowof mostrivershas been reduced by water conservation andfloodmitigation schemes. Many of the most productive (in wildlife terms) swamps have been drained. Many of these measures have been carried out in ignorance, but more usually they have been earthe ned out for the world's demand fbr productive and economic viability. The value of waterfowl, unfortunately, has rarely if ever been given concause sideration when water reclamation and consercoming vation schemes have been implemented. In the inland areas many of the common game ducks have breeding seasons which are directly related to water level changes in swamps and billabongs. Although some breeding occurs each year, extenthe sive breeding takes place only when lagoons billabongs are replenished or when spreads across the plains. The whole trend of water conservation on the inlandriversystems is to diminish or to prevent this flooding. This tricts waterfowl breeding. This Act is an instrument developed to maintain coastal refuges and to replenish adequate inland swamps and billabongs. This will go far towards ensuring the survival of all waterfowl. Unfortunately, many wildlife conservationists regard protection as the main obligation to Bill. native fauna. They cannot accept the idea of servation for hunting. Perhaps the most viable and effective groups in my area in relation to conservation of our unique fauna and wildlife are ourfieldand game naturalist groups. It is my view that waterfowl conservation is justified, both because of its value as a game species as a natural resource. As the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Hodges) pointed out, the recent tabling of the report on the protection of flora and fauna in Australia recognises that tat destruction is by far the most important threat to our wildlife population. We have made some very drastic and important recommendations which, when initiated by this Government, will assist in protecting some of our unique and rare fauna species. I do not wish to delay the passage of this Bill much longer. There have been increased demands for significant areas of national park development over recent years. Some of these parks are most desirable and wanted. In other situations I believe some of the demands have been totally unjustified. It is important for all our governments and groups, particularly conservation groups, to recognise that increased public lands require more than the simple proclamation of an Act. of the They need increased expenditure in many fields of other than acquisition. They need increased proexpenditure in management and in controlling stock and feral animals of nestnoxious weeds and vermin. I recently did a bit of research in regard to Victoria. It shows quite clearly that spending in relation to the control of such vermin and noxious weeds receives a very low priority. In fact, one man is employed within service to look after some 3000 hectares of land, an impossible job and one which means that in our State and in most other States, beof its low priority, our pubhc lands are befhe prime means by which vermin and noxious weeds are being spread throughout the rest of the area in agriculture and through our national parks. As well, we must have increased expenditure on management and in controlling various weeds and vermin which are one of and the very real problems which we face when we water increase our areas of pubhc land. I believe that this Bill will provide the flexibility for States to carry out more appropriresate measures in this way. I feel that one reason for local and public opposition to many conservation proposals has been a past unwillingness by many governments to effectively manage public land with the same enthusiasm and effectiveness which they expect from private land owners. I support the amendments moved to the I believe the Bill will provide in the future conthe vehicle by which environmental protection and conservation of our natural resources can all the be achieved in balance with our needs for productivity and for the nation's economic welfare.",75
153,Mr NEWMAN,COMMISSION,"Bass-Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development) and (10.7)-in reply-In concluding the debate I begin by thanking at least 3 honourable members who have spoken for their contribution; that our is the honourable member for Mallee (Mr habiFisher), the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Hodges), and the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Fry). In relation to the fourth honourable member who participated, I shall dwell for minutes on his contribution. I do not know what to do with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Uren). I am becoming a Uttle bit weary the absurdities which he produces in the House. After listening to him tonight, I do not know whether to be indignant or whether to start ing the poor man. I do not know whether to be amused or angry. We have a Bill which attemptsmind to widen the interest of the Federal Government. It attempts to take us into areas where we can really help the States in conservation matters. Yet hardly once-perhap s in passing, to give man credit-di d he even recognise the attempt by this Government to be constructive in the matter of conservation. As usual, he slipped back to his romanticising on past deeds, of what and his Government did. In doing that, of course, he indulged in and displayed all his favourite prejudices and pursued his favourite task of bashing State governments or, at least, State governments which do not belong to the same poltiical party as he does. We really cannot tolerate this sort of approach in this place. At least, I do not think we can. Ueve that sometimes there is a case for bipartisanments approach. I believe there is room for positive, constructive criticism. I think there is even - mayb e I am asking too much-for people to join together to encourage conservation in this countiy. I have to ask myself just how genuine this man.",76
154,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMISSION,Mr MartinOrder! Would the Minister mind taking his seat for a moment? I remind the Minister that any reflections on the motives of an honourable member of this House are unparliamentary. I mention this matter before we get to that stage. The Minister is getting very close to it. I draw attention to that fact.,77
155,Mr NEWMAN,COMMISSION,"I accept your warning, Deputy Speaker, and I heed it, but you will understand, as I went through some of the tilings that were said tonight, that I became so excited, that I made the preUminary remarks in which indulged myself. Firsdy, one of the main critiCapital cisms made by the Deputy Leader of the Oppolast sition concerned funds. The Government has made it perfectly clear that although it Uke to be able to fund many projects this sees itself bound by fiscal responsibUities. If it is to cure inflation, the Government is necessarily bound to restrict the growth of pubtic expendibadly ture. Enough has been said in this House on matter, but it needed to be reiterated tonight. In relation to this Bill, may I say in passing that a few this year the Government is spending $3.3m which is more than was ever spent by the Opposition when it was in government, even though it of initiated the Bill. For example, in 1974-75 an amount of $9m was appropriated but nothing was spent. In 1975-76 an amount of $ 1.8m was pityappropriated and approximately $1.3m was spent. I think that those things have to be kept in when we hear the ranting and raving of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. So much for funds; but there are some other things on which I must correct him. First of aU, on the provision of the funds for the National Estate, let me reiterate that it is true that this year the Government has curbed expenditure on the National Estate but the Government has made it quite clear that this he is only until the Heritage Commission draws together those elements of the National Estate, or at least is well advanced in that area, which will enable the Government to rationally decide those projects in the National Estate which we will fund in future years. Secondly, in dealing with the National Estate it is interesting to compare the record which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition so proudly extolled. At least this I beGovernment can take credit for making appointto the Heritage Commission, and for making them quickly. The previous Government had room made only one appointment by November 1975 although the Act had received royal assent in June 1975. That is not a particularly good record is on which to come into this House and make comparisons. Reference has been made to Kakadu, and I should make clear where the Government stands on the dedication of this park. We cannot do anything at the moment until we have the second report of the Fox Committee because part of the job of the Committee is to help the Government his define the boundaries of that national park. However, I am quite prepared to say tonight that my colleague the Minister for the Northern TerMr ritory (Mr Adermann) and I are working towards declaring this as a national park at the appropriatetime,and nobody should doubt our motives in this matter. As for the Gudgenby I national park, my colleague the Mmister for the Territory (Mr Staley) declared this park week. For heaven's sake, let the Deputy Leader of the Opposition get his facts straight would before he comes in here making such wUd, year, itsweeping, inaccurate accusations. There are many other things which were so put and so badly misrepresented by the thatDeputy Leader of the Opposition. Perhaps isolating a couple of those matters wtil suffice, although I repeat that he said other things which either misrepresents the situation or were inaccurate. I am under some constraint tofinishso let me do so on this note: The Deputy Leader of the Opposition talked about the leadbeater's possum in Victoria and the ground parrot in Queensland. By introducing this Bill and by providing the ability for the Federal Government to assist the States in the management of their national parks, we will be able to help the States in the preservation of species such as those. Through the States requesting help from us the National Parks and Wildlife Service will be able to provide expertise and decent advice which will allow the States to formulate proper management poUcies which, in the end, will do more to preserve the sorts of species about which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was speaking than anything that the last Government tried to do under the existing Act. I could say much more but I conclude by saying that this Bill is a genuine attempt to broaden the scope of the Act in order to develop the interest of the Federal Government in helping aU the States better prepare management plans for the conservation of their national parks, their fauna and their flora. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Newman) read a third other time. FEDERAL COURT OF AUSTRALIA BILL operated Debate resumed from 21 October, on motion by Mr Ellicott: That the Bill be now read a second time.",77
156,Mr ELLICOTT,COMMISSION,"May I have the indulgence of the House to raise a point of procedure on this lation. Before the debate is resumed on this Bill, would Uke to suggest that it may suit the venience of the House to have a general debate covering orders of the day Nos 5 to 8, the eral Court of Australia Bill and the 10 associated Bills-the Judiciary Amendment Bill 1976, the Remuneration and Allowances Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1976, the Conciliation and Arbitration Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1976, the Bankruptcy it Amendment Bill 1976, the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court Amendment Bill 1976, the Northern Territory Supreme Court Amendment Bill 1976, the Federal Court of Australia (Consequential Provisions) Bill 1976, the Income Tax Assessment Amendment (Jurisdiction of Courts) Bill 1976, and the Patents Amendment and Trade Marks Amendment Bill 1976-as they are associated measures. Separate questions will, of course, be put on each of the orders of the day at the conclusion of the debate. I suggest therefore, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you permit the subject matter of the 11 BUls to be discussed in this debate.",78
157,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMISSION,"Is it the wish of the House to have a general debate covering these measures? There being no objection, I will allow that course to be followed.",78
158,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,COMMISSION,"In leading for the Opposition in the cognate debate, I indicate that the Opposition, while not refusing a second reading to the Federal Coun of Australia Bill, has an amendment which suggests that it would have been far better for that jurisdiction to be of a wider original base in accordance with that referred to in section 75 of the Constitution and of laws made by this Parliament. In respect of another measure, the Judiciary Amendment Bill, I indicate to the Attorney-General (Mr Ellicott) that the Opposition proposes to move amendments to clause 3. BasiThird Reading cally, they relate to the fact that there should be an appeal to the High Coun as ofrightin matters involving interpretation of the Constitution. The matter to which I wish to refer is the Remuneration and Allowances Amendment Bill relating to the fixing of judges salaries. That from 1 June last, and the Opposition 1976 approves that legislation. In addition to the Federal Coun legislation, 8 ancUlary pieces of legisSecond Reading lation are listed on the business paper. I do not propose to go through them at this stage, except to say that the Opposition supports the legislation. Dealing with the first matter, the Federal Coun of Australia Bill, let me say that the case legisfor a Federal Court has been argued for well I over a decade. I am reminded that Sir Garfield conBarwick when Attorney-General was authorised to proceed with such a Bill, and that AttorneyFedGeneral Bowen introduced a Bill which was not subsequently proceeded with. It will be recalled that the Labor Party's Superior Court Bill met an unfortunate fate in the Senate. If one looks at that particular piece of legislation and compares with this Federal Court legislation, it wiU be seen that the main difference Ues in clause 19. Clause 19 of the Superior Court Bill spelled out the original jurisdiction in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution whereas the present Bill indicates that jurisdiction will be that provided by the Parliament. The ancillary pieces of legislation indicate that jurisdiction, and that been explained to the House by the Attorney in the second reading speeches that he has made. We feel, as an Opposition, it would have been far preferable to give us a federal court that was dealing with all federal jurisdiction and not leave it in a situation which obviously had to develop at thetimeof federation that State courts would be exercising Federal jurisdiction. In our submission the State courts have done a splendid job but, nevertheless, we feel that they have as much work as any Federal jurisdiction may have and it could well be an over burden on the States to be left with increasing work in the Federal jurisdiction area. Secondly, we are of the opinion that it helps to make good law if it is in the uniformity of federal jurisdiction without the fragmentation that can develop when State jurisdictions are involved. Now we have grown up as a federation we say that the situation is not as it was when that jurisdiction was vested in the State courts. The Bill clearly indicates that there will be diction in a number of areas. I mention, for example, that the court itself will be in 2 divisions. There will be a general division and an industrial division. One would like the assurance of the Attorney, which he may care to give, that in the industrial division of the court all existing industrial judges will remain and will not be removed into any other sphere. I think the Bill allows it but we believe it would be unwise and unsatisfactory to have people who have that special quality of industrial judges moved to another jurisdiction. The other question relates to the ancilliary legislation. One example is bankruptcy, which is to be a Federal jurisdiction in New South Wales and Victoria but is still to be exercised by State courts in other States. We feel that is a weakening of the position. We would have much preferred to see a Federal jurisdiction in those States. We note that there can be an appeal from the State bankruptcy/jurisdiction to the Federal Court where there is jurisdiction exercised. We note that there is some limitation on appeals from the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. In other words they seem to be restricted as compared with the present situation. We also note the provisions relating to income tax assessment, trade marks and patents legislation. We know in particular in respect of the Patents Act that appeal Ues to the Federal Court as ofright.Where a decision of the Commissioner is involved there can be an appeal to the High Court by special leave. In the concept of Federal legislation we believe that the Federal has Court legislation is good legislation. We just say that it does not go far enough. It is legislation that we welcome and we believe that it can be buUt on to give this country an effective Federal legislation in Federal courts. Another matter that is of perhaps more concern is the amendment to the Judiciary Act. As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, the Constitution provides for an appellate jurisdiction of the High Court with such exceptions and subject to such regulations as the Parliament prescribes; that is under section 73 of the Constitution. The Attorney proposes to amend to the Judiciary Act in the sense that the Parliament itself wiU indicate what jurisdiction should be avaUable. This creates restrictions that obviously the Attorney feels should be created because of what is deemed to be the excessive work of the High Court. I have already indicated in my earlier comments that the ancilliary legislation for the Federal Court will take some of that work. Nevertheless, the Jujurisdiciary Act amendment does indicate that there are to be major restrictions in matters of appeal which may be now brought as ofrightto the High Court from any State supreme courts and other State courts exercising Federal jurisdiction. There is to be a repeal of provisions for automatic removal to and exclusive jurisdiction of the High Court in matters involving the limits inter se of the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth and the States. There is to be complete revision of the subject of removal to the High Court by order of the High Court of cases commenced and pending in other courts, extending the power of the High Court to order such removal beyond the existing category of constitutional cases to cases in Federal or Territory courts and cases where a State court is exercising Federal jurisdiction, and giving the High Court increased power over the removed causes, increased powers or remittal of the whole or part back to the original court, and entirely new powers to direct the further conduct of the cause m the original court. There is to be new power in the High Court of its own motion to remit other court cases commenced as ofrightin the High Court by virtue of the Constitution. I am advised that this could be of some doubtful constitutional validity but since it is well known that the High Court has sought this power for some years it is thought that the High Court is unlikely to hold the new section invalid should there be any test of that position. Generally the two new matters of importance are the conferring upon Commonwealth and State Attorneys-General of a new power in condoes, stitutional cases in any court of intervention the suits of private parties, and provisions ring newrightson legal practitioners of one to appear m courts of other States. As I menthe tioned, there are restrictions. One restriction relates to an appeal as ofright.At present there a $3,000 Umit. It was to be $20,000 but by virtue of another amendment now there may appeal in respect of the quantum; it has to be on other issues. So we do see a restriction there. We have some reservations about that matter because we feel that people must have some basic cause which they would be entitled to litigate. is a bit unfair to suggest that because there sum of money related to quantum only the High Court is not going to be able to be involved less special leave is obtained. We are advised generaUy that at the present time section 38A of the Judiciary Act has the effect that only the High Court may decide quesprovision tions as to the limits inter se of the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth and States, and that present section 40A provides for automatic removal to the High Court of cases commenced in other courts which raise such a question. Clauses 4 and 6 of the Bill will repeal those sections. The result will be that inter se questions may now be decided by other courts and although there will still be power in the High Court to order removal to the High Court of the whole of such a case or the inter se question, there will be no automatic removal. We are suggesting, of course, is our amendment that the High Court still be the major court for the interpretation of the Constitution and appeal as ofrighthi all matters relating interpretation of the Constitution. GeneraUy, in view of the detailed nature of the legislation, I will not delay the House to any great extent. The present section 45 of the Juate. diciary Act permits the High Court, on the appliand cation of a party, only to remit to a State court having jurisdiction in any matter any cause orginally commenced or pending in the High Court. This power has been little used because could not be exercised on the court's own motion. It is chiefly relevant to the class of set out in section 75 of the Constitution, confers absolutely on the High Court jurisdiction in this class of case, which jurisdiction the Parliaduce ment has no power to take away. These cases include cases between States, cases between residents of different States, cases in which Commonwealth or a Commonwealth authority is a party. Clause 6 of the Bill relates to section 44 of the Act. It appears to be doubtful because it it is suggested, subvert the intention of secin tion 75 of the Constitution by permitting for the conferfirst time the High Court of its own motion to State remit to another court any cases commenced in High Court under the Constitution or under Commonwealth legislation. Thus it is now up to is the High Court to decide whether it will hear a case which otherwise it must have done under be no the constitutional legislation. Mr Ellicott- I do not think it is fhefirsttime.",78
159,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,COMMISSION,You do not? I accept that. There is a new power of intervention by the It Attorneys-General. Clause 10 of the Bill prois a poses to create a new power to a Commonwealth or State Attorney-General to intervene in any uncase between private parties pending in any Federal court or any Territory or any State court excerising Federal jurisdiction if the case involved a matter arising under or the interpretation of the Constitution. I think also there is a for a newrightwhereby the legal practitioners can practise in Federal courts other than those of the Territory courts. Debate interrupted.

161,Mr COTTER,ADJOURNMENT," I wish to draw to the attention of the House an injustice to the people who live in a large part of my electorI refer to the hardy race of people who live work in the harsh environment of the PUbara area of Western Australia and who put up with the heat, the dust, the flies and the loneliness. They are faced with the immense cost it of living 1000 miles north of the capital city of Perth. The cost of living is high, the cost of case transport is enormous and the cost of damage to which private vehicles on bad roads etc. is astronomical. These people of the PUbara proa huge percentage of the export income of Australia-proportionatel y far more than any other group of Australian citizens. They are prethe pared to work in adverse conditions in order to produce Australia's wealth. The Pilbara people want the alternative outlet of being able to go to Bah on their days off instead of the long tedious haul down to Perth. It is almost the same cost for a return flight from Port Hedland to Perth as it is from Port Hedland to BaU. MACRobertson MiUar Airline Services quoted $250 Port Hedland-BaU return as against $207 Port Hedland-Perth return. However because of problems with our overseas airline agreement and the request by the Indonesian airline for reciprocal rights, it has been decided to aUow only Qantas Airways Ltd to implement the service. Qantas wUlflyPerth-BaU-Perfh at a fare of $514 or will fly a package tour Perth-BatiPerth for 8 days for $455 including accommodation. Qantas wiU fly another package tour Perth to Bali for 7 days then to Singapore for 7 days and return to Perth for $662 including accommodation. Despite being 1000 miles from Perth and approximately the same distance from BaU and the fact that Port Hedland or Learmonth are almost on the direct route from Perth to BaU, Qantas plans to overfly the PUbara without stopping. In an answer to a question I asked this mornsome ing, the Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon) may have given the impression that Learmonth was unsuitable as an international airport. He could have been mistaken as Learmonth is already designated as the international alternative within Western Australia and is regularly used by the largest planes operating in Australia including Jumbos. In fact a giant American Air Force StarUfter aircraft lands and takes off from Learmonth on a regular round-the-world trip every week. The demand for this overseas flight to BaU originated in the PUbara and has the port of aU local government bodies, all the ing companies and chambers of commerce as well as the 50 000 people living in the immediate vicinity. It also has the support of the State bers for PUbara and North Province who have put forward strong representations on the solidated matter. It would be criminal if Qantas were to be lowed to overfly the PUbara without stopping and so force the people Uving in that area to an additional $450 to $480 and be forced to travel an extra 2000 mUes. I ask the Minister reconsider his decision and to require Qantas land at Learmonth on the way to and from BaU. ask the Minister to identify the deficiencies Port Hedland with a view to upgrading this port to the standards necessaiy to allow use international nights. When these deficiencies have been remedied Qantas should be required to land at Port Hedland. If this leads to a move reciprocalflightsto and from Port Hedland by the Indonesian airline it will be a desirable extension of the service to the people of PUbara.",80
162,Dr KLUGMAN,ADJOURNMENT," I take the opportunity tonight to make one criticism of the people who decide programming of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. The ABC Monday Conference program last night dealt with Darwin. The pros and cons of what has happened since the cyclone in Darwin nearly 2 years ago were discussed. The point I make is that the program was recorded in Darwin in mid September. That point was also made during the program. It was obviously felt at that stage not to show the program. It was shown last night obviously to publicise the book written by Major General Alan Stretton. I will not comment on the book because I have not read it and I do not know the detaUs of it, but I think it is completely wrong for the ABC to get involved in commercial advertising without being paid for it. I know that the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Ruddock) once suggested in this House that the ABC should get involved in advertising. I have reservations about that. Advertising is a matter of collecting money and not a question of doing the advertising for nothing. It is not a matter of using handouts to pubUcise a particular commercial venture, and this obviously is a commercial venture. I do not know the pubUshers of the book but they must have some influence with today, the programmers at the ABC. I am not criticising Robert Moore, the producer of Monday Conference. The program was suprecorded in mid-September and he may well minhave been unaware that the book by Alan Stretton was to come out some 2 months later. We do not want the ABC to deteriorate into the memsort of news organisation of the daUy papers in Sydney. The 3 groups, including the old ConPress group, have significant interests in travel agencies. They push overseas travel continuously with pages and pages of pubUcity alhandouts. Anybody who reads the Sydney Morning Herald, the Daily Telegraph, the Sun and the pay Daily Mirror must be impressed or depressed by the pages and pages of obvious handouts which to appear day after day, week after week. The only to reason for them of course is that the owners of I the newspapers also have an interest in travel at agencies and they also accept advertisements airfrom people involved in overseas travel. By by doing this the newspapers in effect deteriorate into the sort of throw away papers of the suburbs. The suburban papers quite openly accept to editorial matter for the purpose of advertising. I conclude by in fact giving a commercial for booklet that has been published by a former eral Party candidate for one of the seats in Australian Capital Territory, Larry Pickering. refer to a lovely cartoon in which the present Treasurer (Mr Lynch) is depicted walking blindly along the road. Somebody asks him: 'How come you are blind?' He says: 'It is becausehis I have been over-stimulating the private sector'. congratulate Pickering in seeing that point. I felt Uke raising it this afternoon when the Treasurer a union. again talked about stimulating the private sector.",81
163,Mr BURR,ADJOURNMENT," I hope I can years have the indulgence of the House to very briefly was aI member quote from a speech of mine last week. In speaking to the ConcUiation and Arbitration Bill (No. 2) 19761 said: I believe-and I believe this view is also held age worker-that unionists extreme Left or the extreme Right. trade union leaders who have at heart the genuine interests of the worker and not the wielding of political power. For making those comments I was accused by furtherBURRthe honourable member for Burke (Mr Keith work as a shiftwas Johnson) of union bashing. I am not sure what Perhaps honourable members the honourable member for Burke interprets union bashing but I well remember a few weeks ago reading an article written in the Australian Financial Review under the nom de plume of Australia. 'Modest member of Parliament'. He stated that Party anyone who dares to criticise the union leaderbasis ship in Australia must inevitably be branded union basher. I think that this was borne out the comments of the honourable member for Burke in branding me a union basher for simply saying that the rank and file trade unionists Australia in fact want to be led by moderate trade union leaders who have their genuine interests at heart. While I must admit to being these somewhat peeved by the comments of the unionspeople honourable member for Burke, I was heartened to some degree when I read the Australian morning and noted the remarks of one of the most formidable and noted trade union leaders in Australia, Sir John Egerton. Sir John Egerton had this to say on this question: Unions have been let run wild and the situation is now where they are dictating not just industrial policy policy, defence policy and a whole host of other things are not properly within the concept of bona fide unionism. Further on Sir John said: I am very much opposed to the blatant political actions that some unions are involving their members in and detriment of the members. I am reUeved that Sir John adopts the same attidiscuss tude as I to the actions of the trade union leaders in involving themselves in blatant political a actions that are, in fact, to the detriment of the Libtrade union movement and to the detriment of the the trade union rank andfilemember. I was also I interested during the debate last week on the ConcUiation and Arbitration Bill in the comments of the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Innes). The honourable member said during speech at the Committee stage of the Bill: I Honourable members Opposite are so inclined to talk about unions but not one of them has ever been a member of In point of fact the honourable member has not done his homework. I point out that for many was a member of a trade union. In fact, I of the Australian Workers Union for 8 years and I was a member of the Printing and Kindred Industries Union for a further 3 years. During the period that I was a member of by the averthe AWU I worked as a shearer and a casual do not want a part of either the They want moderate farm labourer. Mr Hodges- A good one too. Mr I was a good one. I went on when I a member of the PKIU to operator in a paper factory. opposite wonder as why a person who came from such a lowly background might choose to join the Liberal Party of The reasons I chose to join the Liberal was that I worked with those people-the ordinary workers of Australia-wh o are the very of this country. I know what they want, not a what the trade union leaders think they want but by in fact they do not want I know because I have worked with them. That is the reason. I have gained an intimate knowledge of those people on of the shop floor. I believe that it is the Liberal Party which can best represent the ordinary rank and file trade union member in Australia, not who abuse their role in the trade for blatant political reasons. this Mr YOUNG (Port Adelaide) (10.43)- I do not wish to respond to the honourable member for WUmot (Mr Burr). Apparently he has had second thoughts about his speech last week. As he is a former shearer, one would have thought that he was better trained. We must have missed but foreign some of them. This week, obviously as will be that known to aU honourable members, thousands of trade Australians will take upon themselves their right to participate in demonstrations and to discuss in meetings the impact upon their future Uves as a result of the actions taken in this country just one to the year ago. I have seen many contributions to that debate and to what Australians might have to in the future and about which parts of the Constitution may have to be amended to safeguard therightsof this House. A Uttle whtie ago I was given the latest contribution to the debate, a book called The Makers and the Breakers. I do not wish to comment upon the authors' particular and specinc comments about the events but it is interesting to note the way in which they have drawn together quotes of the people who drew up the Constitution. I think it is of interest when looking through these to see that obviously what happened last year in Australia was never seen as likely to happen by the people who framed the Constitution of Australia. There can be no doubt that whilst the demonstrations perhaps express the rage of the people, nonetheless there will have to be a very serious discussion in this country about the changes which are necessary to see that the House of Representatives, maintains its position as the governing House of Australia. Until such time as that debate is concluded satisfactorily to the House of Representatives no doubt we will see people in the Senate being quite cavalier about the way in which the powers in the Constitution may be interpreted and used by the Senate. Obiously, it would mean that if that action was to be continued we could not look forward to a parliamentary democracy in Australia. As one of the founders of the Constitution said, there is a very thin line between what is right and revolution. I think that if honourable members opposite and honourable members on our side of the House were to sit down and look at the record of discussions that took place and the conference minutes of the framers of the Constitution they would see that what happened last year was not envisaged. I quote what Alfred Deakin had to say about the role of the Governor General: A Governor General will be required to act in this as in other matters on the advice of to be endowed with the personal power to act over the heads of Parliament and the ministry. Obviously Deakin did not see the Governor General ever taking the decision which was taken in Australia in 1975. Sir John Downer, who was a very conservative poUtician in that day and age, had this to say: We are not prepared to interfere with the cardinal principle of our constitution, and the Government should be only the nominal head of the executive and not become a real substantial legislative force in the community. If conservative poUticians in that day and age Uke Sir John Downer held those views, again this is further evidence that what happened in Australia last year was wrong. Dr Coburn, who was also a participant in those discussions, had this to say: The Governor General's highest function would be to be a dummy and although he was the only link between us and the Crown, in being that link he was less than the least in the whole of the colonies, a useless image and bauble. Finally, I wish to quote Alfred Deakin again on the question of the Governor General. I want to repeat this because I think it is terribly important in terms of what discussions take place in Australia in the future. He said: The Governor General will be required to act in this, as in other matters, on the advice of his executive. In no case is he to be endowed with the personal power to go over the heads of the Parliament and the Ministry.  cuss a problem which I have already raised with the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) in relation to primary producers. Many people consider that primary producers carry an unfair burden in regard to the estate duty they pay. Figures cited to me reveal that primary producers pay about 6 per cent of total income tax collected and yet pay about 30 per cent of estate duty collected. Of course, the problem arises because a farmerrequiresa physical asset-hi s land-befor e he can earn an income whereas, for example, a pubUc servant has everything supplied by the State or Federal government and has to supply only his labour. At present, the Commonwealth Government applies a rebate of 50 per cent to primary producers whose estates do not exceed $140,000. The rebate then diminishes untU it ceases where the estate exceeds $250,000. Two points arise. One is that the $140,000 limit has remained unchanged for a considerable period. Unlike income tax payments which the Government has now indexed, there is no such indexation of rebate Umits. I think this should be the subject of Government consideration. I urge the Treasurer to investigate the possibiUty of indexing these limits in the next Budget. his executive. In no case is he However, I am concerned that in these times of inflation a 50 per cent primary producer rebate which diminishes under Commonwealth legislation ought to be aflat50 per centrebatefor all primary producers. I understand that the South Australian and Victorian State Governments already apply aflat50 per cent primary producer rebate. I strongly urge that the Commonwealth investigate the possibUity of doing likewise. I that is that the nominal head of have received from the Minister assisting the Treasurer an undertaking that a proposal for a flat 50 per cent primary producer rebate will be reviewed when the Government examines the recommendations of the Asprey Taxation Review Committee. The amount of the present rural propertyrebatein estate duty assessments issued in the 1973-74 financial year was $1.9m. A rough estimate of the cost to the Government of making a primary producer rebate of aflat50 per cent would be under $4m. It would mean that there would be less pressure to sell all tion of what in many cases are viable farms to pay probate. It would encourage the primary producer in his later years to continue to improve his farm, knowing that his efforts would be of value to his family and would not all go towards paying probate. I reiterate that I urge the Government in its future considerations of this matter to review the plight of the Australian primary producer.",82
164,Mr LES MCMAHON,ADJOURNMENT," Mr Speaker, with the Minister for Social Security (Senator Guilfoyle) over the last 6 months there has been an exchange of correspondence concerning 2 important projects in the electorate of Sydney. These projects, one for the South Sydney Municipal Council and the other for the Leichhardt Municipal Council are for welfare centres. The South Sydney Municipal Council has an architect's estimate of the cost of one project-the renovation of the Reg Cope Welfare Centre which has been in existence for approximately 20 years. Reg Cope is a brother of the former Speaker of this House, Mr Jim Cope. The total cost of the project, is estimated to be $214,000. The property is at 55 Pitt Street, Redfern. It was transferred to the Council on its incorporation in 1968 from the Council of the City of Sydney. There is no trouble about the title. The property is situated within a residential (2)b zone. The unimproved capital value is $26,000 as at 3 June 1975. The Council will provide its share of the project cost from its general revenue fund. There is a plan indicating the location of the Reg Cope Welfare Centre. The area is well serviced by bus transport to bring patients to the centre and the centre services residents who are within walking distance. The project is designed to provide dining and welfare facilities for approximately 130 persons daily. Daily activities at the existing centre include cards, television, housie, library and indoor bowls. It is proposed to extend these activities to the new building and to introduce arts and crafts and social events-activitie s now precluded because of the inadequate accommodation within the existing building. It is considered that there will be no future need to expand the premises. The Council is already operating 4 other welfare centres within the municipality. The 4 centres are the Ron Williams Welfare Centre, the Gordon Ibbett Welfare Centre, the Harry Burland Welfare Centre and the Cliff Nobel Welfare Centre. I do hope that the Minister for Social Security in her wisdom will agree to the allocation of this amount of or por- $214,000. It will help the Reg Cope Welfare Centre in South Sydney. There are 2 welfare centres in Leichhardt. One is the Harry Hannaford Welfare Centre. The Council originally decided to buy the property on 15 July 1975. On 18 August 1975 the Council asked the architect to make a report and to prepare a scheme for the conversion of the property to an aged persons centre. The Council received a plan on 15 September 1975. It applied to the Under-Secretary of the Department of Local Government on 24 September 1975. It enclosed the architect's report on the scheme and it was agreed to. The Council advised that the total preliminary cost would amount to $165,480 of which the amount of $55,000 was Council's contribution and was the cost of the land. The Council then asked the State Government for a subsidy of $2 for every $1 under the States Grants (Home Care) Act 1969-73. The estimates went to the State Department of Local Government and were forwarded to the Commonwealth Department of Social Security. While waiting for the subsidy, the Council started to carry on with the work. At this stage it has spent $70,000 including $55,000 for the cost of the land. We expect there will be a deputation of South Sydney aldermen, the Mayor of South Sydney, Leichhardt aldermen and the Mayor of Leichhardt to meet the Minister for Social Security in connection with these worthy projects for the older people in the area of Sydney. We would like a sympathetic reply. The City of Sydney has 5 welfare centres. South Sydney has four and the Leichhardt Council has two. I think that consideration should be given to granting these extra few dollars to help the older people of the electorate.",84
165,Mr HODGMAN,ADJOURNMENT," I rise very briefly to pay a tribute to 2 members of this honourable House in relation to 2 separate matters which I believe have a common link. Firstly, I wish to express what I believe to be the pleasure of all honourable members at the appointment to the ministry of the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Macphee). Mr Speaker, I noted with interest that when you called the Minister at question time today you noted the pleasure that you enjoyed, as did we all, in seeing the honourable member for Balaclava as a Minister in this Parliament. Without appearing in any way platitudinous, I noted with some interest today a report in the Melbourne Press of a comment made by an absent friend now representing this country temporarily at the United Nations. I refer to the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron) who, last year, apparently made the complaint that due to noise in the be chamber he could not hear the honourable memTasmania ber for Balaclava. He added that the honourable member for Balaclava was one of the few on this side of the House who were worth listening I think it was pleasing that the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Dr Cass) had the honour of asking the new Minister for ductivity the veryfirstquestion that he received in the chamber. The unbridled pleasure which was witnessed on both sides of the House at the appointment of this outstanding member of this Parliament, I believe, is something which ought not to pass unnoticed. He will be an outstanding Minister and if I might say so, as one who has admired the honourable member for a long time, I believe that all in this House will wish him well. I am aware that the honourable member for PbilUp (Mr Birney) wishes to speak and I shall make my remarks brief. The other honourable member to whom I wish to refer is the honourmen able member for Braddon (Mr Groom). He has an enormous weight on his shoulders at this time and isfightinga very substantial battle for a very significant part of his electorate. It is a small by it. speck on the map of Australia. I ask the House to take note that the honourable member for Braddon is endeavouring to retain part of his electorate which is on the brink of destruction. It would a tragedy for this country if the west coast of were to go out of existence as it may well do. I appeal to honourable members on both sides of the chamber to support the honourto. able member for Braddon in what he is doing. He certainly needs the support of this House if he is to save the west coast of Tasmania which is Prounder a very grave threat of extinction.",84
166,Mr GOODLUCK,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to pay comptiment to the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) for arranging a very novel situation tonight in which the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Road Safety went to Yass and talked atfirsthand with the truck drivers. In particular the Committee looked at the road safety aspects of heavy duty vehicles which was most interesting. I am afraid that sometimes politicians are apt to deal in theoretical situations rather than the practicaUties. Tonight we had the opportunity to see these in action, tofindout their problems and to ask them at first hand exactly how they feel about road safety and heavy duty vehicles. I can assure all members of the House that we learned Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 11 p.m. The following answers to questions upon notice Mr Hodges asked the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, upon notice: (1) Are orchids, other flowers Australia; if so, from which countries.

(2) What expertise does the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee possess in allergic diseases and their treatment.",89
170,Mr HUNT,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Medical research in Australia is funded from a multiplicity of sources. As there is no register of research supported from private sources such as drug companies, private foundations and funds it is not possible to give an estimate the total annual expenditure on research into allergic diseases. The Commonwealth Government finances medical research through the National Health and Medical Research Council. The Council supports projects into allergic diseases at a cost of$43,000. Dr A. J. Woolcock, 'The pharmacological nature of bronchial hyperactivity in asthma' Dr R. V. Southcott, 'Harmful effects to man from animals and plants' Dr K. J. Turner, 'Immunological studies on allergic disease'. (2) The six medical practitioner members of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee include two consultant physicians and a consultant paediatrician as well as two general practitioners and a neurologist. The Committee also includes a Professor of Therapeutics and Clinical Pharmacology. It was never envisaged that the Committee would provide from within its membership, expertise in all the many specialities of medicine and it does not include a specialist allergist. However, to keep abreast of the latest developments in the various fields of medicine, the Committee meets periodically with representatives of the various medical Colleges and Societies, including the Australian College of Allergists. In addition, the Committee from time to time seeks expert advice from specialists and specialist bodies where the Committee considers such action to be appropriate.

Mr Lynch-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The question of reducing the rate of sales tax on road vehicle safety components has been re-examined, as the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Road Safety recommended in its May 1976 Report. The conclusion reached is that the weight to be attached to the advice conveyed by the Treasury to the Committee remains the same. Indeed, that advice seems to be reinforced by some of the views expressed by the Committee, notably in paragraphs 161 and 173 of its Report. (Question No. 1244) Mogadon (Question No. 1328) Mr Neil asked the Minister for Health, upon of the recently notice: Why is it necessaiy for the drug Mogadon to be prescribed small quantities thus necessitating frequent visits to a docon tor and increased costs to Medibank.",92

The Committee siders that the maximum quantity of 25 is adequate, instances, to establish a sleep pattern.
