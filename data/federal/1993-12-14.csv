1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. Stephen Martin) took the chair at 2 p.m., and read prayers. NA Community Grants",11
2,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories.",11
3,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Ah, the big issues again.",11
4,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is a big issue to the people of Australia-$30 million. It goes to the very heart of what is wrong with your government. Yesterday in the House the minister denied that she had 'destroyed any single document' associated with the sports rorts issue. Does the minister deny that her office destroyed or withheld any records relating to the community cultural, recreation and sporting facilities program?",11
5,Mrs KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have absolutely no knowledge of my department, myself or my office destroying any such document. Economy",11
6,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to reports in this morning's media that Treasury has significantly upgraded its forecasts the performance of the economy in the current financial year. Can the Treasurer provide the House with any further information on the forecasts?,11
7,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"At about this time each year, following the publication of the September quarter national accounts, the Treasury, along with other Commonwealth agencies, engages in a review of the forecasts for the current financial year. That review of the forecasts has not been completed yet, but the Treasury has given me advice about its views on the forecasts for the current financial year. In relation to GOP growth, it expects that now to be in excess of three per cent, compared with the budget time forecast of 23/4 per cent. In relation to inflation, the forecast has been reduced from the 3 1h per cent at budget time to under three per cent now. I will dwell on those two figures for a moment. The fact that we have got growth above three per cent and inflation below three per cent is quite frankly a magic combination. It is a very long time since Australia has seen its inflation rate below that of its growth. Herein lies the key to our economic progress over the next few years: the fact that we can have strengthening economic growth whilst at the same time maintaining a low level of CPI measured inflation. The other encouraging advice from the Treasury is an upgrading of its employment growth forecasts from the budget time figure of three-quarters of a per cent to something around 11/4 per cent or a little more now. This means that there is an expectation that the growth we have seen on the job front since the beginning of this financial year-where 100,000 jobs have been added-will continue for the rest of the year. It probably is not possible to expect that there will be simply a continuation of the current rate of job growth that we have seen over the last five months. There are all kinds of seasonal and other factors which come into play. Bearing in mind that the budget time forecast was for 100,000 jobs for the entire financial year and that that figure has already been achieved, it is clearly the case that there will be a growth in jobs well in excess of that for anticipated at the time of the budget. This is not just a question of a set of measurements being relayed into forecasts; it is also a question of the measurement of business and consumer confidence. There have been a number of surveys recently, the most recent of which being the BCA survey, to which the Prime Minister referred yesterday. There have been others, including from the National Australia Bank, Dun and Bradstreet, the Australian Chamber of Manufactures and so on, and they have been recording a pick-up in business confidence. As well as that, we have seen from the WestpacMelbourne Institute work that the measure of consumer confidence rose in trend terms in December to reach a five-year high. These are very good signs for the Australian economy and, again, they are underpinned by concrete evidence of some very important changes to the composition of growth. This was revealed in the latest national accounts figures, which show that it is the private sector rather than the public sector which is making the stronger contribution to growth. This is entirely consistent with what the government had in mind when it decided to provide a stimulus through the public sector from the time of the One Nation statement and from the subsequent two budgets. It was anticipated that, as that public expenditure did its work in the economy and as it began to trail off, we would see a pick-up in private sector activity of precisely the kind that we are seeing now, which is providing the fortification for the continuation of the recovery. Even in the area of business investment, which has of course been disappointingly low, if we look at the last national account figures, we see that both plant and equipment and non-dwelling construction expenditure grew strongly in the September quarter. So underlying business investment has been improving over 1993 and has increased by a strong six per cent in the September quarter. We are seeing these forecasts being upgraded and, as well as that, we are seeing that fortified by growth in business investment, improvements in business expectations and improvements in consumer confidence. I think we are seeing not only the real evidence of jobs being created but also improvements on the job vacancy front. The Treasury is not alone in making these more optimistic assessments of the economy. BT Australia has provided a comparison of its forecasts with the average forecasts of those economists polled by the AFR and published on 10 December. We see from both the BT forecast and the average of the others that they are all forecasting for 1993-94 growth rates, inflation rates and employment growth of the kind of magnitude which the Treasury now thinks will provide the underpinning for the revised forecasts for official purposes. This is good news for Australia and it confirms the sense of economiC policy that we have been pursuing for the last couple of years. Our task now is to see this recovery broaden and strengthen and see the benefits of it flow to more and more Australians. Community Grants",11
8,Mr JULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I refer the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories to the grant of $200,000 to the Mount Gravatt Workers Club. As the club did not officially exist when the grant was announced in January 1993, nor had it received Brisbane City Council approval for its project, was a needs criteria used in making this grant? If so, how does the minister justify refusing a grant of just $30,000 to the Logan City Council to expand sporting facilities at Underwood Park in the Liberal held Fadden electorate to allow all-year use of the oval for cricket, soccer, softball and athletics? As this project would have catered for six of the seven target groups under the program, including communities with high unemployment, large migrant populations and youth and residents in inner urban areas, what grounds did the minister have for rejecting this application in favour of the Mount Gravatt project other than the political requirement to protect the marginal ALP seat of Moreton?",12
9,Mrs KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member has raised a specific question about one of the 2,863 applications received. Of those, 726 projects were successful. I will, of course, be happy to look into the specific project, and the request, and give him an answer. Uruguay Round",12
10,Mr HARRY WOODS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Can he tell the House whether a new world trade deal is likely this week? Does he believe that a good outcome to the Uruguay Round would boost the world economy and would it support the expansion of the Australian economy?,12
11,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I am delighted to be able to inform the House that the . world is now within reach of a very favourable outcome to the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations under the GATT. These negotiations began seven years ago. This government has neVer wavered in its commitment of time, . resources and energy to fight for a result which would take the monkey of agricultural protectionism off the back of our farmers and which would help our service exports and our manufactured exports. We will know for sure in 48 hours the precise outcome of the round but my judgment is that the overall result of the round will be good for the major economies, good for Australia and good for the world. The government's trade minister, Senator Cook, is now in Geneva, fighting for the best possible outcome on commodities of particular interest to us in markets of particular interest to us. We will see those results later in the week. Indeed, it needs to be recorded that Senator Cook has played a very important and energetic role in these closing months of the round, no less so in these closing days of the round when he has had some considerable success in improving the market access questions and maintaining markets for Australia in particular areas in particular commodities. It is also worth recording that it was very encouraging that the Prime Minister of Japan, Prime Minister Hosokawa, had the wisdom and-in the context of the Japanese political system-the bravery to beat down his opposition and declare this morning that Japan will open its rice market. I congratulate him on a wise and profoundly important decision and one that has never been capable of being made in years gone by. Similarly; late last week we saw President Kim Young-Sam of Korea announce the opening of the Korean rice market, which was another wise and difficult decision taken by one of the most eminent and far-sighted of Asian statesmen. Japan will be opening its very lucrative market in 1995 to around 400,000 tonnes of imported rice equivalent to four per cent of domestic production. Over six years, from 1995 to the year 2000, that access will expand to 800,000 tonnes. The Japanese market for imported rice in the year 2000 will therefore be almost double Australia's current level of total rice exports which are valued around $230 million. We now know that we have a new deal in agriculture which will mean major cuts to export subsidies, border protection and internal supports. We know that we are going to see some very useful cuts to protection against industrial goods. We will see service exports enhanced. For the Australian economy, which still relies on commodity exports but which in recent years has tripled both its service exports and its manufacturing exports, the balance of the package is very favourable indeed. The global impact of the Uruguay Round, as it is presently shaping up, may add around $400 billion annually to world GDP when the reforms are fully implemented. Australia stands to gain around $2 112 billion in GDP and tens of thousands of new jobs as a consequence of these more open and liberal trading rules. So the imminent conclusion of the new world trade agreement adds to the good news which we have already seen in our economy. As the Treasurer said a moment ago, the Treasury is revising up its growth forecast for this year. A hundred thousand jobs have been created in the last three months. The growth recorded in the economy was 3.4 per· cent over the year to the last quarter. This comes at a time when we have, as the Treasurer again reminded the House, low inflation. With the potential of an opening up of trading opportunities under the GATT, I think this bodes well for the economy in the midto late-1990s-particularly as we see GDP accelerating. So, could I again just reiterate that seven years of prodigious effort into the GATT round seems to be paying off. The government has devoted a tremendous amount of energy to it. I think it will prove to be a substantial boon for Australia to our earnings potential, to our GDP and to building on the things that we are now doing domestically, as the Treasurer said a moment ago, to lift employment and incomes and to make the Australian economy so much better and stronger in the 1990s. Community Grants",12
12,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed at to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories. On 1 December, Senator MCMullan wrote to the arts community saying that· arts grants are made on an arm's length peer review basis 'to ensure politicians do not have a say in deciding who is awarded grants'. If it is important that politicians do not have a. say in who is awarded arts grants, why is it not important that politicians do not have a say in who is awarded sports and cultural grants? Why did the minister take it on herself to personally decide who received sports and cultural grants rather than have it done at arm's length by her department?",13
13,Mrs KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The processes for assessing those grants have been outlined in the Auditor-General's report. As I have said, the criteria and the guidelines were set in the criteria. The Auditor-General has made certain recommendations about the administration of the report. I find many of his recommendations very constructive. If there is a new program, I will, of course, take those recommendations into consideration when designing that new program. Tourism: Japanese Tourists",14
14,Mr NEWELL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Tourism. Is the minister aware of reports that the downturn in the Japanese economy has reduced the number of Japanese tourists expected to visit Australia this year? Can he infonn the House of the significance of the Japanese market and what initiatives the government is taking to ensure that Australia continues to be a highly desired destination for Japanese tourists?,14
15,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Japan remains Australia's largest source of inbound tourists. In 1992 we had a 19 per cent growth in the number of Japanese citizens coming to Australia, bringing the number to 630,000, who spend money and create jobs in our country. A number of newspaper articles have suggested, as the honourable member for Richmond stated, that there is a difficulty with the number of Japanese travellers coming to Australia because of the recession in Japan. While it is true that there has been a-I would have thought some opposition members would have been interested in an industry that is earning a few export dollars for Australia.",14
16,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I take a point of order. Is it orderly for members to stand up, have audible conversations and hand papers amongst each other when somebody is answering a question?",14
17,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is no point of order. The minister is answering the question and will get to that answer.,14
18,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I was saying, despite the fact that the Japanese economy is in recessionunlike the Australian economy-and the fact that outbound travel from Japan has declined, in the first nine months of this year Australia has had a six per cent growth in the number of Japanese travellers coming to Australia. So our market share is increasing. One Japanese wholesaler said to me that, in a declining market, Australia is the only area where there is growth. That is something which we will ensure continues, because the Tourist Commission will spend over $13 million this year in trying to encourage more Japanese travellers to come to Australia. I know a lot of people claim that Japanese travellers pre-purchase packages and not much money comes to Australia. I got the figures out. The value to Australia of prepaid package Japanese tourists is estimated to be more than $400 million. In addition, they spend more than $700 million while they are here. Mr Speaker, next time you are on one of the scenic beaches in Wollongong and see a Japanese couple and you are thinking of offering to take their photograph, just think that that couple has probably contributed more than $4,000 to the Australian economy in export earnings. They probably deserve to have their photograph taken.",14
19,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,They are well looked after on the beaches of the IIIawarra.,14
20,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Australia's success in continuing to promote our tourism industry will improve as we get the Partnership Australia program going and increase cooperation between the Commonwealth and the states. I am pleased to be able to say that last week I signed the first agreement with any of the states-with my friend Bob Gibbs in Queensland. We hope to have the agreement signed with New South Wales later this week, with other states following soon after. Partnership Australia will ensure that we get more bang for the dollar in the money that the Commonwealth and the states spend overseas in promoting Australia as a tourist destination. That program will help fund a centralised information service for overseas visitors and travel agents and will ensure, for example, that if a state wants to have a cooperative tactical marketing campaign-perhaps sending letters by direct mail to travel agents in Singapore, Malaysia or other countries'-this can be done under Partnership Australia with the Commonwealth and the states. sharing the cost. Partnership Australia will completely revolutionise the way we promote Australia as a destination for tourists. That will help earn export dollars for Australia and provide jobs for young Australians. Community Grants",14
21,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again addressed to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories. I refer the minister to her undertaking to the honourable member for Fadden to look into the rejection of the application for a grant by the Logan City Council. How does the minister propose to look into this matter when the Auditor General found that no documents existed to justify any of the decisions?",15
22,Mrs KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,In the letter I wrote to the Auditor-General I pointed out a number of criteria which I took into account. I would like to go through those. The department's schedule is the main one. Mr Tim Fischer-Why don't you resign?,15
23,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Those on my left!,15
24,Mrs KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I said: ... however for your information I also take into account the selection criteria and priorities published in the program guidelines. In addition I consider the overall amount to be expended, consultation with State Governments, the need for reasonably even geographic distribution of projects, the immediate employment impact of projects, the need to provide facilities for disadvantaged ... communities, the desirability of encouraging use and joint school/community facilities and representations from Members of Parliament, local councils etc. Pharmaceutical Industry Development Program",15
25,Mr GRIFFIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development. In light of recent publicity about the commercialisation of Australian medical research, can the minister report on the performance of the government's pharmaceutical industry development program-the factor F program? What progress has been made in achieving the objectives of the program?",15
26,Mr GRIFFITHS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Ithank the honourable member for Corinel1a-my near namesakefor his question. The pharmaceutical industry development program has been very highly effective in increasing local activity and exports in the pharmaceutical industry. Mr Tim Fischer-What about bun gee jumping?,15
27,Mr GRIFFITHS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the National Party interjects. He is on the record as saying that he has been the beneficiary of some of these products. I think that morphine was the case in point. He might have been on it again just recently. Mr Tim Fischer- Mr Speaker, that is a little below the belt.",15
28,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister might stick to the response he has.,15
29,Mr GRIFFITHS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I was provoked, Mr Speaker. Since 1987 when the scheme was first announced, the domestic value added in pharmaceutical exports has risen from $50 million per annum to some $200 million. By the end of the program in 1999, value added in exports is expected to reach $600 million per annum. Last week I announced the major commitments that Faulding, an Australian owned pharmaceutical company from the state of South Australia, and a very good one indeed, and Glaxo Australia are making to the further development of the research based pharmaceutical industry in Australia. Just to give honourable members some sense of the multi- dimensions of this, the companies have committed to cumulative replacement more than $2.5 billion worth of imports to 1999 and over the same period achieve exports of some $680 million. They have also committed to invest over $200 million in new medical research and development which will go to Australia's commercial advantage. The announcement this month by Glaxo Australia that a revolutionary flu drug developed in Australia will be tested in the United States of America next year is an important example of just how successful this program has been. The flu drug is based on 15 years of CSIRO research, and the commercialisation is backed by Glaxo in partnership with the Melbourne firm Biota. Successful commercialis-tion of the drug would bring returns of over $2 billion. This market is absolutely huge. This product can be sold anywhere in the world where people can say 'aitchoo'. I will not give up the day job, Mr Speaker. Much of the financial benefit will flow to Australia. Supported by the factor F program, the locally owned company Faulding has developed innovative drug delivery systems, and the commercialisation of kapanol, Faulding's sustained pain relief formulation, is progressing well with full-scale manufacturing trials having been undertaken in Australia. These are the sorts of smart ideas emanating from a clever country. They are of international significance, and ought to be regarded as such. By way of interjection earlier I made some comments about a derivative of the poppies that are grown in Tasmania. I will not traverse that ground again, but this is really a good example of how high technology adds value to this industry. In conclusion, a certain comrade in this House, comrade Costello, may have benefited from the calming influence of this morphine based drug, kapanol. A prescription before yesterday's press conference, when he indicated that the only move that he was going' to make was upwards, might have been a particularly good use of this drug. Native Title",15
30,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I ask the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy whether he agrees with the following statement of the National Farmers Federation Executive Director, Rick Farley: Pastoralists could be joined in court actionson Mabo c1aimswhich are likely to be protracted aJld hellishly expensiveandIt would be absolutely inequitable if their costs not met by the Crown. In view of this statement from an organisation which has until now supported the government's approach to Mabo, what will the government now do to try to get the government to remove from the bill the hardship clause that will apply before land-holders can get assistance?",16
31,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The fact of the matter is that the farming community will be. involved in protracted disputes and claims about land if our legislation does not pass through the two chambers. If there is to be uncertainty,16
32,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You don't believe that.,16
33,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do believe it, and the Leader of the Opposition ought to understand it because they believe it. The Leader of the Opposition should understand the reason why the National Farmers Federation, has been calling on all opposition members, particularly this National Party group over here, to get behind and back the legislation. In Western Australia, where a lot of this concern exists, under the West Australian legislation there is no effective validation pre-1975 and no certainty as to sensibly dealing with future land grants. So if opposition members are genuinely concerned about the future certainty attaching to farming properties, they ought to get behind the legislation. The other part of the question concerned financial assistance. As part of the Mabo package, the government said that it .is prepared in test cases to ensure that, where financial assistance is given to one side, it will also be made available to the other. The decision on whether or not financial assistance is given will not be based on the opposition's silly notion of a hardship test but on a recommendation from the Attorney General, who will be advised by a committee on which will sit a representative of the National Farmers Federation. That is the commitment that we gave the National Farmers Federation. Is it any wonder that the executive director of that organisation was not only prepared to support the government's position on Mabo but also prepared-and succeeded in doing so-to carry the whole of the National Farare mers Federation. The only people who are out of step with the farming community are those in the coalition whose stance against the Mabo legislation can only add to uncertainty for the farm sector. Mental Health",16
34,Ms CRAWFORD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services. I ask: can the minister inform the House of the progress of the national mental health strategy.",17
35,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,17
36,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Those on my left will cease interjecting.,17
37,Mr HOWE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for her question. The national mental health strategy was released in June last year, providing a framework where, for the first time, the Commonwealth would work together with the states in a detailed way, particularly in the development of community based services for people with mental illness. Mental illness is extremely widespread within the community. Indeed, quite a high proportion of the population at anyone time may well experience serious mental illness or mental problems. So the development of a mental health strategy was very important. It preceded the release of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission report by Brian Burdekin, which was a comprehensive airing of a range of issues relating to services available for people with mental illness.",17
38,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The Deputy Prime Minister might resume his seat for a minute. On no fewer than two or three occasions this afternoon I have requested those on my left to maintain some decorum and dignity in this place. I refer those honourable members, especially those on the front bench, to standing order No. 55, with which I suggest they acquaint themselves. Mr Downer-This is a ban on humour.",17
39,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the honourable member for Mayo.,17
40,Mr HOWE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I understand that the Leader of the Opposition requested a briefing from Brian Burdekin on his report but, apparently, the opposition is not interested in hearing about this particular issue. The Burdekin report followed the development of a national mental health strategy. The Commonwealth spends something like $2.5 billion a year in assistance for people who are mentally ill, through both income support and Medicare measures. The national mental health strategy will add $135 million to that over five years for particular programs that will care for people at a community level. As Brian Burdekin pointed out in his report, the question of mental illness is not one of going back to institutionalisation but of moving forward to improve services at a community level. That is very much in line with what the Commonwealth is doing through the national mental health strategy: targeting funds for services that either enable people to be cared for in acute hospitals close to where their families live so that they have normal visiting support, or provide housing and other services at a community level. It is important that we build on the national mental health strategy. The Attorney-General and I have established a task force at Commonwealth level that will examine in some detail the Burdekin report and its recommendations which go to many areas of public policy at both the Commonwealth and state levels. We will do that in a way which will allow us to consult relevant ministers at state level in March or April next year and to respond to the Burdekin report overall in 12 months. Unlike the opposition, the government takes policy very seriously and we recognise where we need to develop policy on the basis of programs. We also need to be thinking across programs and across levels of government. In the national mental health strategy we anticipate that approach and, in our response to Burdekin, will take that approach further. . The issue of mental health in this community is a serious problem-it is not a simple problem-and it requires complex solutions and a change in culture. So the Commonwealth will work with the states to achieve a much more comprehensive approach to mental health care and treatment than we have ever seen before in this country for people who are mentally ill. That builds on this government's record on social policy, which has been to take issues that need to be tackled at their roots and deal with them across programs and, if necessary, across levels of government. As we respond to Burdekin, I think it will be clear to all honourable members of this House that it is a serious response worthy of Burdekin's report. It was a very comprehensive report indeed. For most Australians, the report was certainly very salutary and one to be taken very seriously. That is the way the government will respond to it. Native Title",17
41,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I direct my question to the Special Minister for State. Is the minister aware that CRA has an annual exploration budget of $80 million and that it intends increasing exploration spending overseas by more than 50 per cent in an attempt to escape the effects of the government's native title legislation? To quote John Ralph, 'We are not putting our eggs in an uncertain basket'. Does the minister agree that the government's legislation will have adverse effects on the mining industry, costing jobs rural areas for Australians, including those in Aboriginal communities? Is it a fact that a huge wedge will now be driven between freehold and leasehold title?",18
42,Mr WALKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Like the Leader of the National Party, I read the papers in the morning. I did see a report, particularly in the Australian Financial Review, that quoted a few figures. Naturally, I had my officers check those figures immediately. It would appear that the figures in the Australian Financial Review were wrong and that CRA is actually reducing its exploration budget only by $8 million in the year. One would imagine that that is a pretty understandable thing. CRA, having been a very successful explorer, at the moment owns with subsidiary companies the largest alumina mine in the world and is about to substantially expand it. It has discovered what is probably the largest lead, zinc and silver deposit in the world and is about to develop that. Obviously it has been doing a lot of very successful exploration in this country. One can imagine it might not be so enthusiastic about spending a great deal more in Australia this year. These mining companies spend huge figures in exploration and $8 million, quite frankly, is peanuts. It is the sort of money· that AMIC would spend on the campaign against the Native Title Bill. It is really peanuts. So I am not surprised that there is a slight downturn in CRA's exploration budget. Mr Ralph, in his statement, said that he is concerned with the native title legislation. He said that the reason the mining companies are not spending more money in Australia and will be spending more money elsewhere is that native title holders have been given a de facto right of veto in the Native Title Bill. I would like to make the statement that we have all made a dozen times: this is not the case at all. There is no right of veto for native title owners in the bill. There is a right of negotiation, but there is no right of veto; that is perfectly clear. I do not know how many times we have to repeat that. The bill is. as clear as crystal on that issue and there is no reason that miners should be concerned at all. If we have a look at how well CRA is in doing at the moment under this government, we see in its annual report that its shares have gone up in April from $13.46 to $17.90. Under the tender, loving care of this government, CRA is on a bonanza and it should not be too concerned. In his statement in the annual report to the shareholders about the native title legislation, Mr Ralph said: We share the concern felt by the rest of the industry that unless the uncertainties raised by the High Court decision are resolved soon by complementary State and Commonwealth Government Legislation, exploration funds and investment funds will be increasingly be directed overseas. To his shareholders-the ones that count to Mr Ralph-he is saying that, unless the government bill goes through this parliament, there is going to be uncertainty and there are going to be reductions in these sorts of funds. I think we are getting a bit of a double message here. The fact of the matter is that the reduction of exploration· expenditure by these huge mining companies is a very small one. The bill is about to go through the upper House. The uncertainty will be removed and the mining industry in this country will do very well, as it already is out of this government. Tertiary Education",18
43,Mr GIBSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Is the Minister for Employment, Education and Training aware of an article in the Australian newspaper of 9 December which showed Australia with the second highest expenditure per student on tertiary education amongst OECD members? Can the minister comment on the accuracy of this report?",19
44,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, I have seen the report and it is very nattering to this country. As the honourable member for Moreton said, it claims that we have the second highest expenditure per student relative to per capita GDP in the OECD. It also pointed out that tertiary education has the highest share of total educational expenditure in the OECDsome 36 per cent compared with the OECD average of about 28 per cent. It indicates that about $10,400 is spent per student from public and private resources. That is the second highest expenditure per student in the OECD. We have a few differences with the article over its methodology and measurement, but the basic thrust of its story is correct in terms of the devotion of this government to effective expenditures in the tertiary sector. In this triennium we are spending some $14 billion. I have recently announced that by 1996 the annual expenditure will be close to $5 billion and that will include an additional 1,500 places. Between 1989 and 1998, therefore, something like 100,000 additional places will have been created in the higher education sector by this government - over that There are now some 580,000 people studying in our higher education institutions out of a population of 17.6 million people, giving a total ratio of population of about 3.3 per cent. If we compare this with the UK, where there are 728,000 people studying out of a population of about 57 million people, we find that the percentage of the population is 1.28 per cent. Because of these sorts of statistics, the Commonwealth has decided that it needs to direct a growth in education expenditure more forcefully into the vocational sector of postsecondary education and a number of measures were put in place in this budget as part of that process. One of those measures that"" was put into place to respond to these sorts of developments, mentioned by the honourable member for Moreton in his question, was a decision that we took to encourage the direction of spending to go towards school leavers. As one of the small measures we put in place to encourage that growth, we decided that people taking a second degree should pay twice the level of HECS. They do not have to pay it up front. But, over time, if they want to avail themselves of a heavily subsidised place and continue in that heavily subsidised place, they should in fact be responsible for picking up double HECS. I notice today that the opposition, which tells us that it has no trouble cutting $10 billion off outlays, has failed to jump this hurdle. As far as those opposite are concerned, they are going to oppose it in the Senate. This bunch of Don Quixote budget cutters was going to charge at a windmill with $10 billion whirring around and around. But somebody threw a pebble in front of the horse-about $4 million-and, crash, down the horse came when it was confronted with actually being obliged to do something about it. The opposition needs to understand one or two things about this proposition. First, even though we have expanded places very substantially, the substantial proportion of those places has gone to mature age students and students doing second degrees. Indeed, school leavers have missed out somewhat-inadvertently, as far as this government is concerned period of time. It is a situation that we are trying to redress. What has to be understood is that every person who does a second degree-this is a zero sum gain-does so at the expense of a student, a school leaver, who is on the margin with his or her results. And that base level has been shifting higher and higher. So the opposition has said that people who have already had one bite of the cherry should be now unfettered to have two bites of the cherry and the youngster trying to get a place can go and whistle. Apparently the opposition has also said in this regard that it discriminates against migrants. It has said that if people had degrees from overseas that were not recognised here and had not been paid for by the Australian taxpayer they would be in a situation where they would be paying double HECS unfairly. That is nonsense. If people have unrecognised degrees from overseas they are not charged double HECS. We can set their minds at rest completely as far as that is concerned. That was one piece of nonsense in .the press release of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. The other point is that if it happens to be a professional qualification which is being sought-such as a nursing qualification, a diploma of education, moving on to a doctors degree-they also get it at single HECS. This is a minor saving; a first step at preserving and advancing the equity in the system. The opposition will have to go down the road chopping absolute scads if it is going to be able to achieve anything like the sorts of expenditure cuts-$lO billion off outlays-it has been talking about. But those opposite have not been able to come up to the mark. The final point I make is in terms of the numbers of people that have commented about our tertiary system and the praise that has been given us by the OECD in that regard. How nice it is to be lectured on questions of equity by people who have not repudiated their Fightback policies on education and intend to charge not double HECS but up-front fees for every single student who enters tertiary education, irrespective of his her capacity to pay.",19

Postal workers are delaying movement of mail to and from Parliament House.

I ask: will you take that additional communication into account as this has changed the character and nature of the ban?

55,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The need to reject the imposition of a jobs levy because it will destroy, not create, jobs. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",22
56,Mr DOWNER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"If ever there was an issue that was bitterly dividing the cabinet and the parliamentary Labor Party, it is the issue of the jobs levy. For example, on the one hand, we have the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) who, above all, is arguing for the imposition of this tax increase on Australians. He is supported by a whole range of caucus members who this morning during doorstops as they walked into the House expressed their enthusiasm for the jobs levy. On the other hand, we have the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) trying to kill off the jobs levy by leaking material from the Treasury to. selected newspapers today and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) not quite wishing at this stage to declare his hand, in a way that shows lack of leadership. The fact is that the issue of the jobs levy is one that really strikes at the heart of the problem of this government, which is that the Keating government wears high unemployment as a badge of shame. The Keating government has put a million people in this country out of work and is now desperately casting around for little more than excuses for what it has done to Australians. Here we have a situation where, since its foundation in the 1890s, the Labor Party has pretended-this is one of the great confections of history-to be a political party with compassion and concern. But when the Labor Party is in power the reality is that it is a party which cannot handle money, cannot. be trusted with the taxpayers' cheque book and, in the end, puts people out of work. Federally, this present government has put a million people out of work and-if honourable members can remember them any more-state Labor governments around Australia compounded the problems. There we have the reality of Labor, which is such a far cry from its rhetoric. Today the Prime Minister and the Treasurer talked about the cyclical upturn in the economy. Of course there is a cyclical upturn in the economy. All economies go· through cycles. That has always been the case and always will be. The test is not whether Australia goes through a cyclical upturn or notof course it will-but whether, as a result of that, there will be a substantial reduction in unemployment in this country to levels which are regarded as acceptable. Despite the claims about the creation of jobs that we heard today from the Treasurer, the fact is that not enough jobs will be created to significantly reduce the rate of i.memployment in Australia. There are two reasons why that is the case. First of all, there is inevitably a natural growth in the labour market in this country. I do not· need to say much more about that it is perfectly obvious. Secondly, the participation rate in the labour market has declined quite significantly since it reached its peak in July 1990. Now the participation rate is starting to climb back up again. If we had the participation rate in our labour market today that we had in July 1990, there would be 125,000 more people out of work. today. than, the unemployment statistics show. Mr Beale-By·choice.",22
57,Mr DOWNER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"As the honourable member for Bruce interjects, by choice. Of course, this is the government's ch oice""':'"" not the people's choice. The simp1efactis that 125,000 more people today would b-out of work-or an un.emplciyment rate of 12 1h per cent-if we had the peak participat'ion rate of Juiy 1990. If .we took the averag- of the 1990-91 financial year, 70,000 more people would be out of work, which is an 11.9 per cent unemployment rate. What does this tell us? This tells us that an enormous number of Australians simply gave away the task of looking for work. Some of those people, on hearing statements like those we have heard from the Treasurer in the last few days, are coming back into the work force, but the economy is not growing sufficiently quickly to absorb the extra burden of unemployment. Despite the boasts we are. getting, the fact is that for the next two years of this government's life unemployment will remain a very substantial social problem and will be a significant political problem as, well for the government. The government conc.edes effectively that it does not know what to do about it, and it has condemned itself with its own words. Last week, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training said to an ACOSS conference: When all the factors associated with the economic cycle are stripped awayat least he is honest about that; we are not talking about some miracle or magic; we are talking about this cycle of the economyone factor stands out beyond all others-the level of long-tetril unemployed.' If we look at the data, we can see how the underlying rate of unemployment in this country, taking the cyclical factors away, has grown substantially over the last 10 years, and the rate of long-term unemployment has simply climbed with it. We now have a government in power that has put a million people out of work, but, as the Secretary to the Treasury has pointed out, it has done so by . its own choice. This government has chosen to put those people out of work and, as the Secretary to the Treasury makes clear, it has chosen to keep those people out of work. That says something for the depth of compassion t\lat there is in the Labor Party, when it pursues policies that deliberately keep people out of work. Now the government is sitting down saying, 'This is a political problem for us. We had better find a solution'. Like - omething out of a novel by Franz Kafka or George Orwell, the government has decided that the answer is to set up committees. First of all we, had a caucus committee. It made a series of fairly vacuous recommendations, and they have been taken to a task force-another committee. Tomorrow this task force will produce its report on what to do about unemployment. It is not as though this is a new government. It is not as though it has just come to power arid has been presented with the problem of unemployment in the way that the Victorian and ,South Australian governments have been. It. is . not as though it is in that situation. It has been in power for 103/4 years. After ove- 10 years, the Labor Party has decided to set up a committee to examine whether it is possible to reduce unemployment That is really quite an extraordinary dereliction of duty. . The only solution that will come out of this report-weali'eady know this-is for the government to spend taxpayers' money on public sector job creation programs. As the Reserve Bahk paper that we circulated enthusiastically yesterday said, these job creation programs amount to'ways of seeking to live with· or disguise the problem of unemployment. That is exactly what the government is , trying to do. TQmQrrQw the green paper will CQme Qut and it will have sQmething which is described as a jQb cQmpact. One Qf the recQmmendatiQns in the green paper will be to. spend $2 billiQn Qf taxpayers' mQney Qn jQbs which will last fQr a mere six mQnths. At the end Qf six mQnths, that will be it; the unemplQyed will be back Qn the dQle. So. an amQunt Qf $2 billiQn will be spent effectively as cQmpensatiQn fQr PQlicy failure. The task force's green paper will cQncede that unemplQyment under the present gQvernment's PQlicies will, at the very best, nQt fall belQw seven per cent by the year 2000. The questiQn that is left begging is: if $2 billiQn is gQing to. be spent Qn what is called a jQb cQmpact, where is the mQney gQing to. CQme from? FQr the gQvernment to. tum around nQW and say that it shQuld be spending mQre mQney Qn labQur market programs is a· quite extraQrdinary thing because in the budget the gQvernment proPQsed to. cut labQur market program spending in the next financial year by 31 per cent. So. at Qne stage when the budget was being drafted the gQvernment was nQt quite so. keen Qn labQur market programs, but suddenly it decided, using the green paper as a way Qf getting the debate up, that it needed to. spend a further $2 billiQn Qn labQur market prQgrams. The Qnly way the gQvernment can finance these labQur market programs is by either reduCing spending in Qther areas Qr increasing taxatiQn. There is Qne Qther QptiQn: the gQVernment can abandQn its deficit reductiQn strategy, but the cQnsequence Qf that WQuld be a blQw-Qut in interest rates. Presumably, the gQvernment dQes nQt want to. do. that. It WQuld be a tragedy fQr the cQuntry if the gQvernment went Qn yet anQther Qf its periQdic and massive spending sprees. .If the gQvernment is gQing to. deficit reductiQn strategy fQr the time beingin the end, I suspect it will nQt-it will have to. CQme up with a way Qf raising $2 billiQn. SQme people might say, 'YQU can raise that mQney by cutting spending', but that is nQt the view Qf the Prime Minister. On 18 August, the Prime Minister said that anybQdy who. proPQsed cuts in gQvernment Qutlays was 'either an extremist Qr a fQQI'. Is everybQdy in the gQvernment, including the Prime Minister, an extremist Qr a fQQI?",23

The government is not going to go for a jobs levy per se; it is going to find surrepti·tious, backdoor ways of increasing the burden of taxation on Australians. The government can rest assured that we will be picking out those ways and telling Australians over and again that these are further examples of the government's breach of confidence and. i-s betrayal of the Australian electorate. And this is from a government that was elected on a no-tax-hike promise which it has abandoned straight away. Not only will the government's tax-andspend formula not work to reduce unemployment, but it is also an abrogation of its responsibility to pursue the right policies to achieve that. We need substantial economic growth to reduce unemployment. We need to find ways of encouraging investment by reducing the tax burden on businesses, and that includes the administrative burden on businesses. Finally, the one thing the Labor Party will never do is improve the flexibility of the labour market. Despite the rhetoric that the government has adopted about labour market deregulation, all its Industrial Relations Bill does is entrench the privileges of union bosses. There is not a business person in Australia who thinks the government's legislation will create jobs through flexibility in labour market. There is not a serious economist in this country, from the Secretary to the Treasury to the Governor of the Reserve Bank on downwards, who does not think the answer to the unemployment problem is, above all, greater flexibility in the labour market. The government will not do it because it wants to stick with its union mates. (Time expired)",24
63,Mr JOHNS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"How wrong the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) is and how ingenuine he is on the issue of unemployment. The fact is that the opposition never has been, and never will be, interested in the unemployed. Its single, enduring solution to unemployment has been to cut the wages of those who are employed. Consistently over the last 10 or 15 years, opposition members have said to Australian workers that the only solution to all of the nation's problems is to cut wages and cut them severely. The opposition has said that it will pay the youth $3 an hour to work in menial jobs. That is how those opposite would keep them in employment. Opposition members will cut every form of decent payMr Downer- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. It is the custom of this House for matters of public importance to be responded to by ministers. I think it is entirely inappropriate but significant that the government runs way from the debate.",25
64,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Mr Jenkins)Order! There is no point of order. The honourable member will resumehis seat.,25
65,Mr JOHNS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I think it is more the little regard we hold for the honolJrable member, so he would do well not to raise that matter. The fact is that the opposition has had one response year in year out to unemployment. The awful thing about this debate is that the honourable member raised the matter so ingenuinely. He has no particular interest in the matter and has made a political response to it. We all agree that long-term unemployment is a very difficult matter indeed to deal with. However, those opposite have chosen not to produce solutions or ideas but rather make political speeches and score points without the any genuine interest in the topic whatsoever. It seems to me that opposition members have ever had only one response-they continue to harp on it-that all problems of the labour market and unemployment' rest with the workers. . Those problems do not rest with the workers, and they have not for a very long time. It is true that during the 1980s, as is the case today, the ratio between profits and wages, for instance, was so high as to make a nonsense of the argument that wages are the most important factor in the employment of Australian workers. The fact is that wages are not the key. factor. A jobs levy is not the key factor. A jobs levy is one small part of a very large number of variables that we, as a government, have the responsibility for tackling and putting into place so that we can ensure that the long-term unemployed have the best chance possible of re-entering the work force. The honourable member for Mayo quoted the views of the Reserve Bank of Australia on public sector job creation. He failed to tell us that the Reserve Bank made quite clear that the government has a role in spending taxpayers' dollars to keep the unemployed job-ready. We have done that in the last several years. The proper role of the public sector of Australia in spending taxpayers' dollars is to ensure that any Australian who has been unemployed for a significant period should not fall out of the work force forever but should be re-employed and given an opportunity to participate in the jobs now being created by the private sector. I remind the honourable member for Mayo that those jobs were previously stimulated by the public sector through our One Nation statement. Other than the opposition's obsession with wages, what are the other factors that are the true determinants of how many Australians will work in the Australian labour market henceforth? The real determinants are inflation, the ratio of profits to wages, the particithose pation rate, private sector job creation, private sector confidence, a good industrial relations climate-which we have produced-and the ratio of productivity to wages. Wage rises are not a problem provided there is the productivity to pay for those wage rises. Forgive me for going back in history, but the last time the mob opposite were in power was from 1977 to 1983. In the seven years in which the opposition had an opportunity to produce a Plore productive labour force-that is,. a labour force that would in itself produce the goods and services that create jobs-not once did it choose to raise a national productivity case in Australia. When the opposition was in government, not once did it suggest before the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission that a central part of job creation as well as wealth creation in this country should be productivity. What has been the enduring mark of the last four or five years of this government's industrial relations is 'not only the lack of strikes-in other words, a very settled level of industrial relations-but the fact that productivity should be the core of negotiations between bosses and workers on the question of wages. Wages should rise, not just in response to inflation-which is now low because of us-but in response to the level of production per worker that can be arranged in any specific workplace. We got it right. We have understood the relationship between productivity, wages and output-as members of the opposition never have· and never could. They have always pretended to have understood how real jobs are created-whatever they are. Presumably, they mean jobs in the private sector. We understand· that better· than anyone. We have reworked the entire nature of industrial relations so that productivity becomes the central heart and core of negotiations between workers and bosses, such that people do not pay themselves more than they can produce. While ever that is firmly kept up front in negotiations, wages are not an important factor in the creation of jobs or the denial of job creation, provided productivity is being rewarded. We put that all into place where opposite patently failed to do so. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) made a promise at the last election that we would not forget the unemployed. We understand that there is a very large number of unemployed Australians, people who have been unemployed for a year or more. But we did not abandon them throughout the torrent of the last election, when it would be expected of a government to put aside a million Australians and go for the votes of the other nine million or 10 million. But we did not. We always said we would return to our core principles-to ensure that all Australians have a chance at employment. Let us keep in mind the context. If the private sector is not going to produce enough jobs for Australians, should we leave that alone and do nothing else? Should we disregard the important weight of evidence which suggests that. the public sector has a role in getting people at least job ready; ready to enter the labour market? Has it a role, as it did through the One Natio- - tatement, of producing jobs utitil such time as the private sector can produce .sufficie-t jobs?] We should remember always that unemployment is not so much a question of economics as of sociology. In the 1950s, about half the people over the age of 15 or 16 chose to work in the labour market. Today, over 60 per cent of people choose to enter the labour market. That is what we call the participation rate. That rate has changed little in the last few years; it has changed massively since World War II, so massively that the Australian labour market has had to cope, no matter the flavour of the government, with so many more. people who wish to be part of paid employment. I predict that the green paper tomorrow spend quite a bit of time debating the particiworkers, pation rate. We will not be saying that people ought not have the right to participate and we would not suggest that people withdraw from the labour market. But we might suggest there are other roles people can play better than that of being on the dole. It is correct to say that at the moment the choice is too brutal; those in employment and those out of employment. There is probably a role for those who are young, under 19 or 20, to continue in education. We have done well in that area in the last 10 years. It is probably true to say that those who wish to retire-perhaps at 60 in the case of men who cannot retire and get the age pension until 65, but are unable to keep a job-should do so. We announced that at the last election. If people are chronically unemployed, they can remove themselves from the labour market, but have the dignity of knowing they have income support. Let us not forget dignity in all this. Over there we have a brutal response to the difficult question of long-term unemployment. We would prefer a dignified response; that is, if there are decent roles the people who are now attempting to participate or are participating in the labour market could otherwise play, then let them play those roles and let assist them-young ones in education and older ones in withdrawing from the labour market. Let us consider this proposition. We know that many couples who are bringing up very young children at the moment would prefer not to be in the labour market. Both parents have said that they are forced to work because they need to, for whatever reason-to pay off a mortgage, a car or to bring up children, and so on. There is an expressed need on behalf of a very large number of parents looking after young children which suggests that they would like to withdraw from the labour force; that is, there would be a lower participation rate. Could they have some other form of support? I suggest that these are the sorts of decent, intelligent ideas that will be produced tomorrow in the green paper-ideas that .do not will confront nor are an affront to Australian nor to the unemployed, but rather are a significant recognition that in every sophisticated economy in this world not enough jobs are produced for the people who want them. We produce enough wealth; we do not produce enough jobs. So the obsession with wages as the one response to producing enough jobs is patently inadequate. Those opposite are inadequate in such a difficult debate. We have already proved that there are far more powerful determinants on the number of people who will work, so why get obsessed with the question of wages? It is wrong that they should do so. It is appalling that, after 11 years in opposition, they still have only a single response. Perhaps we should give them another 11 years to toss it over amongst themselves. I do not mind; they can have as long as they want because on this side of the House we will continue to create ideas that we think will marry the interests of the unemployed and the employed so that they will not compete with each other, cut each other down or be jealous of what each other has or has not got in this society. Rather, our idea is to create a sufficient bond between the two so that both groups can see a way out of this, so that those us who are employed receive decent wages, the long-term benefits that come after accruing superannuation, the training that comes with the imposition of a job training levy and the care that comes with insurance and work cover should they become ill at work, fall over or cause damage to themselves. We cannot just rule out those sorts of things. Superannuation, training and care for those who are sick cannot be ruled out and somehow be deducted from the· wages of workers. Those are the decent things for which we have always fought. It is not good enough to wish them away and it is not good enough to suggest that 'if only we did not have to pay workers we would be able to employ lots of them. We may as well wish away the entire labour market, we. may as well wish away the living standards of all employed Au-tralians and we may as well wish we were not in the parliament at all. The fact is that we have worked hard to determine the level of living standards of Australians, which is higher than most of our competitors. We also have a more expensive welfare state than most of our competitors, but that is the real world. We will deal with the real world. Tomorrow we will see a more than decent response on behalf of the Commonwealth Labor government to the question of the long-term unemployed. It is a response that will bring with us all of those who ate employed. We will also ask the employed to think about the plight of the unemployed and to ensure that together we continue along this path of decent, equitable responses. I thank the opposition for nothing-for a nil contribution and for reconfirming the result l3 March: the Australian people do not want the opposition to govern on their behalf, whether employed or unemployed.

66,Mr COBB,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The coalition is disappointed that the Minister Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) has squibbed on this most important debate. However, the coalition is even more surprised that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Johns) has been put up in his place because only a week ago, on 7 December, he was reported in the newspapers as saying that a jobs levy would create resentwasteful ment of the unemployed. In arguing against a jobs levy he said, - A tax is a tax, no matter whether you call it a levy or a surcharge'. The parliamentary secretary said in his contribution to this debate that, under coalition government, real wages went down, thereby implying that real wages went up during the Australian Labor Party's 10 years in government. I remind him that, taking a baseline of 1984-85, the average wage in constant dollars was then $499.30. On the latest figures available for 1992-93, the average wage is $471.40-a decrease in average weekly earnings in real terms of 5.6 per cent. Such an illogical, inconsistent argument is epitomised in many ways. Only a couple of months ago we were told that tax cuts would help revive the economy, provide more spending power, stimulate things and lead to more jobs. Today we are told that tax increases will lead to more jobs. This jobs levy idea is the whacko suggestion of the month with all the hallmarks of a typical ALP approach. Typically, the ALP creates a problem through mismanagement, belatedly recognises the problem, expresses concern and tries to fix it with a bandaid approach that only entrenches and exacerbates the problem. We have seen that happen right across Australia: in Western Australia, Victoria, Tasmania, New South Wales-where the ALP was thrown out in 1988-the Northern Territory, and, aS,we saw last Saturday, South Australia. We will see it again, federally, at the next election. I was absolutely amazed to hear the emof ployment minister support this levy. I would expect the tomato left over there to support it but I was amazed that someone of the minister's stature would support it. I am also amazed that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is even considering this levy, as is half the for caucus. Of course, the trade unions are also on side for this off-the-planet idea. The number one problem in this country today is the one million people unemployed. It has taken this government 10 years to recognise that and 10 years to - suddenly' realise that it has to do something about it. So what does the government do? It does not cut expenditure and reform the society in which we live. For heaven's sake, all the government can come up with is putting on a new tax. The government knows that a new tax will not go down too well so it has to cloud and camouflage the issue by calling it a jobs levy. The government has to provide some sort of rationale for it by saying that it will create jobs. The government has to complicate it a bit by putting it on a sliding scale. But it is absolute nonsense to link taxing jobs with creating jobs. If the government wants to create jobs by using government money it would be more logical to take it out of general revenue or to tax breakfast cereal. If the government said, 'We will tax breakfast cereal and use the money we raise to create jobs', it would be laughed off the treasury bench. However, there is no more logic in taxing jobs than there is in taxing breakfast cereal. The government will end up destroying more jobs than it creates. It is about time the government realised why that is so. At best, a jobs levy will only shuffle the unemployment queues, firstly because of the substitution effect-something the government has not even thought about-whereby the comparative advantage between companies that employ labour is altered. Secondly, there is the displacement effect, whereby the composition of the unemployed is merely rearranged-that is, employers will target subsidised labour groups for recruitment in preference to others. Judith .Sloan of Flinders University has said that, because of those two effects, for. every 100 wage subsidy placements there will be only 20 jobs net created. Even the Department of Finance came out and said that for every 100 jobs that are created for the long-term unemployed, we will end up with only 15 per cent net. I remind honourable members that we have nearly half a million long-term unemployed people in Australia today. If we cast our minds back 20 years and asked how many long-term unemployed people there were then, we would be amazed at the answer. The parliamentary secretaries at the table could not tell us, but the answer is 1,500. Other detrimental effects will lower that net figure even more. The government totally overlooks the fact that if the levy is put on low income earners who tend to spend all their money, there will be less spending in the community and less demand for goodswhich is genuine demand-which will lead to fewer jobs. Even If the government puts the levy at a higher level on high income earners, an it means they will spend less, invest less and save less. Therefore, there will be less spending and less investment, and the net effect will be fewer jobs. But the biggest impact - I' think this is the greatest tragedy of all-will be on small business. Today small business already provides something like six out of every 10 jobs in the economy. Very small business-those businesses which employ fewer than 20 people-provides 40 per cent of the work force. Many of these are unincorporated. While businesses employing more than 100 people have shed in excess of 20 per cent of their labour over the last couple of years and those employing between 20 and 100 people have shed in excess of 10 per cent of their labour over the last 10 years, those businesses that employ 40 per cent of the work forcethose that employ fewer than 20people--:-are actually putting on labour. They will be hit hardest by this tax because it will up their tax burden by about 121/2 per. cent on my calculations. So a jobs levy will specifically hurt the area that is going to be in the best position to increase the number of jobs. The government should take note of that. Apart from what I have mentioned, there are other detrimental effects as well. There will be administration costs associated with this levy, there will be spending of the levy in non-productive areas, it will be used to prop up declining industries and things such as that, and it will scare away foreign investment. The Prime Minister has admitted that. So it is no surprise that the economic analysts in this. country have cQme to the conclusion that there is every reason to believe the net effect on employment of levy-type funding schemes is negative. We have only to look at what the Labor Party has been doing over the last couple of years with labour market programs. In the period between 1991-92 and 1993-94 it has doubled spending in this area. We now spend $1,320 million on these programs, hiding away half a million. unemployed. The real unemployment figure should probably be up around 16 or 17 per cent. There has been no improvement whatsoever in the unemployment level over that period of time, despite , the doubling of spending; it has remained static. The last thing we want is ,extra money being spent in this area because of such considerations as declining marginal benefits. But, again, the Labor Party would not understand that. We need to recognise the real causes of unemployment-which is something the Labor Party never does. At the end of the day, jobs essentially depend on labour unit costs. New Zealand has recognised that. Its on-costs on things such as payroll tax, training levies, superannuation levies, excess penalty rates, holiday leave loadings and those types of things, are only a third to a half in many industries compared with the levels in Australia. That is why the New Zealand economy is starting to skip ahead as ours is stagnating and falling behind. On top of that, we need increased labour market flexibility. We do not need such things as the Industrial Relations Reform Bill of the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton). We also need economic growth. Having more public sector job creation schemes is a very expensive way of assisting the long-term unemployed. The jobs levy is nothing more than another tax. It just reshuffles the unemployment queues and it puts business investment priorities into less efficient areas. The perpetrators of this idea should be condemned and the concept should be abandoned.",28
67,Mr SNOWDON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Northern TerritoryParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training) (3.35 p.m.)-That was a mournful contribution from both the shadow Treasurer and honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), and the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb). It is absolute testimony to the void of policy motives or any understanding of labour market 'issues that exist within opposition ranks. The opposition has demonstrated yet again its incapacity to deal with the reality of the labour market. Not only that, as soothsayers, those two honourable members are telling us what will appear in the green paper tomorrow. I do not know what will be in the green paper tomorrow.",30
68,Mr COBB,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I never told them.,30
69,Mr SNOWDON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"If the honourable member for Parkes does not know what is iil the green paper tomorrow, why is he putting up this furphy? What is the point of today's debate? For some reason out in the ether a proposition is legitimately put that there may be a jobs levy. The government has not adopted it. It is not a government position. The green paper may raise it as an issue and may even comment upon it. But for some reason the honourable member for Mayo has chosen to have an MPI today on a jobs levy. What a waste of time! He is completely disingenuous when it comes to contributions about the labour market, showing as I said previously an incapacity to understand the issues which are crucial to it. Honourable members have only to look at the contributions which have already been made today or, indeed, at the media release put out by the shadow Treasurer where he talks about the job levy. He says: The jobs levy would n-t create one real job. One could debate that, and I am sure that will be debated at some time down the track by those people who might propose such a thing. The shadow Treasurer also says: The only constructive way to get the long-term unemployed back into the work force is to improve Australia's economic performance and an increase in tax is not a way to speed l!P economic growth. It is absolutely true that economic growth is crucial. We all agree with that. That does not seem to. be a point of contention. But, in terms of the. labour market, to say that economic growth is the only issue is missing the point entirely. The honourable member for Parkes showed his ignorance when he disparagingly commented on the government's expenditure on labour market programs. As for the shadow Treasurer, I have never given him any great creqibility. He has proved yet again that he is not worth a bumper. There is no doubt that economic performance is at least, in part, important in terms of the labour market, but it is also important to look at the capacity of those people in the labour market to see whether they have the skills required in that market. That is exactly what the Australian government's labour market programs address-issues not understood by the opposition; issues which clearly show it does not comprehend. The coalition, whilst disparaging the government's performarice in the labour market area, has not in today's debate nor in any previous debate on this subject told us what its policies are. We know what the coalition's policies are, because it has made them clear. Apart from the GST, it is sticking to Fightback-thank you very much! What does Fightback do for employment? The opposition would firstly increase the company tax rate to 42 per cent compared to the government's decision to reduce it to 33 per cent. That is a positive for employment? Imagine what a nine per centincrease in company tax would do to the incentives for businesses to employ more people. The shadow Treasurer· was asked by Brian Toohey on the Meet the Press program: Will you put company taxes up to 42% which is what you promised? The shadow Treasurer replied: As far as company tax is concerned ... we'll have a look at what can be done. There will be no cuts to other business taxes to compensate for this increase. In reply to another question from Mr Toohey .relating to the dumping of the GST, the shadow Treasurer said: We obviously, as you imply in your question, don't have the financial resources left to abolish sales tax, payroll tax and fuel excise. On 15 November in the Age in an article by David MCKenzie, the shadow Treasurer said: We just cannot afford to abolish those taxeS without replacing them with some other form of tax. On the question of labour market programs, the article said: . But he ruled out extra spending on programs to help the long-term unemployed, saying they had been tried around the world on many occasions, and. did not create sustainable jobs. What would he know? Hehas not got a clue. Look at what Fightback proposed in the area of job creation and labour market programs. It would have cut labour market programs by-listen to this-$435 million. That is roughly a third of this year's expenditure by the Commonwealth government. Taking into account the increase in this year's budget of $120 million over last year's expenditure, those opposite would have had to cut something in the vicinity of $575 million from labour market programs just to meet the target they set out in Fightback. Significantly, Fightback would also have abolished the new enterprise incentive scheme, NElS; phased out skillshare; and dismembered the Commonwealth Employment Service. That is the opposition's contribution to the issue of labour markets. Those opposite have shown that they do not understand the issues involved in labour market reform and they do not understand the necessity of having appropriate and coherent labour market policies and programs which provide people with the skills they need to compete in the labour market. This government understands the issues. As has been acknowledged by this government, it quite properly sees the question of long term unemployment as being at the core of its social and political agenda. That is something we should be proud of. In order to address it, we have set up a committee of experts who will bring down a green paper looking at the issues involved in employment options. That is a very reasoned response and a responsible attitude which will lead to public debate and eventually to a white paper. Those opposite will be invited to be involved in the debate. But today we have seen, I think, a fairly foolish attempt to pre-empt an aspect of what that debate might be-that· is, if a job levy is proposed, who will propose it and wht it might be about. Those opposite are not interested in the harder labour market issues or the need to address the concerns of the long-term unemployed. They are interested in the furphy that somehow or other they are soothsayers and can see what the green paper might bring down and what aspects of it they will or will not agree with. They will find out tomorrow what the green paper says. Those opposite should understand this: they have shown again a forlorn and silly attitude when it comes to recognising the needs of people who are unemployed. Those opposite have shown their incapacity to understand the needs of the labour market. They have shown yet again not only by their Fightback policies but also by their inability to recant them-an attitude which, by definition, says that they will be reinforced-that they will slash into the labour market programs, impacting drastically upon the way in which the long-term unemployed can compete in the labour market. I remind those opposite of some of the things that they propose to do. One of the most significant and successful of the government's labour market programs is the new enterprise incentive scheme-a very successful program. This program builds on what I thought would have been a premise of opposition ideology: it builds on small business. It is about assisting people to set up small businesses. But those opposite want to cut it down. They are proposing to abolish it. The scheme has a 72 per cent success rate. For every 100 NElS businesses operating for one year, 50 new jobs are created. That is not a bad impact; that is not a bad hit rate for a government program. Yet it is a program which those opposite would deign to cut if they were to be in government. But they will not be in government. Those opposite have demonstrated· yet again why the Australian community was dead right when in March of this year it rejected the opposition's proposals not only in terms of taxation but also in all areas of social policy. Labour market program reform, labour market programs and unemployment were crucial issues at the last election-and those opposite were rejected by the community. The other dispiriting thing about this whole exercise is not only the willingness of those opposite to not address issues of importance, such as those positive aspects of labour market reform, but also their penchant for having the most negative outlook and reinforcing the worse possible outlook for the economy and the Australian community. Instead of highlighting what we can do to beat these problems, those opposite are entrenched in the view that their only road back to government is to see this economy in chaos. This view has been reinforced by every statement from the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and by every statement from the shadow Treasurer-it was reinforced by his contribution today. The government is doing the appropriate thing in terms of labour market reform. The green paper will .be brought down tomorrow and those opposite will have their chance to comment on it then.

70,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Mr Jenkins)Order! The discussion has concluded. NA Public Works Committee Report,32
71,Mr HOLLIS,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the ninth report of .the committee for 1993 relating to RAAF Williams rationalisation project, Laverton, Victoria. Ordered that the report be printed.",32
72,Mr HOLLIS,COMMITTEES,"by leave-The report which I have tabled deals with the RAAF Williams rationalisation project, Laverton, Victoria. RAAF Williams, which comprises Point Cook and Laverton bases, is located 20 kilometres west of the Melbourne central business district and five kilometres from the township of Werribee. The Defence Force structure review rationalised the disposition and functions of all defence units and subsequently, in May 1991, the Minister for Defence, Senator Ray, announced that the airfields at Laverton and Point Cook were to be closed or sold. Following the minister's announcement a consultative committee under the chairmanship of the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) examined the implications of the possible base closures and the impact this would have on local communities. This proposal consists of three major items, minor adjusting works and engineering services. The major items are refurbishment of the school of radio building at Laverton to accommodate RAAF Headquarters Logistics Command, which will vacate rented premises in the Melbourne CBD; refurbishment of existing facilities at Laverton to house all elements of the RAAF publications unit; and construction of purpose-built facilities RAAF Institute of Aviation Medicine which will be relocated from Point Cook base to RAAF base Edinburgh in South Australia. At the public hearing the committee was advised of the savings in rental which will result by relocating Headquarters Logistics Command from premises presently occupied in the Melbourne central business district to RAAF base Laverton. The Institute of Aviation Medicine will be collocated with the Aircraft Research and Development Unit which is currently located at Edinburgh. One of the functions of the Institute of Aviation Medicine is refresher training for current aircrew, and service transport will make Edinburgh easily accessible. While recognising the historical significance of Point Cook. and supporting the proposal, the committee does not see the logic of maintaining the two operational bases at Laverton and Point Cook. Apart from the RAAF museum, the committee does not see the necessity for maintaining other units, such as Headquarters Training Command and the RAAF college at Point Cook. Should the National Air and Space Museum be, established at Point Cook, then the committee believes the RAAF museum should be incorporated into it. The committee recommends that no further capital works be commenced at RAAF Point Cook and that units located at Point Cook, with the exception of the RAAF museum, be located elsewhere. The committee also recommends that the Department of Defence keep it advised of the results of the ground decontamination surveys of RAAF Williams and of possible costs of decontaminating both.RAAF Laverton and RAAFPoint Cook. The estimated cost of the RAAF Williams rationalisation project is $19.8 million at August 1993 prices. The committee commends the report to the House.",32

84,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"For future reference, I think we need to have that clarified. In any case, leave is granted for the honourable member for Lalor to make a short statement on this matter.",33
85,Mr BARRY JONES,COMMITTEES,"Being the member for Lalor, which includes the RAAF Williams base at Laverton and Point Cook, lam deeply interested in the report from the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Public Works on the RAAF Williams rationalisation project at Laverton. I look forward to reading the full text of the. report. I chaired a consultative committee, appointic ed by the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray), which looked at the future use of defence property at RAAF Williams, and which reported to the minister in September 1992. That report was accepted in principle. I would say that the report of the parliamentary committee and the report of the consultative committee are convergent rather' than identical. While I agree with. the broad thrust of the former, it concerns me that its future implicataking tions for the Laverton and Point Cook landjng strips are still uncertain. For example, it may be that some time in the mid-1990s a decision will be made about the relocation of the Essendon airport. The likely future level of aviation demand in the Port Phillip region suggests that there should be an opportunity for the. commercial use not only of Avalon, which is outside the RAAF Williams area and closer to Geelong, but also Point Cook and/or Laverton. Because there are heritage implications associated with Point Cook-which dates from 1919, making it the oldest airstrip in continuous use in the world-:-because this is the area where the RAAF was initiated, it would be very regrettable if aviation activity were to cease altogether down at Point Cook. I note the recommendation from the committee that, should the National Air and Space Museum of Australia, NASMA, be established at Point Cook-which is the current feeling of the Victorian government, .and of· the surviving members of the committee-the RAAF museum should be integrated with it. I advise. the House that there is already a proposition for joint facilities. While there may not be a formal merging .of the RAAF museum and NASMA in a technical sense, they will certainly be operating together. Sooner or later the future of aviation in the western Port Phillip region will require some very serious decisions-decisions outside the range of this committee. In the meantime, as the local member, I point out that there will be quite a significant transition of personnel. Essentially, personnel who were working in the central business district will be transferred to Laverton. I am pleased to be able toreassure those members of my electorate who might be listening that the amount of economactivity in the area will undoubtedly remain. The intention is that the total number of defence staff in and around the RAAF Williams area will be slightly increased by the end of this century, although the nature of their activity-not involving things that go bang or that take off, like the economy-will be essentially terrestrial. I am grateful for the interest taken by the Standing Committee on Public Works and I look forward to the activity that the committee has recommended place quite speedily within the boundary of the Lalor electorate. NEW BUSINESS AFTER 11 P.M. NA Mr BEAZLEY' (Swan-Leader of the House) (3.55 p.m.)-I move: That standing order 48A (adjournment of House) and, standing order 103 (11 0' clock rule) be. suspended for the remainder of the sittings this week. It is hot my intention that the House sit late every night. Indeed, although we would sit until about midnight tonight, it would be wise for us to rise at 8.00 p.m. tomorrow. Certainly I do not intend that we proceed past that point. On Thursday we would sit through until midnight again, while sitting times on Friday, and perhaps on the weekend, are in the lap of the gods-or perhaps the Senate. ' Mr JlOWARD (Bennelong-Manager of Opposition Business) (3.56 p.m.)-In order not to delay the Housej the opposition will be voting against this measure but it will not divide the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA Suspension of Standing and Sessional",34
86,Mr BEAZLEY,URGENT LEGISLATION,"i move: That, in relation to the proceedings on the following Bills, so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the House making one declaration of urgency and moving one motion for the allotment of time in respect of all the Bills: National Health Amendment Bill (No.2) 1993; Industrial Relati.ons and other Legislation Amendment Bill 1993; Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill (No.3) 1993; Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill 1993; Australian Broadcasting Corporation Amendment Bill 1993; Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill 1993; Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) 1993; Arts, Environment and Territories Legislation Amendment Bill 1993; Bounty (Ships) Amendment Bill 1993; Customs Legislation Amendment Bill 1993; Road Transport Reform (Vehicles and Traffic) Bill 1993; Occupational Health and Safety (Maritime Industry) Bill 1993; Occupational Health and Safety (Maritime Industry) Consequential Amendments Bill 1993; Health and Community Services Legislation Amendment Bill 1993; Migration Amendment (""Points"" System) Bill 1993; and Protection of the Sea (Shipping Levy) Amendment Bill 1993. This motion is intended to clean up the remainder of the business before the House this year, with the exception of the bills to.be introduced during the course of this week. Those bills will provide for substantial debate when the. House comes back on 1 February. A request has been made of both managers of government business and they have given undertakings to their opposition counterparts that a certain amount of business will be available to the Senate at the start of next year. As we will be going into a three-session pattern of sittings next year, there will be a requirement for us to provide the House and Orders the Senate with a good block of legislation for consideration when the first session starts. That will be provided for the House by the bills to be introduced during the course of this week. It will be provided for the Senate through this measure .. There is a possibility that we will sit on Friday, and even later. Apart from debate on matters returned from the Senate, it would not be our intention to debate fresh legislation at that time. It will provide us with an opportunity to discuss the report of the Blewett committee more fully. In addition to ministerial statements I,lnd valedictories, it would be our intention to discuss such things on Friday rather than legislation. As I said, apart from any matters coming back from the Senate, the legislation that we wish discussed during the course of this year will be completed by adherence to the program circulated to honourable members. .",35
87,Mr HOWARD,URGENT LEGISLATION,"The opposition will oppose this guillotine. We do so as a measure of our continued unhappiness with the way in which the government has conducted the affairs of the parliament this year.. I again draw the attention of the House to the fact. that the current Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) has become an almost compulsive guillotiner. I have in front of me a bundle of guillotines that have been moved by him. They started in May after the election. In fact, he became only the third Leader of the House since Federation to move a guillotine in the first two weeks of a parliamentary sittiQg. I think one of his distinguished predecessors in this was, in fact, him, after the 1990 election. Dredging the memory, I think there was one other occasion stretching back to before the Great War, so it does not happen very often. Since then the Leader of the House has elevated it to an art form. We had guillotines on 10 to 13 May, 26 October, 17 November, 18 and 19 October, 28 September and 6 October. Here we are today, 14 December, having another one. It has to be said again that this makes for very unsatisfactory decision making. I take the opportunity to say that there is some improvement in the new parliamentary sitting pattern, if I may put it that way. I hav- Lavarch, M. H. long favoured the idea of having a somewhat shorter break at Christmas and a shorter break in the middle of the year. I have some reservations about the intra-daily sitting arrangements that have come out of the Blewett committee report, particularly as they relate to question time. I am glad that the Leader of the House is foreshadowing that there will be an opportunity to talk about those matters, perhaps early on Saturday morning. I seem to get the impression from what he said that it will be early on Saturday morning. I hope it is at a rather more civilised hour than then. Given the almost compulsive use of the guillotine and the other sundry abuses of the proper processes of this House and of all Westminster parliaments, the opposition cannot allow this proposal to go unrebuked. Therefore, we will not only vote against it, but we will also require a division. Question put: That the motion (Mr Beazley's) be agreed to. The House divided.

90,Mrs CROSIO,COMMITTEES,"Prospect-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services) (4.11 p.m.)-I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: relocation of the Salisbury sive Ordnance testing facilities to Port Wakefield, South Australia. The environmental test facility, ETF, is an army unit that undertakes environmental testing of equipment and explosive ordnance to ascertain.complianc- with defence specifications. The ETF is to be relocated in part from its cUl1ent location in the Salisbury DSTO complex to Poit Wakefield, north of Adelaide, to provide improved facilities for explosive ordnance testing and to eliminate danger to the civil community from testing and from the transport of stressed explosive ordnance from Salisbury to Port Wakefield for firing or destruction. The existing facilities at Salisbury are in dose proximity td the civilian population and other defence units. This restricts the size and nature of the testing programs undertaken. The explosive ordnance teSting function of the ETF will move' to recently acquired land adjacent to the existing proof and experimental establishment at Port Wakefield. This proposal will establish approximately i2 test laboratory buildings, control and administration facilities, together with four small explosive storage magazines and the necessary infrastructure dn a greenfield site at Port Wakefield. It is anticipated that construction will commence on the site in May 1994 and be completed in December 1995. The estimated outturn cost for this proposal is $8 million. I commend the motion to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative.

91,Mr WAKELIN,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"I have Reference only a few brief comments to make about the National Health Amendment Bill (No.2) 1993 because the issues it raises were pretty well' canvassed last night. The nature of the 70 per cent of scripts supplied in the last two months and the stockpiling that occurs are key points, as are the reduction of costs and the need for simplification of a relatively Explocomplex system. We need to be more aware of the preventative health measures. Of course, overprescribing is an issue that people are already becoming familiar with. In his second reading speech, the Minister for He,alth (Senator Richardson) said that escalating costs were what particularly concerned him. Also of concern is,the ma-ter of brand premium-that is, not allowing our pharmacists to give the .lowest priced medication. In the wider context, Hhink we need to be a little more aware of the impact of medical costs generally on the community. Yesterday's Australian Financial Review summed up Senator Richardson's health changes and the proposals he will be putting to cabinet on Thursday. Even though I do not agree with the detail of all the proposed changes, the review is welcome. It is important that we become much more aware of the cost of our health care program-and, of course, pharmaceuticals come into that. For approximately 2D yeats, we have seen an assault on individuals who attempt to take some reasonable control of their health costs. We are all aware of the decline in the number of people ,subscribing to private health insurance. There was a time not that long ago when people were very aware of the ,cost of health care and of the value of taking out their own insurance. I believe that that is something that the government should focus on more. Of course, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) does not agree with me at all on that point, and that is to be regretted. As far as the pharmaceutical bill is concerned, the 'same principle applies. As a nation, we have allowed the whole question of the cost of health care to be disguised; consequently, the overall contribution by individuals has not been brought out into the real light of day. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on mqtion by Mrs Crosio) read a third time. NA NA . BILL 1993 Second Reading Debate resumed from 23 November, on motion by Mr Brereton: That th- bill be now read a second time.",38
92,Mr HOWARD,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"The Industrial Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bi111993 now before the parliament is an omnibus bill that brings together a number of changes to a number of pieces of legislation. I want to take the opportunity in the. time that I choose to make available to myself, which will be somewhat less than the normally allotted time of 30 minutes, to address a· few remarks to one of the acts which is being am-nded, the Industrial Relations Act 1988. In doing so, I am conscious of the fact that. we are on the eve of the release of a very important. green paper on unemployment. There would be common agreement across the political divide in this parliament that unemployment is the most serious personal and social problem which faces Australia. It is the social condition that inflicts the most degree of hardship, family trauma, family strain, individual pressure and ,loss of individapparently ual self""esteem on Australians and their families. All of us have an obligation to work together, to the extent that our different views on the subject permit us to do so, to try to find some solution. I agree, as I think anybody who has even the most rudimentary understanding of how the Australian economy works would agree, that there is no solution to the problem of high unemployment divorced from faster economic growth. This country has no hope of making a sizeable reduction in the level of unemployment until it achieves economic growth of four per cent or more and is able to sustain that economic growth of four per cent or more for a considerable period. In addition to there being economic weaknesses which contribute to the high level of unemployment in this country, there are also a number of major structural weaknesses and what I might call micto-economic explanations as to why this country has such high unemployment. If it were simply the case that high unemployment is a function of a recessed economy and that once the recession has ended unemployment would begin to fall, then one might expect, for example, that the rate of unemployment in the United States would still be roughly what it is in Australia. Yet, interestingly enough, the United States has a nite of unemployment of 6.4 per cent and Australia has an unemployment rate of 11.1per cent. In other words, the jobs recovery in the United States has been much more rapid than it has been in Australia. To those who say that that is completely the result of there being much lower minimum wages in theUnited8tates, let me reply in advance that that is a facile and superficial explanation of the difference. The reasons are complex. One of the reasons is that the United States has a much more flexible labour market. It has a labour market and an industrial relations system that facilitates job growth in the small busitless sector. What happens in the United States is that as the economy begins to recover, that recovery is reflected in the generation of jobs. That is nowhere near the case in Australia, although I welcome the fact that there are some signs that jobs are going to begenerated a little more quickly in Australia than was originally thought. I wholeheartedly and unreservedly welcome any signs of any improvement on the employment front in this country. We have. suffered from a rate of unemployment for too long. It is too high and has inflicted too much misery and pain on too many Australians. I want to narrow the focus of my remarks to matters relating to debate about the green paper. I want in particular to refer to a document which was released yesterday and which was prepared by the Reserve Bank of Australia. Those people following politics in Australia will know that over the past couple of years the government of this country has been very happy to quote the Reserve Bank of Australia in aid of some of its economic arguments. The Governor of the Reserve Bank has criticised the taxation policies of the opposition. He did so on a number of occasions before the last election. The Governor of the Reserve Bank and other people in the Reserve Bank have spoken approvingly of the impact of certain government policies. I am not arguing about the right or otherwise of the Governor· of the Reserve Bank to speak; I accept that he has a right as a statutory officeholder and a person charged with the management of the monetary policy of this country. He is a person who has a very good understanding of the functioning of the Australian economy and he has a total right to speak on any of these matters that he chooses to speak on. It is therefore interesting that, when the Reserve Bank of Australia produces a document about unemployment, it is very noteworthy that the government is completely silent in some of the things that the Reserve Bank has to say about unemployment-and well it may be silent. If we thumb through the document called 'Towards full employment', which is a submission by the Reserve Bank of Australia to the government's task force on unemployment, we find a number of references that bear very heavily on the policy debate about unemployment which has gone on in this country over the last couple of years. In particular, the Reserve Bank is in no doubt that the rigidity of Australia's industrial relations system is a prime cause of unemployment. It is in no doubt about it at all. The Reserve Bank stated: ... changes in industrial relations arrangements which make it more difficult for the unemployed to offer their services at a realistic wage rate The Reserve Bank goes on to endorse the Austrain proposal in the spirit and, indeed, in the substance put forward by the opposition before the last election. The opposition said that, if a person is out of work for two years and is suffering from long-term unemployment, it is not unreasonable to ask of that person that he or she be re-employed initially at lower than the award rate, rising to the award rate after that person has been back in employment for the length of time that that person was out of work. . The Reserve Bank gives endorsement to that strategy. That strategy was put forward by the opposition before the last election. It was ridiculed by the government. Government members might say in parenthesis successfully. Yes, in electoral terms they were successful. They did manage to generate fear about some of those policies. They did manage to successfully ridicule them. Whether in the proc-ss they served the interests of the long term unemployed and the interests of the Australian battlers, whom government members have always prattled on about being concerned for, is another matter. It is one of the signal features of the Australian political divide at present that the Labor Party that professes a lifelong compassion for low income earners in Australia perpetuates an industrial relations system that condemns more and more of them to the poverty of unemployment benefits. On that particular subject, the Reserve BaOk to has also had quite a bit say. It criticised the large rises in labour on-costs. It was careful not to criticise wages. I do not argue that Australian wages are high by world standards; they clearly are not. I have not argued that proposition for some years. But I do argue that many of the other rigidities-workers compensation and many of the other conditions that attach to the employment of people in this country-act as a disincentive to the employment of people. The Reserve Bank has basically said that the more minimum conditions the government imports into the industrial relations system, the harder, more expensive and more complicated it makes it for ... people to be employed. That is a fairly basic proposition. It is certainly a very basic propoattack sition for the small business sector of is. The small business sector is the hope of the side in reducing unemployment. The government will not. reduce unemployment in Australia through the BHPs and the CRAs - great companies though they may be. They are not the companies that are going to take on the large number of new employees to reduce unemployment over the next few years, unless there is a burst of employment activity on the part of the small business sector. That will not happen unless it is freed of many of the industrial relations constraints that it suffers at present. Instead of going in that direction, the government, right at the moment"" in legislation now before this parliament, is going to make it worse. It is going to make it harder and more complicated to employ people. I was very interested to hear an interview with the Secretary of the ACTU, Mr Kelty, a few days ago. I compliment the work that Mr Kelty and Mr Lindsay Fox have done in going around Australia and encouraging large companies to take on young people. I have no argument with that at all; I compliment both of them. I have spoken to both of them in the course of their travels around Australia in trying to persuade companies to take on young people. They have our total support and goodwill. Mr Kelty gave an example of visiting a hospital, I think it was, at Bairnsdale in Victoria. He made a very interesting comment that he had persuaded the hospital to knock off penalty rates and holiday loading and, as a result, it was going to employ six more people. That is what the Secretary of the ACTU said. Yet, in the election campaign, the opposition said that if the government had a more intelligent approach to penalty rates and holiday loading, it might generate a few more jobs in the service sector of the economy. Anybody who follows this knows that the service sector of the Australian economy is going to generate a lot of new jobs in the future. When we raised those matters a few months ago, it was typified as some kind of on the living standards of Australian Australworkers. It was nothing of the kind. My view about penalty rates is very simple. They ought to be a matter of negotiation. They should not be a compUlsory minimum standard. To the extent that they are, they are destroying jobs. I have Mr Kelty to support me in that proposition. If Bill Kelty can go to Bairnsdale and bargain for the creation of six jobs by getting the workers to give up their penalty rates and 'holiday loadings, why can that not happen elsewhere in Australia? Why does it need the personal fiat, warrant and approval of the Secretary of the ACTU? If it made economic sense for that hospital in Bairnsdale, does it not make economic sense for hospitals, firms and enterprises all around the country? Perhaps. the honourable member. for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) or somebody else with a background in the trade union movement who speaks-and I do not say that in any way derisively, but instructively in a debate like this"":""""'will say that it can happen only if the Secretary of the ACTU says so. That is what it all boils down to: if he 'is there and approves it, it is okay; but if he is not there and cannot give the idea a tick, it is not okay. That is not very satisfactory to many people. I return to the Reserve Bank report. On going through it, we find endorsements of the sorts of arguments that have been put forward by the coalition. For example, on page 17 of the Reserve Bank report, the following appears: As important as the cyclical conjuncture is for unemployment outcomes, changes to demand and supply in the labour market can also be driven by forces which are nqt merely cyclical in nature. These changes might be the result of shifts in the pattern of skills required resulting, for example, from innovation in production, technologies or changing consumer tastes. The responsiveness of the labour market in the face of such changes is an important factor in determining employment and unemployment patterns, and the associated scope for non-inflationary economic growth. The Reserve Bank says later, on page 18: Labour market rigidities can amplify the effect on employment and unemployment of economic disturbances. They can also impede the movement of labour between jobs, industries, occupations regions in response to changes in demand and supply condition-. It goes on to detail some important examples of where that occurs. Again and again one finds this report giving a very simple message: the more rigid, inflexible and regulated the labour market. is, the more harmful is the effect on employment. The less regulated, rigid and ossified and the more flexible the labour market is, the more likely it is to have a beneficial effect. That simple test is endorsed and ratified by the Reserve Bank. The Governor of the Reserve Bank, Bernie Fraser, is frequently quoted with approval by the government on economic matters. If we apply that test to what the government is now doing in industrial relations we find an extremely disturbing pattern. Instead of the government going with what, the Reserve Bank is putting out, the government is rowing in the opposite direction. It is making the labour market more rigid and, as a result, will condemn many thousands of Australians to longer periods of unemployment than would otherwise be the case. It is quite within the wit and capacity of this country, even under the present government, to ensure that unemployment falls at a faster rate than it will over the next couple of years. It is quite within the wit and capacity of this nation to have an industrial relations system that provides adequate protection against exploitation, guarantees people a decent minimum wage, decent provisions for holidays, long service leave, sick leave and maternity leave and, beyond that, allows people to negotiate arrangements for the intervention of unions, if that is their wish, to get outcomes that are likely to create jobs and reward productive effort in the workplace. Unfortunately, that is not the path that has been chosen by this government. The government is pretending to reform .industrial relations. The longer the debate goes on in the Senate, the more apparent it is that the bill, which passed through this place a few weeks ago, is nothing but an electoral payback to the ACTU. It certainly falls foul of the tests laid down by the Reserve Bank of Australia and or does no credit to the claim of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) immediately after the election that he was going to be a reformer of industrial relations in Australia. I have two other comments to make. One relates to some remarks made in the Senate debate concerning the industrial relations bill. It does relate to the bill now before the parliament, which deills with matters touching on industrial relations. It was suggested during that Senate debate that, in some way, the Australian Democrats had been misled about some amendments concerning preference clauses which were being proposed by the coalition. I want to. make it perfectly clear that our aim at all times was to' take out of the bill; and the principal act that it was amending, any capacity for the commission-or any other authority-to grant preference to unionists. Our view is very simple: whether someone is a unionist or non-unionist should be a matter of choice. We totally oppose victimisation of unionists and unions; and we totally oppose victimisation of non-unionists, people not desiring to join a union. We totally oppose-either in an award, act of parliament, certified agreement, enterprise flexibility agreement or any other industrial arrangement-preference being granted to a person or group of people because they belong to a union. That is a basic principle of non-discrimination. It continues to amaze me that a governmerit which daily gets out of its tree about issues of discrimination when it comes to sex, race, gender, religion or anything else, can tum' a blind eye to discrimination in the workplace. It is all right apparently to say to somebody, 'We will discriminate against you because you do not belong to a union and you vote Liberal'. But if we say, 'We will discriminate against you because you are a man or because you are a woman', that is an entirely different matter. Both are objectionable. I cannot see why the former should not be as objectionable as the latter. That is probably' a view that most Australians would agree with. It is interesting that when the amendment to give partial effect to that was before the parliament, the government voted against it. It has now succumbed to the reality in the other place. But at no stage did we represent to the Democrats anything other than that we are totally opposed to the concept of preference. Finally, to anticipate a later stage of this debate, I give notice that we will move an amendment to delete the entirety of part 7 of the bill, which deals with a number of aspects of superannuation law. If time permits, my learned colleague the shadow Attorney-General .a-d honou.rable member for Tangney (Mr Wllhams) WIll speak on the objectionable features of part 7 of the bill. An amendment in my name is being circulated to honourable members. It will be moved at the appropriate time. I thank the House. , Mr TANNER (Melbourne) (4.38 p.m.)-I WIll comment on a couple of points raised by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). I should point out to him that the town he referred to, which is in the area I come from, is generally called 'Bairnsdale' no- '-arnsdale'-although some people refer to It tn that way.",39
93,Mr HOWARD,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,I'm a'northerner.,43
94,Mr TANNER,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I probably mispronounce a few Sydney names, too.' I appreciate the honourable member's laok of stridency in his contribution, because it is ,important to acknowledge-on the employment issue and the industrial relations system-that we are living in ,a changing world where one of the key fac-ors that has been driving the change in poltcy that has occurred on both sides of this House has been the lessening in homogeneity of the production process. This has also occurred in many other countries. One of the things that has been compelling change-which people in the trade union movement have done a lot to come to terms with and work with-is the fact that we are no longer dealing with the relatively homogenous production processes that we dealt with in perhaps the 1940s and 1950s. Therefore, the large scale, comprehensive awards of the past may not be the appropriate vehicle of regulation they once were. That does not mean that we should move to the type of policy that the opposition advocates, but it does indicate that it is important to closely examine the change and the implications - f that change. It is necessary to step back a bIt from some of the self-righteousness that tends to dominate this debate-the suggesti.ons that the government is voluntarily prolo-gtng unemployment at a higher rate than It needs to or that there is some simple war th.at the government, by some magic legIslatIve approach, can get rid of unemployment through changes to the industrial relations system. Those suggestions, which have been made by members of the opposition at various times, have no real place in the debate. I appreciate the fact that the honourable member for Bennelong has stepped away from that sort of approach. As I have said before in this sort of debate, the unemployment rate in the United States is now at about 6 117 per cent. It is clearly lower than the Australian unemployment rate. Obviously there is a range of issues, as the honourable member for Bennelong conceded that complicate the picture, that make a direct comparison between the two a little more complex than perhaps one would like to think. We have to take cognisance of the fact' that people in the United States employed in certain industries which are exempt from the very low minimum wage of just under $5 an hour-people such as waiters and waitresses-are quite legally on' rates below $3 an hour. We also have to take cognisance of the circumstances related to the employment situation in the United States. But we need not stop the analogy there. In addressing these issues, it is false to simply look at one country. The United Kingdomprobably as similar to Australia as is the United States; maybe more so-has a deregulated labour market and a persistently high u.ne-ployment ra.t-. Its .-osition is very SImIlar to Austraha s posItion. It is fair to conclude that the argument that there is some sort of magic connection between the industrial relations system and the level of unemployment in a country such as ours does not hold much substance. Obviously the connection between the two is a great deal more complex than we are led to believe. Before going to the substance of my comments today, I refer to a couple of other points made by the honourable member for Bennelong. I do not agree with him absolutely, but I think it is clear, as the caucus ployment task force report indicated, that the issue of on-costs needs to be addressed, particularly with respect to occupational superannuation and workers compensation levies. My personal view on that problem-it is not necessarily a view that is shared across the government benches or, indeed, in the trade union movement-is that we are now paying im extremely high price in this country for employment as a result of the Liberal opposition in the 1970s blocking the Whitlam government's national compensation and national superannuation schemes. I personally would support any moves that could be made towards those types of structures. I believe the future we will start to move, possibly even pursued with the support of the conservative side of politics, towards those sorts structures. We now have widespread occupational superannuation. It is being accepted by the bulk of the community. The honourable member for Bennelong raised the issue of penalty rates and negotiability. Through the mechanism of enterprise bargaining, negotiations are occurring every day at the workplace level on changes to penalty rate structures. It is now commonplace for these sorts of things to be tackledwithout the intervention of the Secretary of the ACTU. It is not something unusual, strange or peculiar; it is happening as part the normal industrial relations process. As I have indicated before, the changes in the processes of production that have occurred, the massively increased diversity that now is the norm in our workplaces, are reasonable-provided we have some basic minimum standards and safeguards and protections that prevent exploitation to the greatest extent possible. No system will prevent all exploitation but, provided the bulk of potential exploitation is prevented, those changes are perfectly reasonable. We should not forget some of the other connotations involved in this issue. For example, penalty rates used to act as a disincentive to a company having a worker work overtime instead of employing additional workers. This is an area that the trade union em- movement traditionally has had as a major goal-in fact, the limitation of overtim- is written in the object clauses of many union rules. One of the reasons penalty rates for overtime should be supported is as a device to act as a disincentive to employers to get their workers to work 50 and 60 hours a week-because some will be prepared to do that-and therefore not put on extra employees. The problem is that the effective disincentive factor of penalty rates with respect to overtime has been eroded over time by the increasing imposts that have been placed on wages and salaries through things such as workers compensation levies and occupational in superannuation through the award system. So I would not suggest it is necessarily a great thing to have.a uniform hourly rate applying of across whatever number of hours. In effect, that will act as an incentive to an employer to employ a person for a longer period of time, for more hours,and not consider the option of putting on another person. We are dealing with a complex picture. We are dealing with things that are all interrelated. Often some of these things will have consequences which we would not necessarily automatically expect. I tum now to the jobs levy, to which the honourable member for Bennelong referred in his speech. Essentially, !""Support the notiOn of a jobs levy, but I do not give ariy blanket of support to the idea. We have to· examine various tax options and consider an approach that will be credible. .",43

96,Mr TANNER,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Time will tell. The honourable member's information may be better than mine, I do not know. The basic problem is structural. I think it is now clearly recognised-not by everybody but I think by many vast people-that growth by itself will not be enough. It has been estimated by people such as Professor Gregory that we will need growth of roughly six per cent per annum between now and the year 2000 in order to effectively eradicate the unemployment problem. We now have a fairly wide recognition of the phenomenon of jobless growth, which is a phenomenon affecting not only Australia but the bulk of the OECD. A change in production processes-related to the types of skills that are in demand, the work that is being performed by people and what is needed in the economy-is sweeping the Westernised countries. It is connected to changing technology, changing work practices and production processes and the shift to manufacturing in the Asian region. There has been an eMntlous drop in demand for the unski11ed and the low ski11ed, particularly in the blue-col1ar arena but also heading into the office based white-collar arena. That has placed downward market pressure on wage rates for people in the traditional1y low-paid occupational groups. Like any aspect of the labour market, it is not instantly amenable to a very simplistic supply and demand analysis. Although market factors will obviously influence how this particular market behaves, it is not that simple. It is not the Victoria Market with people selling sacks of potatoes. It is a lot more complex than that. It should be recognised by this House that lowering the price for 10w-ski11ed labour wi11 not generate more demand for 'pw-skilled work. What applies in other markets where there is a degree of elasticity does not apply in this situation. So, if there is a current demand for 100,000 labourers of a particular description, just because their wage rates are suddenly lowered does not mean that, as a result, there will be additional work of that character to be performed in the economy and that therefore more people who have those skills are capable of being employed. We have a structural problem. The alternative to the strategy of lowering wages to stimulate increased demand, which I would suggest would not occur, is to reduce supply. That is basically the thrust of the government strategy. Through its labour market programs and through the massive increase in funding that has occurred to education in this nation in the past eight to years, the government is endeavouring to reduce the number of people in the work force or seeking employment who have very limited skills to offer. I support that strategy wholeheartedly. That is what a jobs levy and the proceeds from such a levy need to be directed towards. We need to enhance, strengthen and further pursue that sort of strategy. There could be substantial costs in resolving unemployment because of the entrenched structural problem- but those costs will have to be met. There is a simplistic notion that the costs should be met by slugging the rich; but that will not work because, while rich people might have a lot of money, .there are not all that many of them. Any serious assault on unemployment wi\l have to be contributed to by the majority of people currently employed. That can be achieved in one of two ways: by the opposition's strategy-if it worked, which I do not accept - of lowering wages, at least for some, and notionally redistributing those wages to the unemployed, supposedly by providing them with jobs; or through the tax system. The basic difficulty with the opposition's strategy-this illustrates the different values and constituencies that the two parties represent-is that, even if it did work, the people who would bear the cost of providing employment for those long-term unemployed people, who are now heading towards the 400,000 plus mark, would be those who can least afford to pay and those who are already most at risk of becoming long-term unemployed. The most comfortable, those with the greatest capacity to pay, would bear no or little cost. The opposition's strategy would have no impact on honourable members-we are all on $68,000 a year, plus various bits and pieces. Allowing wages to fall by deregulation would have no impact at all on us. Yet through the tax system, through a jobs levy or some other mechanism, we would contribute, as would other high income earners. If we are serious about being egalitarian in this country-a philosophy on which the Labor. Party does not have a monopoly-we have to look at how this would be paid for. 10 As an illustration of where Western society is heading economically and structurally, I commend Work of Nations by Robert Reich, the Secretary for Labour in the Clinton Administration. It illustrates the dramatic changes that have occurred in the structure of Western economies and the particular implications that those changes hold for lower skilled workers. The theme that stands out in that book-which this government has picked up on when comparing our performance and the performance of the United Kingdom-is the need to educate and train the work force. In a global economy, Australian workers at all levels will be better off and better positioned with training and the ability to get experience even, if necessary, in subsidised jobs. That is why we need something in the form of a jobs levy to fund additional a!isaults above and beyond those already mounted on the long term unemployment problem. It is yet to be seen what the actual task force on unemployment report will come out with-we will find that out tomorrow. There will obviously be debate over a number of months on alternative ways bf reducing the level of unemployment. The report may come out with several alternatives of its own. I urge opposition members to think laterally and to go beyond the simplistic notion that minimum wages-set at very basic levels-cause unemployment to rise. That is an unsustainable proposition that opposition members repeat with such evangelical fervour that it indicates a lack of evidence to support it. Some of the miscellaneous items of legislation that we are dealing with in this debate relate to matters that in the current jargon come under the heading of 'political correctness'. For example, in the Defence Act 1903, we are replacing the word 'chairman' with the word 'president', which I wholeheartedly support. This sort of thing is regularly lampooned by people on the conservative side of politics, in the media and the like. There are occasional examples where this sort of thing goes a bit too farI cannot come to terms with the idea of calling the honourable member for Bennelong 'vertically challenged'. In fact, I think the most appropriate thing to do is to make no reference at all. . Even though there are things that are easy to lampoon, language reflects values. It sends messages, especially to children, about our society: how we see ourselves, who is and is not important, and how we should behave. Hence, all of us would agree that racially charged words, such as 'nigger'-commendably, the Queensland Government is taking steps to replace such language where it appears in certain place names-reflect a past society and past values which are no longer appropriate in contemporary Australia and are suitable for removal. Some call this social engineering. We socially engineer all the time-we engineer our children in the way that we bring them up both within individual families and on a broader social level. Collective decisions to change how that occurs do not mean that we have not previously been socially engineering them. It means that we have decided that certain things that used to be acceptable are now unacceptable because of changing community values and therefore should not be applied. Unfortunately, opposition members cannot resist the temptation to take things out of context and to blow them up into something that they clearly are not. A classic example of this occurred recently with the unfortunate comments by Senator MCGauran on the childcare guidelines. After his very commendable comments on East Timor-I commend his views to other opposition members and suggest they have a chat with him-I was disappointed to hear his comments on the child-care guidelines. Reading the guidelines, one realises that he made absolutely nonsensical accusations. He suggested that Christmas carols are being banned. The guidelines only suggest that it is not necessarily appropriate to have Christmas carols played non-stop for a month before Christmas and that it may be a good idea to intersperse a few other bits of music-hardly a revolutionary concept. Senator MCGauran also suggested that words such as 'no' and 'naughty' had been banned. This was an ironic suggestion, considering the basic standpoint of the opposition. In those guidelines, the government was saying to child-care centres that they should not usurp the role of the parent. Of course, if one child is hitting another, it is all right to say, 'No, naughty', or whatever. But where, for example, a child is exhibiting some behaviour that does not threaten anybody, it is essentially the preserve of, the parents whether to chastise or not, or to determine a strategy of how to deal with it. It is not the role of the child-care worker to say, - No, naughty', and to chastise-something that I would have thought the opposition, given its professed concern for the role of parents and so on, would have actually supported. So these things have been portrayed in quite a bizarre way. There is a considerable need for us to gradually progress the use of language to 'reflect contemporary values, not the values of the past and not the days when society had totally hierarchical, patriarchal structures.",44
97,Mr CHARLES,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"La Trobe) (4.58 p.m.)We just heard' a rambling expose which covered a number of topics, went around the stage and came back again. I am not really sure what the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) told us except that he did so in very measured terms and seemed to say, 'There are a few minor problems in the world but, basically, in Australia things are pretty right. We might consider a jobs levy, a little bit of money here and a little bit of money there. It is perfectly all right to change all of our language and. a few other things. The opposition is simplistic' - I picked that one up- 'but, . essentially, we don't have many problems'. We are here today to debate what is supposed to be an industrial relations bill-the Industrial Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill-but which is in fact a collection of bits and pieces which ought to have been part of legislation dealt with at earlier times by this House. In effect; we are dealing with a rubbish bill-it is a bill of rubbish. It parallels the Industrial Relations Reform Bill which dealt with voluminous rubbish. Every day, as the detail of that bill unfolds in the Senate, line by line, item by item, outside the House the government is queried on its real intent with respect to the words it put in that massive document. It is clear that the problems created by its volume and its complexity-difficulties arise in trying to understand it, let alone read it will not be dealt with in any comprehensive way for the next decade. We have some very real problems in Australia and this bill does not deal with any' of those problems. Our problems start with debt. We owe the rest of the world $178.8 billion net. That is a lot of money. We do not have the money to pay it back. We are not generating income in excess of what we spend to cover the debt. So we have to borrow money to pay the interest bill. As we borrow the money to pay the interest billl the value of our dollar continues to be suspect-it is. probably lower than it might otherwise be. That may help our exports a bit, but that overprices imports, which overwhelm the exports, and we wind up with imports costing more than they ought to. Structurally, inflation, while it is low, is higher than it might be if we had a balanced economy, but the fact is that we owe too much to the rest of the world. The next big problem we have is unemployment. The honourabk member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) spoke about the Reserve Bank's statement which attempts to deal with this all issue of unemployment and the Labor Party's continuous infatuation with programs to try to deal with things such as unemployment. Just about everyone in Australia who has any real knowledge of these things agrees that a jobs levy would be nothing more than a straight out tax on working Australians. We do not have enough working Australians at present. Our goods are not competitive enough or their quality is not high enough yet. We have not yet sourced out or found the markets overseas to. encourage our people to export more and replace some of the goods that we import. We are not even very good at encouraging gov. ernment to buy Australian made. We have a massive unemployment problem. We can talk about it in measured terms and those on the government benches can try to explain how they are going to deal with this problem, but the fact is that ALP governments created the problems we have. As long as they are in government, we will have to live with them. Australians may as well wake up and recognise that fact because it is not going to go away. While those opposite are in government, unemployment will be high because they do not know how to deal with it. They do not know how to encourage industry to invest in a capacity to build real jobs in the real economy. They do not have a clue. Another one of our real problems is skills training. We do not have enough discrete skills training. Just about everybody in the education and training market in Australia agrees that we need to make some shifts in that area. That does not mean that in some draconian manner we tell those who need a broad based university education that they cannot have it. What we do is tell those who do not believe that they need a broad based university education that we can help them to obtain the skills that they will find necessary in the real job market today. As the honourable member for Melbourne said, that job market is changing-that is demonstrably so-and there are fewer and fewer unskilled jobs every day of every week. Another major problem is that we do not have enough national savings. We are living on debt and on Bankcard-on borrowed money. This point has been made many times. If our households operated in the same way as our national accounts, we would have very few households that could afford to go to the movies, could afford to go out to 'dinner or could afford to put petrol in their cars. We have borrowed mo-ey to live beyond our means. Sooner or later we are going to have to slowdown and pay the piper. Investment in new productive capacity is another problem that this nation has. Our investment is too low. There is a whole range of structural prc;>blems why that is so, not least of which is this issue of industrial relations. Those companies which would invest in new plant and equipment would like to know that there is in place an environment where they can work in a modem manner with their employees to achieve results that are needed in order to be able to grow and to provide products, goods or services that society wants to purchase and is willing to pay for. Investment in new productive capacity is a problem and we will not address it until we address the industrial relations problem. We have government regulation and overregulation. In the ten years from 1983 to 1992 that the Hawke Labor government and now the Keatirig Labor government has been in this place, this House has passed 40,279 pages of legislation, statutes and acts. That is a ripper-and a record as well. At 4,028 pages a year, that is twice the rate of the Fraser government in the seven years preceding it and several times the rate of the Menzies government. This government is all about producing paper in the Industrial Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill which we are debating nominally today. It is just more paper about issues such as changing gender title. I do not mind whether we call the head of a commission the president rather than the chairman, but until sornebody pointed it out to me I never really considered that the title chairman had a gender base. I just thought it was the title of someone who headed a committee, whether male or female. Almost everybody else in the community felt the same. But we have now devoted pages of new legislation which will add to the record that this government has in overregulation. There are more pages of legislation devoted to changing titles from chairman to president. That will generate more volumes of paper. The regulations that back up this legislation amount to tens of thousands of pages. I do not know where we are headed, but this place is certainly keeping the paper industry going, if nothing else. Another real problem that we have in this nation is our highly cosseted labour market. The Industrial Relations Reform Bill that we the debated earlier, which will be brought back to this House no doubt later this week, adds another 193 pages of complex legislation which, as it has unfolded in the Senate, is unworkable and a huge nonsense. My view is that this bill contains the seeds Of destruction of the entire industrial relations system in this country-the mechanisms for setting wages and conditions of employment. The government-the ALP, the Labor Party, the mates of the trade union movement-has now so overbalanced the equation and given so much power to the trade unions by putting in place so many bureaucratic rules and regulations which are so complex and need to be dealt with by the legal society that it is bound to fail. Cartels always fail. There is no cartel the history of the world that has ever survived for very long. This cartel between the ACTU, the Labor government and the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, which is now enshrined in another 193 pages of legislation, is doomed to failure. It has itself the seeds and the government will reap the results.",47
98,Mr SWAN,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"The Industrial Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill is an omnibus bill which largely deals with a number of uncontentious amendments. So I, too, take this opportunity to make some general comments about industrial relations and to refer to one of the amendments before the House which allows the Commonwealth Industrial Relations Commission registry to act as the registry for a state industrial tribunal when the state and Commonwealth agree for it to do so. This amendment really goes to the heart of the government's approach to industrial relations-the heart of what we were on about in the Industrial Relations Reform Bill, which .the opposition holds in such contempt. Basically- this system will allow a cooperative arrangement between the registries at the state and federal levels to ensure that we go ahead into the world of enterprise bargaining based upon the award system-the award system which is, so essential to ensuring that we have in this country a fair and balanced system of industrial relations which protects the rights of those who do not have any bargaining power if the award system were not to exist. It is to those ends that I wish direct my remarks today. In particular, I want to.' talk about the government's approach which is summed up in this amendment and contrast it with the approach of the opposition, which approach we heard about in the previous industrial relations bill and which we have again heard today. Labor is seeking a cooperative system of industrial relations based upon the platform of the award system-a system which is based on the central role of the Industrial Relations Commission and all of the administrative backup which it requires. Essentially, that is Labor's consensual approach to industrial in relations-an approach which is rejected by the opposition. It is this consensual approach which is bringing many lasting benefits to this economy. In the 1980s this consensual approach sown resulted in the creation of 1.6 million jobs. Labor holds many records in this country. We . created an unprecedented number of jobs in the 1980s-something which is never acknowledged by those opposite, particularly when they discuss the problems of unemployment as they exist today. During the 1980s we created 1.6 million jobs. One of the reasons we created that record number of jobs was that we had in place effectively a wages policy which produced a curtailment in real wages over that time and led to the creation of jobs. We created jobs in a fair and balanced way. We did it in a way that this opposition never acknowledges. Opposition members never come into this House and acknowledge the sacrifice that was made by the work force of this country throughout the 1980s. Those opposite never acknowledge it because they want more: they want to cut wages so that they are even lower. They always want to force down wages and they want to cut public spending. I do not know how cutting public spending and slashing wages in the current environment will. do anything to create jobs. Nothing that the opposition has said in this debate or previous debates can demonstrate how that is the case. We have a gradualist approach to industrial to relations. We have the support of the great bulk of the business community for doing so, and we certainly have the support of the Australian electorate. The opposition does not have the support of the electorate or the business community for its big bang approach to industrial relations-the big bang approach to industrial relations which was delivered by Jeff Kennett in Victoria, which is currently being delivered in Western Australia and which is still the policy advocated by the opposition in this House. I would like to quote '7'"" as indeed I did during the industrial· relations debate-the Chief Executive of BHP, MrJohn Prescott. He dismissed the need for bigger changes in industrial relations. On 4 November, Mr Prescott warned that changing to a totally different system of industrial relations could cause 'a great deal of disruption'. He also said: ... industrial law should not get· too far ahead actual development. The parties on the ground can do a lot more with the existing legislation than they've done. That does .not support any of the .contentions put forward by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) or the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) in this Essentially, debate today. We have had a system throughapproach out the 1980s which has produced the flexievidence bility that we require as we become a more export oriented trading nation. We have . produced a system which has become much more flexible, but it has not delivered the absolute cuts in real wages sought by the regulation. opposition. So those opposite come into this House and denigrate the system. But they cannot denigrate it to many of the practitionfemale ers on the ground who have received the States benefits of that increased flexibility throughthat out the 1980s. The ca:se for gradualism;· I suggest, compelling. It is significant that the case the big bang approach put forward by the opposition has been rejected by the people. The head of BHP has rejeCted it. The complete opposition's contention that some dramatic cut in real wages will produce tremendous employment gains is not supported by any the evidence which is being produced by prominent labour market economists. Neither is it supported by much of the evidence or much of the experience from the United States that is cited by opposition members. Professor Bob Gregory is currently a memledge ber of the. Prime Minister's expert panel which is producing the green paper and not subsequently the white paper. Professor Gregory also argues the case for gradualism and rejects the case put forward by the opposition. He said: · .. the labour market is the key market in which the greatest differences have emerged among OECn countries over the last two decades. He goes on to say: · .. Australia may well be at a watershed of labour market reform, and the nature of this reform may be the crucial and irreversible policy choice over the next two years. Further, he states: · .. recent labour market experiences in Australia, of New Zealand and most of OECn Europe seem to suggest that the effects of adverse labour market shocks are not easily reversed. We need to think carefully before adopting policies of radical change-there are dangers as<;>cilltlid with a rapid and too radical deregulation of the labour market. .. Professor Gregory is rejecting the put forward by the opposition. What does Professor Gregory offer? He offers a great deal of evidence. He· says that US experience suggests caution before accepting some of the more 9ptimistic forecasts of the benefits that will flow from radical deIn that article, Professor Gregory goes on to cite the. employment experience of casual workers in Australia and the United to back up his contentions- It is a fact the most dramatic increases in real wages in this country have occurred amongst the casual female work force in recent times. The is most dramatic employment gains in this for country have been in that area of the work force. How can the opposition come into this House .and mount a case that the sole and cause of unernployment is the level of real wages when - he greatest employment gains made in our community have been of made by the workers who havesec1)red, over time, the greatest increase in real wages? The system, the whole problem,· is much more complex than that, as the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) said earlier. But the opposition refuses to acknowthe complexity of the issue. The reality is that the current levels of unemployment are just a product of our current recession but a product of the fundamental structural changes taking place within our econ()my- For example, more fundamental structural changes have meant that, of the 1.6 million jobs created in this country during the 1980s,only one. in seven of those went to a person who was previously unemployed. If we were to secure very high levels of economic growth right through to the year 2000, very large numbers of people-4oo,000 or 5oo,000:""':""""would still be defined as being long-term unemployed. That· is the case for substantial government intervention via labour market programs to do something for those people. Those programs will not automatically create jobs out of nothing. We on this side of the House acknowledge that government cannot do that. We acknowledge that the most fundamental way to reduce unemployment is to secure growth in the private sector. We have put in place a whole host of policies to do that, in particular .the lowering of the corporate rate. . But 400,000 people out there will not be the beneficiaries of that. They have been sidelined, due to their long-term unemployment, defined as being almost unemployable. The employers that the honourable member for Benne10ng talks about will not consider those people unless there is positive labour market intervention. We need positive labour market interventions for these people to rescue them from the fate delivered to them by fundamental structural change in the economy. For the opposition to come into this House and claim, on the one hand, that labour market programs are useless and then somehow claim, on the other hand, that it stands for some degree of egalitarianism in the community is simply preposterous. Those who stand for egalitarianism should stand for very substantial interventions to do something about the long-term unemployed; The most fundamental redistribution of wealth which occurs in this community occurs via unemployment. Failure to act for the long-term unemployed will skew the distribution of wealth in this community from the bottom to the top much more fundamentally than any other form of tax measure that the opposition might. care to put forward. We are a party which cares about equity. Those who care about equity have to care about the distribution of employment. As the honourable member for Melbourne said before, every policy put forward by the opposition will redistribute wealth from people who are unemployed or who are on low wages to people who are on high wages. That is the policy of the opposition, either via its expenditure cuts of $10 billion put forward in Fightback-the abolition of the CES, the abolition of labour market programs and so on-or via the tax system. This is why those opposite simply cry foul whenever we want to have a logical discussion about how we might raise the revenue to provide for the 400,000 or 500,000 people who are victims of fundamental structural change in our economy and who will remain victims unless we do something for them. This government is not scared of the debate about the green paper and the white paper. We will have that debate over the months ahead and the poverty of the opposition's approach will be exposed during that time. I think the poverty of its approach was best summed up in a recent interview given by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) on the Lateline program with Kerry O'Brien. I would like to quote from the transcript of that program. Kerry O'Brien asked: . . . So where is John Hewson on the political spectrum, today, compared to the past? The transcript continued: JOHN HEWSON: Well, Kerry, I don't ever allocate myself to the political spectrum. I leave that for people like you and others to do. John Hewson's still committed to the basic sense and direction of the policies we took to the last dection although, cleady, ,some of the detail will change, and to be clear, we ''Ie set the GST tax package aside. But the broad approach is pretty much the same in terms of the principles. That means that the opposition remains fundamentally 'committed to Fightback. It remains committed , to dramatic and drastic cuts in public expenditure. The shadow' Treasurer, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), came into this House and advocated taxation levels equivalent to that of most of our Asian tradingpartners, which would mean a cut in public expenditure in this country of between $10 billion and $20 billion. The opposition continues to decline to name which programs it would hack into. But, because it is still committed to the principles of Fightback, we know which ones they would be. The CES would go, labour market programs would go and the family income supplement would go. All of those things would have to go because if those opposite are going to cut public expenditure by $10 billion to $20 billion they will have to pick the big ticket items-$5 billion on family allowance and family income supplements, $8 billion on pensions and $1.3 billion on labour market programs. If those opposite want public expenditure cuts to the tune of $10 billion to $20 billion and they are still sticking to the principles of Fightback they cannot be concerned about jobs and equity. I will quote a bit more from the interview with Kerry O'Brien on Lateline. Speaking to the Leader of the Opposition, Kerry O'Brien said: You. weren't always so coy about this spectrum question. In 1986, you told writer, Craig MCGregor: 'I'm clearly on the right of the Liberal Party; I'm a pragmatic dry. I like competition. There's nothing like putting yourpart of his anatomyon the line'. Now is it-that's basically the same, you haven't changed? The transcript continued: JOHN HEWSON: That was before I entered Parliament. KERRY O'BRIEN: But you haven't changed philosophically? JOHN HEWSON: No. The basic direction's the same although I think, having reflected on it, words like right and dry don't mean all that much now. And so it goes on. The fact is that the opposition is committed to Fightback. It will somehow cover up the fact that it does not have a GST, but it is still committed to cutting public expenditure by between $10 billion amI $20 billion. It is still committed to all of those principles which can only cause unemployment in our community. Why do those opposite come into the House and carry on with this pretence-day in, day out-that· they have some solution to the problem of unemployment? We do not pretend to have all of the answers on this side of the House, which is why we have engaged in the white paper process. We have engaged in fiscal stimulus to the maximum extent possible, and that is creating jobs in the community. But what does the opposition say? It says, 'Oh, we shouldn't be doing that. We shouldn't be having a deficit of the level that we have got. We'll cut that. Well, that's more unemployment. We'll cut the labour market programs and we'll cut the CES'. The fact is that in this area the opposition is talking essentially about what it stands for in Fightback. I will go back to the Lateline interview because it really goes to the heart of the opposition's dilemma. Kerry O'Brien said to the Leader of the Opposition: Okay. Last question-have you worked out, yet, a nice portfolio ... that you're going to be able to offer Bronwyn? The transcript continued: JOHN HEWSON: Look, I've said I will make the decision in my own time. I offered her a very good portfolio last time in a combination of administrative services and privatisation designed specifically, I thought, to give her maximum scope to pursue her interests and for her talents to emerge. The Leader of the Opposition went on: But look, as I've said, I'm looking for Bronwyn to deal with that perception of instability and disloyalty ... The transcript continued: KERRY O'BRIEN: But I thought you said she had? JOHN HEWSON: No. She's in the process of dealing with it. KERRY O'BRIEN: How long are you going to give her? . JOHN HEWSON: As I say, I'll make the decision in my own time. I'm not going to be baulked into it by the media or poll pressure or whatever. KERRY O'BRIEN: John Hewson, thanks very much for talking with us.",49
99,Mr HOWARD,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,What has this to do with industrial relations?,52
100,Mr SWAN,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,What it has to do with industrial relations is that,52
101,Mr HOWARD,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,Nothing at all.,52
102,Mr SWAN,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Kerry O'Brien went on to say, 'What portfolio are you going to give her?' . I would suggest, given the poverty of the debate in this H(;mse, that the opposition give her industrial relations. Let us see where the opposition really stands. Let us see where the heir apparent to the throne of the Liberal Party stands on industrial relations. Let us see what she can say about the Industrial Relations Reform Bill. Let us see where the opposition really stands. Let her quantify the expenditure cuts. Let her tell us where she stands on enterprise bargaining. Let her tell the people of Australia what the policy of the Liberal Party is on industrial re1atior-s, on expenditure cuts, on macro-economic policy, on productivity and all of those v-ry important policy items that the Liberal Party is simply hiding. But the Leader of the Opposition has really let the cat out of the bag. He cannot talk about Fightback. any more because he has Bronwyn breathing down his m;ck. So my suggestion is: Bromvyn for IR, because then we might find out what the Liberal Party is really talking. abOl.-t.",53
103,Mr WAKELIN,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"We are debating the Industrial Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1993. The ALP tradition of fear and division is well and truly alive, as has been demonstrated by the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Swan). He mentioned that this side has contempt fodR. My word would be m9re like despair.J have listened to my opponents using great flowery words when talking. about what they have done. They tal-ed about 1.6 million jobs. I wonder how many are actually left?",53
104,Mr HOWARD,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,Very few.,53
105,Mr WAKELIN,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Very few, I would say. I will focus for a few minutes on the matter of equity. The bill talks about the registry state industrial bodies, including state industrial relations tribunals, Industrial courts workers compensation tribunals. I thought I would perhaps refer to my previous occupation as a farmer and see whether I could apply for registration to one of these courts. I wondered whether the courts might protect me against the weather, world prices and costs.. I notice that the honourable member for Lilley has left us; I thought. he might have some answers for us. Surely the answer is for more of my parliamentary colleaguesparticularly my opponents and more union officials-to venture' into business: run an enterprise, create a product and see the process in its totality. It is a matter of realising that many of us do not have access to these registry tribunals dealing with redundancies, overtime, superannuation, workers compensation, conditions for dust and conditions for temperature. They are things which I just took for granted. But I definitely want equity in this business and I want to register my business with the industrial registry. ,The honourable member for M-lboume (Mr Tanner) mentioned a $3 wage in the US. I understand that in Australia today under this current Labor government there are people already working for $3 an hour-quite remarkable. The honourable member for Melbourne also mentioned the jobs levy. He said that the costs might be substantial. Surely the jobs levy is going to lower people's wages. If we raise people's taxation we will lower people's real wages- The Labor Party said, 'Oh, no, we won't lower wages. Oh, no'. The Labor Party would never lower wages; it just takes a jobs levy. I tum to the issue of structural problems and come. back to my little old industry. For 100 years successive governments made sure that agriculture became structurally sound as tens of thousands of us walked out through the gates bankrupt. Much of this problem was created by the cost structures of this country. Do not talk to me about equity. Do not talk to the young people of this country about equity. Do not talk to the unemployed of this country about for equity. There are going to be green papers and white papers, and surely they are the and living proof of our economic weaknesses. I guess we are going to be sold the idea that they are some panacea; that somehow they will come to terms with unemployment; that another paper will solve unemployment. How many jobs will be created by this legislation? How has this parliament improved each Australian's life by this legislation? Only when we answer these questions will we have fulfilled our responsibility.",53
106,Mr WILLIAMS,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I speak in support of the amendment moved by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) to delete part 1 of the Industrial Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill dealing with the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988. This part is but briefly described in its positive sense in the second reading speech of the Minister for Industrial Relations(Mr Brereton). His described in tenns that suggest it is quite innocuous. In his second reading speech the minister said: The proposed amendments of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 will assist Comcare and licensed authorities to recover certain overpayments which may occur when an employee who is receiving worke- compensation benefits retires and becomes entitled to superannuation benefits. The proposed amendment introduces a scheme that will· enable the overpayment to be recovered from the superannuation fund concerned, rather than from the individual. Let us see how this little scheme is intended to work. The provisions contemplate that Com care, or an authority licensed under the act-meaning in this case Australia Post or Telecom Australia-is paying an employee of the Commonwealth, or of a Commonwealth instrumentality, workers compensation benefits under the act and the employee then retires. If Comcare or its licensed authority fonns the opinion that it may make, or may have made, an overpayment of compensation to the retired employee, it may then give a notice to the administrator of a superannuation schem- under which the employee is entitled to a pension, to a lump sum, or to both. I repeat the, condition to which the power to give the notice relates. Com care, or the licensed authority, fonns the opinion that it may make, or may have made, an overpayment of compensation to the employee. Let us now have a look at the notice. The notice may state, as conditions of power, that Comcare may make, or may have made,an overpayment. It may then require the superannuation scheme administrator to tell Com care or the authority whether the retired employee has received any payment of lump sum or pension, or whether the employee's benefits have been deferred. The notice may then require the administrator, if the retired employee has not received any superannuation benefits and the benefits have not been deferred not to pay any superannuation, j either lump sum or pension. The notice may also require the administrator as soon as practicable to give Comcare or the authority particulars of the benefits that are payable to the retired employee under the superannuation scheme. So we have a situation in which an authority-an insurance authority, in effect, alien to the superannuation fund-is entitled, on the fonnation of an opinion that an event may have occurred or may occur in the future, to freeze the superannuation benefits. Comcare or the authority is required then to give the employee a written notice stating that it has given a notice to the administrator and explaining how the provisions work. When Comcare or the authority receives the details from the administrator, Comcare or the authority is obliged within two working days of receipt to detennine whether an overpayment has occurred. Let me say that again,but in another way. Comcare, or the licensed authority, is not obliged to detennine whether an overpayment has actually occurred until it has received details from the superannuation scheme administrator of the benefits payable to the retired employee. Comcare or the authority must, within the same two-day period, either advise the administrator that no ov!!rpayment has occurred or state the amount of the overpayment and then require the administrator to pay that amount to Comc,are or the licensed authority. The administrator is then required to pay the amount of the ov-rpayment of compensation to Com care or the licensed"" authority out of the pension or the lump SUlp· payments which, the administrator would otherwise have paid to .the employee. That payment discharges any obligation of the administrator to the retired employee in respect of the amount of the payment. This is an extraordinary scheme. The power to assault the employee's superannuation arrangements arises before a detennination has even been made as to whether there has been an overpayment. It is irrelevant to whether or not Comcare or the licensed authority has power to freeze the benefits. If there have been overpayments, it is irrelevant that they may have been due to' the negligenceof Com care or the licensed authority, or even that theyha:ve been done deliberately. It is irrelevant that the retired employee may challenge the determination or the anticipated determination by Comcare and might wish to argue that there is no overpayment. The retired employee is the silent victim of a bureaucratic monstrous scheme. Many employees spend years planning their retirement. Many make detailed plans for paying off mortgages, going on trips, investing for the future, or making gifts to their children, and it may make an enormous difference to their plans whether they receive their lump sum in full or they ,receive their pension payments on time. For many, those plans are quite capable of being disrupted by this scheme. What makes it worse is that there is no encouragement to Com care or the licensed authority to get the determinations 'right, or to get those determinations done in a timely way. There is positive encouragement to Comcare and the licensed authority to let the payments run on, knowing that they can recover them from the retired employee at wilL If one examines the principle that might be stated as the basic operating mechanism of this scheme, it would seem to be this: Comcare, as a workers cbmpensation insurer of Commonwealth employees, Is entitled to make overp-yinents negligently, deliberately or inadvertently to an employee and then to recover the overpayments by whatever means it decides'in relation ,to the employee's annuation payments. It is patronising iri the extreme. The employee is not given the choice of saying, '1 wOldd like to pay that out of this nest egg account that my wife has'. He is riot' entitled to say, 'I will borrow it from my children to repay this overpayment'. He is not even entitled to say before the scheme freezes his superannuation benefits that he has not been overpaid. One can think of how this scheme might be extended if one Commonwealth authority is entitled to say to another Commonwealth authority, 'A Commonwealth employee or a former Commonwealth employee owes me money. Why not just institute some sort of EFTPOS scheme onto salary?' That is basically what this is. It is EFTPOS into the superannuation payments, lump sum or pension that can be implemented at the will of Comcare or a licensed authority without reference to the employee. This is a most extraordinary piece of legislation to be proposed by a government that purports to represent the working man. It is tota1\y objectionaple and, in my humble view, it is outrageous. I cannot understand how the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) could have offered a certificate that this does not infringe the privacy of an employee. 1 cannot understand how a government that seeks to represent the working man could be proposing it. I cannot underst;md how it ever got through caucus. 1 cannot understand how it ever got through cabinet. But 1 can understand why it was proposed by the minister. This legislation is part of a package that is tied up with string and which will cost working people of Australia jobs. ,But it will cost them not only jobs; if this part of the scheme gets implemented it will also cost them their superannuation benefits under arrangements that they may have, had in place for many years. I' commend the amendment to the House. (Quorum formed)",54
107,Mr SLIPPER,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"1 thank colleagues opposite for coming into the House to provide a quorum for this speech. It is interesting to note that the Labor speaker who was listed to speak has not spoken. Obviously super- those opposite are running away from the legislation which is before the House. The Industrial Relations and Other Legislation - Amendment BiII encompasses amendments to eight acts. It is what is called an omnibus:bill, which bills appear to be increasingly common in this place. 1I have some difficulty with the government's putting together a grab bag of proposals, bringing them into the - parliament in one bill and then expecting people who read the proceedings of the parliament to understand what is in fact happening. I think that as legislators we have an obligation to make it easy for people to understand the proceedings of parliament. When amendments to eight pieces of legislation are brought together under the guise of one bill changing a .vast number of things, I wonder whether it could be suggested that the aim is to make the proceedings of the parliament more obscure rather than more understandable. The acts which are being amended by the bill are the Defence Act 1903, the Industrial Relations Act, the Maternity Leave (Commonwealth' Employees) Act, the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act, the Remuneration Tribunal Act, the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act, the Sex Discrimination Act and the Tradesmen's Rights Regulation Act 1946. It has been said that the essential nature of the amendments before the House is to allow the Commonwealth industrial relations registry to act as a registry of l\ state industrial tribunal where the states and the Commonwealth agree to this; to clarify the operation of the maternity leave provisions for the parliamentary departments; to extend the operation of the act and regulations dealing with occupational health and safety of Commonwealth employees to others at or near the workplace; and to allow Coin care to recover overpayments from the superannuation entitlements of former employees where they have received an overpayment. Six of these amendments result from careless or faulty drafting of instructions submitted by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) to the parliamentary draftsmen. The bills are being rushed through the parliament in a great hurry. Those who listen to the parliamentary broadcasts, arid those in this place, would know that more and more we find that the debate Is limited; we find that the guillotine is being applied and that we are not having reasonable time for debate, with the result that the quality of the legislation passing through this House is not really what it should be. The net result is that the minister has to come back into the parliament and ask the House to, in effect"" fix up what should have been fixed up in the first place. I think that that is very sad and it is a very great reflection on the government. It, is a very strong argument for having an upper house, a house of review. But even our house of review does not always make sure that the legislation is what it indeed ought to be. The coalition is not opposing this bill. However, we are concerned about a number of the matters it raises. One thing I am very worried about is the social engineering aspect of the bill in changing the term chairman to president. Of, itself, that change is fairly unobjectionable-both chairman and president are respected words-but the suggestion is that the word chairman is a sexist term and that somehow, the word president is nongender specific. In the Oxford English Dictionary, volume 2 of the 1989 edition, the word chairman is defined as: l.a. The occupier of a chair of authority;such as yourself, Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER the person who is chosen to preside over a meeting, to conduct its proceedings, and who occupies the chair or seat provided for this function. There is nothing, there about the gender of the occupant. The person who occupies the chair simply becomes the chairman. I think that some of the politically correct language changes being made at the moment are all a bit precious. The honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) said that, while he supported these changes, even he was concerned about the extent of some changes in this social engineering area. I think it is fairly sad that politically correct language and behaviour is now creeping into our bills as well as into child-care centres. What will the end result be? Honourable members would be aware of the politically correct guidelines for child-care centres that the Minister for Family Services, Senator Crowley, issued recently. My electorate office has been inundated with complaints from people on the Sunshine Coast and throughout the electorate of Fisher who very strongly object to the abolition of Christmas in childcare centres. I ask myself: is the fact that Santa Claus is not depicted as a gender neutral figure the reason",55
108,Mr HOWARD,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,They will stop at nothing!,57
109,Mr SLIPPER,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"They will stop at nothing, as the honourable member for Bennelong says. Is the fact that Santa Claus is not ed as a gender neutral figure the reason the government seeks to ban Christmas celebrations from child-care centres? I ask you, Mr Deputy Speaker, as someone I consider to be a reasonable individual: will Australian toddlers who fail to remove gender specific titles from their vocabulary find that funding to their child-care centres is cut? It is tragic that the government, in its fifth term is now implementing its philosophy in this way. People, regardless of their politics-be they Labor, Liberal or National party-would be totally opposed to what the government is seeking to achieve. I hope that the government will review the guidelines. If it has any common sense, and an eye to the next election result, it must take on board the outrage of people in all sections of the community over this attempt at social engineering to produce a generation of politically correct young Australians. The attitude of this government is very similar to that of the discredited former communist regimes in eastern Europe which were prepared to influence the minds of young people as they went through the education system. I therefore hope that the government reconsiders this matter. The honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams) referred to part 7 of the bill, which relates..to .the amendments to the Safety, RehabllttatlOn and Compensation Act 1988. That change introduces a number of new sections dealing with the recovery of overpayments to employees who retire at a time when they are in receipt of Comcarebenefits. These are shocki-g provisions. As indicated by my colleague, It would allow Com care, without reference to its clients, to recover overpayments from their superannuation funds. That reallr amounts to a grab, which is quite despIcable. Indeed, I am totally opposed to what th- government is seeking to achieve here. It IS outrageous that the government is seeking to bring a legal provision into the legislation which will allow any person or - ody access to any individual's superannuahon fund. However, the section that I find to be of particular concern is the one dealing with the Industrial Relations Act. As the honourable member for Bennelong said, I am depictalways happy to talk about the industrial relations situation in this country because q-ite frankly, it is a total and unmitigated dIsaster. Members on both sides of the House during the limited time that the Leader of thHouse (Mr Beazley) allowed us debated the industrial relations legislation a 'week or two ago. Unfortunately, that bill did not meet Australia's real needs in this area. We did not find any increased flexibility. We did not find - ny genuine move towards enterprise bargainmg. . When I looked at the title of this legislatIOn, I thought that perhaps the minister had had a change of approach; perhaps he realised the inadequacy of his sell-out to the unions with the legislation we debated such a short time ago. When I read the pages of the bill and saw that it was an omnibus bill-a grab bag of bits and pieces, as one of my colleag.ues refet;ed to it a little while ago-I realtsed that It was totally inadequate. It did not seek to remedy any of the real changes necessary in the industrial relations area; it did not address the question of unemployment. At. the moment, we have one million people out of work-and perhaps as many as two million people who are unable to find enough work. . Tomorrow the government will be releasing ItS green paper on unemployment. There is already a suggestion that there will be a jobs I-vy-to which the people of my electorate of Flsherare totally opposed. This bill does not meet any of the real needs in the industrial relations area. It does nothing to solve the unemployment crisis. It does nothing to remove the labour market rigidities and regulations. Indeed, it is a major disaster. We still have an unemployment rate of more than 11 per cent. Something needs to be done. To slim up-my abbreviated time is almost up-this bill fails on all counts: it seeks to socially engineer; it seeks to change a large number of acts with one piece of legislation' it brings in an absolutely dreadful and despicable amendment that would grant Comcare access to superannuation funds; it fails to make very necessary amendments in industrial relations. This government stands totally and completely condemned by its absolute abrogation of its responsibinty to the people of Australia. This government stands condemned and will continue to be condemned by Australians throughout the nation for its absolute failure to properly govern and adopt policies needed by a nation with so many troubles.",57
110,Mr MCARTHUR,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I note the paucity of speakers on the other side of the House and wonder where the true believers are when it comes to supporting the bill before us-the Industrial Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill-and the industrial relations legislation that is now before the Senate. I would like to make a few observations about the industrial relations matters presently under the consideration of this parliament. I had the honour to be part of an Australian delegation to the Indian subcontinent: India, with a population of nearly 900 million people; Bangladesh, with a population of 120 million people; and, Nepal, with a population of 20 million people. In the course of that parliamentary delegation it was very interesting and revealing to hear the various prime ministers and finance ministers talking about open, competitive economies. In those nations-where the standards of living do not rate, and where they are struggling to feed their populatio.ns-governments are moving in the opposite direction to this government when it comes to deregulation, freeing up their ecohomies and freeing up the labour market. Whilst the condition of the labour market in those nations is dramatically different to that found in Australia, their attitude was one of creating a privatisation program to make domestic industries more competitive and to open up investment so that jobs would be created. As reported in the New York Herald Tribune, Europe has a similar problem with between 14 million and 16 million people unemployed. That situation is due in part to inflexible labour market arrangements. That paper, and a number of commentators in that paper, drew to my attention the relationship between the· industrial relations arrangements in Europe and in the United Kingdom and the lack of jobs. The unemployment rate was between 10 and 12 per cent. That compares to the situation in the United States, which the honourable. member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) alluded to earlier in the debate. He said'that the rate of unemployment in that country is in the range of 6 1h per cent of the work force. That is the situation as the United States comes out of a recession. A more flexible labour market allows that country to create more jobs, especially in that small business sector. The more competitive, less rigid system in America allows jobs to be created. ;Again, the comparison· to Asian nations paints an enviable picture. Asian nations are becoming competitive; they are creating wealth and investment. They are using those very big populations to create job opportunities with more flexible job arrangements. These industrial relations bills-both the one before the House now and the key industrial relations bill relating to the formation of enterprise agreements before the Senate-are really industrial relations bills in name only. As I said recently in the parliament, there were 12 hurdles to the formation of these enterprise agreements. The attitude of the government has been that enterprise agreements will be covered under these· new arrangements .. Obviously, when one looks at the fine print, there can be nothing further from the truth. I would just like to quote what Professor Judith Sloan, who is well known to members of this House, said in relation to industrial relations. She is highly respected. She makes some independent observations about the industrial relations system,both historically and in a future context. In the Australian Financial Review of October 14 an article entitled 'The Brereton can of worms' states: The. labour market reform package is a sham, writ- Judith Sloan . In the thrust of her article, which we have to take some recognition of because of her deep understanding of industrial relations in Australia, she goes on to say-and she agrees with my proposition: With the hurdles being imposed by the legislation, it will be a brave non-unionised (and probably foolish) employer who would even contemplate negotiating a formal enterprise agreement. So she is saying that ,the legislation which the government has put before this House and which develops an enterprise agreement has so many impediments to it that no genuine enterprise 'agreements will be enter-d into under these arrangements. She goes on in this particular article to talk about the possibilities that, while small business would be advantaged by the enterprise agreements, big business would not be greatly affected because it will have the award arrangements and probably will not enter individual enterprise agreements. She says: ' While it is true that little will be altered for big, unionised business; apart from the changes related to industrial action and secondary boycotts, big firms have small businesses as their suppliers and customers. And given th-t 60 per cent of workers are employed in businesses that employ 100 worken; or fewer, the effective disenfranchisement of small and medium businesses in the Brereton package is of considerable concern. I think she hits on the major point of the whole argument that, whilst big business is reasonably happy with the industrial relations refanns and has not made too much public comment because it will be business as usual; those small finns throughout Australia who are contemplating exercising their rights to enter genuine enterprise agreements will find that the impediments that this legislation poses will make it almost impossible forthem to enter those agreements. 'Professor Sloan goes on to say: Overall, it is a very pro-union package with an institutionalised right to strike, diluted secondary boycott provisions and an insistence that employers ""bargain in good faith"". This latter provision is another can of worms likely to involve the Commission. It is also extremely dubious in the context of a system still based on compulsory arbitration. Employers have the ""choice"" of bargaining in good faith or being forcibly dragged before the Commission. So, in an outward context, we have enterprise agreements. We also have, with all the trappings within this very complicated legislation, a situation where enterprise agreements will not be entered into. They will just be an addon to existing awards and conditions. That is absolutely contrary to what the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has said on a number of occasions. What the government has been advocating in tenns of enterprise agreements and in tenns of the change of attitude in the whole indiJstrial relations arrangements in Australia and around the world is that individual agreements between the employerMr DEPUTY SPEAKER, (Mr Snow)Order! The honourable member is dwelling at some length on the provisions of the Industrial Relations Refonn Bill before the Senate, which relates to enterprise agreements. This legislation does not specifically relate to those agreements, and I ask the honourable member to dwell on the provisions of the bill rather than a matter'which is before the Senate.",58
111,Mr MCARTHUR,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank you for your advice, but we have before us an omnibus bill which relates to government instrumentalities and which contains details relating to changes to other legislation, as is mentioned in the title of the legislation. I note speakers on the government side deviated somewhat in some of their discussions. The honourable member for Lilley (Mr Swan), for instance, covered a wide range of topics. I seek your indulgence to cover just some of these issues which do cover the detailed matters before the parliament at .this moment. Mr Deputy Speaker, could I move on to the other very important matter of the relationship between the corporations power and the ability to control the new industrial relations package as put forward by the government. As you would be aware, the Tasmanian dams case in 1983 introduced the concept of the foreign affairs power. The ability of the Commonwealth government to control states rights has been hotly debated over the years and various opinions have been expressed on the High Court's interpretation. The Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) has used that example to extend the corporations power t6 support this current hatch of industrial relations legislation. So the government has been able to enforce the Commonwealth's attitude in industrial relations through the corporations power. Whilst it is enforcing what we would say is a rigid set of terms and conditions of a very pro-union arrangement where th- unions have their finger in the pie of federal awards, unions will be a part of any workplace agreement and will be very much involved in the setting of industrial awards and so-called enterprise agreements. The key element that I think the govern01ent and the minister should be aware of is that, whilst the corporations power allows. the government to make these arrangements, any future government would have the ability to make a more deregulated market and allow for true and genuine enterprise agreements to be entered into. I wind up by saying that the government in this omnibus bill has brought to bear a range of conditions, which is totally against the thrust of thinking of those people concerned with and close to industrial relations matters both here in Australia and in America and Europe. I find it quite amazing that these detailed arrangements are contrary to the general thrust of the government's thinking, but we know that the ACTU was able to exert its influence on the minister and make sure that the trade union .movement was included in the negotiations. Inevitably in the bill a preference clause still remains that the union movement has an undue say in the outcome of many of these so-called enterprise agreements. I conclude in the vain hope that sanity will prevail and that industrial relations, as we know them in Australia, will progress and become more flexible .and that the darkness that some of this legislation casts upon the total industrial relations system will be shed at some later time. Inevitably, industrial relations arrangements will become more flexible. As people seek job opportunities and employers try valiantly to help young people to get a job, the cloak of these sorts of restricbefore tive arrangements will be removed and, hopefully, more job opportunities will be created, especially with the sorts of industrial relations programs that 'the honourable member for Bennelong and the opposition have put forward over the last five to eight years.",59
112,Mr ANDREW,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,";-I am pleased to participate in this debate and follow the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) and, particularly, my colleague the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr MCArthur), whose experience in industrial relations is well known on this side of the House and generally applauded across the chamber. As did the honourabie member for Corangamite, I want to pick up a comment or two made by the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Swan). When participating in this debate, he applallded the opportunities that had been taken up by the government in job creation. On behalf of the members on this side of the chamber, I agree with his sentiments. The parliament is delighted at the job creation opportunities that have occurred under this government. Our reservation about the legislation before the House is not meant to be a criticism of the new jobs the government claims to have produced during its term of office. We simply want to state that the legislation does not do sufficient to counter the ongoing problem of unemployment. It fails to address what is Australia's No. 1 social dilemma: unemployment If I were participating in this debate as a member of the government and the honourable member for Lilley, per chance, were a member of the opposition-the roles having been reversed-all hell would have broken loose had the Liberal and National parties been in government during the expansion in unemployment that we have seen since 1983. I am aware, as you are aware Mr Deputy Speaker, of the criticism levelled at the Fraser government during its time in office. It is simply not good enough, in the context of this deb-te, for the honourable member for Lilley to want to somehow gild the lily-no pun intended-by suggesting that all is well in unemployment as a result of the legislation the House tonight and the legislation which is currently being debated in the Senate. We have not created jobs at a sufficient rate to relieve the exploitation that unemployment currently represents for the community. As the honourable member for Corangamite keeps saying,. there is 11 per cent un employment-900,OOO Australians must be a burden on the conscience of every member of this parliament, particularly members of the government. The honourable member for Lilley says, 'Look at what we have done in job creation'. It is not denied by us but it is no way to point, avoid the fundamental dilemma of unemployments ment that the nation faces. It is particularly pertinent that there is this level of unemployobservation ment while the Australian Labor Party is power because it has made so much of history as the representative of employees. Its monopoly in that area is something would dispute. But it must be particularly poignant for Labor Party members-if they are honest with themselves and acknowledge that under their philosophy we have seen this blow-out in unemployment. The legislation is specifically designed-so they tell us-to address the unemployment problem. The honourable member for Corangamite has made the point, as has the honourable member for Bennelong-and, having heard the honourable member for Pearce (Mrs Moylan) contribute to this debate before, I have no doubt that she will also want to make the point effectively-that the opportunity to provide jobs for Australians exists principally through the expansion of small business. The enterprise agreements that have b,een part of this total industrial relations package in many cases have been taken up by big business. The challenge that we as parliamenthis country. . tarians face is that of ensuring that those enterprise agreements and the opportunity to be flexible with awards is as appealing to small business as it is to big business. reservations being expressed by the. honourchanged able member for Bennelong, the honourable member for Corangamite-and I suspect, of me as it is to say so, by the honourable member for Pearce-and me are that this not the sort of legislation that will allow small business to employ additional employees. Mr Deputy· Speaker, you have heard the suggestion that members on this side of the House see the solution to unemployment purely in terms of reducing people's take home pay. I do not know how frequently have to say-as the honourable members for Bennelong and Corangamite have said--'-that we do not intend, as participators in this parliament, to see people with a reduced take home pay. We want to see increased employment opportunities. I know you made the sir, about the fact that enterprise agreeare being debated in the Senate. I respect that; but in 30 seconds I will make the that it was the enterprise agree in ments that gave opportunities for new emits ployment in industries with which I am . familiar, particularly with the changes that have occurred in the canning industry in the I Goulburn Valley. The passion that members on this side of the House have, is to see that sort of flexibility extended more easily for the nation-to small business. I represent the farming community. There is no shortage of jobs in rural Australia, as the honourable member for Corangamite can attest. But the reservation that small business employers-particularly rural employershave about putting on additional· staff and relieving the burden of unemployment, is about the additional responsibility that unfairly is placed on the. employer· and not the employee. We are saying: allow employers and employees, regardless of the size of the business to negotiate a package which is more attractive for both, so employers are more willing to employ people and relieve some of the current unemployment levels being felt by One particular focus of the bill is referred to in the address from the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton). The title of the The head of the Remuneration Tribunal ifrom chairman to president, to ensure the title is gender neutral. Along with the bold honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles), I am not opposed to that-but I am is a shade bemused that we should find ourselves caught up in so many pages of legislation in what is an exercise jn nothing more than gender neutrality, when very few people find the terms president al1d· chairman offensive. . The opposition will not oppose that measwe ure, we merely point out the absurdity of having additional paper generation and legislation to address something that is not important, when we have a major human dilemma of unemployment continuing on the horizonand not being addressed effectively by the government. The techniques that the opposition has suggested, and that would allow greater flexibility in employment, are largely being ignored by the government. We think a change to industrial relations is the key that will unlock employment opportunity, yet the key has not been put in the lock-much less turned-because all the legislation we have dealt with has been frustrating in industrial relations terms. The change from chairman to' president only represents further regulation in an area that desperately needs to be deregulated. I will quote briefly from the speech given by the Minister when he introduced the amendments now being debated by the House. He said: The proposed amendments of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act . .. will assist Comcare and licensed authorities to recover certain overpayments which may occur when an employee who is receiving workers compensation benefits retires and becomeS entitled to superannuation benefits. We all understand that. He went on to say: The proposed amendment introduces a scheme that will enable the overpayment to be recovered from the superannuation fund concerned, rather than from the individual. The opposition proposed amendments in the Senate which, taken as a whole, would have had the effect of preventing the government's proposed recovery mechanism from operating. The opposition was concerned that the amendments gave Comcare and licensed authorities-presently Australia Post and Telecom-unprecedented access to a retired employee's superannuation funds. Let me emphasise that the recovery mechanism only operates if the retiree actually receives, or over, a superannuation benefit. Where the benefit is preserved, the amendments will not operate. The fundamental concern the opposition has is that there has been far too little supervision of the whole question of the work cover and Comcare arrangements. I have had situations in my office, as I suspect most honourable members have, where I have wondered how real the work cover demands were that were being made by the employee. I found very little opportunity to supervise both the work cover arrangements and the legislation that currently obliged Comcare and licensed authorities to meet these compensation benefits. The opposition believes that there should be greater flexibility in this area to enable those authorities to ensure that the funds are recovered from the appropriate source. As I have indicated in my remarks, the opposition's concern with this legislation is that there has been far too little flexibility in the whole area of industrial relations, far too little opportunity for small business, to avail itself of the same employment opportunities and of the same changes in enterprise agreements as currently apply to. big business. Our plea to the government is to allow greater flexibility in this area to allow small business to play its role in ensuring that unemployed Australians have an opportunity to find permanent work.",60
113,Ms MOYLAN,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"The time spent on this Industrial Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill defies explanation. Senator Reid, in her speech on this, bill in the Senate on 19 November, stated: Six of these acts relate to amendments that ought not to be before the parliament or take up our time at present. These amendments arise from careless or faulty drafting instructions from the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brerton) in relation to each of these bills. They do not relate, of course, to errors in the drafting itself; they are clearly errors in the instructions given by the minister in the first place. Correcting bills that were pushed. through in such a hurry in the first place that they were not correct is the sort of thing that seems to take up a great deal of our time these days. rolls But of more importance than the sloppy work of the Minister for Industrial Relations in issuing the instructions for drafting is the predilection of this government for fiddling on the fringes of industrial relations legislation while we have one million people out of work. What do the unemployed care about the legislation being gender neutral and the change of name from a chairman to president? My guess is that they would at least like the legislation to apply to them. What, also, do they care about the recovery of a miserly $180,000 under the Tradesmen's Rights Regulation Act-even that figure is doubtful in its accuracy-and the dubious changes in regard to avoiding duplication on a register, allowing unions operating under state awards to transfer to federal awards. Oh to have a job to be able to take maternity leave from. And so it goes on. The unemployed have one care: to be employed: This government seems intent on increasing the benefits, the security of tenure to those already employed and the responsibility of employers to fund all that rather than to seriously address the needs of those million people without any job opportunities. The irony of government rhetoric about reform in industrial relations and job creation was not lost in a recent PM interview with Bill Kelty and Lindsay Fox at the Melbourne Zoo. Ellen Fanning asked Bill Kelty a question. I-le responded as follows: I suppose it's an appropriate place to close a campaign, a zoo. I don't think I've ever been at the zoo before to either launch a campaign or to close one. I might suggest that Mr Kelty is in a permanent zoo; I am surprised that he did not recognise it when he saw it. Perhaps a circus would have been a more appropriate· venue. In response to Bill Kelty, Peter MCCutcheon had this to say: The general message they wanted to sell was that reducing unemployment is beyond politics. I would like to leave that interview for a moment and go to an article in the Australian dated 4 September 1993 titled 'The labour reform that wasn't'. We will have a look at Mr Kelty's desire to leave politics out of job creation. The second paragraph reads: The unravelling of the reform process of industrial relations minister Laurie Brereton guarantees that industrial relations will be a political problem for the Keating Government for the next three years. The conspiracy theory says that Brereton and Paul Keating were led into a no-win situation by the ACTU; the blunder theory holds that Brereton and Keating misjudged union resistance to their proposal to free-up the labour market. At this week's ACTU congress in Sydney, the trade unions rudely removed any doubt about their opposition to the Brereton reform package. The Government and the unions are now working on an alternative proposal from ACTU strategist Bill Kelty which would continue the ban on certified non-union deals, instead encouraging the use of nexibility provisions in existing awards and allowing some non-un ionised workplaces to form their own unions. The whole exercise has become an embarrassment of Lal?or's own making, with all sides blaming everybody else. A prime example of that is. the Prime Minister's speech to the Institute of Company Directors on April 21 in which he first nagged his desire to see a much greater spread of enterprise bargaining in the non-union sector. Kelty and the ACTU president; Martin Ferguson, were both away at the time, and mystified union officials reacted angrily to what was interpreted as a tackle from Keating. So much for the non-politicisation of industrial relations. Further on in the PM interview, this time in response to Peter MCCutcheon, Bill Kelty said: The figures on the traineeship scheme are now quite startling. But it's not the figures. It's really what it means for young people. And it means giving them a bit of confidence and a bit of hope, broader skills and most important, a bit of confidence in themselves. And from where Lindsay and I have sat, basically we've been out there barracking for young people, trying to show the rest of Australia that a number of people do care-they care about the future of young people, they believe in them and, because they believe in them, believe in the future of this country. That probably made Mr Kelty and a few others feel warm and fuzzy, but it will take more than cosy rhetoric to solve the problems. While Mr Kelty and Mr Fox can be congratulated on their initiative, I think there are many real things that could have been done via the Industrial Relations Reform Bill instead of fiddling, as I said before, on the fringes with all these other bits and pieces that have no bearing on the real issues facing this country in terms of industrial relations reform. It was at this point in this interview on PM that Lindsay Fox responded to Peter MCCutcheon. He said: Well, it's 16 months since we started the road show. We started at Bairnsdale. The first day, we finished with the community asking for one person to come forward and we placed a young lady in a job at the Bairnsdale Base Hospital. Some three days later, the people from that community working at the Bairnsdale Base Hospital all elected to give back their 17.5 per cent loading as a donation. The hospital, in tum, ultimately then put on six people which helped the local community. We found that spirit right throughout travels in Australia-the elements of caring and sharing. Perhaps Mr Kelty and Mr Brereton could go and tap into this community spirit-which I think is quite wonderful, genuinely-to see whether the community will go a step further. Instead of applying a jobs levy and taxing the Australian public any more, why do they not bite the bullet and start developing industrial relations reforms that make a difference? They could start with the 171/2 per cent loading. It can be properly argued that all Australians should forgo this loading at this particular time in Australia's history when we have one million people out there without a job, without the opportunity to earn and, mbre importantly, without the bpportunity to develop the work ethic and have the joy of going daily to a place of work to feel like they have done their bit. For many people, work is about more than just money. So I appeal to the Australian people to forgo, at least for the time being, the 171/2 per cent leave loading. If Mr Fox and Mr Kelty can create six jobs at one institution, the Bairnsdale Base Hospital, it does not take much to imagine what can be done Australia wide if the whole Australian community participated in that kind of a job creation program. But that will take more than rhetoric; it will take courage and action, and today we need action to put in place industrial legislation that does more than merely fiddle around the fringes. While the work of Lindsay Fox and Bill Kelty in helping to fill positions under the Federal government's jobskill program is commendable, more has to be done in this country than merely talking about the problem and undertaking small programs. If Mr Kelty is really serious in his quest to help provide more jobs, why is he not addressing on behalf of the ACTU some of the other industrial relations reforms which have not. been addressed in the recent bill? The minister, in his second reading speech, said: Fundamental to the Labor approach are both nexibility and fairness. This bill incorporates both. It does so in a manner consistent with the Australall of our Ian tradition of a fair go. Already, under this government, Australia's industrial relations have been transformed. We have moved the system from the old adversarial model of 'them and us' to a far more cooperative approach, where all sides recognise the need for improved productivity and competitiveness. I do not know which rock the minister was hiding under, but that is not the story I get from the business community as I move about my electorate. This bill does nothing. As far as enterprise bargaining is concerned, it is a Clayton's bill which does nothing to bring the two sides together. Indeed, the bill will create more divisive situations.",62
114,Unknown,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,Sitting suspended from 6.34 to 8.00 p.m.,64
115,Ms MOYLAN,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner I was saying that, while this government fiddles with masses of legislation on various aspects of industrial relations, the real issues go unattended. In fact, my colleague Senator Crane raised this issue when he spoke to a Senate committee recently. He pointed out that there are now 11 separate acts on industrial relations, not to mention the numerous ILO provisions which additionally complicate industrial relations policy and, now, a clutch of miscellany in this Industrial Relations and other Legislation Amendment Bill. I want to quote the conclusion of the second reading speech given by the Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services (Senator MCMullan), who represents the Minister for Industrial Relations. He said:  effective framework for enterprise bargaining and build on the reforms of the last decade. By tailoring those reforms to the needs of 21st century Australian workplaces, it will give our firms the ability to compete with the best companies in the world, many of whom are located in the Asia-Pacific region, the region we have only recently begun to call our own. The Australian Business Council had something. to . say about that. In the Australian newspaper of 7 August 1993, an article entitled 'A Shock to the System' refers to the BeA report, which concluded in this vein: ""Despite refonns to the processes the structure of Australia's industrial relations system is much the same as it was a decade ago. The question this raises is whether the changes in policies and practices, notwithstanding the static nature of the system itself have been enough to underpin the development of truly international, competitive enterprises."" It's answer to this crucial question is no. a quarter of Australian enterprises rank.themselves on a par with the best of their competitors, while the typical Australian enterprise is operating at 70 per cent of best practice. The article finishes with these two paragraphs: In other words, the Government and the ACTU have tried to make the existing system, with its union monopoly underpinned by an extensive system of industrial awards work better . . . and have made the policy decision to shift from centralised wage fixation to enterprise bargaining within this system. They have left the old institutional structures in place, undennining the capacity of the system to deliver real refonn and leaving open the possibility of a return to the old system should the unions so decide. The unpalatable message for the Keating Government and its new Minister for Industrial Relations, Laurie Brereton, is that this old mould has to be decisively broken. Effective industrial relations refonn does not allow an each-way bet. I was also quite surprised by some of the articles on Mr Kelty's idea on industrial reform because I understand that he is on the board of the Reserve Bank Of Australia. In November of this year it put out a paper entitled 'Towards Full Employment' which was a submission to the committee on employment opportunities. It talked in quite a lot of depth about structural unemployment and the causes. On page 8 of that paper some of the things it lists are not being addressed in the industrial relations reform that we are seeing today. They include changes in industrial relations arrangements which make it more difficult for the unemployed to offer their services at a realistic wage rate; secondly, sustained real wage increases which exceed underlying productivity growth and so make it unprofitable to employ at the margin, such as wage rises which were masked by the superannuation legislation and which required the employers yet again to make the sacrifices; and, thirdly, large rises in labour oncosts such as workers compensation, payroll tax, training and other levies indexed to the payroll, which also add to the unit cost of employing labour. I conclude by challenging my parliamentary colleagues on both sides of the House-in At best fact, by challenging all Australians-to move beyond the cosy deals, the rhetoric, the public relations exercises and the grab for more and better at the expense of those among us who are unemployed. There are a lot of folk hurting in the community, and it is wrong. It is wrong because, for all the talk about economic slumps and difficult conditions in other countries, in this nation we have the ability, the opportunity and the will, but do Mr Kelty, Mr Ferguson, the Minister for Industrial Relations and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) have the courage to drop the political agenda and the self-interest to match their sentiments with their actions and bring about real change, create real jobs for those folk in Australia who have already waited too long to enjoy the fair go and the same opportunities as the rest of us enjoy?

116,Mr FREE,TRAINING GUARANTEE,"Lindsay-Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training) (8.08 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The training guarantee scheme was established by legislation introduced into this House on 18 May 1990, and it came into effect on 1 July 1990. It requires employers to spend a minimum amount on training. The scheme was .introduced as part of the government's policy over the last several years to develop the appropriate environment in which Australian industry can become more competitive internationally. A fundamental step in this process is the development of a highly skilled work force which can adapt quickly to major changes in the economy. The scheme is an additional mechanism to stimulate industry'S commitment to training. As the signs of economic recovery strengthen, we must be prepared for an increase in demand for skilled people. The training guarantee provides an important underpinning to achieve this skilled work force. This bill amends the principal act to give effect to two amendments promised by the government in the election context and also includes other amendments to minimise compliance costs and give greater flexibility to the scheme. In line with election commitments, the biII provides employers with enhanced flexibility to plan training expenditure over a longer period by allowing excess eligible expenditure incurred in one year to be carried forward to the next year. Although this excess expenditure cannot be carried forward indefinitely, it will assist those employers who have a need to train extensively within a short time frame, but whose training needs may not be so great in the following year. At the same time, and in keeping with the same principle, provision is made for employers who have a training expenditure shortfall in one year to make it up through additional training expenditure in the following year. This avoids hasty and unplanned expenditure simply to meet the minimum training requirement. The government also committed itself to remove the need for employers to deduCt training subsidies provided. by government bodies for apprentices and trainees when calculating their net eligible training expendito ture. To avoid anomalies, this pn;lVision includes any program with training subsidies. As a consequence of this amendment, the minimum allowable apprentice or trainee amount, or 'deemed amount' as it is also known, has been doubled to preserve the full incentives effect. It maintains tration for employers who choose to claim the minimum allowable apprentice or trainee amount. Subsequent to the introduction last year of clauses relating to work experience for students and teachers, it became apparent that full-time students 21 years and over were suffering discrimination. The bill removes this anomaly. The bill widens the range of entities which can group for the purposes of the act, thus giving organisations greater flexibility to maximise their training opportunities. It also specifies that businesses must be related at 30 June to form a group for that year and that a business cannot be a member of more than one group in a particular year. In order to avoid complications concerning responsibility for a shortfall or ownership of an excess, businesses which group will not have access to the carry forward provisions. To rectify confusion about who is able to design and approve an eligible training program, the bill simplifies these requirements. It specifies that the person or persons who design or approve the program must, between them, have a working knowledge of the subject area of the program and the skills necessary to design or conduct the relevant type of training program. The bill rectifies anomalies about the use of equipment for training by extending the concept of eligible training expenditure. It will now include rental, hire, lease or depreciation expenses on property or equipment for any part of the year during which the employer uses the property or equipment specifically for eligible training programs. Finally, the bill aligns the training guarantee legislation with a recent amendment to the Australian corporations and securities legislation relating to the appointment of an administrator for liquidation purposes. In summary, this bill encompasses a number of measures make the legislation more business-friendly, especially for the small business sector. These amendments offer significant benefits to business and their retrospectivity to 1 July 1993 will ensure their immediate USe on receiving assent. I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill. I commend the bill ease of administo the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Andrews) adjourned. NA BILL (No.4) 1993 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Free, and read a first time. Second Reading",65
117,Mr FREE,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Lindsay-Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training) (8.13 p.m.}'-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The bill will amend the taxation laws in a number of respects giving effect to a number of previous announcements, including some measures announced in the 1993-94 budget. It will also make a number of amendments which have not previously been announced. NA Employees employed in foreign locations Under the existing fringe benefits tax law, a benefit provided by an employer to employees working in certain foreign locations in respect of travel from their workplace to obtain suitable medical treatment ma.y be exempt from fringe benefits tax. Th.ese foreign locations were to be prescribed by regulation but because of various practical difficulties this requirement is to be removed. The effect will be that, subject to certain conditions, the fringe benefits tax exemption will apply in respect of any employee working outside of Australia where there is no ,suitable medical treatment available at the place where the work is carried out. For the period prior to the amendment, transitional provisions will ensure that the exemption will continue to apply'as originally intended. The impact on revenue of this measure is negligible. Car parking benefits Under the existing fringe benefits tax law, the taxable value of a car parking benefit can be determined by reference to the lowest fee for all-day parking charged by any commercial parking station operator within a one kilometre radius of the car parking facilities provided by an employer. As a result of the wording of the defined terms 'all-day parking' and 'commercial parking station', employers can use night fees charged by commercial parking station operators and fees charged at kerbside parking meters to value car parking benefits. The use of these fees result in a lower taxable value for car parking benefits which does not renect the value of the benefit provided. Also, car parking provided by employers in non-CBD areas may be subject to fringe benefits tax where there are kerbside parking meters within one kilometre of the. parking facility. The bill will amend these definitions so that the taxable value of a car parking benefit determined under this method can only be determined by reference to day-time rates and kerbs ide parking meters are excluded. from being commercial parking stations. The amendments in this bill will prevent an unintended loss to revenue. Non-government schools From 1 April 1994 fringe benefits tax will be levied on the tax inclusive value of a fringe benefit and any fringe benefits tax payable will become deductible for income tax purposes. This method, known as the 'grossing up' method, will ensure that broadly the same amount of tax is paid on fringe benefits as on the wages that would be required, after payment of income tax, to purchase those benefits. A tax rebate of 48 per cent of the fringe benefits tax payable under the grossing up method. is available for certain non-profit, non-government organisations known as rebatable employers. Certain non-profit, nongovernment schools have inadvertently not been listed as rebatable employers. These are non-government schools established under Commonwealth, state or territory legislation. This bill will amend the fringe benefits legislation so that these schools will be listed as rebatable employers. The impact on revenue resulting from this measure will be negligible. NA Tax-exempt infrastructure borrowings The bill will give effect to the budget announcement to allow tax-exempt infrastructure borrowings to be used to finance interest falling due on such borrowings during the construction phase of a new road transport, seaport or electricity generating facility. The estimated, cost to the revenue of allowing interest. on infrastructure borrowings to be an eligible spending purpose is $3 million in 1993-94, $10 million in 1994-95 and $30 million in eac- of the 1994-95 and 1996-97 years. A second amendment for infrastructure borrowings will extend the scope of such borrowings to infrastructure facilities constructed on any crown lease of land. At present, only facilities constructed on land held under statutory crown leases are eligible. Tax-exempt infrastructure borrowings will be able to be used to finance the construction of road transport, seaport or electricitygenerating facilities on land held under a crown lease granted under a commercial contract by the Commonwealth, a state or a territory, or a tax-exempt authority of the Commonwealth, a state or a territory. Both parties must intend the lease to continue for at least 25 years the facility becomes income producing. This measure will make infrastructure borrowings available where it is appropriate to negotiate crown leases of the land on which the facility is to be constructed. This amendment will have no effect on revenue. Pensions and annuity rebates The bill proposes to amend the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to extend the rebate that applies to superannuation pensions and rollover annuities paid from a taxed source. The rebate will apply to pensions and annuities that are purchased by rolling over an eligible termination payment arising from the commutation of a deferred annuity or from the commutation of a pension from an untaxed superannuation fund. The amendments will overcome some technical deficiencies in the existing law and ensure that the pension and annuity rebate provisions operate as intended. They will apply to superannuation pensions and rollover annuities which first commenced to be paid on or after 1 July 1988 and are not expected to have any significant impact on the revenue. Leases of luxury cars This bill will amend the taxation legislation to ensure that lessors of lUXUry cars cannot use the 'finance method' of returning the lease income to avoid the luxury car depreciation limits .. The use of the finance method effectively excludes from the lessor's assessable income part of the cost of the car. That part is the difference between the cost of the car and the residual value, which is treated as if it were the' principal being repaid by the lease instalments. Where the car costs more than the depreciation limit, the share of the excess proportionate to the share of the car's cost which the finance method excludes from income must be added to the lessor's income. This bill will include that share of the excess in the lessor's assessable income evenly over the period of the lease. These amendments were announced on 8 July 1993 and will apply from that date. The after annual revenue at risk is $60 million. , Exemptions for pensions and allowances The amendments will exempt from income tax bereavement payments made under the Social Security Act 1991 in relation to certain entitlements to pension, allowance and benefit. The amendments will also provide for income tax treatment of basic and supplementary payments in regard to mature age allowance and mature age partner allowance similar to that for age pension and wife pension respectively. The nature of the bereavement payments is such that it is n<?t possible to make a reliable estimate of the cost to revenue of the relevant amendmentS. The revenue cost of the mature age allowance and . mature age partner allowance amendments is estimated to be $5 million in each income year 1994-95, 1995-96 and 1996-97. Payment of instalments by companies and certain trustees . ' In the autumn sittings this year amendments were made to the income tax law to reintroduce quarterly payments of company ,tax, which will commence from the 1994-95 year of income. Under the new arrangements, the timing and amount of instalments due depends on the amount of a company's estimated tax for the payment year. More concessional treatment is available for smaller instalment taxpayers. In announcing the new arrangements in t-e Investing in the Nation statement of 9 Februa- revenue. ry 1993, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) stated that special rules would be introduced to prevent companies within large company groups taking advantage of the more generous payment arrangements for smaller companies. Broadly, all companies within a group that has combined estimated tax exceeding $300,000 will be required to pay tax according to the rules for large companies for that year. However, companies with estimated tax of less than $8,000-that is, a small company-will not be covered by this requirement. This bill implements these measures. The grouping provisions will only take effect once the new instalment arrangements are fully implemented, that is, the 1995-96 year of income. This bill will also amend the penalty provithe sion of the new company tax instalment arrangements to ensure that the penalty for an underestimation of a company's tax for the payment year will apply as intended where a second estimate is lodged by the company. This bill will also make some minor technical amendments to the company tax instalment arrangements. These measures will have no effect on the original estimates provided for the new company tax instalment arrangements. Penalties for over-franking dividends The bill will correct a deficiency in the application of the penalty for deliberate overfranking of dividends under the imputation system. The imputation system provides for a penalty, franking additional tax, where a company deliberately overfranks a dividend and this event gives rise to a deficit in a franking account of the· company at the end of its franking year. . The proposed amendments will ensure franking additional tax can be applied, as always intended, where an initial payment of company tax reduces the franking deficit tax otherwise payable in respect of the franking account deficit. The amendments will apply to companies that deliberately overfrank a dividend after 14 December 1993, the date of introduction of this bill. The proposed amendments will have an insignificant impact on Heritage conservation rebate The bill also gives effect to the measure announced in the 1993-94 budget to provide a rebate of 20c in the dollar for expenditure on approved heritage conservation works of at least $10,000 on historic buildings and structures listed on Commonwealth, state and territory statutory heritage registers. The scheme, which will be administered by the Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services, will consist of a two-stage approval process. The first stage will be an application for a provisional certificate, which will constitute approval to proceed with the proposed work and will specify a limit on the amount of expenditure that will qualify for the rebate. Any expenditure incurred on the work before provisional certificate is issued will not be rebatable. Except where a taxpayer disposes of the property or dies, the taxpayer will have two years, with a possible extension of three months, in which to complete the work. The total amount for which provisional certificates may be issued in a financial year will be limited to $9.5 million. Accordingly, selection for admission to the scheme is expected to be highly competitive. The second stage will be the issue of a final certificate. An application for a final certificate can be made on completion of the work to the approved standard, at a cost of at least $10,000. A final certificate must be applied for before the provisional certificate expires. The issue of the final certificate will result in the taxpayer being entitled to the rebate in the tax assessment for the year of income in which the application for the final certificate was made. The revenue cost of the rebate scheme will be limited to $2 million for each financial year. Savings banks This bill will repeal the current exemption from income tax provided for savings banks conducted exclusively for the benefit of depositors. This exemption is no longer relevant since integration of savings bank activity into trading bank business under the Bank Integration Act 1991. A corresponding exemption from withholding tax for certain non-resident savings banks will also be repealed. These changes are not expected to have any revenue impact. Exclusion of low income rebate from provision'al tax arrangements The recently enacted budget legislation provided for Ii low income rebate of up to $150 to taxpayers whose taxable income for the 1993-94 and subsequent, ipcome years is less than $24,450. The budget statement announced that the rebate would be provided on assessment, the intention being that PAYE and provisional taxpayers wi11 benefit from the rebate in a similar manner. The amendments in this bill supplement the provisions which introduced the rebate by ensuring entitlement to the rebate will not be available through the provisional tax arrangements. This measure will maintain the original revenue costs for the rebate and avoid a oneoff cost increase, in the order of $110 mi11ion, to the estimated cost of $530 mi11ion for 1994-95. Superannuation Guarantee amendments The bill makes several amendments to the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 to address a ,number of technical concerns and to clarify certain aspects of the legislation. The requirement for quarterly superannuation contributions will be deferred until the 1994-95 year. Consequently, employers could contribute ,the minimum level of superannuation support prescribed for their employees for the 1993-94 year on or before 28 July 1994. From 1 July 1993 superannuation guarantee contributions wi11 not be payable on lump sum payments for accrued annual leave, accrued long service leave and accrued sick leave made on termination of employment. Certain statutory authorities will be brought within the scope of the superannuation guarantee, scheme with effect from 1 July 1993. The industrial agreement between an employer in the maritime industry and the Maritime Uni,on of Australia will be recognised a- a valid industrial award for superannuation guarantee purposes'. ' The bill will also make II number of other amendments to facilitate the smooth operation of the superannuation guarantee scheme. The ', proposed amendments will have no effect on the revenue. I 'present the explanatory memorandum which contains more detailed explanations of the provisions of the bill. I commend the bill to the House. I Debate (on motion bY, Mr Howard) adjourned.

118,Mr HOWARD,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I move: Pages 14-18, omit Part 7 (comprising clauses 45 to 54). This amendment which has been circulated in my name seeks to delete in its entirety the whole of part 7, which comprises clauses 45 to '54. The reasons for this amendment were explained amply and cogently by my colleague and learned friend the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Tangney (-1rWilliams), who pointed out the severe disability which could be imposed upon many working men and women in this country if the proposals in those particular sections comprising part 7 were carried forward. It contained the rather extraordinary proposition that, if it were deemed that some overpayment of an entitlement had been made, the mere service of a notice on the superannuation fund would give rise to a liability for repayment. That seems to us-and I would have thought to the government as well-to have, surely been an oversight. Surely this pro-worker government could not be so arbitrary and high handed about the rights and entitlements of Australian workers. I would be completely astonished if it were. I would naturally welcome any explanation that might be forthcoming from the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton). The honourable member for Tangney did go into this at some length and put a very cogent case during the second reading debate. Before I sit down, I direct-as I understand I am at liberty to do as we are dealing with the bill as a whole-some remarks to part 2 of the act. I have no particular objection to the word 'president' and as such we will not be dividing on these rather tedious amendments that the politically correct in our society think necessary. But I take the opportunity of recording my concern with what can only be called a formof verbal fundamentalism or verbal fanaticism which has crept into our community. Nobody has any objection to the removal from statutes of words that are clearly offensive to either men or women, but to take an axe to an ancient and beautiful language in the name of political correctness is something that I find deeply offensive. The way in which we are filling our language and cluttering our official pronouncements. with inelegant, ungracious, meaningless utterances is something that concerns a lot of people. Every time an objection is made to something like this, the official defence is, 'Oh well, you can't really be worried about this little change'. But all the little changes add up to a big change. A lot of people find this absurd. There are a lot of women who are not the least bit offended by the use of words like 'chairman'. There are many men and women who find expressions like 'chairperson' almost verging on the vulgarMr Costello-Convoluted.",70

120,Mr HOWARD,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Yes, un-Australian. As someone who has a deep affection for the English language-and I know there are many' on the other side of the chamber who have an equally deep affection for the English language-I find this trampling on the forms and the grace and the elegance of the language something to be lamented. But it is typical of the way in which the upper reaches of this government, its bureaucracy, the academia and indeed many sections of the media in this country have been captured, and the com. manding heights of those sections of our society have been captured by people for whom I think the expression 'politically correct' is too kind. I think they are fanatics. Fanatics are dangerous. Political fanatics are dangerous; language fanatics are dangerous. People who search the highways and byways of books and statutes in our English language to find words that do'not conform with their rather bigoted view of what our language ought to be are a menace in our society. Fanaticism is something that is repugnant to most Australians. Fanaticism is not only represented by jackboots; it is also represented by people who go racing around telling other people what they can say, what they can think, what they can beli-ve, and what they are allowed to do. Albeit this particular amendment is only a very minor form of that fanaticism, it is nonetheless an outcrop of a broader and deeper disease, and I think it is a form of fanaticism and verbal fundamentalism that ought not to go unremarked.

121,Mr HOWARD,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Or were given the freedom. We have reached dizzy heights. According to the Speaker of this parliament we no longer make maiden speeches; we make first speeches. If that is not a form of ridiculous fundamentalism and fanaticism, I cannot think of a better one. I notice that there are some moves to change some names of towns in Queensland. I suppose, if a name of a town gave particular grief and offence to a section of the community, one might understand it. I legislation. acknowledge that. I would not be surprised if that is not the end of it. We will have some other clown coming along and naming the New England Highway the New Multicultural Highway. Mark my words, we will get some as verbal fanatic who will come along and want to do that. Mr Costello-I find the name Collingwood offensive.",71
122,Mr HOWARD,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,Collingwood? Mr Costello-Yes. What would you do about that?,72
123,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT, these Order! I think we will have one person speaking at a time.,72
124,Mr CHARLES,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I . take this opportunity to say firstly that disappointed that the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) is not here. I support the amendment to the Industrial Relations Other Legislation Amendment Bill that has been moved by the shadow minister for industrial relations, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). It is an importlonger ant amendment. The shadow Attorney-Genermy al, the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams), spoke at some length earlier in the debate regarding the amendment that we have put forward. Unfortunately, as is usual with this pig-headed, obstinate, insensitive governcan ment led by a Prime Minister (Mr Keating)who is not known throughout the length and breadth of the land, nor might I say overseas, for being reticent in his use of the English language-the minister is not here to take account of this amendment that forward. Mr Costello-He would not understand opposition's what it is.",72
125,Mr CHARLES,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"It is very complex, I must admit, relating to Comcare and superannuaindustrial tion. If people receive a benefit that they expected for some time and then find that department has made a mistake and that Treasury would like to have a refund, instead of the refund being taken from the employee who has received the overpayment it is to come from the superannuation fund. Honest to goodness, I get lost in superannuation That brings me to the amount of legislation that comes before this place. As I said earlier, we did a count today. From 1983 when Mr Hawke-I think that was his name-took over Prime Minister, until the end of 1992, there have been some 10,700 pages of legislation. This bill adds some more pages to itrubbishy sorts of pages, useless pages. Mr Costello-Is it improving industrial relations?",72
126,Mr CHARLES,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I do not know what it has improved. That is the problem. We have all statutes and on top of these statutes we have regulations. I should get someone to do a count of the pages of regulations. There are therapeutic goods regulations, road safety regulations and regulations governing superI am annuation. Then there are the regulations produced by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. I do not know about the and minister, but I can tell honourable members that the people I talk to tell me that superannuation has become so complex that there is no-one who understands it all. We can no go to someone and say, 'Hey, this is situation. This is how much I. earn and how much I have put into this superannuation pot. This is what I would like to do. This is my age and my situation in life. Please tell me what the regulations say I can do'. No-one give an answer. Someone would have to go away and research the thousands of pages that make up the superannuation rules and regulations. By the time the answer had been found, the chance is that the legislation would probably have changed. This legislation will we have put change it as well. At the moment we are debating the amendment to omit part 7 so that we do not further disadvantage employees. Employees are a very important part of the equation in this nation-if I might had say so, a critically important part. Without the employees-without the people who actually do the work, make the goods and provide the services-we have no businesses; we have no productive enterprises. We have lots of employees in the Commonwealth Public Service. Off the top of my head, I think we have about 160,000 employees. A big point has been made that' the Hawke Labor government created 500,000 jobs-half a million jobs-in the mid-1980s. Do honourable members know how they were created? They were created in the public sector. They were not in the private sector; they were created in the public sector. The actual real increase in the number of jobs over and above the population increase was created in the public sector. Anyone who has read the budget papers would know that everybody had to take a cut: The states took a cut. Programs took a cut. But who got an increase? It was the Commonwealth Public Service-you bet, every time. That is because we in this place do not believe-because we are led by a government and told that we cannot believe that government has to be responsible and that when times are tough a government has to take the hard option and look at its own spending. Oh no, not this government. This government believes in producing page after page of legislation to become statute and add to regulation. Industry is being decimated. To administer the superannuation guarantee levy has become so complex that company after company says that its on-costs are 10, 15 or 20 per cent higher than they should be. In fact, there are companies that say that their costs to adminiscalled ter the superannuation guarantee levy are greater than the money they put into it which might advantage their employees some day. How much' do their employees contribute? Nothing. They do not contribute because the government's rules say, simply put, that employers must contribute tow\lrds superannuation for their employees. But, if the employees themselves put money into superannuation, there is no tax benefit-none at So what advantage is there to an employee to take after-tax income and put it into superannuation to save for a rainy day? An employee would be better off putting it in the bank, buying real estate or putting it in the stock market. This legislation deals with a wholehotchpotch of more rules and regulations. Two parts of this bill deal with changing language. Essentially, the bill says that we cannot call people chairmen; we have to call them presidents. Well, that is for vertically marginalised people. If we are not vertically marginalised, perhaps we can be a chairman. I object, Mr Truss",72
127,Mr HOWARD,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,Mr Chairman.,73
128,Mr CHARLES,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Mr Chairman, Mr Truss,  at a committee and should be called the chairman and someone calls me a chair. I object to that because I am not some bloody inanimate object. It is a fact; I am not. I am not a chairwoman either. Perhaps I am silly but, to my mind, chairman is a gender neutral expression. It describes the job, the function to be done. Mr Nugent-You can be a chairperson.",73
129,Mr CHARLES,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I do not like 'persons' either, quite frankly. The honourable member for Aston should sit down. If he wants to interject, he should say something sensible. I am not into this person business. Personsgeez! Honest to goodness, there is no warmth, colour or drama any more, is there? This is 1984 revisited-Orwell. Fair dinkum, it is 1984 all on. This is the era of the vertically marginalised person. In fact we no longer say that people have disabilities; do we? I forget what they are now but they went from being called handicapped, to disabled, to now being partially functionally able, whatever that means. So it 'is all a nonsense, a bit of a joke. It would be funny except that it means more statute and more regulation taking up more time of this House when we ought to be debating sensible, important issues which the nation should address. (TIme expired)",73
130,Mr FREE,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Lindsay-Minister for Schools, all. Vocational Education and Training) (8.48 p.m.)-:-I thank the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) and the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) for their contributions. I must say that I share many of the views expressed by both about the cumbersome consequences of using politically correct language. I would be happy to join with them in a crusade. against linguistic terrorism. But I suggest that it probaply requires an occasion other than debate on the Industrial Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill, and requires a general assessment of style and new instructions to parliamentary draftsmen. The opposition has proposed that part 7 of the bill be amended. Let me explain briefly why the government cannot accept the opposition's amendment. The bill introduces a mechanism to facilitate the recovery by Comcare of overpayments of compensation to retirees from administrators of superannuation funds, but only for money that falls due for payment to the relevant retired employee. Com care is required under the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act to recover overpayments. Under the present arrangement, when a recipient of compensation receives an overpayment, Comcare is required to seek to recover money from individuals. The current mechanism is inappropriate and can cause hardship to employees for a number of reasons. Firstly, repayment from an individual's own savings may cause hardship, particularly when the overpayment is a large one. Secondly, the existing mechanism involves a process which may be drawn out and expensive. In this regard, following negotiations between Com care and the employee, if an overpayment has not been recovered, the debt may need to be pursued through the courts. Thirdly, where the amount of an overpayment is relatively small, recovery action may not, for various reasons, be cost effective for Comcare and the relevant sum of money may therefore have to be written off. In summary, the current regime is inconvenient and potentially expensive, both for individuals and Com care. In the course of this debate, the opposition has raised several concerns about the operation of part 7. These concerns can be summarised as follows: the new part 7 operates inequitably and jeopardise an individual's superannuation entitlements. In that regard, the opposition has indicated a concern that the amendments allow Com care to issue a notice to a superannuation administrator if it considered that it had made,or may have made, an overpayment of compensation. This is essential for the operation of the recovery mechanism because it is not possible for Comcare to determine the extent of the overpayment, 9r whether in. fact there is an overpayment that can be recovered under this scheme, until it has been advised of the retiree-ssuperannuation entitlement and. his or her election as to the way in which that entitlement will be paid. The opposition also alleged that the amendments allowed Com care to effectively freeze an employee's superannuation entitlement. This is not correct. The following safeguards have been included in the scheme to protect the rights and income of retirees affected by its operation. If superannuation payments have commenced, the proposed recovery mechanism will not operate. This protects the retiree's income stream. Comcare and licensed authorities will be required to continue paying full compensation until the relevant superannuation fund administrator has been informed of the exact amount of the overpayment. When compensation payments are reduced, the relevant administrator will be in a position to commence superannuation payments, thus ensuring a regular income for the retired employee. There may be a short periodenvisaged to be not more than two to four weeks-when the retired employee may not receive the full amount of superannuation if the arrears of superannuation are insufficient to cover the overpaid compensation in full. During that period, the balance of overpayment will be deducted from superannuation payments until the overpayment has been repaid in full. Com care 's determination. of the amount of the overpayment is reviewable. ·An individual may seek the review of Comcare's determination through the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. It should also be noted that this type of scheme is not unprecedented in Commonwealth legislation. Sections 1172 to 1176 of the Social Security Act 1991 provide for a 'similar scheme to that proposed in part 7 of the bill. The Social Security Act provisions allow the Commonwealth to recover social security overpayments directly from another Katter, R.

NA NA AMENDMENT BILL (No.3) 1993 Second Reading Debate resumed from 25 November, on motion by Mr Tickner: That the bill be now read a second time.",73
131,Mr NUGENT,ISLANDER COMMISSION,"The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill (No.3) 1993 is a fairly weighty tome, as can be seen from the bill itself. This is the third and final set of amendments this year to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act 1989. Most of those amendments have in fact been picked up by the government from the coalition's proposals that it took to the last election. This bill proposes amendments in four particular areas: firstly, to establish the Strait Regional Authority; secondly, to devolve some financial functions to regional councils; thirdly, to establish an electoral review panel; and, fourthly, to strengthen the role of the Office of Evaluation and Audit within the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission and bodies which it in turn funds. I will talk a little about each of those areas. Then I will talk a little about the elections that have recently taken place as part of this amendment bill. The Torres Strait Regional Authority will be established as a body corporate and will operate in much the same way as ATSIC itself but will be independent of it. Hopefully, the authority will eliminate many of the current areas of duplication between the Torres Strait Island Coordinating. Council and ATSIC. The elimination of that duplication of course is welcomed by members of the coalition. However, whilst we recognise the good sense in rationalising multiple government inputs into the Torres Strait-when I was there some months ago we counted some 37 different government departments, federal and state, that function into those islands of a few thousand people-we want to make it clear that our support for those measures does not reflect support for independence. We are talking about some local self-management measures. Our support is not for independence or separate sovereignty. That concern has certainly been raised in that part of the world. When the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), a number of others-including my colleague the honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan), who is at the table-and I were in the Torres Strait some months ago, we met with the elected leaders of the island community. They made it very clear and specifically said to us that, whilst they are looking for a large measure of some selfmanagement in a whole range of areas, they did notwant to separate from Australia. They were not looking for separate sovereignty. There are some concerns in this area. When this bill first went through the Senate before it came to this place, some of my Senate colleagues noted some of those concerns. One is that we do not believe that we can be Torres talking about any treaties. That has been mentioned in the context that, under international law, that is not appropriate. But, certainly, we might well look at some form of a document and that of course is a task for the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. We want to make it clear that, in terms of looking at some greater local autonomy for the area, Australia's security and international arrangements are critical. These must be held to the national government. Other Queenslanders are living on the Torres Strait Islands as well as the Torres Strait Islanders themselves. Their representation in any future models must also be taken into account. We have had some concerns about the fact that the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) indicated to Islanders that self-government by the year 2001 is an option- But the Queensland government has not supported this, so one has to ask whether it is fair to raise expectations when there is not even agreement between the two Labor governments. My colleague Senator Boswell, in - he Senate, quoted the Minister for .Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs-}Vhen this bill went through that place recently-as saying that self-government by 2001 was highly likely, provided Torres Strait residents established a uniform goal. Given tharthe minister is saying that sort of thing-which certainly is not proposed in this legislation-and is raising expectations, it is fair to ask how far the Queensland and the federal governments are prepared to go. It is time they came clean and told us where things stand. There have been suggestions that the Torres Strait might adopt a form of constitution based on the Norfolk Island model, or even the Cook Islands model, in its relationship with New Zealand. Senator Collins /iaid in the other place during debate on this bill that the establishment of the Torres Strait regional authority should not be confused with any form of self government for Torres Strait Islanders as the government 'does not have a position on that at this time' and has not taken a policy position on the Torres Strait Islands. So we are getting conflicting signals from the government. Although Senator Collins said that he has no conflict with the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, who was merely expressing a hope, I believe it would be appropriate for the minister to confirm that the government has no policy for self-government or independence for the Torres Strait. Mr Dodd-What about self-determination?",76
132,Mr NUGENT,ISLANDER COMMISSION,"I will come to that. The honourable member should be patient and not worry; he will get his turn. Let us have a sensible, rational debate instead of all the barracking and usual diatribe we get from that end of the woods. Let us talk a bit about the devolution of powers to the regional councils. This bill strengthens reporting arrangements and accountability requirements for the regional councils. It provides them with increased funding responsibilities, with wider powers to approve funds arid issue guarantees. These powers may also be suspended if deemed necessary by the ATSIC chairperson. Regional councils will now be required to provide draft budgets which are tied to a regional plan for their region. ATSIC will have the power to remove regional councillors who fail to perform functions or comply with budget or reporting requirements. The devolution of power to regional councils means, as this is now being taken away from the central Canberra bureaucracy-certainly a direction that we would support-that we should be able to cut back on the size of some of that cel)tral bureaucracy. We should ensure that the money thus saved is put towards tangible projects to improve the welfare of indigenous people. We welcome those moves and also the moves in the bill which strengthen the power of ATSIC to. deal with people who do not perform satisfactorily. This is essential in any organisation, regardless of its size, so it can achieve peak performance and optimum accountability.. It is important to remember that a crucial aspect of self-management, resting with regional councils, lies with their function of allocating funding. Perhaps it is testimony to their success in that role, and their willingness to take some of the hard decisions, that a large number of complaints-which certainly come into my office about ATSIC-are from those who fail to convince their regional councils of their need for funding. In other words, the councils do not just distribute money. willy-nilly or with gay abardon; they take their job very seriously. They are to be commended for that. An important aspect is the streamlining of ATSIC, after its first three years, by reducing it from 60 to 35 regional councils. To achieve high standards of administrative excellence, it is necessary to have measures to allow for the removal of regional councils which fail to comply with their responsibilities. I certainly agree with Senator Kernot in the other place who said, when this bill was being debated, that self-determination-I would use the word 'self-management' - should be seen as a non-controversial statement of Aboriginal people seeking maximum community independence whilst remaining part of the nation state. ATSIC now proceeds to the next important stage of its development-and hopefully its consolidation. Now I would like to talk about the Office of Evaluation and Audit. The provisions in this bill are in addition to· the functions already conferred on the Auditor-General. So we are not talking about replacing the Auditor-General but about additional functions. The bill will significantly expand the Office of Evaluation and Audit to include regular audit and evaluation of ATSIC, Aboriginal Hostels Ltd, the Commercial Development Corporation and the Torres Strait Regional Authority. It also provides the mechanism to allow the minister or ATSIC to request the evaluation and audit of particular aspects of the operation of regional councils, any individual, body corporate or unincorporated body receiving one or more grants or loans from ATSIC-or any borrowers whose loans have been guaranteed by ATSIC. It would be the coalition's intention in government to review where the Office of Evaluation and Audit is situated within the structure of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs-whether it wbuld be more appropriate in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, where ,the minister is, with the Auditor-General or somewhere else. The object of such a move would be to make sure the body was even more independent than it is now. We moved amendments in' the Senate, which were' defeated, to require that the auditing and evaluation process be more extensive than it is. That was defeated. We will not reintroduce that amendment in this place because we do not have the numbers. But we would have preferred to have seen more responsibility for more extensive auditing and evaluation than is in the bill. We are pleased that the government has finally moved-I suggest it is a response to pressure' from us-to require organisations receiving funding from ATSIC to be publicly accountable for those funds. I make the point that there are other areas in which Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations, on behalf of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, are receiving funds through other mechanisms which are not touched by this legislation. Therefore, they are not subject to the scrutiny that we are talking about We would like to see the same standard of scrutiny applied to those outside the ATSIC funding umbrella. A prime example of the need for this has been placed before us today with the tabling of the Auditor-General's efficiency report No. 20 into the Northern Land Council. I will mention briefly some of the key points from that report because they are illustrative of why we need to look at organisations outside ATSIC's control, as well as those directly under it. I will indicate some of the key findings. Under the heading - Administration of Royalty Trust Accounts', it says: Practices did not comply with the provisions of the ALR Act in several respects. Under - Advances to Council Members and Chairman', it says: Advances of the type undertaken are not accepted in other Commonwealth authorities and contravenes a resolution of the Full Council. It results in additional administrative costs and the write off of uncollectable advances. It talks about: Flexible remuneration packages involving significant fringe benefits for certain senior... staff were implemented without the required approval. It goes on: Controls over the selection and management of consultants provided insufficient assurance that value for money and accepted public contracting practices were pursued. It also says: Inadequacies were found in the application of expenditure control procedures. Further: Excess administrative funds were distributed against the express wishes of the Minister and have contributed to a significant reduction in Aboriginals Benefit Trust Account funds. We are not talking about small amounts but literally millions of dollars. I understand that in terms of some of the investments, motor vehicle activity, air fare activity and various other areas, management and administration have been appalling. The new director of the NLC has undertaken to put things right. The NLC has accepted something like 49 of the 52 recommendations made by the Auditor General. I can say categorically that he will have our full support in putting those correc,tive measures in placeI ask the minister: what is he 'going to do about those wh9 transgressed over an extendedperiod, some of whom are still very much on the federal payroll? In view of this type of example, I urge the minister to give the Office of Evaluation and Audit power to look at all Aboriginal organisations. The need for this is amply illustrated in the report. We are all concerned that taxpayers' money does not necessarily hit the mark in this very important area. We have talked many times in this place and elsewhere about the severe disadvantage in the Aboriginal community and the need to improve the well-being of our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. No amount of accounting for funds can ensure proper management. The principle of the Office of Evaluation and Audit is not only audit but also evaluation. We are looking for value for money and common sense spending. The problem has as much to do with policy direction within ATSIC as it has with bean counting, and it is the minister's ultimate responsibility to do something about it. Let me give the House a simple example of what I mean. In the last seven or eight months, I have travelled to probably 70 or -80 Aboriginal communities through the length and breadth of this country. I visited a Gommunity of about 400 in the Pitjantjatjara lands in South Australia. The old community store had literally falltin over-it was rotten, rat infested and obviously needing replacement. ATSIC spent something like $750,000 providing a much needed new store. The problem was that the new store, half of which stood empty, was twice if not three times the size needed and could have serviced a population of 4,000 let alone 400. Yet, 100 yards down the road, the antiquated, health centre could have done with some money being spent on it. If a sensible decision had been made so that we had a new store of a sensible size, we could well have saved enough money to put some valuable resources into the health centre. We simply have to find a better way of looking at the way the money is spent. I tum now to the electoral review panel. The purpose of this clause of the bill is to review electoral boundaries, the grouping of the regions and wards within the boundaries and the electoral system generally, and to then report to the minister. There have been criticisms to the effect that the arrangements for the elections for ATSIC held last Saturday were carried out' too hastily and without adequate consultation, particularly in relation to the planned system of wards. The coalition is in favour of the establishment of an electoral review panel so that there will be time for consultation and proper planning prior to the next set of elections. We welcome' the record number of nominations for the elections, and we acknowledge that many candidates who had previously been non-supportive of ATSIC have now decided to have a go. There has been an increased ntimber of enrolments. Interestingly, 400 more candidates stood this time than for the 1990 election. Of the 2,001 nominations, 700, or 35 per cent, were women candidates. In the federal election, it was only 25 per cent, so in that sense women are doing better in the Aboriginal community than they are in the broader community. However, voter turnout was disappointingbarely up one per cent overall, although it was variable across the country. If we cannot get support for that elective process, we must ask ourselves whether ATSIC is the correct structure for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. No improvement in three years is chastening. After six years, we should be expecting a better voter turnout and demonstrable results and programs on the ground. If we are not seeing those things, we will have to seriously question whether we have the right structure and whether it will ever work. It seems that many of the people involved in what is sometimes called the - Aboriginal industry' - people in the bureaucracy, the lobby groups and so on-are obviously locked into standing for election, but they are not necessarily reflective of the broader community because the broader community is not voting in large numbers. As I have gone around the communities, it seems that the broad numbers in those communities are much more concerned with fundamental issues of day-today survival. I am concerned about whether ATSIC is the appropriate structure for the majority of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Particularly in recent times, it seems that that body has been giving more open partisan support to the government and that a number of Aboriginal leaders have increasingly been talking about treaties and sovereignty, when those communities I mentioned are really talking about health, housing, education and jobs for their children. I called into voting places during the elections. At one place I introduced myself to one of the officials from the Electoral Commission who called herself a 'liaison officer'. When I asked her what her job was, her lack of training and understanding of what was required were quite apparent. I was worried that the election was not conducted properly. There are concerns about whether all the votes were properly recorded in some places. We will have to give much more care to that area in the future. Another area of concern is the delay in counting the vote. In many areas this will take weeks and, in some cases, months. Frankly, although some of those electorates are very remote and dispersed, it is· beyond my comprehension why counting should take months. ATSIC has contributed $4 million to the Electoral Commission to· run that election. Even if everybody who is eligible voted,· the number of actual voters is still only the equivalent of three federal electorates however dispersed. If we talk about the number of people who actually voted it would represent only one federal electorate. As we all know in this place, those votes can be counted in one night. Even in dispersed electorates the votes can be counted in a . lot less time than several months. So, for the sake of Aboriginal people themselves, we must do better in future. I turn now to the amendments made to this bill by the government and the Australian Democrats in the Senate. In the previous amendment bill No.2, we amended the number of commissioners of ATSIC from the present appointed chairperson, two other appointed commissioners and 17 elected commissioners to two appointed and 17 elected, from which the minister would appoint the chair. The Democrats abandoned their principle on that particular matter-they voted with us on the last occasion. They have changed their mind, presumably under pressure, and voted with the government, so that we now have an amendment which means we only have 17 elected members, with the chairperson being elected from those 17. And, because the chairperson is required to come and live in Canberra, it means that one of those regions will effectively be left unrepresented. The reasons for the original amendment are still valid-we are only talking about a couple of months ago, for goodness sake-and I must record the coalition's disappointment at the Democrats' lack of resolve and consistency. I now turn to the other amendment made in the Senate, which inserts a preamble of six paragraphs. I agree with much that is there. Amongst other things, it talks about the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people being the original inhabitants; the desire of Australian people to rectify the problems of the past; making sure there is a maximum participation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the formulation and implementation of policies. Nobody would support that more than the coalition. The preamble also talks about the need to improve economic status, promote social well-being and improve the provision of community services. Certainly, that would be consistent with trying to break the welfare mentality, and we would be supportive of that. However, I urge caution with respect to the final paragraph introduced, where it talks about the Australian government acting to protect the rights of Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders by recognising international standards, and what follows in that vein. The principle of that paragraph is fine but, as expressed, it needs some caution lest we are seen to be ceding some of our national sovereignty, which indeed would be dangerous ground. The coalition will not oppose this legislaestablishing tion. We are disappointed that the government would. not deal with us on the amendments we put forward. The government indicated its preparedness to discuss amendments and we put them forward, but there was no discusStrait sion---:they were rejected willy-nilly. It seems that that is becoming a trend on the part of the minister and his government. This is not the first time that we have gone to this minister and sought a bipartisan approach-an approach which he frequently espouses-only to be rejected. We seem to be establishing something of a pattern. But we certainly welcome the measures in the bill relating to the Office of Evaluation and Audit, the devolution of responsibility to regional councils, increased accountability, the establishment of the electoral review panelundoubtedly, there is room for substantial improvements in that area-and the establishment of the Torres Strait Regional Authority. We are concerned about the government's inability to control problems in non-ATSIC funded organisations, such as the NLC, for the sorts of reasons that I talked about earlier. We register our cautious attitude to the final part of that preamble and object to the ges affecting the make-up of the commission and the appointment of the chairperson. My final message is that we will be watchTorres ing to see whether these measures actually make a difference in improving the health, prosperity and quality of life of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. If not, we will Act. certainly seek changes-because that is the bottom line of what this legislation should about.",77
133,Mr DODD,ISLANDER COMMISSION,"The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commisshould sion Amendment Bill (No.3) is of great Junior. personal interest to me and, more importantly, to my constituents of Leichhardt who reside in the Torres Strait. The bill provides for major changes to arrangements for the Torres Strait, including the establishment of a Torres Strait Regional Authority. I will be confining my comments to this aspect of the bill, which also deals with other matters relating to the functions of ATSIC. In the regional authority to exercise ATSIC powers with respect to Islanders and Aboriginal residents in the Torres Strait, this bill is responding directly to calls from the Torres Strait Islanders who are resident in the and the island communities of the northern peninsula area of Bamaga and Seisia. The Torres Strait, it is very trite to say but true, is a long way from Canberra. There was a feeling in the Torres Strait that its best interests would be served if ATSIC funding decisions were made on Thursday Island-not Canberra, and certainly not Brisbane or even Cairns. A function of the new authority will be to recognise and maintain the special and unique - Ailan Kastom' of the Torres Strait Islanders, as well as· the customs and traditions of Aboriginal people in the area. Ailan Kastom is defined in the legislation as the body of customs, traditions, observances and beliefs of some or all of the Torres Strait Islanders living in the Torres Strait. The strength of this Ailan Kastom is evident to anyone who has had the privilege of visiting the Torres Strait. The Torres Strait Regional Council had asked that a new Torres Strait regional authchanority be established separate from ATSIC. While the commission endorsed the creation of the authority as the legitimate aspiration of Strait Islanders in· the Strait, I am happy to see that the regional council has agreed to ATSIC's proposal to keep the new authority within the framework of the ATSIC I would like to commend the regional be council for the manner in which it has approached all aspects of the negotiations that have taken place in the process of establishing the new authority. Particular commendation go to the chairperson, Mr Getano Lui Mr Lui and all regional councillors are committed to the future of the Torres Strait. I think this vision was most clearly articulated by Getano Lui Junior during his recent Boyer Lecture which was delivered to the ABC. I would like to quote extensively from Mr Lui's Boyer Lecture. He said: Torres Strait Islanders are not trying to abandon Australia. When I hear people accuse. us of that I cannot help but think of how, in. the 1970s, the Australian Government wanted to give away some of our people and islands to a foreign country. I don't think Australians have anything to teach us about loyalty. . But the fact is, today Australia tries to manage our affairs through the repreSentatives of nearly 40 official agencies and departments, none of whose officials are accountable to our region or our people. To participate in Australia as citizens we must change this status. I do not wish to prejudge the exact relationship which may develop. Perhaps we will negotiate over the next years some new status-in time for the 2001 anniversary of the Constitution. Whether we and our Australian negotiating partners find that a specific island territory constitution serves us best, or a new Australian Constitution big enough to embrace Islander and Aboriginal peoples, I cannot tell. We are looking at a range of options. None of these options calls into question our continued association with Australia in culture, spirit or law. We need reforms and improvements-not a separation and certainly not a divorce. I believe that this ATSIC Amendment Bill honours the spirit of Mr Lui's Boyer Lecture. It provides for the appropriation of funds from the government to the Torres Strait Regional Authority as a single line .allocation in the ATSIC budget following negotiations between the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner), the chairperson of ATSIC, the chairperson of the Torres Strait regional authority and the commissioner for the Torres Strait. The funds to be provided to the Torres Strait Regional Authority are to be those presently allocated by ATSIC to the Torres Strait Regional Council and those currently allocated by ATSIC on a national basis in respect of the Torres Strait. But this bill does more than provide for the flow of funds from .the government to the Torres Strait. Getano Lui Junior in his Boyer Lecture referred to the need for the development of the economic base of the Torres Strait. No region can enjoy a· degree of political autonomy without a degree of. economic autonomy. This bill provides that the Torres Strait regional authority must formulate and revise from time to time a template of the economic future of the Strait to be called the Torres Strait economic development plan. The aim of the plan as stated is to improve the economic, social and cultural status of Torres Strait Islanders and Aboriginal people resident in the Torres Strait. It is intended that the plan will include a marine strategy to ensure that the Torres Strait's most important natural resource is managed in the best possible way to ensure sustainable development alongside economic advantage. While the government has accepted ATSIC's advice in regard to the creation of the authority, it has. also listened to other concerns coming from the Torres Strait. In response to these calls, the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs set up a review of the constitution of the Torres Strait Regional Council and recommendations for the constitution and electoral process for the new Torres Strait regional authority. The review was conducted recently by a Torres Strait community lea<;ler and member of the National Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, Mr Alan Mosby-who I am sure is known to the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) at the table-and anthropologist Professor Jeremy Beckett. May I commend both Mr Mosby and Professor Beckett for the diligent manrier in which' the review was conducted. Meetings were held in every community throughout the Torres Strait. The whole of the Torres Strait was aware of the presence of the review team, and its presence in the Torres Strait was welcomed and seen as indicative that this government wants to give the Torres Strait the form of regional authority that residents want and that will work best for them. There has been no other issue in this part of my electorate that has created so much community in.terest and involvement. When one comes down to Canberra and hears debates about industrial relations, the balance of payments, perhaps even sporting grants-or even the native title legislation, I might sayit is another world from the Torres Strait. This is the burning issue in this part of my electorate: the nature of the Torres Strait authority in the short term, and the issue of possible regional autonomy in the long term. I think that the enthusiasm for this issue is indicative of the commitment of the Torres Strait peOple to self-determination as expressed so articulately by Mr Lui. That same enthusiasm and commitment to the future was made clear when Mr Alan Mosby called a public meeting on Thursday Island in October. It was an important meeting attended by many residents of the Strait, and it was addressed by Mr Mosby, Mr Lui, Mr Jim Akee and others. Opinions on the future of the Torres Strait may differ amongst these individuals, but Alan Mosby summed it, up when he said: We live in a glorious country, Australia, where each person has the right to ,speak up for his own rights. I have been very encouraged by the readiness of the people of the Torres Strait to speak up and say what they want and by the active way they have pursued their vision for a Torres Strait Regional Authority. The Torres Strait has an extremely diverse and multicultural population. People have settled there over a long period of time from many countries of the Pacific and Asia-from Malaysia, Japan, Papua New' Guinea, the Solomons, other islands of the Pacific-and, of course, Europe.' The very multicultural nature of the Torres Straif. ....:.especially day Island, Hom Island and Prince of Wales Island-provides a real challenge for the electoral structure of any possible form of future self-government in the Torres .Strait. Obviously the Queensland government, the new authority and the Torres Shire Council will need to work together in negotiating any further steps towards regional autonomy. Having .said that, amongst those non-indigenous communities there has been some . confusion about what the new Torres Strait Regional Authority will mean to them. May I assure those members of the multicultural Torres Strait community that these changes that are currently before the House will affect only those programs and activities funded by ATSIC. In reality, it will mean. that the CDEPcan be managed locally and loans to local businesses can be made at the local level. As well as the establishment of the development fund, the Torres. Strait .Regional Authority will establish a fund to be known as the Torres Strait housing fund. Anyone who has visited the Torres Strait will know that, although some .improvements· have taken place in recent years-especially since the election of the Goss government in 1989-there is a desperate need for affordable housing. When I was in the Torres Strait last month with the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, we had a series of quite constructive meetings with a broad cross-section of the community on this very issue. Meetings were held with representatives from the Torres Shire G:ouncil, the Tamwoy Development Association, the Mura Kosker Sorority, the Port Kennedy Associldion, the ATSIC regional council, the Hom Island Residents. and Ratepayers Association, and other groups and individuals. I take this opportunity to thank all pf those groups for taking the time to talk to both the minister and me. Earlier this year I had talks on this issue with representative groups in the Torres Strait and, in September, the then.Acting Prime Minister, and current Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe), visited the Torres. Strait. He assured groups on Thursday Island and at ThursBadu. and York of the gradualist nature of any reforms that this government will bring in. The, Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the Deputy Prime Minister, Minister Tickner, and I, as the local member, sympathise with expressions of the need for greater autonomy in the Torres Strait region. It gives me some comfort that the shadow minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs, the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent), has also expressed that view. But, importantly-and I say this in answer to the comments of the honourable member for Aston-this will occur only after consultation with all people in the Torres Strait. Some people do not seem to understand that the government believes in self-determination. That does not mean imposing some model that the honourable member for Aston, the honourable member for Leichhardt, any other member of this House or any bureaucrat in Canberra thinks might be appropriate for the Torres Strait., It means talking to the people of the Torres Strait. As I have indicated, it is a multicultural society. It is not an easy tion for the government or the opposition to answer. I see that the honourable member for Aston agrees with me on that point. The important, thing is that, from now on, there has to be continual consultation. As I said earlier, it cannot be just consultation with the government of Queensland or the local councils-which are obviously important-but consultation with all the people of the Torres Strait. This bill is a very important measure for the people of my electorate in the Torres Strait. I have no hesitation in commending it to the House.",81
134,Mr WAKELIN,ISLANDER COMMISSION,"As the shadow minister for Aboriginal' and Torres Strait Islander affairs, the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent), has explained, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill (No.3) has four main objectives: to strengthen the role of the Office of Evaluation and Audit, to establish the Torres Strait Regional Authority in place of the existing Torres Strait Regional Council, to devolve some financial functions to regional councils, and to establish the electoral review panel. I wish to make a few brief comments about my observations in recent' months. The separationist movement, if I can call it that, has been of some concern. It is encouraging to hear both sides of politics talking about it tonight in a reasonably sensible way. I think it is essential that Aboriginal communities remain part of this nation-and may that always be so. Self-detennination is important and the devolution of power is important, but it has to be done in the context of good management and responsibility to the taxpayer. Three or four days ago I was in Pitjantjatjara lands, which are in the northern part of my electorate of Grey. Whenever I go there a memory is imprinted indelibly on my mind-I do not go there expecting that to happen; it, just seems to happen. On this occasion-I will not go into it in any great detail-it was a matter of substance abuse. It reinforced to me the practical responsibility that this parliament has to the Aboriginal people of Australia. I must acknowledge the ques- conscientious and dedicated work of the shadow minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs in his portfolio role. It has been a privilege to work with him, particularly in working through my electorate in recent months. So much of this debate seems to be tied up in ,emotion. We have just come through a rather difficult debate on native title, and I suppose that is fresh in many minds. If we do indulge in too much partisanship on this issue it can only detract from the real issues; of health, education and housing. I have a particular interest in enterprise-I have mentioned this a number of times in my capacity as a member of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs-because I see a very clear link between enterprise and substance abuse. I do not intend to go into that in any detail here because I do not think it is appropriate to do so, but I, think it is certainly tied up in the role of the Office of Evaluation and Audit and the best way to use taxpayer dollars. I think the example the shadow minister used about the store and comparing it to the medical centre was very apt. I visited that particular settlement as recently as Friday morning. I say to the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Dodd) that in the Pitjantjatjara lands-I presume most would agree with me-we have had the equivalent of native title for many years. The granting of native title in itself has not solved the underlying issues. In fact, many have advised me-and I can see it with my own eyes-that there has been some deterioration in the situation. In conclusion, it is a privilege to be able to speak to this bill tonight. I acknowledge ,the contribution of the shadow minister, but I believe there are many options which we have barely discussed at this stage and which remain available to this parliament and Australia in meeting the challenges of the future.",84
135,Mr LES SCOTT,ISLANDER COMMISSION,"The year 1993 has been one of the most important for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in almost 25 years. There has been a renewed focus on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander issues as a result of the International Year for the World's Indigenous People and the community debate about how to respond to the High Court's decision on native title. The international year resulted in an increased awareness of the contribution of, and the issues confronting, the 300 million indigenous peoples throughout the world-in particular, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people of Australia. The United Nations' decision to expand the current International Year of the World's Indigenous People into an international decade of the world's indigenous people is most welcome as it will lead to a focussing on issues of concern to indigenous people which has resulted from the international year continuing into the future. One day in every year of the decade should be observed as the international day of indigenous peoples. The decade will begin on 10 December 1994. Of course, much more must be done than can be achieved in a year if indigenous people in this country are to achieve the full realisation of their rights as citizens. The other major event this year has been the debate leading up to the government's legislative response to the High Court's decision on native title. The High Court's decision on native title, commonly referred to as the Mabo decision, provided Australians with the opportunity to face the truth about our past and to build a more just and democratic society for the future. By doing away with the racist idea of terra nullius-the idea that this continent had no owners prior to the settlement of Europeansthe Mabo judgment laid the foundation for a more just future for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The government's legislative response to the High Court's decision on native title is fundamentally about human rights and correcting over 200 years of injustice suffered by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The government, in preparing its legislative response, embarked on a lengthy process of consultations with many groups, including representatives of Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders. Those representatives who were involved in these discussions participated in a constructive way and showed a willingness to compromise. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people showed by their leadership that they are able to rise to the occasion created by the Mabo decision. The way in which the consultation surrounded the drafting of the government's native title legislation demonstrates clearly that the government's approach to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs is effective. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission is the cornerstone of this approach, which is fundamentally about empowering· Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to take control of their own destiny. This legislation contains the third amendment in a series of amendments to the act under which ATSIC operates. The legislation comes as a result of a review carried out by the commission into the effectiveness of the act. It resulted in a report to the Minister for Aboriginal· and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) in February of this year. The main changes contained in this legislation include the establishment of the Torres Strait Regional Authority to replace the existing regional councils in the Torres Strait; the simplification of the financial provisions of the act and the decentralisation of some financial functions to the regional councils; a strengthening of the role of the Office of Evaluation and Audit; and the establishment of an electoral review panel. The overall effect of these amendments is to increase the input of local communities in the decision making process within an even more effective and accountable organisation. I tum to the financial aspects of this bill. One of the great myths which unfortunately are believed by a significant section of the population is that ATSIC has a huge budget, a large portion of which is wasted. This fable has no basis in reality. The facts are that the budget of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission in the last financial year was around $788 million. Out of this budget, around 60 per cent is spent on the community development employment program and on the provision of housing and other infrastructure for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. This false perception of large amounts of funds being available to ATSIC leads to the mistaken conclusion that there is a lack of accountability in relation to how the money is actually spent. The reality is that, in tion to being subject to the user requirements of public accountability, including examination by Senate estimates committees, by the Auditor-General and by the parliamentary committee system, ATSIC is also subject to scrutiny by the Office of Evaluation and Audit. This body reports directly to the minister and the Chairperson: of ATSIC on matters relating to accountability. In addition the budget related paper produced by ATSIC each year contains details of every cent of federal government expenditure in the area of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs. This legislation, which as I have said comes as a result of the review of ATSIC by the commissioners themselves, will increase the ability of the Office of Evaluation and Audit to examine the finances of ATSIC funded organisations. Under the changes, the OEA will have the power to evaluate and audit the Commercial Development Corporation and Aboriginal Hostels Ltd, in addition to the proposed Torres Strait Regional Authority and ATSIC itself. The commission and the minister will have the power to direct the OEA to investigate regional councils as well as the recipients of ATSIC, and TSRA grant and loan recipients in some instances. In addition to the increased role for the Office of Evaluation and Audit contained in this legislation, it also includes administrative changes that will clear up some anomalies in the act relating to the appointment and conditions of service of the Director of the Office of Evaluation and Audit. Taken together, these amendments will increase the confidence of the broader community in the accountability of ATSIC and related organisations, and will build on the excellent work which is already being done by the commission in the area. The financial provisions of this legislation will also result in a decentralisation of power to regional councils. Under the bill ATSIC will be empowered to delegate its powers to a regional council to approve funds and issue guarantees. The commission will have the power to limit these powers through written directions, and any abuse will be subject to sanctions, including suspension of delegates addi- to regional councils by the Chairperson of ATSIC. This devolution of power to regional councils is an effective way of increasing the input of local communities, which are in the best position to judge what the needs of the particular community concerned are. It is also in the spirit of the amendments made to the act· earlier this year, which are designed to increase the role of regional councils within the structure of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. Another amendment in this bill which will increase the ability of the indigenous people of Australia to have control over their own destiny is the establishment of the Torres Strait Regional Authority. This was referred to at length by the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Dodd). Part 28 of the legislation contains the functions of the new authority, which will be substantially similar to those of ATSIC. An additional requirement wm be to recognise and maintain the special and unique Ailan Kastom of Torres Strait Islander life. Ailan Kastom is·defined in the bill as: ... the body of customs, traditions, observances and beliefs of some or all of the Torres Strait Islanders living in the Torres Strait area, and includes any such customs, traditions, observances and beliefs relating to particular persons, areas, objects or relationships; The establishment of the Torres Strait Regional Authority is an important step forward in recognising the unique history and separate cultural identity of Torres Strait Islanders. They will have the opportunity to elect representatives to their own separate authority, giving them a say in how government funds are distributed in their communities. It is important for ATSIC and the Torres Strait Regional Authority to remain truly accountable to the wishes of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to ensure that the electoral system under which these bodies are elected remains effective. To ensure that this occurs, this bill establishes an independent electoral review process which will review and determine the boundaries of regions and awards and the. grouping of regions into zones, as well 'as reviewing and reporting back to the minister on the electoral system by which regional councils are elected. When determining the boundaries of regions, the independent review panel will call for submissions and make draft boundary recommendations with an expanded panel which will then hear objections to proposed boundaries. The process will operate on a similar basis to that which operates under the Australian Electoral Act for the determination of boundaries for the House of Representatives. This process will ensure that the regionmost al councils of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission continue to be representative of the communities that they represent. This legislation will ensure that the process of empoweJ1l1ent of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to make decisions to take control of their lives will continue. a process that I am sure has been welcomed by many. The bill will ensure improvement in the accountability measures existing for the commission while ensuring that the commission continues to effectively represent the aspirations of Aborigina:l and Torres Strait Islander people. I am particularly pleased .to have the opportunity to support the amendments in this bill.",84
136,Mr NEHL,ISLANDER COMMISSION,"I rise to speak, on the Aboriginal· and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill (No.3) with a great deal of pleasure and a lot of interest. I think the provisions that are brought forward in this bill are very significant to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people-and, indeed, to all Australians. I believe very strongly that, even though we have to have legislation specifically directed to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, their future cannot be considered' in isolation from the future of other Australians. I believe very strongly that Australians have one future together in brotherhood, and we certainly should not take any separate path. I do welcome the bill, which has. as its principal functions major changes to the arrangements involving the Torres Strait, including the establishment of the Torres Strait R(!gional Authority. Streamlining the financial divisions of the act is also of great importance. One of the effects of that will be to facilitate the further devolution of authority to regional councils. Strengthening and enlarging the role of the Office of Evaluation and Audit is very important. The final provision of the bill is to establish an independent electoral J;eview panel. ' As far as the Torres Strait area is concerned, I welcome the introduction of the Torres. Strait Regional Authority. I have visited the Torres Strait on three separate occasions-first in 1977, then in 1986 and recently this year when I went there as part of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs inquiry into access and equity for Aboriginal and Torres Str-it Islander people. I have tremendous admiration for the people It is of the Torres Strait. They are wonderful people. They are intelligent, they are proud and they are good Australians. They have proved that over decades. As the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Dodd) said in his speech, it is a pity that more Australians do not have the opportunity of visiting the Torres Strait and experiencing first-hand the warmth, the friendship and the tremendous community spirit. I cannot think of the Torres Strait without thinking of people like George Mye from Darnley Island, whose contribution to Australia has been enormous and whose contribution to the Torres Strait has been very significant indeed. The honourable member for Leichhardt made merition of Mr Getano Lui Jr-I certainly recall meeting him-and Getano Lui Sr, who was a great Australian who made a wonderful contribution to the Torres Strait. The honourable member also mentioned Mr Alan Mosby. I have memories of meeting many of the Mosby family-particularly on York Island and elsewhere-in the past. I cannot talk about friends and acquaintances in the Torres Strait without mentioning a wonderful .woman and a good friend, Mrs Flo Kennedy, who I think is very largely mother to the whole of the Torres Strait. She is one of those great, wonderful, warm, loving human beings who are the epitome of caring and compassion. Unfortunately, I have not had the opportunirevise ty of listening to or even reading'-I will make the effort to do so-the Boyer lecture of Getano Lui Jr. I was interested to hear the honourable member for Leichhardt quote from it. I was particularly pleased that he emphasriginal ised the fact that Mr Lui mentioned that his people were part of Australia and were happy to be part of Australia. Unfortunately, I believe that among our population of 17.6 million people there is great deal of misunderstanding. To some extent, this has been fostered and fomented some people within the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community who have a politia cal agenda of their own and who are to put forward the proposition of a country within a country. I have spoken about this the House before. It is a concept that I reject very strongly. I do not believe it is in the best interests of any Australian, whatever his her racial origin, to embrace the separatist fantasy of creating a country within a country. I totally reject that concept and I am delighted that Getano Lui Jr made that point in his Boyer lecture. I think the vast majority of Aboriginal and Torres·Strait Islander people who are certainly conscious of their own aspirations, their own a plan. culture and their own history-which is a very long one-can see them evolving, communities developing and growing within the context of Australian society. I think that is the way we have to go. I think we have to be very careful of the way we use words like 'selfof determination' and 'autonomy' because they Strait are capable of various interpretations. This continues to cause some confusion for some people. I welcome the Torres Strait Regional Authority. It is going to be a step in the right direction. Whether it is the Torres Strait Regional Authority or the Coffs Harbour Council in my electorate, it is the right of Australian citizens to elect their own represenbetween tatives to get on with the job of running their own local affairs. I see no difficulty in the Torres Strait Regional Authority doing that, and doing it particularly. well. I note also that part of the legislation provides that the authority must formulate and from time to time a plan to be known as the Torres Strait development plan. That is certainly very necessary. The aim of the plan is to improve the economic, social and cultural status· (}f Torres Strait Islanders and Abopersons living in the Torres Strait area. Torres Strait Islanders are of a mainly Catholic background, with people coming from the Solomons bringing the light-the introduction of Christianity to Darnley Island. a I have had the experience-I was about to say pleasure, but I changed my mind-of stalking by across that rocky foreshore, which I will not even call a beach, to the point where there is memorial to the first landing of the seeking missionaries from the Solomons. The plan also has to incorporate a marine in strategy for improving the economic, social and cultural st-tus of Torres Strait Islanders. I applaud that. I think it is perhaps a pity that or here we are in 1993 just now getting to the point of establishing the authority. But, more than that, we are only now at the point of saying, 'Okay, the authority is going to be established and it has got to develop this plan'. I think it is a reflection on governments of both sides of politics that only now that we are at this point are we starting to talk about When I first visited a number of Aboriginal in the Torres Strait in 1977, I was struck by the fact that all too often some of the projects appeared to be designed to fail. I say that in a very critical way. I think part the problem for Aboriginal and Torres Islander Australians is that they are cast in stereotypes. I think what has happened in the past has been designed to create that system of failure. I have mentioned that before in this House. I have spoken about the number of Aboriginal children from the Macleay Valley in my own City electorate who suffer from otitis media. Something like 94 per cent of Aboriginal kids the ages of three and six suffer from .this disease-glue ear. I will not bore the House by repeating the full details of it. But it is significant in that when these kids start school they are already three years behind, on average, in tenns of language development and socialisation. When they get to school they cannot hear, they cannot learn and so they are cast in this role of being dumb. And it is not true. I will not go on with this topic, be<;ause it is one of my pet hobby horses. But it does lead me to another area which I will talk about in the time available to me: the provision of health for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. I think back to my visit to Lockhart River in 1977. The federal government of the day, which was of the same political cast as I am, had very generously provided two really good diesel fishing dories to enable the people to establish a fishing industry. Of course, the venture was doomed to failure. The sad thing about it is that this is just one example of what has happened time and time again right around Australia. We collectively, as a government, provided these beaut boats but we did not provide any money for nets. We did not provide any money for fuel. If they did get fuel and nets and if they did catch fish, where were they going to market the fish? The only market that one could poke a stick at was at Cairns. The only way of getting to Cairns was by air by bushies-bush pilots-in the old DC3s. In order to get the alleged fish that they would catch-if they ever got the fuel and the netsto that market they would have had to freeze them, and then send them to Cairns on the plane which came in two or three times a week. But there was no freezer either. I use that as an·· example of how, right around Australia in past decades, governments of all persuasions have supported a situation that was doomed to failure. That is part of the problem that we have in tenns of the lack of role models for Aboriginal and Torres· Strait Islander people and the way that the broader community tends to regard them. This bill provides a framework so that they can succeed and they can be-I use the words carefully-involved in regional autonomy. They can do their own thing and they can be responsible for themselves. That is what we are all entitled to, and that is what we all want to do. I want to deal briefly with the Office of Evaluation and Audit. It is quite important that the powers of this office should be strengthened. It will have the obligation to undertake regular evaluation and audit of the operations of ATSIC, Aboriginal Hostels Ltd and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commercial Development Corporation. It is a sad fact of life that, because of public perceptions, the expenditure of Commonwealth money by Aboriginal organisations has to be like Caesar's wife-absolutely above suspicion. Everybody is looking for the opportunity to criticise and cast stones at them. . . Mr KaUer-Hear, hear-undennine them.",87
137,Mr NEHL,ISLANDER COMMISSION,"And undennine them, as my colleague the honourable member for Kennedy says. I am sure that every member in this place who has close contact with Aboriginal communities is constantly getting phone calls from both Aboriginal and European or white Australians who are complaining and nitpicking about waste, and making all sorts of allegations. That is why, unfortunately, they have to be like Caesar's wife-above suspicion. Whilst the Auditor-General's authority and responsibility certainly apply, I think it is excellent that the Office of Evahiation and Audit is going to be strengthened and given more power, because it is very important in tenns of public perception that federal and state government money should be seen to be spent properly and not wasted. I would like to conclude by making a point that is always of concern to me. If we are going to consider the future of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, it cannot be done in isolation from the rest of the community. They are Australians first and foremost. As a caring and compassionate society we have to provide for those of our fellow countrymen who are in need; whether they are in need in tenns of health, employment or education. It is perhaps not so vital for Torres Strait Islander Australians as it is for Aboriginal Australians. Health is the key. In Torres Strait we have this widespread problem of diabetes that has to be conquered. The health strategy for Torres Strait is another item that has been lagging for some time. and needs to be addressed. I hope that the introduction and the formation of the Torres Strait Regional Authority will focus attention on the need for that health strategy to be introduced and become m.ore effective. Education is the key to· success for any individual, whether in this country or anywhere else. We have. to pay partiCular attention to the education services provided for all Australians, but particularly for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities who are basiCally remote. In the report of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs that will be submitted on Thursday we are concerned with the question of access and equity for all Australians. I support the provisions of the bill and I look forward, in particular, to the Torres Strait Regional Authority becoming a vibrant and vigorous arm of government by and for Torres Strait Islander people.",89
138,Mr KATTER,ISLANDER COMMISSION,"I rise to speak on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill (No.3). According to' the newspapers in Queensland, almost all of the councils in Torres Strait had qualified audit reports last year. One of the ladies who care very greatly and dearly about the Aboriginal councils told me, amongst some fairly copious tears, that the government was going to undermine selfmanagement, was going to undermine the councils and was going to destroy them. When I laid up my shoes as minister for Aboriginal affairs in Queensland only six of the 28 councils had qualified-that means bad-reports, or unacceptable reports as far as the Auditor-General was concerned. Four of those were very tiny councils in the Torres Strait. They were not a great deal of worry to us or to the public purse. But now we have only six of the 28 councils not getting qualified reports. I have heard few people in this House speak with such perceptive observations and prescient judgment with respect to the first Australians as the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl).",90
139,Dr THEOPHANOUS,ISLANDER COMMISSION,You want his vote.,90
140,Mr KATTER,ISLANDER COMMISSION,"Quite seriously, I think it would do everyone in this House a great deal of good in understanding the first Australians to listen to the honourable member for Cowper. What he is saying about the undermining of the councils is something that I could see continuously with the do-gooders. Trying to be a practising Christian, I deeply regret having to say this about the missionaries, but a lot of them fit into the same category. I am sure that the little carpenter in Nazareth had no idea that the interpretations of his teachings were going to be such that little children would be taken from their parents. I do not think that this is a matter for jest. 1\vo generations of Australians-two generations of human beings-on Cape York Peninsula were taken from their parents. To have done that under the guise of Christianity is unbelievable to me, but that is what happened. I will not pursue that subject any further because I do not have the time. Getting· back to the undermining of the councils, the statements of the honourable member for Cowper were very prescient observations and judgments. I cannot mention names because of the vicious vindiCtiveness of the Queensland government, but that government sacked almost every single one of the senior operators in the field of Aboriginal affairs. Some courageous people have fought to get them back again, because they were the only decent people that they had in the department. . The honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Dodd) earlier referred to the lovely meetings that they had in the Torres Strait. I wonder whether the honourable member for LeiChhardt referred to the fact that the Queensland government, which he was lauding and praising here, has taken control of all the people's houses. This is very much at the heart of this partiCular bill. In my day some $30 million or $40 million-it might even have been $46 million in one year-was given to the Queensland government to expend on Aboriginal housing. Be it good judgment or not, we decided to instruct our offiCers to work at the behest and the direction of the local federal government housing cooperatives. It was handled under an Aboriginal affairs department and the officers their directions from the elected housing cooperatives. It was not a good system but could not find any better. This way the black people had control of the housing. In Queensland, the Queensland government has simply shifted in a most improper manner all of the money for that housing away from the black people themselves-the decisions were taken by the ACC and ICC council as far as the community areas in Queensland were concerned, which was about two-thirds audit problems. of the housing in those days-and handed it over to what was called the Housing Commission but which is now called Q-Build. If honourable members think that the black people will get a fair go out of that arrangehas ment, all I can say is that I have had black people from, I think, seven out of the 12 major areas in my electorate come to me and complain bitterly about the disastrousconsehis qiJences that will follow for these houses. They will not be repaired; they will not be maintained; and the people will be brutalised about the collection of rent. I do not mean that rents do not have to be collected. I think we had about three per cent of delinquent debts, if my memory serves me correctly, in Queensland. People paid so long as they knew that they had to pay. We found that there was not a problem with the payment of rents. Once again, one cannot help but think that these councils and the people's ability to run their own affairs are being undermined by race of do-gooders who are threatened bebeen cause not only they will have no jobs if the black people stand on their own two feet, also their very identity and the way they define themselves will vanish. That is far more serious to them. Some say that they simply worried about losing their jobs. was explained to me by Eric Law, there is a lot more to it than just a fear of losing jobs. They are worried about losing their identity. They feel threatened. Every time. I saw black people stand their own two feet, show initiative and start to make decisions, I could physically see do-gooders tighten with tension because they were seriously threatened. All I can say is the observations made by the honourable took member for Cowper in this chamber are deadly accurate. That is at the very heart of I the failure of this government and other governments to be able to come to grips with the successful management of the affairs in these areas. Moving on to the specifics-I think I should move on to the specifics here-one of the reasons that we did not have any audit problems was because we were deadly deter. mined to ensure that. we did not have any Mr Les Scott-'-There's nothing to audit. Mr Dodd-There's a quote!",90
141,Mr KATTER,ISLANDER COMMISSION,"The honourable member for Leichhardt seems to think it is funny. He burst out in a hyena-type giggle at the statement that we were determined to see that the audits were successful. He thinks that that is funny. I suppose, looking at the conduct of government on black affairs over the last 10 years, he could be expected to laugh like a hyena, but I do not think it is funny. I am quite proud to repeat the statement, which he laughed at, that we were quite determined to see that the audits were successful. An audit team visited these areas on a fortnightly basis for a very long and extended period-at times it used to blowout to a month or two months. Each of the cheques had to be signed by two people. Not only were the cheques to be signed, but I laid down a memo-which I must admit was not carried out; if it had been, the I do not think a single council would have out of line in that final year-that there was to be a reference number on every single but cheque so that when a cheque was written a box had to be filled in with a number. That number referred to an account file. If someare one did not have an account and had to pay As money out, a memo was notated that was referred to a council meeting. That particular their disbursement had to be agreed to by the council itself at a subsequent meeting so that every single writing of a cheque by that on council and disbursement of moneys would have to be justified in accordance with the the terms and conditions laid down by the auditor. I think that that was almost a foolproof that system because we had only four tiny councils in the Torres Strait-one of which, Stephens Island, had only 25 people on it, so we can dismiss that and say only three councils-out of 27 that were out of order, and two of them were island councils. What I am saying is that, if there is a and a determination to see that these councils are successful, they will be successful. But I, like so many of the first Australians, have my suspicions that deep in the dark heart of the so-called do-gooders there is a subliminal or at least a subconscious desire to see the people fail on the issue of private ownership and self-management, as it has been called so often. Let me quote just how well the Torres Strait Islanders can run when the shackies that have been imposed upon them over the years have been removed. The Badu freezer was in two feet of water when I first visited Badu and I was shown the freezer.. It had gone broke three times under a communal ownership arrangement foisted upon the community by the do-gooders and the federal government-which had been of both political persuasions, so I am not making a political point here. There it lay, in two feet of mud. Richard Bowie approached me and Getano Lui and said he wanted to take over the freezer. After much argument and fighting over a period of two or three months, I said, 'All right, we will buy the freezer. We will give it to them on the basis of a loan from the federal government'. On that basis the federal government decided it was prepared to give the freezer to this partnership of Richard Bowie, Joe Nona and Jacky Ahmat. At that stage I think there were six fishing boats working out of Badu and the total income from fishing from the Torres Strait Islands was about $350,000. Some 15 or 16 months after that the big fishing operator in Australia George Raptis rang me and said, 'You will be very pleased to know, Mr KaUer, that the Badu syndicate has had $3.5 million paid to it by my organisation'. It had been paid $3.5 million, if my memory serves me correctly, in the previous 12 months. Give the blokes a fair go, give them the opportunity to run, give them the carrot and stick of private ownership, the same as every other Australian enjoys-the machinery that will work, instead of stupid communal ownership which has failed everywhere it has been tried in the entire worldand see what these people can achieve. From will $350,000 to $7 million in the space of some 18 months to two years is a most extraordinary accomplishment. We spent a fortune on the Kuzi-it went broke about four times, from my memoryuntil we stopped its operations altogether. It was another stupid communal ownership operation. That was before my time but when I came in I realised what a disaster it had been and we stopped it. We put fishing freezers in each of the communities because the banks would not loan money. There was no other way for them to be funded and each of the communities had their own fishing freezer so that .the community could go fishing and have somewhere to store their fish until the mother ships came in and picked it up. One day on Coconut Island one of the dinghies had just come in and its catch for the morning, after being out for two or three hours, was about $500 or $600 worth of fish. That is the sort of money, given the opportunities, that the people can make, and make with a considerable degree of ease. In talking about the Torres Strait, I cannot help but commend a community that has some of the lowest crime rates in the entire world. In fact, the store on Mer Island had never been broken into when I visited Mer Island. There was a lady there who had worked there for 17 years and the store had never been broken into. The island has some of the lowest rates of social disease in the entire world and some of the lowest incidents of alcoholism in the entire world. This is an enormously successful culture, if you like; an enormously successful group of people. For us to interfere in any way with the way that they run things there would be an act of criminal .stupidity. Given the opportunity for some coconut processing factories on the mainland-I would very strongly recommend this to the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner)-I am quite sure that 30,000 trees that are up there now can be brought into commercial operation. A lot of people call the government in Queensland racist, and it is very hard to avoid tagging it with that tenn. I plead with the minister to overrule a decision it has made. Instead of putting in solar energy on the islands, it has decided to put diesel electricity generators throughout all of the islands. Over a 20-year time frame, it will cost $5 million more. In addition to that, our ability to service complex generators on th,ose obscure islands is enonnously limited. It was said that the solar energy plant on Coconut Island was deficient. Of course it was. With the growth in demand, there was supposed to be a growth in solar cells. The growth in demand took place, but there was no increase in the numsecond ber of solar cells being put out there. While the solar energy generator on Coconut Island never faltered at any stage whatsoever, the generator that was attached to it did on three occasions. That gives us some idea of what the most reliable, valuable and important",91

NA AMENDMENT BILL 1993 Second Reading Debate resumed from 17 November, on motion by Mr Kerr: That the bill be now read a second time.",93
145,Mr WILLIAMS,LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION,"Tangney) (9.32 p.m.)The Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill is an omnibus bill which makes wide ranging amendments to the Disability Discrimination Act 1992, the Racial Discrimination Act 1975, the Sex Discrimination Act 1984, the Privacy Act 1988 and the High Court of Australia Act 1979. I do not intend addressing the all of the amendments proposed by this bill. My principal comments will relate to the significant amendments proposed to the Privacy Act in respect of representative complaints. Several clauses in this bill are directed at correcting drafting errors or omissions. The reading speech euphemistically refers to these amendments as 'merely technical or made as a result of other legislative amend. ments' .' In fact, they have been necessitated by sloppy drafting resulting in this parliais ment's time being taken up with amendments that should never have been necessary. Drafting errors and unconstitutional legislation take up an inordinate amount of parliamentary time. Section 36 of the Racial Discrimination Act provides that the minister may appoint an race discrimination commissioner when the commissioner is absent from duty, absent Australia or during a vacancy in that office. At present, the acting commissioner cannot continue so to act for more than 12 months. The bill removes this restriction, which is referred to in the explanatory memorandum as a 'drafting error'. What is referred to as a 'drafting omission' in the explanatory memorandum is that which was contained in the Sex Discrimination and Other Legislation Amendment Act 1992. That legislation substituted new provisions in the Sex Discrimination Act with respect to sexual harassment in connection with the workplace. It was always intended that these amendments would not affect the exemption contained in the act in relation to acts of workplace sexual harassment by an employee of a state or of an instrumentality of a state. However, the relevant section refers to section 28, which was repealed by the 1992 act. Thus, since the commencement of that act on 13 January 1993, the intended exemption has been totally inoperative and there has not been the intended exemption from workplace sexual harassment provisions for employees of a state or a state instrumentality. This bill restores that exemption. This amendment has been made retrospective and will thus be taken to have commenced on the date on which the Sex Discrimination and Other Legislation Amendment Act 1992 commenced: I do not know whether any complaints of workplace sexual harassment have been made against state employees since the commencement of the 1992 act. If such complaints have been lodged, the retrospective nature of this amendment will (ender them groundless. Citizens may have incurred expense in pursuing them because of this 'drafting error'. A further 'drafting error' in the Sex Discriit mination Act is amended by this bill with the renumbering of a subsection. New subsections were inserted in the Sex Discrimination Act by the Sex Discrimination Amendment Act 1991. Subsequently, a further subsection with the same number was inserted by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Legislation Amendment Act 1992. These botched amendments have resulted in the reprinted Sex Discrimination Act presently containing two subsections 14(4). In addition to the errors in drafting which this bill seeks to amend, it also proposes amending what amounts to an error in judgment on the part of the government in relation to exemptions in the Sex Discrimination Act with respect to particular insurance policies and superannuation funds. The Sex Discrimination Amendment Act 1991 removed from the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 the exemption for superannuation and insurance policies and replaced them with more limited exemptions. These provisions were to have commenced on 25 June 1993. According to the second reading speech, the delay in the commencement of these provisions was in order to give superannuation funds time to develop options to allow members to transfer to non-discriminatory schemes. However, the guidelines which were to be formulated by the Human Rights. and Equal Opportunity Commission to assist funds to develop non-discriminatory options were not finalised in sufficient time. As a result, clause 24 of this bill provides that these new provisions shall be taken to have commenced on 1 July 1994 to allow time for the funds to be in a position to comply with the new regime. Clearly, the introduction of .these provisions was premature and without adequate consultation with the parties concerned. We will await with bated breath the extension of the date to 1 July 1994 to see whether that also introduces a premature arrangement. , Whilst critical of the fact that sloppy drafting and inadequate consultation on the part of the government have necessitated the amendments just described, the opposition does not oppose those provisions in this bill. Nor does oppose the other amendments contained in the bill in relation to the Racial Discrimination Act, the Sex Discrimination Act, the Disability Discrimination Act and the High Court of Australia Act. The opposition also does not oppose the proposed amendments to the Privacy Act which provide for the registration of determinations made under that act in the Federal Court, their review and enforcement. It is noted that these provisions; and similar provisions already contained in the Disability Discrimination Act, the Racial Discrimination Act and the Sex Discrimination Act may fall foul of the constitution with respect to the separation of judicial and non-judicial power. However, the opposition recognises that these procedures provide a more straightforward method of enforcement and review than those presently contained in the Privacy Act. Consistent with its position with respect to the other legislation mentioned, the opposition will not oppose these measures. I now come to the amendments proposed by this bill which the opposition does oppose. Amendments have been circulated in my name, which I will move. Under the Privacy Act, where an act or practice may interfere with the privacy of two or more individuals, anyone of those individuals may make a complaint to the Privacy Commissioner. This is presently defined as a 'representative complaint'. This bill proposes modifying the definitions and procedures relating to representative or class complaints in the Privacy Ad along the lines of corresponding provisions relating to representative actions under the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976. Similar amendments were made to the Disability Discrimination Act, the Radal Discrimination Act and the Sex Discrimination ACt by the Sex Dis-rimination and Other Legislation Amendment Act 1992. Under section 39 of the Privacy Act, nothing in the provisions relating to repr-sentative complaints prevents a person from making a complaint to the Privacy Commissioner about an act or practice about which a representative complaint has been made. The proposed amendment will provide that a person who is a class member in a representative action is prevented from lodging an individual complaint unless that person withdraws from the representative complaint. Thus, the bill seeks to incorporate an 'opt out' rather than an 'opt in' system with respect to representative actions. In other words, unless a member of the class. which is covered by the representative complaint withdraws from the action, his or her rights are determined by that action without his or her voice ever having been heard. Such a scheme has never been supported by the opposition and it is not supported in relation to this amendment. The concept of a person being included in a class on the description of a complainant and thereby having his or her rights determined in that action, unless he or she specifically withdraws from it, is offensive to the notion of justice. In this regard, I refer to the submission made to the government by the Law Council of Australia when similar amendments were proposed to the Federal Court of Australia Act. As stated in the Law Council's letter to the then Minister for Justi.ce and Consumer Affairs, Senator Michael Tate: ... a person should be bound by the outcome of a representative action only if he or she gives express consent to be bound. A procedure which places the onus on the individual to opt out of proceeding does not provide appropriate or adequate protection to individuals who may not wish to be bound by the outcome of a representative action. The Law Council also pointed out that there is a risk that a representative action taken in a new field will fail, leaving all members of the group unable to take their own separate action if they wish to do so. I concur with the comment of the Law Council that members of that group should not have to run that risk unless they agree to accept it. When this bill was debated in the Senate last month, Senator Bolkus's response to the opposition's concerns about the representative complaint amendments was simply to say that the debate as to whether there should be optin or opt-out provisions had been debated in the past and that the debate had 'lost its vitality'. Whilst the debate may have lost its vitality for Senator Bolkus, it has not for the opposition. The fact that the government was successful in amending other legislation to incorporate similar provisions does not render the present amendments either correct or desirable. . Senator Bolkus also used a quite illogical piece of reasoning to justify the provisions. He said that legal access to redress of rights, particularly for those who are disadvantaged and less educated, was more likely to come through an opt-out proposal which, at the same time, according to the senator, would enhance the access to justice of many. In fact, it is precisely those disadvantaged and less educated people who will be adversely affected by the proposed amendments-those who will not be aware that their rights may finally be determined in a representative action unless they opt out of it. The fundamental point is that, with opt-in provisions, individual rights are not lost if an individual is unaware of or takes no action with respect to a representative action. It is essentially irrelevant whether those rights are exercised or not. In contrast with opt-out provisions, an individual must be aware of and take steps to withdraw from a representative complaint to prevent his or her rights being lost. The question of access to justice is one which must be addressed separately and does a not, in any way, mitigate the fact that opt-out provisions can result in individual rights being lost without those individuals ever being aware of those rights in the first place. The fact is that the provisions proposed by this bill with respect to representative complaints are unjust. The amendments I have proposed will result in the omission of the amending provisions. I commend the amendments. The bill is otherwise not opposed by the opposition.",93
146,Ms HENZELL,LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION," I am pleased to support the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill, but I am not in a position to support the amendments proposed by the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams). It is the government's view that providing an opt-out provision allows for greater access to justice for people-it will certainly not take away their rights-and it has been incorporated in other legislation in this area, including state legislation. I want to refer to the bill more generally. As the shadow Attorney-General indicated, this is a portfolio bill which provides a number of technical amendments to the Disability Discrimination Act, the Sex Discrimination Act and the Racial Discrimination Act. These acts were amended late last year under the Sex Discrimination and other Legislation Amendment Act 1992 which provided for the enforcement of determinations by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission via their registration in the Federal Court. The previous amendment required that the respondent receive written notification within seven days and that the respondent be allowed 28 days from the registration to appeal the commission's decision in the Federal Court. Absence of an application to review the decision within that time span would automatically result in the determination becoming an order of the court at the expiration of the 28-day period. Subsequently, concern was expressed by the Chief Justice of the Federal Court that this time limit could lead to injustRDA ice in certain circumstances. Therefore, the amendments in the bill under consideration this evening allow the court to review a determination of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission after the 28-day period has elapsed if the court considers that there are exceptional circumstances. The Federal Court has approved these amendments as drafted. The onus will be on the respondent to demonstrate that exceptional circumstances have occurred. The possibility of a review outside the 28-day period will not prevent the complainant from taking action to enforce the determination after the 28 days from the registration of that determination. In this way, both the original complainant and the respondent are not denied access to due process. The amendments to the Privacy Act include, firstly, the amendment to the determination provisions Of the Privacy Act. The amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act, the Racial Discrimination Act and the Disability Discrimination Act were part of the government's response to the recommendations made by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in its report entitled Halfway to equal, but did not incorporate the recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs in its review of decisions of the human rights and equal opportunities commissioners and the Privacy Commissioner. Consequently, the amendments to the Privacy Act will make it consistent with th- enforcement of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission determinations, including the extension of time for review in exceptional circumstances. The second aspect is the clarification of the power of the Privacy Commissioner to copy and retain documents. Amendments will provide the Privacy Commissioner with specific authority to copy and retain documents relevant to an inquiry, as is the case for the Ombudsman and the human rights commissioners. The third aspect relates to compensation for humiliation and injury to feelings. The Crimes Act 1914-in relation to spent convictions-the Privacy Act, the SDA, the and the DDA give the authority investigating complaints the power to make determinations on those complaints. This amendment will allow for the inclusion of injury to the complainant's feelings or humiliation suffered by the complainant to be specifically compensated for under the Privacy Act which, once again, brings this act into line with other discrimination acts under consideration. The technical amendment simply amends the reference to the Joint Intelligence Organisation updating it to the Defence Intelligence Organisation. A further amendment also provides for disclosures of credit information to state and territory government housing assistance schemes. This' amendment will assist state and territory mortgage assistance schemes to be supervised and managed adequately. The amendment to the Racial Discrimination Act is an amendment of a technical error identified by the Office of Parliamentary Counsel in section 36 of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Amendment Act. In referring, to these technical drafting errors, note that the shadow Attorney-General made much out of these technical problems. I dare say that, in a perfect world, these things would not happen. But this is far from a perfect world. The recent conduct of legislation due to the pressure put on the parliamentary draftspeople by the requirement to have bills in the other place by a certain date has caused several more technical drafting errors. So the shadow Attorney-General is being a little precious in taking the high moral ground on this matter. On the amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act, the shadow Attorney-General also referred to the exemption of employees of state governments and state instrumentalities. It should be noted that all states, with the exception of Tasmania, have complementary legislation. Although the shadow Attorney General expressed concern about what has happened, as far as I am aware, the cases he alludes to have not made the headlines. The shadow Attorney-General also referred to the superannuation amendments in the Sex Discrimination Act. The time allotted for the changeover to a new regime for non-discrimination in superannuation as provided for in the Sex Discrimination and Other Legislation Amendment Act 1991 is to be extended. Originally, as indicated by my colleague opposite, it was planned that this would be in place by June of this year but, due to administrative difficulties, has been delayed until July 1994. Unless the Sex Discrimination Act is amended to allow fund administrators to continue to' offer existing members time to join non-discriminatory schemes prior to the removal of the blanket exemption, superannuation funds will find themselves in violation of the Sex Discrimination Act. Such matters are required in a world that is far from perfect. The amendment to the High Court of Australia Act is obviously technical, to amalgamate the office and responsibilities of the clerk of the court and the registrar into the chief executive and principal registrar. All of these amendments are designed to make these various acts work effectively together and to provide security and access to important areas I of discrimination and equal rights legislation in this country. I want to spend some time reminding the House why these amendments are so necessary. It is a great tribute to the Labor governments in this country that we are dealing with such legislation. It is important that honourable members remind themselves that these amendments are important because every day in Australia people suffer discrimination. The legislation provides for conciliation and processes to enforce determinations, thus sending a strong signal to individuals, employers and groups in the community that discrimination on the grounds of race, sex or disability is no longer acceptable in our society. I would like to give the House some illustrations of discrimination from my own professional experience. I recall attending a dinner with management and executives of a state government instrumentality-people whose managerial competence I had a great deal of admiration for. At that dinner they criticised the sex discrimination legislation, suggesting that it really was no longer necessary because there was no sex discrimination in the workplace-not on their behalf anyway! A lively discussion ensued and, being the only woman-the first woman on the board of this statutory authority-I lobbed shots across the dinner table. It is important to remember that every day 1 in most workplaces women have to deal with discriminatory practices. I have been in· work force since I was 12, so'l have had few discriminatory experiences. The stories have heard from women in, the work force . indicate the real importance of this legislation. These experiences have impacted not only the way people did their work but on their life her legs'. experiences. I refer to the young girl who was subjected to continual harassment at her workplace, which culminated in her employer demanding oral sex from her. This young girl was very vulnerable, having already experienced other forms of sexual abuse away from the workhaqdle place in her family of origin. That experience led her to leave that job in which she was gaining confidence, and affected her choice of partner. It was not until she had counselling to deal with the trauma of those experiences that she began to make more effective choices in other aspects of her life. I refer to the very competently qualified female engineer who was put in a position authority over a number of male colleagues and had to work away from the city. In the course of that work, following a period socialising, she was drugged, violently atordered tacked and, effectively, raped. When she attempted to seek redress through her senior people, the boys closed ranks and she was made to feel the guilty party. She was unable to obtain redress, which caused her to leave the fie1dof work in which she was extremely competent. She had to carry that burden ty completely unresolved until further situations in her work brought her into contact counselling, where she was able to deal with these kinds of experiences. As a counsellor who spent a lot of time dealing with clients who suffered just about every form of sexual harassment and abuse, I felt extremely angry about that girl's situation because her career was completely destroyed by that experience. We have to remind ourselves that, even with legislation in place, it is not always - asy for people to seek redress in law. I can think of another example of a:yQung woman at university. I was told this story a nephew of this young woman who attended the same engineering course. This goes back 10 years when there were not so many young the women doing a first year engineering degree a at a well-known university in my state. One I day this young woman walked into the lecture theatre, and written on the board by her male peers was the line, 'Would Joan Smith' - not on her real name-'pleasewear a bra and shave This incident was related to me with much mirth' but "" it resulted in that young student withdrawing from that engineering course. I do not know what she is doing now, but we have probably lost a very competent engineering professional because the boys could not the fact that she was a female who did not conform to their;>tereotype of what a female engineering student should be like. I would also like to tell honourable members about women who are out of the work force who find, even today, when they breastfeed their babies in public, that they are subject to threats, hostility and harassment.! thought that orily happened years ago, at a of time when I was breastfeeding my babies in public and was subjected to that kind of thing. The most recent incident occurred in Westof ern Australia when a young inother was off a bus for doing the most natural thing in the world-in fact, the activity which has nurtured the human race. Being mammals we suckle our young, and that has probably got most of us-including the shadow Attorney-General-where we are today. The fact that such things still happen in our communiindicates that we have a great deal more to do. Not only must we have this legislation, with but we must educate people. I was recently at a mine site 'for a professional meeting with senior management regarding a person who had been injured at work. Prior to the meeting being opened, one of my male colleagues indicated the calendar on the wall and said, 'Well, where is the bottom half of it?'. This comment was addressed to a senior management person at a major coal production facility in the Bowen Basin. When I tentatively expressed my concern about calendars on the work site by which were inappropriate in these days, I was accosted with the comment, 'Well, this is the way it is. You can't do anything any more. You can't put your hand on a woman. You can't call them ""love"" or anything'. This sort of response when women challenge sexist material in a workplace is still very widespread. The fact that young male students are still being 'greased' on work experience and accept that it is okay, and the fact that they are still unaware that they are harassing their peers in high school until it is drawn to attention, indicates that we have a very long way to go when it comes to dealing with discrimination in our community. If we do not have the sort of excellent legislation that is the proud record of this government, and if we do not continue to make the important technical amendments that will allow access to effective justice in these areas, we will continue to have discrimination on the basis of sex, race and disability. That is' not acceptable in 1993, and we must continue to work very hard to deal with this issue. I commend the legislation to the House and oppose the amendment from the opposition.",96
147,Mr SLIPPER,LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION,"The Law and Justice Legislation AmendlTlent Bill is an omnibus bill. Earlier today I spoke on another. In this case the government is seeking to amend five bills-the Disability Discrimination Act 1992, the Racial Discrimination Act, the Sex Discrimination Act, the Privacy Act and the High Court of Australia Act. Basically, the bill proposes to make a number of changes to these various items of legislation, some of which are of a mechanical nature, some of which are of a more substantive nature and some of which simply rectify earlier sloppy drafting procedures. In the course of the debate, a number of honourable members criticised the swiftness with which legislation is sent through the House, leaving no time for adequate debate. There is not an adequate opportunity to consider individual items. The imposition of the guillotine has often meant that we do not have an adequate committee stage; consequently, various clauses are not subjected to the scrutiny they should be. The absence of that scrutiny has meant that these clauses have passed into legislation, and then the relevant minister has to come back before the parliament to seek to change the legislation make it to what it should have been from day one. Some of the bills being amended were enacted by this parliament pursuant to the external affairs power given by the High Court through its very generous interpretation of that power. I suppose a lot of those bills their have now become enshrined in the statute books. At the time they were introduced they were matters of great controversy-the Sex Discrimination Act, the Racial Discrimination Act and so on. It does concern me that in Australia we have a situation where the High Court has decided, through judicial interpretation, that the federal government can now enter into a treaty with virtually any nation anywhere in the world and thereby acquire the domestic competence to legislate, even though under our Australian federal constitution the matter which is the subject of such legislation would normally be a matter of state responsibility. So the High Court judges, I suppose, have tom up the constitution as we knew it. This is an ongoing problem, and it will probably remain so until we have a constitutional amendment in relation to the external affairs power. However, given the difficulty that governments of both political persuasions have had in changing the constitution through this mechanism, it is a problem that will probably endure. The Disability Discrimination Act was brought into being partly because of Australia's obligations under a number of UN instruments, including the ILO convention on discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. That is one of the bills which became law through the fairly generous interpretation of the provisions in the constitution. This particular act puts certain procedures in place, but unfortunately those procedures could well be Oawed constitutionally. The 1992 legislation created difficulties which unfortunately have not yet been resolved, and are not resolved by this legislation. The 1992 legislation effectively allowed the commission's determinations to have the same effect as a Federal Court order. Therefore, the commission is allowed to make binding to judicial orders, and this provision is believed to breach the constitutional separation of powers. Under the earlier legislation, while the commission was able to make orders, the orders were not binding. As s1,lch, that was not seen to be a breach of the constitutional separation of powers. The government really stands condemned for failing to take the opportunity to rectify this particular matter by this omnibus bill. Generally speaking, I am opposed to the sorts of omnibus bills we have had but, if we are to have them, we really should take the opportunity to rectify matters which clearly require rectification. However, we do not oppose the extension of the time limit-currently 28 days; in effect, 21 days-during which a respondent is able to appeal to the Federal Court to review a determination of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. I think it is only reasonable that this discretion should be given to the Federal Court in exceptional circumstances to enable a person aggrieved by a decision of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to apply for a review. I might add that this omnibus bill includes similar provisions for the extension of the time limit of 28 days pursuant to the Racial Discrimination Act and the Sex Discrimination Act. I must also say that I have some concerns about the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. Those of us who read the newspapers-members of parliament probably 'read more newspapers than most peoplehave found that many people have been upset by decisions of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. At times that commission has appeared to be a kangaroo court. Personally, 1 think that if a person is alleged to have breached' a law of this country that person ought to have access to the ordinary courts of the land. In this I am consistent with my approach to industrial relations where I believe that industrial relations and the question of damages flowing from unlawful industrial action should be dealt with in the ordinary courts of the land rather than in special courts-which of course is the government's policy. Special courts lead one to the suspicion that there are special rules for special people and that there are deals. Under the Privacy Act there are some new provisions, clauses 10 to 13, which include new procedures for the making of and dealing with representative complaints similar to those available under the Disability Discrimination Act, the Racial Discrimination Act and the Sex Discrimination Act. Clause 11 sets out the conditions to be satisfied before a representative complaint may be lodged. These conditions include the fact that class members must have a complaint against the same person, all complaints must arise out of the same, similar or related circumstances and that all complaints give rise to a substantial common issue of law or fact. Proposed subsection 38(3) provides that a representative complaint may be lodged without the consent of a class member, and the system of representative actions proposed .by the bill is an opt-out system. We on this side of the House believe that an opt-in system would be much better, because it is quite wrong that a person could be deemed to. be involved. A person really should make the decision to be part of the action. I support the amendments proposed by the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams). Mention has been made by my colleague the honourable member for Capricotnia (Ms Henzell) of the Sex Discrimination Act. In any reasonable society, no honourable member in this parliament would support discrimination on the basis of gender or on any other basis. However, while the cases outlined by the honourable member were in some instances very uns-voury and very unsatisfactory, at times I think that people can go a little overboard. After all, the honourable member for Capricornia is here in this place performing an equal role with her male and female colleagues, and that is exactly the way it should be. I have been opposed to affirmative action legislation because quite often I think it can be demeaning to women if the token woman is put in. We need the right people for the job, whether people happen to be male or female. The paramount consideration for appointment to any position must be that of merit and not of gender. 1 stress that I am totally in favour of equal opportunity. The bill that we are discussing changes the date for the application of provisions relating to making superannuation funds non-discriminatory. The provisions in the bill to that effect are fairly unexceptional. The reason for the extension to the time given under the original legislation was that the superannuation funds needed a longer period to put options before members so that the nondiscriminatory intention of the original act could be brought in in an orderly way, and one would not oppose that. This is a grab-bag of provisions. It is almost as though someone in the minister's department sat down and said, 'We found this mistake and we found that fault, and we found that a particular draftsman did not possibly dot his or her i's and cross his or her t's as would be required', with the result that we have legislation that is ineffective or somewhat flawed. 1 read the speech made by my colleague Senator Vanstone who, 1 thought, was extraordinarily generous to public servants. She, quite reasonably, put most of the blame in the direction of the government for mistakes in drafting because of the way the government runs the program of the parliament. She said that the government does not give adequate time to draftsmen to enable them to bring forward legislation of the sort that we really need without the faults and defects that unfortunately are now so common. But 1 think it is not unreasonable for the government to approach the drafting agency and say that the mistakes that have been creeping into the legislation are not acceptable, and 1 think those officers ought to look at their own practices. The government should be coming forward with some definitive answers for us as parliamentarians as to why these mistakes are occurring. The opposition is not opposing the substance of most of the provisions of the bill. The honourable member for Tangney has proposed certain amendments and 1 support them. 1 certainly hope that the government will consider adopting them because 1 feel that, unless the government is more reasonable in this place and seriously considers amendments that we seek to make to its legislation, we will have more omnibus bills having to correct more mistakes. If we have a reasonable opportunity for debate, if the government allows the parliament to look at its legislation clause by clause, then a lot of the mistakes which now have to be rectified would not be made in the first place. '",99
148,Mr DUNCAN,LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION," I want to respond to some of the points that have been made tonight. Before doing so, 1 thank all members that have contributed to this debate, particularly, in his usual thoughtful way, the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams). 1 also want to say how pleased I was to listen to the contribution of the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) who, in his reincarnated guise, is certainly a calmer parliamentary animal than the one we used to see some little time ago. At the outset 1 want to deal with the point that the honourable member for Fisher made before he concluded because 1 thought it was somewhat disingenuous. The amendments that have been proposed by the ,honourable member for Tangney contain what 1 call a philosophical position. They are in no way related to mistakes or omissions or any otherproblems with legislation that has gone through this parliament. So to suggest that the reason that these amendments h,ave to be moved is that at some time in the past mistakes have been made because legislation has been rushed through the parliament, or some other such suggestion, is completely false. The general thrust of some of the comments that were made by opposition speakers on this omnibus bill was that it repairs either mistakes that have been made or drafting errors which have been ascertained because of legal advice or possibly in some cases because of court decisions. It is a bit disingenuous of the opposition to be crying crocodile tears about these sorts of matters. 1 can say from my long experience in this place and in the South Australian parliament, both in opposition and in government",101
149,Mr SLIPPER,LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION,I bet you're pleased you are not there. now.,102
150,Mr DUNCAN,LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION,"I am particularly delighted, if I can respond to that, that I am not there now. The point is that these mistakes do happen. At orie time members actually used to diaft their oWn pieces of legislation. I do not think that we need to be any great students of history· to know that it got to the stage where some of the pieces of legislation were so"" pre-dfully drafted that they did not achieve anything like what was desirable or intended. . , . , A little time later we then had the period where members relied heavily on the good offices of the clerks of the parliament for drafting advice., Again, it was found after some time that that was not entirely appropriate. The position that was originally called parliamentary draftsman-now known, in this place anyway, as parliamentary counselcame to the fore. For many years now legislation has been specially drafted by such people. But these experts in this area of parliamentary or \egislativedrlifting are not perfectionists. They are not absolutely perfect, of course. They are human like the rest of us. With the best will, intention and care, inevitably mistakes will be made. Sometimes they are not mistakes of the parliamentary counsel's"" office. Not infrequently mistakes which need to be corrected' are made in the printing and production processes as well. Then of course there are· changes which are necessary as a result of statutory interpretation by the courts. These things are perfectly normal. They are not out of the ordinary. Each and every one of us know that that is the case. As long as there is a parliament-I hope that will be for a very long time-there will be situations where an omnibus bill, as it is so called, is needed to correct and adjust in a minor way statutory instruments. In the brief few minutes available to me, I want to deal with the main issues which were raised. Firstly, I refer to the issue of so-called separation of powers. I noticed that this was raised by some senators and was raised again tonight by the honourable member for Fisher. I want to make the point that nothing in this bill before the parliament will be struck down as being in breach of the separation of powers doctrine. Upon review, the Federal Court could review· all issues of fact and law. The respondent 'would be, a,ble to adduce new evidence but only with the leave of the court. The court would have full control .of the disposition of the matter where a respondent had chosen to contest' the determination of the tribunal. The scheme is basically analogous to the procedures concerning judgments in default of appearance or defence in an ordinary civil court. In principle, there is no relevant distinction between these procedures and. the main features of the proposed provisions. In other words, although a determination will be lllade by the tribunal, its determination cannot be enforced therein. It must be registered in the Federal Court. As I said a couple of moments ago, that will then enable the Federal Court, after reviewing the det-rmination, to enforce it once the Federal. Court has adopted it. So I reject the suggestion that there is a breach in any way of the doctrine of the separation of powers.",102
151,Mr SLIPPER,LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION,"I didn't say that in relation to this bill; I said that this bill does not pick up the problem that was created in the early legislation. MrDUNCAN-As I said, I believe that this legislation does not affect any breach of the separation of powers doctrine. We are dealing with this particular piece of legislation and, as such, I do not think the points that were made in the Senate or here tonight are valid. I now want to deal with the so-called issue of opting in or opting out. I think it - can be said that this is an important philosophical issue between the opposition and the government. We believe that, if there is to be class actions-over a period class actions have become more and more available in this country; personally, I think that is a step in the right direction and that class actions should have been made more readily available in this country long ago-we must choose to have either what is known as an opting-in or an opting-out procedure. In other words, where an action is to be taken by a person on behalf of a class of persons, there should either be a procedure whereby the person taking the action ropes in as many persons of the class with their knowledge and consent as he or she could contact or, alternatively, we should have a procedure where the person taking the action does so on behalf of all the people in the class-known or otherwise-and those people then, by various procedures, are able to opt out should they want to and take their own proceedings if they choose to. This is one of those choices that one often has to make in law or legislation which is superficially difficult because of arguments in favour of each side. But, overwhelmingly, the strength of the arguments is in favour of the arrangements which are known as opting out because that procedure is the best option to ensure that the rights. of the class are not abrogated, are not extinguished and are assisted. That option is particularly useful in terms of equity because there are many people in classes. When we are dealing with the privacy laws, quite clearly it would be very unfair if there were, for example, to be an unlawful disclosure of a list of names and only ·some of those people were able to be included in the class simply because they were too poor to take action on their own or were not able to take action. Allegations of interferences with privacy may lead to the conclusion that not only the complainant but all members of the class have been affected by the act or practice. All of those people ought to be able to be part of that action unless they specifically wish to out. I say to the House that I believe that the government is wholly right on this matter. As I have said, the government believes that it is right on .the grounds of both equity and efficiency. In my view, opting out will allow more Australians to assert their rights and that should be the principle by which this parliament approaches this sort of question. Frankly, I think that opting-in procedures are not a practical alternative because obviously unworkable where there are large numbers of complainants. Opting-in procedures disadvantage the poor and the less well educated. As a policy we ought to try to assist the poor and those less able to look after themselves. That is certainly what an opt-out procedure allows to happen. An opt-out inquiry will inevitably be simpler and cheaper to run than cases involving large numbers of named and identified complainants. This system basically works in the United States at the federal level. It has worked there for a long period and has been found to be effective. I think the efficacy of it is now beyond question. In the. context of court proceedings, the manifest inadequacies of an opt-in approach have already been recognised by the courts through the development of the representative actions procedure, which I think now exists in most of the supreme courts around the nation. Opt-out benefits respond by allowing",102

155,Mr ALDRED,ADJOURNMENT,"At the risk of seeming alarmist, may I take the opportunity to plead w-th honourabl- !llembers in this place and with all Australians for a united effort to achieve stricter censorship of films, television programs, videos and video games in order to ensure the well-being of future generations. Although theoretically all. is squeaky clean in this regard and we are told that decent standards are more stringently applied here than in comparable Western nations, the fact remains that too many of the vulnerable members of our community, especially' the young, are being bombarded constantly by violently graphic visual material with which they cannot cope-sometimes with devastating consequences. Following the infamous Bulger case in Liverpool, England, video companies have been quick to react against general speculation that the R-rated video Child's Play 3, which was viewed in the home of one of the lO-year-old murderers of toddler James Bulger, was a contributing factor in the grisly torture and murder of the two-year-old. A direct link cannot be proved, that is true. But Mr Justice Morland, the judge presiding over that gruesome case, commented: It isn't for me to pass judgement on their upbringerotica, ing, but I suspect that exposure to violent video films may, in part, be an explanation. Much nearer to home, Paul Denyer, aged 21, of Frankston North, Victoria, was reported in the Melbourne Herald-Sun of 3 December 1993 as pleading guilty· to the bloody murder. of three young women aged 17, 18 and 22. Previously, on 31 July, Denyer admitted to the police that he got the idea of stabbing them in the throat from a movie called Stepfather 2. Many similar R-rated films are generally available in video shops and can be hired or purchased officially by persons of 18 years and over. In fact, many juveniles hire them or watch them at home after older people bring them in. This situation is far from new, Mr Speaker. In an article entitled 'Courts form nationwide protest' which appeared in the Sydney SunHerald of 22 December 1991, various judges commented in a similar vein on the effect of R-rated, X-rated and hard-core pornography films and literature on rapists and murderers. Judge Hart and Judge 'O'Shea of the Melbourne County Court, Justice Matthews and Justice O'Brien of the Sydney Central Criminal Court, Justice Cosgrove, of the Burnie Criminal Court, Justice Sir William Kearney of the Northern Territory Supreme Court, Justice Jacobs of the South Australian Court of Criminal Appeal and former Justice MCGarvie of the Victorian Supreme Courtnow the Governor of Victoria-were all quoted in the article as stressing the relationship between the viewing of such .material with violent crimes by susceptible people. I highlight one comment by Justice Matthews. After hearing the case of teen!lger Darryl Phillips, who murdered a woman by stabbing her 18 times subsequent to watching the violent film Nightmare at Shadow Woods, he said: It is not so easy to absolve a system which allows for such a violent and unmeritorious film. , . to be viewed indiscriminately by members of the community, regardless of their underlying problems and susceptibilities. Unfortunately, in the short time available I am unable to deal with the so-called non-violent rated X, which is produced in the ACT; hard-core porn, which infiltrates the country from overseas; or video games, which have recently been the subject of a Senatselect committee inquiry which sharply criticised the looseness of draft guidelines regulating such games. However, may I suggest that our code of censorship-which, according to the Office of the Chief Censor, is based on what is acceptable to the 'average, reasonable person' - is flawed. Perhaps it is time that average, reasonable families, who are probably not interested in such material anyway, are protected from the few hundred or few thousand who are neither average nor reasonable nor able to cope with violent or sexually explicit material. If we do not, we may find that average, reasonable people will no longer be safe in homes or streets. Richmond Secondary College",104
156,Mr TANNER,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to raise the matter of the circumstances associated with recent picket line problems at the Richmond Secondary College, which honourable members may have seen in TV coverage. There has been very serious violence on the picket line both yesterday and, to a lesser extent, today. I am extremely disturbed at the fact that this is occurring in my electorate and that the approach now being taken by the police resembles that which was taken in demonstrations back in perhaps the late 1960s and early 1970s, but which, under both Liberal and Labor governments since then, had become much more moderate. In particular, I refer to the use of batons the police yesterday. They were lining up and chanting at demonstrators and, attacking them with batons. Fortunately, that behaviour seems to have moderated a bit today, but I am still extremely disturbed by the developments. I am particularly worried that we are now seeing a return to a much more confrontationist approach by police in their dealings with picket lines and demonstrators. As I indicated, it is a return to the sort of approach that led to very serious violence in demonstrations in the early 1970s-for example, the Springbok tour demonstrations. To its credit, under the Hamer government this approach moderated substantially and in the late 1970s we saw a situation where the approach of police at demonstrations was much more moderate and sensible. Therefore, public protest and civil disobedience was able to occur in circumstances which rarely led to significant violence. I am concerned that what we are now witnessing at the Richmond Secondary College is a return to the bad old days of serious confrontation and considerable violence. I am also concerned at the fact that the state government, in its political approach to the very serious problem at the Richmond Secondary College, is targeting a number of demonstrators-a number of individuals-because of their membership of particular political organisations.",105
157,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! Whilst not wishing to necessarily interrupt the flow of the contribution by the honourable member for Melbourne tonight, he might be careful and wary in what he says in this place in respect of this particular matter as I understand that there are some charges that may be pending as a result of the activities to which he is referring. Of course, we would not want to impede justice in any way",105
158,Mr TANNER,ADJOURNMENT,"-'-I am fully aware of that, Mr Speaker. In fact, I was intending to refer not to individuals with respect to charges but to the fact that the state government has made a political attack, indicating that there is something wrong with the cause involved because of individuals who happen to have associated themselves with that cause. I am by very aware of the fact that reflecting on particular matters likely to come before the judicial system is not appropriate. What worries me is that in some way the state government seeks to discredit the cause, which is a very worthwhile cause-that is, maintaining co-educational public education in the suburb of Richmond. Individuals are being singled out as belonging to particular hardline political groups and that supposedly indicates that the cause with which they have associated. themselves is in some way devalued or not worthwhile. I can personally vouch for the fact that a good many ordinary local people in Richmond are strongly involved with the Richmond Secondary College campaign. They have been involved in the occupation and have been involved in the telephone tree in order to ensure that the presence can be maintained there. Indeed, one of my own staff has been involved. Until recently, she was a councillor with the Richmond City Council and has been active in the Richmond .area for a good number of years. . The Richmond City Council, which recently indicated that it felt that the protesters should give way to the decision of the state government, has now passed a resolution condemning the violence that has occurred. It condemned the activities of the police yesterday and called on the state government to engage in serious negotiations around a resolution that has been developed by the Trades Hall Council, the protesters, and also the council which is designed to ensure that co-educational education can remain in Richmond. I conclude by indicating that the state government is treading a very dangerous path if it continues in this approach to what is very serious issue. The issue' of education in this area is of fundamental importance and it is treated in such a violent and confrontationist way, when there are obviously peopie deeply committed to ensuring that children in that area continue to have' reasonable access to education, the state government will reap the whirlwind in years to come. Rajski, Mr L.",105
159,Mr MACK,ADJOURNMENT,"North Sydney) (11.40 p.m.)Mr Speaker, it is recognised that the Australshould Ian legal system is a largely self-serving mechanism to protect the poweiful. The costs are such that the law is mostly available only to the rich or those using. other people's money. The time frame of the operation the courts in effect denies justice and, given Waldron. the number of acquittals, either many guilty persons go free or the authorities charge innocent people. But there is no greater condemnation of legal system than the struggle for justice over 13 years by Leszek Rajski. This notorious litigation began in 1980 with a breach of contract action brought by a company called Tectran against Rajski and his company Raybos, leading to a number of subsequent actions. Rajski has sued a number of associattheir ed companies: Tectran, Scitec and Gavemer much' alive. Properties. He is also suing their directors and solicitors on the grounds of conspiracy and abuse of process. The web of intrigue' and manoeuvres since 1980 has not only brought into question the integrity of legal firms such as Allen Allen and Hemsley and Blake Dawson Waldron, bilt also the effectiveness of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, the Australian Stock Exchange and the Australian Securities Comas mission. These huge and poweifullegal firms dollars. have for years manipulated the processes of the Supreme Court and have prevented the fair resolution of the Tectran v Raybos litigahave tion. Their manipulation has prevented justice being done between the weak and poweiful and prevented the exposure of those law firms' perversion of thejustice process. It has also brought into disrepute the court which has allowed it to happen. The failure a of the court to deal expeditiously with this case is having national ramjficlltions. Encourif aged by that failure,. one of the parties has . been emboldened to engage in a persistent and dangerous deception affecting the investing public and the integrity of the institutions supposed to protect the investing public-the Australian Stock Exchange· and the Australian Securities Commission. In July 1993, the New South Wales Court of Appeal finally made clear that Rajski's conspiracy and abuse of process allegations be heard at the' same time as the Tectran v Raybos breach of contract action. This action, he alleges,. was a fraudulent concoction by Tectran and its original lawyers, Allen Allen and Hemsley, and mainof tained by its later lawyers, Blake Dawson It is no accident that, since the judgment of many the court of appeal opened the way to a proper hearing of Rajski's allegations, Allen our Allen and Hemsley have moved to negotiate a settlement of Rajski's claim-after 13 years. However, ultimately Rajski's claim is against the Tectran interests. Tectran and the old Scitec are now nothing more than a shell. To secure his position, in 1987 Rajski began proceedings in the Supreme Court against successors. These proceedings are very What has this got to do with the Australian Stock Exchange and the Australian Securities Commission? Scitec Communication Systems Ltd is listed on the Stock Exchange, and under Stock Exchange rules potential liability should be disclosed in annual reports. It should do that in its latest prospectus by which it is currently seeking to raise large sums from the investing public, particularly the potential liability runs into millions of Although the manoeuvres and delays have kept Rajski and Scitec out of court, he does a judgment that a prima facie case exists against the Tectran interest and its lawyers. Scitec either does not acknowledge the existence of this potential liability, or denies it is 'material' within the meaning of the Companies Code. The somewhat vague and commercial provision of the Companies Code is being used as a loophole to refuse to disclose information which investors need if they are to be properly informed. Nevertheless the Australian Securities Commission has queried Scitec's failure to disclose in its annual returns the serious contingency liability it carries because of its involvement in this litigation. In response, Scitec has told the commission that it has legal advice that the contingency liability litigation is not 'material' and therefore need not be reported in its annual report. But can there really be any public confidence in the commission giving a dispassionate judgment when its chairman is a senior partner in one of the legal firms being sued? This case highlights the question of the appropriateness of appointing practising professionals to the Australian Securities Commission from areas which the commission is supposed to supervise. Forest Hardwood Products: Exports",106
160,Mr VAILE,ADJOURNMENT," Mr Speaker, tonight I would like to bring to the attention of the House, and also put on record my support for, a local export project that looks likely to make a significant impact on local industry on the mid-north coast of New South Wales. The project I refer to was undertaken by the New South Wales Forest Products Association and is titled 'Market Opportunities on the West Coast of the USA for Flooring Milled from NSW Hardwoods'. Last week I attended the launch of this project at Cassegrains winery at Port Macquarie, and I was pleased to see the widespread support from the community that this project received. It was also pleasing to see the honourable member for Patterson (Mr Home) attending the opening and putting his support behind this project. The project has been principally funded by the mid-north coast Office of Labour Market Adjustment, and I congratulate that office for its contribution to the project. It is more projects such as this that will generate truly that practical solutions to the employment problems on the mid-north coast of New South Wales. It should be pointed out that these projects have been successfully running for some time without any jobs levy of any kind. Three representatives of the New South Wales hardwood sawmilling industry played an integral role in the formation of the report. These people were Doug Head of Kempsey Timbers, David Prestwidge from the New South Wales Forest Products Association, and Richard Sims, manager of Upper Hunter River Timbers. These three people deserve congratulations for their practical and realistic initiatives towards the export of hardwoods to the United States of America. I have examined the report and it is very well compiled. It provides a comprehensive overview of the US hardwood flooring market, including an analysis of its size, growth, structure and value. The report also covers issues such as distribution regulation, environmental considerations, technical requirements, and promotion and marketing, and relates all of these elements back to the potential for the New South Wales manufactured product. The report includes recommendations pertaining to manufacturing guidelines, packaging, labelling, documentation, transportation and distribution of exported hardwood to satisfy US regulations. The main issue to come from the report is that US hardwood markets are immediately viable, and that other markets such as Europe and Asia are at least as effective. The research has revealed a market worth a massive $A750 million per annum in the US for solid strip hardwood flooring, forecast to grow to possibly twice this size by the tum of the century. This is a great opportunity for hardwood millers on the mid-north coast of New South Wales. As the report itself concludes, there are genuine and viable opportunities for New South Wales hardwood millers. From the project team's visit to several US east coast sawmilling and manufacturing operations, it became clear that they are faced with many of the same problems that are experienced in New South Wales hardwood mills. For example, maximising recovery of saleable product from low-grade logs and the profitable utilisation of short length amI/or low-grade material poses the same challenges to the US as it does here. In response to these problems, the US has developed and educated markets to suit the material. As a consequence, US sawmillers are engaging in a high level of further processing to add value to a traditionally low value product. Australian sawmillers could significantly benefit from such a strategy, given the current underutilisation of short length material on the domestic market. By way of comparison, in the US, lumber will not leave the local town until all possible dollars have been squeezed out of it. In Australia, the timber is cut down and more often than not sent in its raw form, and that is the last we see of it. From an employment point of view the comparison is startling. For the same volume of timber in both countries, the US employs 10 times as many people as Australia. This includes a diverse cross section of jobs including quality assurance, grading and classifying, exporting, design and marketing, and trade, as well as the traditional labouring jobs. In Australia, this of industry employment is not nearly as well developed. This is a lesson not only for the timber industry, but for the rural community in general. There needs to be an increase in the level of local manufacturing and processing of our raw materials, together with further development of local value-adding facilities. This will not only increase rural and regional employment prospects, but will also improve the economic outlook of regional New South Wales. I welcome this project as an extremely thorough and practical insight into the opportunities available for exports to the USA. Too often we on this side of the House are critical. However, this evening I congratulate all involved in this project, and I look forward to seeing more products of a similar nature that will help industry on the mid north coast develop to its full potential. Company Takeovers",107
161,Mr KATTER,ADJOURNMENT,"Kennedy) (11.50 p.m.)The birds of carrion are flying around the skies of North Queensland. The vultures are circling. Jaquita closes in on the banana industry, Tate and Lyle closes in on the sugar industry and Conagra closes in on the giant beef industry Of Australia. Each of these companies is an international commodities broker of giant size and has predatory practices as part of its modus operandi in all of its operations throughout the world. The Bundaberg Sugar Company, as)lbsidiary of Tate and Lyle, through its subsidiary BNQ, has contemptuously made a takeover bid for both Tully and South Johnstone mills. This intention was made known on 18 October. The bid is most unwelcome and completely undervalues the shares in both milling organisations. It behoves me to put on the record this evening the rather brilliant front cover of the Tully TImes in which an assessment of this bid is made. I do not have the time to read out that article this evening, although I do pay tribute to the editor of the newspaper, Bruce Dickson, for the intense work that he has done in most successfully exposing the undercross-section valuation of these shares. Tate and Lyle took over the Bundaberg Sugar Company in.1991. Since that time the performance of the six sugar mills-three of which are in Bundaberg, one in Nambour, one in Innisfail and one in Babinda-has deteriorated markedly to the extent where the mills have been subject to continuous breakdowns and delays to crushing operations, thus incurring losses to the growers supplying those mills. The dismal problems have put at risk the crushing of all of the cane at Babinda, Nambour and the Bundaberg mills. There has been some wet weather effect in these areas, but of higher importance are the delays from breakdown and processing problems. I must emphasise that I am not in any way criticising the workers in any"" of these mills. This is just a failure to ou-lay the necessary funds and bring in the maintenance people who need to be brought in on a regular basis. In addition, Babinda and Mourilyan mills have had serious accidents which have caused Division of Workplace Health and Safety representatives to closely examine safety operations of the two mills under the terms of the Workplace Health and Safety Act. In a recent case, it is tragic to report that an employee of Babinda mill who was cleaning in the area of the milling unit fell through open walkway and his leg was drawn into the crushing rollers of the milling unit. He, of course, lost his leg. This sort of accident is almost without precedence in sugar mills; they were until recently extremely safe places of work. There was a similar unreported incident at Babinda which could have resulted in similar circumstances. The week prior to the unfortunate incident with the man'- leg, Queensland Rail's Sunlander ran into a cane train crossing the Queensland railway into Babinda mill. Fortunately, nobody was injured in this incident, but once again this highlights the manner in which panic, induced by poor management of crushing operations to complete the 1993 crushing by this mill, has caused the failure of application of normal safety procedures. Within two to three days of the unfortunate incident at Babinda where a man lost his leg, two employees of Mourilyan mill were burnt with hot juice flowing from a conduit in the factory. This clearly demonstrates again that workplace health and safety matters need to be very closely examined in mills owned by Tate and Lyle. The delays to the crushing at Babinda mill will cause significant losses to Babinda growers, and the fact that approximately 100,000 tonnes of cane will be left to rot in the fields supplying the Moreton mill Nambour must be of grave concern to the cane growing community. The Bundaberg area is currently being subjected to industrial action over the failure of an enterprise bargaining agreement, which will cause further delays to the termination of the crushing season and possibly cause cane to be left in the fields there as well. It is very clear that the performance of all Tate and Lyle mills in Australia has deteriorated significantly since that company took over Bundaberg Sugar. To this effect, five of the seven mills still crushing cane in Queensland belong to Bundaberg Sugar. Other mills with larger quantities of cane crushed have completed their crushing seasons over the last three weeks and have been subject to similar lost time through wet weather. Some of these mills are grower owned and an crushed record tonnages of cane. Two of these mills are South Johnstone and Tully, the subject of the current takeover bids. In 1993 Tully mill crushed a record of almost 1.6 million tonnes and South Johnstone crushed a record of almost 1.1 million tonnes, in periods which are proven to be economic crushing season lengths for cane growers. Both South Johnstone and Tully are extremely well managed, highly efficient mills arid are essentially free of industrial troubles. Their operations are controlled by boards of directors who are themselves cane farmers. The high level of operating efficiency of these two mills has been the result of balanced fiscal decisions relating to allocation of maintenance and capital expenditure. Both mills are producing high quality sugar which is sought after in world markets. Both mills are modem, high capacity units incorporating modem technology and operations. It is of concern that Tate and Lyle now wishes to take over two mills, and growers in these areas run the risk of having the current highly efficient units being progressively reduced to the standard of operations of the six Bundaberg mills. Surely a move which will reduce two top performing mills to a mediocre organisation must be a detriment to Australia. It is quite apparent that, whilst Tate and Lyle executives may be experts in other at areas of the sugar world, their expertise and management and ability to operate raw sugar mills is grossly deficient. Why should this purchase continue which will ultimately result in a further two mills being reduced in efficiency? Tate and Lyle's intention to extend its sugar industry in Australia means that other mills which are also operating efficiently will fall into the low performance category. South Johnstone mill, for instance, has spent $30 million in capital expenditure over the last 14 years and increased its crushing rate from approximately 380 tonnes per hour to a capability which will allow 500 tonnes per hour. This capital expenditure was used to improve milling capacity, sugar quality and recovery aspects and additionally reduce lost crushing time to the extent where in 1993 South Johnstone mill achieved lost time, excluding weather, of 3.3 per cent. (Time expired) Question· resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 11.55 p.m. The following notices were given: Mr CLEARY to move That this House calls for: (1) the immediate suspension of all nights to and from Essendon Airport; (2) the redevelopment of Point Cook as the replacement site for activities currently ring at Essendon and asks that appr()priate . funds be allocated for redevelopment of Point Cook and preservation of the surrounding buffer zone; (3) the eventual development of a second major airport for Melbourne to be sited in the Cranbourne region; (4) substantial Government assistance to be given to all Essendon Airport based industries to help with costs resulting from relocation and subsequent expansion; and (5) a firm timetable to be established for the earliest possible total closure of Essendon Airport.

162,Mrs KELLY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I am advised that information on this matter was Sought from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) and the Plastics Industry Association (PIA). While the PIA was able to provide data ill response to most of the questions, much of the information was not readily available for the periods, nor in the format requested. Further, the ability of the organisations approached to divulge information was limited by the commercial-in-confidence nature of the information sought. (I)(a) and (b) (i-v) According to the PIA (based on ABS and PIA estimates), approximately 297,340 tonnes of plastics were imported into Australia in 1991. Data for other years was not able to be provided. Domestic production of plastics in Australia during 1992 was estimated to be 703,160 tonnes (based on ABS and PIA estimates). Data for other years was not able to be provided. (2)(a) and (b) (i-iii) (A-E) Data provided by the PIA on Australian plastics consumption does not distinguish between imported and domestically produced plastic and does not define the end markets in terms of the industrial, commercial and part domestic sectors. According to the PIA, the major markets for plastics in Australia during 1992 were packaging (33% of total consumption), building (21%), and electrical and furniture (each 8%). A more detailed analysis of consumption patterns is presented in Table 1. Table 1. Consumption of plastic in 1992 by market. Market Packaging Building Electrical Furniture Automotive Agriculture Housewares Other transportation Tots, leisure & sport Clothing & Footwear Other Markets Total Source: Mitek 1992 and PIA estimates (3) (a) and (b) (i-v) According to the PIA, the most recent comprehensive survey of the recycling industry was undertaken by the PIA in 1991. There was a discrepancy between the amount of plastic collected for reprocessing/recycling (58,600 tonnes) and the amount re-processed i'1 1991 (57,388 tonnes). This apparent anomaly is accounted for by stocks of waste being carried over into the next year. Since this survey was conducted, there has been an increase in recycling of post-consumer waste, particularly for polyethyleneteraphthalate (PET), natural high density polyethylene (HOPE) and vinyl. Information on collection and recycling for the other years was not able to be provided. (4) (a-e) Based on industry estimates (Strategic Industry Research Analysis 1992), post-consumer waste constituted approximately 12% (6,789 Table 2.

Almost without exception, all of the plastic collected for recycling since recycling programs commenced has consisted of plastic packaging. It is only very recently that other plastic products have been recycled (for example, plastic coat hangers). (5) The types of plastic packaging collected for recycling included PET, HOPE, low density, polyethylene (LOPE), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polypropylene and polystyrene. (6) (a) and (b) (i-v) PET accounted for the largest proportion of total collected post-consumer plastic in 1991 (4,331 tonnes or 64%), followed by HOpe (1,653 tonnes. or 24%). A breakdown of plastic recycling by. polymer type is provided in Table 2. Information on the recycling of plastics for years other than 1991 was not able to be provided. for re-processing in 1991.

The recycling rate for 1992 was about 17%. Higher recycling rates have been achieved in some metropolitan centres, for example, in Melbourne PET recyclhlg is presently 29%. I (8) According to the PIA, recycled plastics are .used for the following purposes: PET-new beverage containers, non-food grade bottles for detergents and household cleaners, carpet and the manufacture of polyester fibres for pillows, comforters and stuffing; HDPE-'-non-food bottles, pipes and crates; LDPE-plastic film and bags; Vinyl-drain and stormwater pipes; Polypropylene-compost bins and drainage pipes; and Polystyrene-mixed with other resins for such products as kerb signs and park benches .. (9) The PIA· has advised that the quantity of plastics stockpiled varies according to market fluctuations. Collected plastic may be held over to the next year. Specific figures for stockpiled plastics are commercial-in-confidence. (to) In the past, plastics have been stockpiled both by contractors engaged for the collection of used plastics and by re-processors. The PIA was unable to provide any specific details on which companies may have held stockpiles during the periods referred to in Question 9. (11) (a) and (b) (i-v) According to the PIA (based on information from the Australian Bureau of Statistics cited in the Age 25 July 1993), the total amount of plastic waste exported during the period 1990-92 was 526.0 tonnes. Information on exports of specific polymers was not able to. be provided. (12) The PIA indicated that ACI Petalite and Smorgon Plastics exported PET plastic but did not provide information on exporters of other plastic types. (13) In the Asia-Pacific region, plastic waste exported to nine different countries (see Table 3 data on the quantities exported). The PIA has also indicated that PET plastic was exported to the United States and Asia. Table 3. Exports of plastic waste to the Asia Pacific region during 1990-92. Country of export .

(1) Which human rights conventions, reservations and declarations were discussed at the meeting of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General in Darwin on 24 June 1993 and with what outcomes. (2). When will the next meeting be held. (3) Which conventions, reservation and declarations are scheduled for discussion at the next meeting.

Mr LavarchThe .answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Commonwealth's written report placed before the rneeting of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General (SCAG) on 24 June 1993 referred to a number of human rights instruments. These include: the'draft Universal Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples;' the draft Declaration on Human Rights Defenders; the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the optional' process contained in that instrument; the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel Inhuman and Degrading Treatment .and Punishment, and, the optional processes contained in that instrument; The International Covenant on Civil and 'Political Rights and the optional processes contained in that instrument; the CO'1vention on the Rights of the Child; and, the proposed Convention on' Intercountry Adoption. The instruments Were not the subject of discussion at the meeting however members resolved to place'the Intercountry Adoption Convention as a separate item on the agenda for the following SCAG meeting that was held on 4 November 1993. (2) There was a meeting of SCAG in Sydney on 4 November 1993. The next meeting will beheld on 18 February 1994. (3) The Commonwealth's written report to SCAG for the meeting on 4 November 1993 referred to the following human rights instruments: . the draft Univer-al Declarati<;m on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples; the. draft Declaration on Human Rights Defenders; the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel Inhuman and Degrading Treatment and Punishment and the optional processes contained in that instrument; The International Covenant on Civil and Political, Rights and the optional processes contained in that instrument; the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the optional process contained in that instrument; the Convention on the Rights of the Child; the draft Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child; and the draft Standard Rules on the Equalisation of Opportunities for Disabled Persons. '(4) The constitutional validity of the. Racial . Discrimination Act was challenged by the State of Queensland in Koowarta v. Bjel,ke-Petersen (1982) 153 CLR 168. Victoria and Western Australia intervened to put arguments supporting the challenge. The Commonwealth, of course, argued for validity. Argument was heard by the Full Court of the High Court on 2' to 4 March 1982, and judgement delivered on 11 May 1982. The Court, by a majority of 4-3, upheld the validity of the Act on the basis that it was supported by the external affairs power (s.5I(xxix) of the Constitution). The Act was again challenged in the High Court in the case of University of Wollongong v. Metwally (1984) 158 CLR 447. The challenge was confined to an amendment to the Act made in 1983 which purported to retrospectively remove any inconsistency, for the purposes of s.109 of the Constitution, between the Act and laws of a State or Territory which furthered the objects of the Convention and which were capable of operating concurrently with the Act. (The amendment was prompted by an earlier decision of the High Court in Viskaukas v. Niland (1983) 153 CLR 280 which held that Part II of the Anti-Discrimination Act 1977 (NSW) was inconsistent with the Act). The challenge was brought by the University of Wollongong. The matter was heard by the Full Court of the High Court on 5 June 1984. The Commonwealth, New South Wales, South Australia and Western Australia supported the validity of the amendment before the Court. On 22 November 1984, the Court, by a majority of 4-3, held the amendment did not operate to give the NSW provisions a valid operation prior to the enactment of the amendment. I am not aware of any challenges to the validity of the Racial Discrimination Act in State or Territory courts. Police Vehicles: Sales Tax Exemptions (Question No. 289) Mr Filing asked the Assistant Treasurer, upon notice, on 19 August 1993: (1) Has the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) removed the sales tax exemption previously granted for vehicles used by the WA Police Department for community policing activities; if so, why. (2) Is he able to say whether the tax ruling, together with an increase in sales tax on non-luxury cars announced, in the 1993 Budget, will restrict the ability of the WA Police Force to conduct its usual community policing activities because fewer vehicles will be available. (3) Is the ATO able to exercise discretion in special circumstances so as to exempt a vehicle which is less than two years old or has travelled fewer than 40,000 kms; if not, why not.",113
164,Mr GEAR,LOPE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No. Under the new sales tax law, vehicles purchased or supplied for community policing work can still qualify for exemption provided the use of the vehicles is for at least two years or 40,000 kilometres of running. The old sales tax law did not specify how long goods had to be used in order to qualify for exemption. The administrative arrangement in operation, however, specified that vehicles had to be used for the exempt purpose for a period of two years or 40 000 kilometres of running. As the law did not specify any period of use for motor vehicles, it was difficult to enforce the administrative arrangement and exemption was sometimes conceded where the use of the vehicle was for less than a period of two years or 40 000 kilometres of running. This was the case with vehicles supplied for community policing work in Western Australia, where the vehicles were used for only twelve months for the exempt purpose before being returned to the dealer. Most exempt users, however, observed the two year/40 000 kilometres running test. The new sales tax law remains in line with the administrative arrangements under the' old law. (2) Whether the two years/40,000 kilometres requirement will resultin fewer vehicles being made available for community policing activlti- is a matter between the motor vehicle dealers who provide the vehicles and the WA Police Department.The requirement is the same as that which generally applied under the old law, and which most other exempt users observed and continue to observe. Where the use test is satisfied, the vehicles will be exempt from sales tax, in which case the increase' in the sales tax rate will not have an effect. (3) The Commissioner of Taxation has a discretion to determine a use time other than two years in special circumstances. However,' this discretion has to be exercised within the general intent of the law. It would be inappropriate for the Commissioner to exercise the discretion in a way which had the effect of lowering the statutory period of use required in the law. That would amount to the Commissioner making law rather than administering it. The exercise of the Commissioner's discretion is limited to those cases where, for example, due to harsh use, the life of a vehicle would be leSs than two years. This is not the situation with the vehicles used in the community policing program which generally are subjected to normal community use and, at the end of their period of use, are returned to dealers in a good condition. Asset Sales (Question No. 378)",115
165,Mr COSTELLO,LOPE,"the Minister for Finance, upori notice, on 27 September 1993: (1) Are asset sales from his DepartmenCs asset sales program treated as negative outlays in the 1993-94 Budget papers; if so, (a) why and (b) how long have Commonwealth asset sales been treated as negative outlays in the Budget papers. (2) Is he able to say (a) which member nations of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development treat asset sales by central governments as negative outlays in their budget papers and (b) what accounting method is used by each member nation which does not treat asset sales as negative outlays. (3) Did his Department advise him before the 1993-94 Budget was introduced that it might not be possible in 1993-94 to realise the sale of some assets listed for sale at page 3.273 of Budget No. I of 1993-94.",115
166,Mr WILLIS,LOPE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Asset sales are treated as offsets to outlays (often referred to as 'negative outlays') in Budget documents (a) The reason for this treatment is that it conforms to Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) government accounting standards which are based on recognised international standards. In the IMF 'Government Finance Statistics' government net loans and equity injections made for public policy reasons are treated as outlays in order to accurately measure the deficit. Under this standard, proceeds from the sale of government enterprises are classified as offsets to outlays. In the UN 'A System of National Accounts' net capital investment is treated as outlays to accurately measure movements in the stock of productive capital assets.

167,Mr COSTELLO,LOPE,"the Minister for Finance, upon notice, on 27 September 1993: Has he requested his Department to examine best practice benchmarking of Commonwealth Government portfolios; if so, has it done so.",116
168,Mr WILLIS,LOPE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is ·as follows: ·The Government has endorsed proposals, in the recent budget round, for benchmarking reviews in the Department of Employment, Education and Training, Social Security, Veterans' Affairs and the Customs Service. (b) The program of asset sales began in 1987-88 and the above treatments have been consistently applied to the proceeds from that program. In relation to other sales: The treatment of sales of physical assets was changed from revenue to offsets to outlays in the 1984-85 Budget Papers to more accurately reflect the. nature of net asset acquisition as a cost of .providing public goods and services and to more closely align with ABS standards. . Net advances to enterprises have been treated as outlays since at least the early 1970s, but significant sales of government enterprises did not occur until commencement of the program of asset sales. (2) The attached table outlines the treatments of asset sales in OECD countries that have introduced a significant program of asset sales. Classification of Asset Sales in Other OECD Countries under 'undistributed offsetting receipts' to outlays under 'government expenditure' of equity are classified as offset to outlays. Proceeds from the sale of non-equity portion of the asset are c1-ssified as revenue. Sales of fixed capital assets and sales of land and intangible assets are classified as revenue under 'capital revenue'. from sale are classified as revenue. A steering committee has been established comprising representatives from each of the line agencies and the Departments of Prime Minister and Cabinet and Finance. The Department of Industrial Relations is also participating on the basis of the expertise they have developed in benchmarking through the Government's Best Practice Demonstration Program. My department is chairing that Committee. Benchmarking within Departments and agencies is consistent with the efforts of the Government's Management Advisory Board (MAB) to promote a culture of continuous improvement within the Australian Public Service.

172,Mr WILLIS,LCWP,"The. answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Yes, a private sector real estate agent was employed during 1992 to assist with negotiating accommodation arrangements .. (a) Australian Property Group (APG) was requested in early 1992 to review the real estate market in Perth for the Regional Office, however, the range of properties offered was limited. As Departments were no longer tied to APG, the Regional Manager decided to test the market with the assistance of a private real estate agent with a view to increasing the options available for consideration. The service and initial advice received from the chosen agent identified a broader range of options which were better oriented to the Regional Office's requirements. (b) Yes.

(2) Is logging continuing in Compartment 1402 of the Nalbaugh State Forest. (3) Is it a fact that Compartment 1402 contains otherwise poorly conserved old growth brown barrel eucalypt forest with some trees between 400 and 800 years old. (4) Did the NSW Forestry Commission recently clear-fell Compartments 1405, 1406 and 1407 which adjoin Compartment 1402 and share its heritage and wilderness listings; if so, was the felling in contravention of the National Forest Policy commitments by the Commonwealth and NSW Governments to protect old growth and wilderness forests. (5) Will she visit the areas urgently with representatives of the South East Forest Alliance to see for herself the devastation being wrought on old growth forests; if not, why not. (6) Has she sought advice on preventing logging in Compartment 1402 and other old growth and wilderness forests nominated for protection by her in accordance with the National Forest Policy since I raised the issue with her on 17 August 1993; if so, what advice has she received; if not, what steps is she taking to obtain the adv,ice. (7) Did she take urgent action to protect Compartment 1402 and other old growth and wilderness forests by (a) seeking urgent Cabinet approval to attach conditions to export woodchip licences, (b) using section 30 of the Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975 in relation to areas on the Register of the National Estate and prudential and reasonable alternatives, (c) using the corporations powers identified in the Constitution or (d) using the World Heritage Properties Conservation Act 1983 to protect areas identified for their World Heritage value; if not, in each case, why not. (8) Has she advised the NSW Government that it is in breach of the National Forest Policy Statement because of the logging of Compartments 1402, 1405, 1406, and 1407; if not, why not. (9) Is it a fact that the NSW Forestry Commission did not undertake normal procedures for a licence to log Compartment 1402 under the NSW Endangered Species (Interim) Protection Act but instead relied upon a general two year old temporary licence which did not specifically relate to the compartment and did not require a fauna impact statement for the area; if so, will she seek an explanation from the NSW Government.",119
173,Mrs KELLY,LCWP,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) Yes. (b) Yes. Nalbaugh State Forest has been assessed by the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service as part of the of the Coolangubra Wilderness area. However, it is my understanding that the NSW Government has decided not to proceed with declaration of this area as wilderness. (c) Yes. (2) Yes. (3) Although Brown Barrel forest types are generally well conserved in the South East Forests, it is not known how well conserved old growth Brown Barrel is as there have been no old growth surveys undertaken in th- South East Forests. I understand that there are some quite large trees in this area, however their ages have not been determined. (4) No. Compartments 1405, 1406 and 1407 have not been clear-felled, but have been harvested in accordance with special prescriptions issued by the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service. (5) No. I am aware of the impact of the logging activities in these areas. (6) Yes. I have been briefed by my Department on possible courses of action available to me to protect old growth and wilderness forests in accordance with the National Forest Policy Statement. (7) (a) No. I have written to the Minister for Resources, the Honourable Michael Lee MP, requesting that the export licence for the Nalbaugh Special Prescription Area be comprehensively reviewed as soon as possible. (b) No. Section 30 of the Act requires the Heritage Commission to provide advice on the impact of proposed actions on places on the Register of the National Estate to the Minister for Resources. It is then up to the Minister for Resources to take this advice into account in his decision making process. (c) No. This is a power that would best be addressed through broader government consultation. (d) No. A proposal to nominate these forests for World Heritage listing was produced by Drs Mosley and Costin for the Earth Foundation in 1992. The Government has not assessed the possible World Heritage values of the South East forests of NSW. (8) No. However, on 22 December 1992 and on 9 September 1993 I wrote to the N-W Minister for the Environment, the Honourable Chris Hartcher MP, seeking advice on how the old-growth and wilderness values of certain nominated areas of forest are being protected. The compartments referred to were within the area referred. to in both, my letters. The response from Mr Hartcher on 18 May 1993 indicated that this matter was being taken up in the context of Premier to Prime Minister correspondence regarding the SE Forests agreement. . (9) Yes. With the introduction of the Endangered Species (Interim) Protection Act, a temporary licence was issued by the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service to log Compartment 1402. The licence was then suspended because the special prescriptions for the Nalbaugh Special Prescription Area could not be agreed. However, after agreement of the special prescription this suspension was lifted and logging proceeded in line ,with the endangered species legislation.

(2) Which forms of assistance or benefits are not means tested. (3) How many persons received each form of assistance or benefit in 1992-93. Mr Baldwin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Department of Social Security does not have any programs of monetary assistance specifically for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have access to pensions, allowances and benefits on the same basis as any other Australian. The Social Security Act principles of administration refer to the need to be responsive to Aboriginality and to cultural and linguistic diversity. To achieve this, the Department of Social Security has an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Services program which includes liaison officers, Support Question (2) Question (3) This program is not means tested. In respect of Sport and Recreation, information on individuals is not requir'cd for funding purposes at the Regional Level where acquillal procedures requirc information on the number and types of grants rather than information on individuals.

Identification as an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander person is optional when claiming Social Security payments. It is possible to obtain a figure for the number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, who have identified as such, who are receiving Spcial Security payments at a particular time. For example, in July 1993 there were 40,500 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people ""receiving pensions, benefits or allowances from the Department of Social Security.
