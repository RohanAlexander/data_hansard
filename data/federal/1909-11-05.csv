1,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Attorney-General a question, without notice, regarding the trouble which has arisen with respect to the free exchange between the States of agricultural and other produce. Has his Department had under consideration the constitutionality, of the various proclamations-, issued by ' the State Governments with respect to imports from other States, notably of agricultural and horticultural produce? If so, will he inform the House of the result of such consideration ?",14
2,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I have had the matter under consideration. The honourable member for Darwin also referred to it last night, but I did not reply then, as the hour was late, and I understood that the subject was to be again raised by the honourable member for Wilmot. A specific case was submitted to me, and on it I gave advice. It did not particularly relate to the importation of potatoes, but the general reasoning upon which the opinion is based would be applicable to that case also. My opinion has been sent to the Department of Trade and Customs, and there my concern with the matter stops. The opinion was given merely on the case presented by that Department.",15
3,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,Will it be available for honourable members?,15
4,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"That rests with the Minister of Trade and Customs. It was asked for by his Department, and sent by the Department of which I am Minister. Personally, I have no objection to the text or effect of the opinion being made. known. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Does the opinion declare that the Inter-State Free Trade, for which the Constitution provides, must continue, or is each State to persist in its embargo against Tasmanian potatoes ?",15
5,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I cannot answer the question, because the privilege of a client shuts my mouth. The honourable member should ask the Minister of External Affairs to submit the matter to the Minister of Trade and Customs.",15
6,Mr LIVINGSTON,Unknown,Is it within the power of a State Government to prohibit the importation of potatoes or other produce from another State if that produce be considered free from disease?,15
7,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"If the opinion is to be disclosed, I would prefer the disclosure to be made by the Department to which it was sent. Mr KING O'MALLEY - I ask the Minister of External Affairs, as the repre- metal ? sentative in this House of the Minister of Trade and Customs, whether the Commonwealth has the constitutional power to prevent any State, by the imposition of taxation, or in anv other way, from pro[:'95J hibiting another State from shipping sound goods to it?",15
8,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I have not seen the opinion given by the Attorney-General to the Minister of Trade and Customs, but if the honourable member will give notice of his question for Tuesday, I will consult the latter about the matter.",15
9,Mr REID,Unknown,"Is the Attorney-General aware that I , too, take a deep interest in this subject?",15
10,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,Every one who knows the right honourable member's public spirit will recognise that he takes an interest in this as in all other questions of the kind. PERSONAL EXPLANATION. PAIRS.,15
11,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,"I wish to make a personal explanation regarding the record of pairs on last night's division which appears in this morning's Age, which indicates that the honourable, member for Wentworth was against the Government, and the honourable member for Balaclava with it. The mistake was made in entering the names in the pair-book. It occurred in this way: Earlv in the evening, the honourable member for Newcastle obtained a pair for the honourable member for Hume, and wrote down the names as though the honourable member for Hume intended to vote for the amendment. In adding the second pair, I did not notice the way in which the first pair had been written in. The pairs should read: "" F or the Government, Sir Philip Fvsh and Mr Kelly."" "" Against the Government, Sir William Lyne and Mr Agar Wynne."" POSTMASTER-GENERAL'S DEPARTMENT. AUSTRALIAN COPPER WIRE-LETTE R BOXES - OVERTIME .",15
12,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"It is stated in one, if not both, of today's newspapers, that preference will be given to copper wire for telegraphs and telephones if made of Australian metal. I ask the Postmaster-General how his Department will be able to determine that the copper is Australian",15
13,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"There may .be difficulty in identifying the metal as Australian, but the preference will be determined in this, as in other matters, on the evidence submitted, which must be the best available, as to the origin of the metal from which the wire is made.  the attention of the Postmaster-General to the long delay in connection with the supply of letter-boxes in country districts. To my own knowledge, there are cases in which boxes applied for over two years ago have not yet been supplied. asked a question on the subject, I was informed that boxes were being obtained from England, and I ask the honourable gentleman now whether it would not be possible to obtain such simple contrivances locally? Does he know when a suflicient supply will be available? These boxes return a direct revenue to the Department.",15
14,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"The honourable member mentioned the matter to me some two months ago, when I informed him that a contract had been let for the supply of boxes. I am very much surprised that they have not been provided, but I shall make inquiries, and ascertain the cause of the delav.",16
15,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"Is the Postmaster-General aware that since the question of overtime in his Department was dealt with in 1908, and cash payments made to wipe off arrears, there has been a new accumulation, and will he devise a plan of getting rid of it? Will he consider the placing on the Estimates of a sum to pay for this overtime, so that the Department may make a fresh start?",16
16,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"Officer s of certain classes are entitled to "" time in lieu "" instead of cash payments for overtime, and instructions have been given that they are to get it as soon as the state of business will permit. Probably there has been delay because of the shortness of the staff. other cases, provision has been made on the Estimates for cash payments for overtime. ADJOURNMENT (Formal). POSTAL COMMISSION.",16
17,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I have received from the honourable member for Dalley an intimation that he desires to move the adjournment of the House to discuss a definite matter of urgent public importance, viz., "" Certain public attacks made upon the Postal Commission."" Five honourable members having risen in their - places, - Question proposed.",16
18,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"Dalley) [10.40] - I think that I shall be able to show that I am not recklessly obtruding upon the House a matter affecting myself alone. The subject which I wish to discuss concerns not merely the Postal Commission, but you, Mr. Speaker, the Whip, members of the Ministry, and the House itself. I wish to When I reply to attacks which have been made publicly, and as a Standing Order would prevent me from saying what is necessary, I should like the House to agree to its suspension. I ask this, not because I wish to make a personal attack on a senator, but to obtain an opportunity to put the true position before the public. Honourable members will see the importance of the matter. If senators are allowed to attack members of this House, there must be retaliation, and the position will become unbearable. I put it to you, Mr Speaker",16
19,Mr FISHER,Unknown,The honourable member should appeal to the Prime Minister.,16
20,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"I appeal, through you, to the Prime Minister, Mr Speaker. He will find that I shall not misuse the privilege which I desire. There is an important matter at the bottom of this.",16
21,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,I hope that the honourable member will not take the.course which he suggests.,16
22,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,It would be better for him not to follow a bad example.,16
23,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I regret the making of personal attacks by the members of one Chamber on those of another, or on any others who may be prevented from replying to them. The honourable member for Dalley will have the sympathy of the House and the public in attempting to protect himself and the Commission of which he is chairIn man against any personal charges that may have been made, but surely it is relatively immaterial by whom they were made. We happen to know, and deplore what has been said; but surely we should be establishing a precedent which, in ways which will suggest themselves to honourable members, must prove prejudicial to the conduct of business between the Houses if we do what he asks.",16
24,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I am sorry to intervene,, but I think it better to do so in the interests of order. I understand that the honourable member for Dalley wishes to refer to statements which have been made in another place. That really raises a point of order, and under cover of it the Prime Minister can proceed.",16
25,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,Who raised a point of order?,17
26,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,What I am doing is for the protection of honourable members. I hope that my position will not be misunderstood.,17
27,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I can base my remarks on, a point of order, and hope, Mr Speaker, that you will consider them in that light. But, as a matter of fact, I wish to make this a personal appeal to the honourable member for Dalley. The Commission over which he presides, and he himself, car. make the position abundantly clear by dealing with the facts alleged without necessarily requiring any reference whatever to the source from which they emanated. The statements may have attained a certain amount of weight, because of their source; but he can afford to disregard that. I am sure that the public generally and the members of both Houses will appreciate the honourable member's attitude, and extend to him more sympathy, if he refrains from establishing a precedent, which he will see would be prejudicial to the harmonious relations of the two Houses.",17
28,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"On reflection, I think that the object I had in view has been really attained, seeing that the matter has been brought under the attention of the House. I have no desire to retaliate on members of another place, because I consider my cause might thereby be weakened. If the case which I desire to put is not strong enough oh general grounds it will, of course, fail ; and as members are apparently in a sympathetic mood I desire to put that case as calmly and dispassionately as I can. The press report contains the following:It was rumoured, he said, that members of the Commission residing in Melbourne were drawing pay for their services on Sundays. If that were true, then it was a public scandal. The word "" scandal "" is repeated several times, and we know where it originated. The word means something notoriously reprehensible, worthy of public reproachsomething that is injurious to reputation; and the charge made affects this House and Parliament, and touches the whole question of Royal Commissions. I should be the last to resent criticism of public institutions or public works; and I may say that, as Chairman of the Commission, I have on every occasion instructed the Secretary to give the fullest information in response to inquiries made. No Com[195]- 2 mission can complain of information being sought by the press or public representatives, because everything in connection with an investigation of the kind should be done in the full light of day. As a matter of fact, I have instructed the Secretary not only to supply all the information asked for, but to give the information the fullest publicity; and in this, I think, I shall be borne out by the Treasurer. Parliament resolved that a Royal Commission should be appointed, and the Prime Minister, in response to the will of the House, took the necessary step. Members of both Chambers were appointed, and the scope of the inquiry was fully set out in the commission of the Governor General. You, Mr. Speaker, and also the Government Whip, were originally members of that Commission, and it will be remembered that you required some protection from charges that were made. I may say that the Postmaster-General for a time was Chairman of a very important Commission which inquired into Tariff matters; and that the Minister of External Affairs has been on one Commission, and the Minister of Home Affairs on several. It will be seen, therefore, that this is a matter which affects this Parliament, the Speaker, the members of the Ministry, and, of course, the country. The commission of the Governor General wasKnow ye that we do, by these our Letters Patent, appoint you to be Commissioners to inquire into and report upon the Postal, Telegraphic, and Telephonic Services of the Commonwealth, and more particularly in relation to the following matters :(1) Management. (2) Finance. (3) Organization, including discipline. (4) Extensions in country districts, and particularly in remote or sparselv-populated parts of the Commonwealth. (5) Complaints in relation to the services. When the Prime Minister was good enough to offer me a seat on the Commission, I asked for two or three days to think the matter over, pointing out that I was not prepared to visit every hamlet in Australia and so separate myself from my home life. I felt that, even if it meant visiting only the capital cities, the work would extend for about eighteen months if the report had to be of any use to Parliament and the Commonwealth. I think it is no breach of confidence to lay that I asked the Prime Minister why he offered me a seat, and - whether the honourable member for North Sydney and the honourable member for Parramatta, whom I regarded as good men for such an investigation, had been asked to undertake the work. The Prime Minister informed me that those two gentlemen had been approached, but that they could not accept owing to other duties. I mention these facts in justice to myself, because the word "" scandal "" is used and money is mentioned. I have been many years in public life; and I resent the idea that a public man should be made the sport and toy of every one without offering some defence. The meaning of the word "" scandal "" is that the Commissioners are - malingering over their work-ar e hanging on for the sake of what are called fees, but what are really a. return of expenses out of pocket. It is perfectly fair to criticise the methods of a Royal Commission, and criticism should not be resented; but the time to offer it is when the report is presented. I claim to have some reputation both inside and outside of Parliament, known as I am, not only in my own State, but pretty well all over Australia; and it would be a serious thing to myself personally, and to the other members of the Commission, if , in view of the coming election, the charges were permitted to pass without rebuttal. I have not had time to obtain all the material, that 1 should like in order to deal with the question, seeing that we sat late last night, and that I arrived here only about ten minutes before the proceedings opened this morning. I think, however, that I shall be able to lay the true fore the House and the public, and I trust that members of another place will pay me the courtesy to peruse my remarks. . The other members of the Commission are at liberty to defend themselves; but it is my duty, as Chairman, to protect the body as a whole, if we are doing the right thing.' If I am unable to absolutely justify my position, the charges suggested should be followed up by an indictment by the Prime Minister at once. The practice adopted by the Commission in regard to expenses is according to regulation, and has been observed by all other Royal Commissions for years. The allowance for expenses to members of the Royal Commission, when they are away from their domicile, is 25s. per day.",17
29,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"Not when they are awaythe from their domicile, but when they away from their own States. Mr Wilks.",18
30,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"There have been seventyseven sittings in Victoria, and on account of these I drew no expenses at all, because, although my own State is New South Wales, I regard my domicile as where my family is, and that happens to be Victoria. I may say that the honourable member for Bourke, Mr Speaker, and the honourable member for Gwydir adopted a precisely similar course. I have no desire to draw comparisons between this and other Commissions', but ' I think that the Postal Commission will prove to be the cheapest, though I hope not the nastiest. I have to be rather careful of what I now say, in case my words may be twisted; but I claim that if economy has ever been exercised, it has 1 been by the Postal Commission. I have drawn up a sort of rough balance sheet, which shows that from the appointment of the Commission on the 27th June, 1908, there have been 206 sittings, most of them during the six months' recess. Including a few recalls 200 witnesses have been examined, and the witness now before us is the Public Service Inspector of New South Wales, who is replying to the statements made by the representatives of associations which number thousands of employees. His evidence deals with complaints about the service, the organization, the management, finance, and the Public Service Act; and his written statement alone runs to over 200 pages. There are two other witnessesthe Public Service Commissioner and facts beColonel Miller-wh o have been intentionally left to the last, because they have charge of the Public Service, and will answer the complaints that have been made. There were two visits to Queensland, and five to New South Wales; and all the head officers, from the Secretary and Accountant at the Central Bureau, to those of all the branches in each State, have been examined; and, in addition, representatives of scores of associations who desired to be heard. At this stage, I remind honourable members that prior to the appointment of the Commission the adjournment of the House was moved day after day in order to ventilate complaints both within and without the service, and that another Commission, with an expert at five guineas a day, has been inquiring into the work of telephone branch alone for over four are months, and has not been able to hand in a report. If honourable members are to be attacked, in the .way members of the Postal Commission have been attacked, they will be very chary of accepting such appointments. One gentleman in the Senate referred to the Postal Conunission as a public scandal.",18
31,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Why not mention name?,19
32,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"I do not care to do so, because that gentleman has known me for years. He did use the word "" scandal,"" and I do not know whether I am justified in suggesting that, when he was in ill-health and visited England, it was a "" scandal "" that he should occupy the position he then did. It is reported that the Commission has cost ^5,000. Those are not the correct figures. The total expenses to date are ^3,700, including the expenses of the secretarial and reporting staffs. That is the total sum which I as Chairman have passed for payment. The balance must be an estimate by the Government Printing Office for the cost of printing up to date, but the charge - for printing has always been kept separate in the case of other Commissions. Imagine a Commission visiting six States, one of them five times, examining over 200 witnesses, dealing, not with individual grievances, but with general questions of management, organization, and discipline in a big Department, and drawing a total of only about ^1,200 in expenses. In my own - case, I have put in no claim for expenses for seventy-seven sittings held in Victoria. If remarks such as were made yesterday went out to the public unchallenged, the impression would be given that honourable members of this House did nothing but work up cases for Commissions in order to obtain seats on them, ancl draw liberal allowances. With regard to allowances for Sundays, the practice of the Commission since it first met has always been that if a - sitting took place on a Monday, and not on a Saturday, no Sunday expenses should be allowed, even to members who were away from their homes. It is only in cases - where there is a sitting on a Saturday, and another on a Monday, that allowance is made for Sunday. While Parliament is in session, Saturdays and Mondays are the only days on which members are free to .attend to the work of the Commission. In a strenuous session like this, their time for the rest of the week is fully occupied with their Parliamentary work. To show the desire of the Commission to save expense, the Public Service Inspector of New South Wales was brought to Melbourne to give his evidence. If the Commission had wanted simply to draw fees, we could have gone to Sydney, and examined him there. As it is, the Commission now meets in the mornings of Parliamentary sitting days, and the that does not look as if its members were anxious to pile up expenses.",19
33,Mr HALL,Unknown,And they get no expenses for those sittings.,19
34,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"We get only kicks. I do not object to criticism of our work, but it is too much to be accused by members of another place of being simply malingerers, and hanging on to our job. The Prime Minister and the ex-Prime Minister know the extreme lengths to which I went to induce the ex-Chairman of the Commission not to resign his position. The difference was a matter of principle, but you yourself, Mr Speaker, are aware of the attitude which I took. I cannot tell the public the full particulars, but if those who criticise the Commission in another place care to make inquiries from their fellow members they can obtain the exact history of the matter. The rough summary which I have given of the cost of. the Commission includes railway and steamer fares, postage, and stationery, typists, petty cash expenditure, secretary and reporters' salaries, and what are called travelling expenses for seven Commissioners for a portion of the time, and for four Commissioners for the bulk of the time. I hope that as the result of this motion - for the adjournment of the House, drastic steps will be taken to put the whole question of Royal Commissions on a proper footing. The matter requires to be taken in hand. I was never enamoured of Royal Commissions, and I have had more experience of them now. I am giving to the work hours of application of which the public know nothing. When a member of another place asks if the report of the Commission will be brought up so that it can be submitted to the electors at the next election, he asks a silly question.",19
35,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order !,19
36,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"I will say no more about that, but I only wish the presiding officer in another place had taken the same stand yesterday as you, Mr Speaker, have taken here today. If the Commission was meant simply to be a cloak for political designs, it should have been shut up a week after it was appointed, but I ' did not take a seat on it with the idea that it was to be a futile body, or with the intention of making anything out of it. The total amount which I have drawn for eighteen months' work is about ;£ 55In that time to accept it. I have visited six States, one of them five times. I have had the extra work attachtical ing to the position of Chairman, and I have had to pay my own expenses out of that sum. so that I am not a. bloated millionaire through it. I will not that I am out of pocket by it, because am rather cautious in money matters, but it has taken very careful watching on part to avoid being out of pocket, and there have been no banquets or flying comes before us. The newspapers prac round about the Commission's want no secrecy about the amount I have drawn, and when the public know the been prettv good. facts and the workthat has been put in, and the report has been drawn up, I am sure they will recognise that we have done nothing to be ashamed of. With regard to the preparation of the report, the Minister will remember that I suggested i,3 that the Commission would take eighteen months. We have sat on 206 days, or . equal to about seven months of actual sitished tings, and the taking of evidence will completed before the end of this session, them to give full publicity to it. If the report'is to be of any value it not be drawn up in a week, a fortnight, or even a month. It has to be based on these attacks from another place. evidence which today covers about 50,000 questions, and is divided into six branches, We have to draw up a scheme of managealmost ment and organization, to suggest improved methods of finance, and point out whether the associations are right or wrong, whether the Department is under or overmanned, and whether the services can be made better serve the interests of the general lie. If ever men's capacity for dealing with a big subject is to be tested, it will be tested in the case of the members of this Commission. I recognise the gigantic nature of our task, and I tell the Prime Minister, the House, and the public frankly that I shall not linger over it. shall do my best, but I want to do justice to all sides. I shall not be influenced any prejudice for the service, but shall be guided by considerations of fairness the employees, the Public Service Commiswith sioner, and the public. I can say without hesitation that if the report is to be worth themselves. anything, it will call for an amendment of the Public Service Act. Fancy dealing with a serious matter of that kind in a - week or two! We shall court the closest inspection and criticism of our report it is brought up. If the verdict is favorthe Mr Wilks. able, no one will be more pleased than I shall be; if it is hostile, we shall have 2 But I trust that all honourable members, irrespective of their polifeelings, will make up their minds that the report, when presented, mfust be dealt with on its merits, and not shelved or thrown aside. If honourable members say had not been too busy with their political I work to take the trouble to read the evidence, they would have been astounded at my certain matters which have come out.",19
37,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,But the evidence never : work. I tically report none of it.,20
38,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"The newspapers have Throughout Australia hev have given a very fair amount of space t to the evidence taken by the Commission, ib they cater for the public taste, and have ut a n idea that the public are tired of it. If , Prime however, the editors of the newspapers wou o n i y reads o r n e of the evidence given by important witnesses, and note its conflicting character, they would be so astonthat it would not require a motion for be the adjournment of the House to induce It is a cansingular fact that other Commissions have g o n e through their work without any of I can scarcely believe it, but the tone of'the remarks of some of the members there would lead one to suppose that it was because the members of this Commission were not swells. At the same time, it does not require the possession of a large banking account, or what is called a stake in the to country, to make a man desire to protect pubhis own honour. I ask the Prime Minister and his colleagues and honourable members generally whether it is fair that crit'icism of a personal nature such as I have referred to should be allowed to go on. By all means, let every member ask questions to ascertain the facts, and let every member I in a responsible position on a Commission give the fullest information in reply. Perby sonally, I have always felt a dislike to the absence of the press, even at meetings into Committee, becnuse the fullest publicity regard to all our proceedings is the best safety for members of the Commission I have not referred to other members of the Commission, but it is my duty to protect them, and although we may differ in our views on certain matters, I can say that if ever a body of men have tried when to do their work, they have done so. If result proves that we were not able to <3o it, that will rest upon our own shoulders, but we shall all try to do our very best to bring up a workable and instructive report. I do not know whether the object of members of another place was to seek information, but if so they went, an unfortunate way about it, and if the word "" scandal "" is used they cannot expect the members of any public body to sit quietly under it. In conclusion, I would ask the press, not as a favour, but if they value ordinary justice, to give to the defence which I have put forward the same publicity as they have given to the attacks made upon the Commission.",20
39,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"Gwydir) [n.13] - I shall not add to what has been said by the honourable member for Dalley further than to state that mv experience on this Commission, and the criticism-the attacksmade upon it has led me to resolve that, only a matter of very great public importance will ever drag me into the membership of another. Every country member knows that he must keep in touch with his electors and with their wants and requirements, but membership of a Commission like this involves throwing up all that, and never visiting one's district. That is the result that must follow if a man devotes himself to such duties as I have undertaken on this Commission. The result may mean the possible sacrifice of any political ambition which one has, and the possible loss of the seat which one has already secured. That is a risk which a man has to run if he is in earnest in taking up such work. Another consideration is the loss of home life which service on a Royal Commission involves. A man who has a wife and family and values the companionship which only home can give should never consent to serve on a Royal Commission of this kind. It has been my misfortune to be absent from my home, as well as from my electorate,, nearly the whole year round. I have had to sacrifice myself in that way in order to be true to the oath which I took as a member of the Commission, and those who are prepared to give a man credit for trying to do his duty will freely admit that it is a big sacrifice to make. But something more has yet to be said. I would remind honourable members that I represent a very large electorate, the correspondence relating to which is something enormous. The better a representative of a country electorate attends to his constituents the more work he has fo do, but as a member of the Royal Commission I have been unable personally to do that which I was formerly able to do. I have had to employ a secretary at a weekly wage ever since I have been on the Postal Commission to insure that my constituents shall not be neglected. Yet we have some persons suggesting that the members of that Commission are trying to take from the country money to which they are not entitled. The suggestion is preposterous. As a result of my membership of the Commission I have had to employ a secretary. I have had to give up my home life and to absent myself from my electorate nearly all the year round, and that should satisfy our critics that a member of the Commission must necessarily make great sacrifices. I would rather not have spoken to this question. Hitherto I have taken no notice of what has appeared in the press or has been uttered in other quarters with regard. to the Commission. But as the honourable member for Dalley has said, when a man's reputation is attacked-whe n it is implied that he is a party to a public scandal-it is time for him to defend himself.",21
40,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"The imputation is that we are stringing out the work of the Commission for what are described as "" the fees "" for service upon it.",21
41,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"That is so. During last session when the Government Whip was Chairman of the Commission, it was decided that it should not sit on Saturdays, but I had fo remain in Melbourne every week-end in order to attend the early Monday morning meetings. I was determined to do my duty. I took a special interest in my work, and, in order to attend the Monday morning sittings, had to stay here from Eriday, when the House adjourned, until the following Tuesday, whilst other honourable members who were not on the Commission were able to return to their homes. My expenses during the week-end were far in excess of the one day's expenses which I received in respect of the Monday sitting. Being anxious to attend to the work of the' Commission, I was prepared to sacrifice even my Sunday at home, and yet certain members of another place have had the audacity to hurl at me the insinuation that I am doing something derogatory to the honour of a public man. The senator responsible for the statement of which I complain spoke to me privately a little while ago and gave me a hint of his view of the position. I then look the trouble to explain to him the work of the Gommission. I pointed out to him the extent of . the task that had been set us, the work which it involved, the time that we were compelled to devote to and the distances that we had to travel. Having heard that explanation, he said that I had put the position to him in quite a new light, and had made out a reasonable case. Nevertheless, he has now the audacity to use in connection with the Commission the word "" scandal."" No matter what our political differences of opinion may be, we should at least be able to respect those of our opponents who are trying to do their best according to their lights to carry out the trust reposed in them. A member of Parliament who cannot do that is less than a man, and has no sense of honour, such as should exist among members of all great public institutions. The officers of this House can bear out my statement that the work of a Royal Commission is not confined merely to the examination of witnesses. I confess that even the 'examination of witnesses involves a. severe mental strain; but,-in tion to attending the meetings of the Commission, I have week in and week out remained in this building until 10.30 .p.m. every Saturday reading evidence, and so forth, in order to obtain a thorough mastery of the subject. I have injured my eyesight in - that way. On Sunday after Sunday I have also been engaged in this building in the same way until 10.30 p.m. The work being a good one, I.felt that I was justified in devoting my Sundays to it. I have done this in order to fit myself to examine witnesses, to ascertain the truth, and to arrive at a proper solution of the problems set before us. Yet, despite all these sacrifices, despite my devotion to what I regard as a sacred duty, which must be conscientiously discharged for the welfare, not only of the country, but of the Department into whose work the Commission is inquiring, I, in common with the other honourable members of the Commission, have been subjected to this attack. I have worked in this way, believing that if I am to do my duty, I must not only hear the evidence of the witnesses, but carefully weigh and analyze it, in order to be able ultimately to arrive at a right decision. I have not spared myself time or convenience, and yet it is said that I am a .party to a public scandal. It is one of the curses of public life that members of Parliament are not safe from attacks on Mr Webster. the part of their brother parliamentarians, who ought to have some regard for their fellow-workers, and to refrain from scattering broadcast imputations with respect to it, men who value their reputations. I value my reputation, because it is the only.wealth I have, and the man who would take it from me is an enemy of his race, and a curse to those who produced him. I speak with feeling, because the criticism of which I complain strikes me to the heart. I have been working as a member of this Royal Commission, not for my own benefit, but for the welfare of the country to which I 'belong, and yet I and my brother Commissioners have been assailed by men who ought to know better. It is humiliating, and even degrading, to find that even a man's honour is not safe in Parliament; that Parliament is an institution where a man is likelv to lose his reputation more speedily than anywhere else. All Commissions have their history, and I do not desire to go into that of the Royal Commission on the Post and Telegraph Department. The members of it have an important duty to discharge, and, addicome what may, while my health lasts, I shall continue to attend to that duty to the best of my ability, without thought of the sacrifice and personal inconvenience which it involves.",21
42,Mr DEAKI N,Unknown,"Ballarat-Prime Minister) [11.25] - I am sure that honourable members generally appreciate the action of the honourable member for Dalley in refraining from moving the suspension of the Standing Orders, which would have allowed a criticism of persons, as well as of the allegations' made. The House is sensible that in circumstances of provocation the honourable member has adopted that course. Great as is the pressure upon the time of Parliament, and little as we have to spare from important questions of legislation, no one would seek to deny to the honourable members concerned an opportunity of making a prompt rejoinder to statements that have been given wide publicity. Royal Commissions, possessing exceptional powers and an authority,, in some respects almost unlimited, cannot expect to exercise them apart from the fierce light of criticism that beats upon all the acts of public men. To that criticism the Chairman of the Commission today has taken no exception. I assume that the: impression that appears to have been conveyed by the critics to whom he has referred is largely due to the fact that up to the present they have obtained no knowledge of the proceedings of the Commission other than that gained from more or iless imperfect, sometimes casual, and not infrequently, hostile, newspaper reports, or - comments made in the press after such reports have appeared. No one can deny to - either House of this Parliament the fullest - right to criticise a Royal Commission, even while it is prosecuting its inquiries. As the (honourable member for Dalley himself pertinently remarked, the only time at which one can expect a comprehensive and final judgment upon a Commission is when it - has presented its report. That, and that - alone, justifies its existence, its methods and as findings. No one can offer more than A tentative and guarded criticism until that rfinal stage has been reached. At the - same time, when, as in this instance, - the criticising body, as well as the body - criticised, is Parliamentary, we have to realise that the mouth of Parliament - cannot be closed either in respect of this - or any other matter. Even during the continuance of the Commission one can take no exception to comments upon the length of its existence or upon its methods, provided they are phrased in obedience to those restraints that make discussion tolerable, by avoiding personal attacks and - misrepresentations.",22
43,Mr WILKS,Unknown,And are based upon information.,23
44,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"And are based upon full information. The honourable member - made it clear that neither he nor his colleague who followed him shrink from the - criticism of their public acts as public men. What they deprecate is hasty personal comments based upon imperfect knowledge of the facts. I should not be surprised if it were - discovered that representatives of the Gov-ernment in another place were not blind - to these facts, and took an opportunity to - suggest them when the criticism was offered. What interests a reporter in the gallery is a charge of a personal character. To lay - down a precise code of rules which would apply under all circumstances to all criticism within or without Parliament has proved an impossible task. Our Parliaments have gradually allowed currents of criticism to accompany their daily proceedings which, to some of their members at anv rate, appear misleading, by placing their actions before the public in an unfair and improper light. Any attempt to regulate, correct, or direct, criticism has been found impossible. Parliament long ago practically surrendered all endeavour to keep in touch with the public other than'by appeals from the platform, and such fair reports as they may be fortunate enough to obtain by the discretion of the reporter and sub-editor. Royal Commissions, consisting of a smaller number of persons, are naturally more sensitive. As the Chairman had to admit, if the Commission were dependent on the reports, especially those in newspapers published at a distance from the scene of discussion, for the justification for its existence, it would be taken at great disadvantage.",23
45,Mr WILKS,Unknown,Newspaper s cannot be expected to report our proceedings fully.,23
46,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Exactly . What interests the readers of a Perth newspaper is not telegraphed to, or if telegraphed, is not published in, newspapers appearing in other parts of the Commonwealth. The news published in each ^lace is often a strictly local reflection of matters of local interest. The broad basic work and continuous investigations of any Commission thus slip out of sight and the public need to correct the impression created by such newspaper accounts from their own knowledge and judgment.",23
47,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"No one complains about the newspaper reports, and the journalistic comment is the concern of those responsible for it.",23
48,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"No newspaper reports at any place can convey a complete view of the full scope and character of an inquiry of this magnitude. We do hot blame those who have no better source of information for taking a narrow view of the work of a Commission. They see if in the light of the press of a particular place, which deals only with particular points in particular evidence 1 he justification of this Commission is that this great Department, touching every interest of our industrial life, is by far the greatest organization under the control of the Commonwealth, and therefore affords such a field for inquiry that, until all the evidence is available, and the final recommendations published, it will be impossible for critics to do justice to their work. . Mr Wilks - Will the Prime Minister mind passing an opinion on the subject of expense ?",23
49,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Thinkin g that the discussion might take a more technical turn while that matter was being dealt with, I was out of the Chamber running my eye over a recent judgment of the High Court, and_ the general principles affecting the investigations of Royal Commissions laid 5434 Adjournment [REPRESENTATIVES.] down in Todd's Parliamentary Government, volume 2. I did not hear all that was said. But it appears to me that whatever statement of expenditure may have been published must have been apart from even a summary of the work which has been done. I understood from the honourable member for Gwydir that the attention of one critic, having been called to the expense, he at once admitted that he had been misled, and that his use of the word ""scandal"" was improper. Surely in any case it is inapplicable. I did not more than glance at today's newspaper report. It seemed not to require serious consideration, appearing to me a flash in the pan, generated by some hasty; personal impression. As some of the Commissioners are members of another place, they, I presume, at once put the facts in the right light. The honourable member for Dalley and his colleagues have been good enough to restrict the discussion within limits which have enabled statements to be made here which, I am sure, will have weight with honourable members. I trust that the public will grasp the fact that this casual criticism of the Commission's proceedings must have been based on so fragmentary a knowledge that it cannot be sound, full, or fair. It represents impressions made by particular facts or incidents regarded apart from their surroundings. ' Any one who reflects upon the vast extent of the Department of the Postmaster General, and the great sweep of the inquiry, must recognise that comments of this kind can apply only' to temporary and trifling incidents.",23
50,Mr STORRER,Unknown,"Bass) [11.40] - I am sorry to have to speak on this matter. For thirty years I have taken an interest in public affairs, and have been a member of many public and private associations dealing with matters of trust and consequence, but this is the first time that my name has been associated with anything to which the term "" scandal "" has been applied. Therefore, I wish to make my position clear. I did not become a member of the Postal Commission, of my own choice. The Pnme Minister of the day asked the party to which I belonged to choose a representative. I was in Tasmania at the time, and received a telegram asking if I were willing to act. My reply was, "" Yes, if the party thinks it necessary""; and subsequently I was informed of my appointment. I consider it the duty of a public man to (Formal): undertake such responsibilities as those associated with him may think him capable of performing. I attended the first meeting of the Commission in Melbourne, but did not ask what the remuneration of theCommissioners was to be, or how expenseswere to be paid. I have since not made«any charge or kept any account, leaving it to the Chairman and Secretary to follow the ordinary rules laid down for the control of Royal Commissions. I have not even checked the accounts in any way, so that the charge of having applied for payment for Sunday work cannot properly attach to me; nor, I think, to any other Commissioner. We have been content to work under the rules adopted for the guidance of Royal Commissions.",24
51,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,The statement which has been made is a scandalous one.,24
52,Mr STORRER,Unknown,"It is a pity that it was made in a manner which prevents it from being dealt with as it deserves. I hope that this will be the last time that anything of the kind will be done. There has been a sort of hitting behind the back.. As a public man, I do not take exceptionto criticism; but I do not think that those who have been elected' by the people to take part in the work of legislation should charge their fellows with discreditable conduct. The proceedings of the Commission' are open to the public, and its evidence is printed, so that all may know what it is; doing. Some of those who make commentson the work of the Commission have not taken the trouble to attend its meetings or to read its evidence, to inform themselves regarding it. Personal attacks should not bf made under such circumstances. It is not necessary for me to go into the question of expenses, because the Chairman has done so. I would only point out that a little while since a Commission appointed in one of the small States to inquire into the education question cost about ,£3,000, while tht Postal Commission, which has a larger number of members, arid has had to take evidence all over Australia, investigating the affairs of an immense Department, has not cost much more. During the fifteen or sixteen months that I have been a member of the Commission, I have not been in Tasmania for more than ten days at a time. I have not benefited to the extent of onepenny by my attendances on the Commission, but have lost what I might have gained by attending to my private affairs. Having undertaken the responsibilities of public life, I do not complain of ^e loss - entailed, but I shall not submit to accusations of scandal regarding my conduct when performing a public service. Attention bas - not been drawn to the many reforms which have resulted from the Commission's inquiry, but that will be shown later on. The Prime Minister spoke of the impossibility of closing the mouths of critics, but in this - case, unfortunately, the mouths of those who have been attacked have been closed to a great extent. I trust that nothing of this kind will happen again. Had the statements which have been complained of been made outside, we should have had our remedy; but they have been made under a piotection which prevents them from being dealt with as they deserve.",24
53,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Wide Bay) [11.45] - I think that there are ways and means of dealing in this Chamber with anything that may be said in another place regarding the conduct of honourable members here. The proper course has, I think, been taken in a. matter which, though important to the individuals concerned, is not sufficiently large to justify the raising of a question - of privilege as between the two Houses.",25
54,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,The remarks should not have been allowed in another place.,25
55,Mr FISHER,Unknown,That is another matter. There is no doubt that this House has the power to resent such attacks by any institution of its kind not assembled within this building.,25
56,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"It was my original intention to raise a question of privilege, but I thought afterwards the matter was not large enough.",25
57,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"In power and dignity we may assume that a Royal Commission represents the very highest form of executive government, enjoying a protection equal to that of Parliament itself. But we are rather in a difficulty when another body, which claims to .be absolute within its own ambit, chooses to criticise a Royal Commission.",25
58,Mr WILKS,Unknown,I do not mind,25
59,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I hope that no member of the House, or of any Royal Commission, is so thin-skinned as to resent criticism ; but there is no doubt that the words reported reflect on the personal honour of the members of the Postal Commission. This Commission, I may say, has had a most unusual and important history. It was brought into existence, not with the con- up. currence of the Government, but by a vote of the House against the wish of the Government.",25
60,Mr WILKS,Unknown,It was appointed by Parliament.,25
61,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"It was directed to be appointed by Parliament, and the Government subsequently accepted the direction.",25
62,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,The British practice for a long time was to appoint Royal Commissions on an address from both Houses.,25
63,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The Government at the time did not think the appointment of a Royal Commission the most advisable course, but subsequently they came to the conclusion that such an inquiry was necessary ; and the appointment was made. Then there arose some internal dissensions in the Commission.",25
64,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,Some differences of opinion.,25
65,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"And these caused certain dissent, with the result that during my term of office the personnel of the Commission was reduced from seven to four; and my opinion was that four members could do just as effective work, and present as good a report as a larger number. There was considerable outside agitation in favour of the Government terminating the Commission, but I thought then, and I think now, that that would have been one of the worse steps to take. The Commission has proceeded with its work, and it has been attacked from time to time in the press, with insinuations regarding the members. I deplore the fact that any sensible man should think there is any profit in being a member of a Royal Commission. There may be a man here and there able to save a few shillings out of the allowance for expenses but the veiled attacks do not reflect credit on those who make them. I have seen it stated in the press, though, of course, I do not know whether it be true or not, that the Government have been bringing pressure to bear on the Commission to terminate their proceedings as criticism. soon as possible.",25
66,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Nearl y every Royal Commission, of course, is hurried up by the Departments concerned.",25
67,Mr WILKS,Unknown,There has been no pressure in this case.,25
68,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"This is a fitting opportunity to have a matter of the kind cleared I am not a strong believer in Roya! Commissions, which, in my opinion, are not productive of that amount of good that people imagine. I have never had any ambition to be a member of a Royal Commission; but those who think that such inquiries serve good purpose, and are prepared to give their time to the work, are entitled to every credit. I - hope and believe that no man in this House would, either directly or by way of insinuation, reflect ou a public body of the kind, as has apparently been done in this case. I do not admit for a moment that the payments made to the members of the Royal Commission are in any degree an equivalent for the expense and inconvenience to which they are put; and so long as they are doing the work they have been invited to do, representative men, at least, should refrain from reflecting on them in any way.",25
69,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"Dalley) [11.52] - Mr . Speaker - Mr SPEAKER - There is no provision made for a reply on such a motion as this. If , however, the mover has not exhausted whole of his allotted time, be may be allowed to reply to the length represented by the unexpired portion; and the honourable member has two minutes.",26
70,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"I have to thank the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition for the manner in which they have dealt with this matter. Putting the Postal Commission on one side, I am very glad to have had an opportunity to introduce the broader question. I can assure honourable members that I have no desire to make a profession of the membership of a Royal Commission; and while I do not wish to appear squeamish, I have thought it right, in the interests of the public and of myself, to - submit this motion. I hope that, in a short time, the House will take into consideration the whole question of Royal Commissions, and see that the best men are appointed, whether they be within or without Parliament, and whoever accepts such positions shall not be paid expenses but a specific amount. It would be much better to have the payment for expenses done away with altogether than to allow it to get abroad that Parliamentarians, as a body, create Roval Commissions for the sake of what can be made out of them - I have to apologize for the delay that has been caused in the public business by this motion; but I hope that the discussion will have a good result, and that honourable members will not neglect to pay proper attention to the Commission's report when it is presented.

71,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"Angas-Attorney-General ) [""-SS]-- I move That the amendments be agreed to. the The two amendments are rather of & technical nature. Taking advantage of the criticism of the honourable member for West Sydney, and, I think, of the honourable member for Werriwa, who urged the desirability of following as nearly as possible the text of the English Act, I recast clauses 28 and 95. The effect of the amendment in clause 28 will be to declare that a contract of marine insurance is not admissible in evidence for the recovery of a sum under the contract, unless it is embodied in the policy. It might appear that we were, to some extent, encroaching on the States' sphere, in which they have, an exclusive jurisdiction, but, so far as the contract deals With the recovery of the sum insured, we are entitled to say it shall not be admitted asevidence unless it is included in the policy. As to the second amendment, the honourable member for West Sydney thought it best to follow the English Act as far as we could, and that has been done by the insertion of the words.

75,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Wide Bay) [rz.o] - I thought the Prime Minister would have indicated, in moving the motion, the business that he purposed proceeding with for the remainder of the session, and, as far as possible, in what order. That is usually done at this stage of the session on a motion of this kind. Members are now asked to devote the whole of their time to the work of this Chamber, and they should know what measures are regarded by the Government as urgent. I wish to make a request to the Prime Minister. I have found it very difficult to follow the Government's method of proceeding with business. They bring a Bill up to the top of the paper, proceed with it for a certain time WILLIAM until it is about to be passed, and then let it slip down again. That is not the method of conducting business to which I was accustomed before I entered this House, and I do not like it. I may instance the High Commissioner Bill, which is not contentious. I communicated recently to the Prime Minister the fact that I was ready and anxious to assist him in passing it at any time. It is about ten days since it came back from the Senate with a few trifling amendments, but it is still on the notice-paper, although it could be passed while we are talking about it. I hope the Government are not trying to pile up a large number of measures on the notice-paper, with the object of afterwards telling the public that they were not able to get their business through. That sort of thing might be becoming in quite another kind of institution, but not in this Parliament. I am in favour of the motion. We ought to get to work, pass as much useful legislation as we can, and then depart for that wider sphere of influence that we are all anxious to reach at the earliest possible moment.",27
76,Mr DEAKI N,Unknown,"Ballarat-Prime Minister) [12.4] - We propose to proceed with the Constitution Alteration (Finance) Bill on Tuesday, and then the third reading of its accompanying measure-the Constitution Alteration (State Debts) Bill-woul d follow. Those two would go together. Then there is the Seat of Government Acceptance Bill.",27
77,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Why not take the State Debts Bill first?,27
78,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,It has been regarded as a corollary to the Finance Bill. But we shall not keep the one for the other. I shall take advantage of the honourable member's suggestion if for any reason we find ourselves unable to proceed with the first Bill.,27
79,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,Do the Government intend to proceed on Tuesday with the Bill with which we dealt last night?,27
80,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,Yes . Mr J. H. CATTS - I thought the Prime Minister said that if the amendment of the honourable member for Mernda were carried he would take the question to the electors ?,27
81,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I said if the Bill were not carried, not if that particular amendment were accepted- We can dispose of the High Commissioner Bill in ten minutes. The Northern Territory Acceptance Bill is the only other large measure, so far as I know, which is likely to provoke an animated, but, I hope, an abbreviated, debate. I have communicated with honourable members, and, although our time is short, am anxious to provide another sitting at which any crucial amendment of that measure can be dealt with. There has been a good deal of moving about of the business on the notice-paper, because such measures as the Bills of Exchange Bill , Patents Bill , Lighthouses Bill , Seamen's Compensation Bill , and others, which have passed the Senate, are not, so far as I know, subjects of party conflict. There may be some criticism of them, but I think it will be independent, and not serous. These measures we have taken, and shall take, whenever it meets the convenience of the House. I shall be always happy, not only to inform the Leader of the Opposition of the intentions of the Government with regard to the business, but, as is proper at this period, to consult him in regard to the order in which these measures can be taken, so as to meet the wishes of himself and his friends, and afford them full opportunities for criticism.",28
82,Mr FISHER,Unknown,What about new measures ?,28
83,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The only two that I know of are the small Public Service Bill , which I mentioned in reply to the honourable member for Calare",28

The only fective protection which the grower of by white labour has against the employer of coloured labour is the bounty, and Government, the Parliament, and people of the Commonwealth can be at no loss giving him a further security for three years. If any better method is discovered, and an alteration of policy is found necesclear sary, that can be equally effectively dealt with after the Royal Commission reports, and the law in the meantime can be allowed to remain as it is at present.

106,Mr HALL,Unknown,"It is ; but the position is serious if a firm that is receiving a bounty is not going to supply its iron to manufacturers in Australia who desire to obtain it .

115,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"Calare) £12.37] - I wish to emphasize a point that I made the other day, in regard to a matpolitan ter connected with the Postmaster-General's Department. I then pointed out that by the passing of monthly Supply Bills much important work relating to the Department, ancl for which provision is made in the timates-in-Chief, is held up. Until the Estimates-in-Chief are dealt with, it is possible for the Department to proceed with them. This complaint relates more particularly to the promised increase supervising staff, for which provision made in the Estimates. The Department .for the last two or three years has had a limited staff at its disposal, and a great deal of work that has been approved the House has been allowed to lapse, owing to its inability to deal with it. Owing the delay in passing the Estimates, that unsatisfactory state of affairs continues. I appealed strongly to the Government few days ago to ask the House to deal with the Estimates-in-Chief as early as sible, so that this cause of complaint might be removed; but we are asked, apparently, to pass another Supply B i ll on the old terms, and this unsatisfactory state affairs in the Post and Telegraph Departmental ment is to continue. I trust that if Government do not see their way to deal with the Estimates-in-Chief at an early date, and find it necessary to introduce another Supply Bill , they will take care that Bill to meet the exceptional and desirable condition of affairs to which have referred. I now wish to bring under notice a matter relating to the Telegraph machines for themselves. Branch of the Department in Sydney. Until last year officers using their own writers in the Department received lowance in respect of them. A promise was then made that they should, and was understood that provision would be made on last year's Estimates for such an allowance. For some reason that promise has not been fulfilled. No doubt it was cut out in the pruning the Estimates by the Cabinet. The able member for Barrier, when Postmasterto General, decided, because of certain representations made to him on the question, not to deal with the matter as a special one, but the provision made was not sufficient for the whole staff. For some years past, officers in the Victorian branch of the service have been receiving so much for the upkeep and use of their typewriters, but that allowance was not originally given in New South Wales. The injustice has now been remedied to some extent, but not full y. An officer desiring promotion to the metroarea, and particularly to the central staff, must show efficiency in typewriting. At any rate, expertness as a typist counts in his favour. When promotion has been gained, he has either to use an obsolete EsDepartmental machine, or to provide a typewriter for himself. In reply to a quesimtion which I put to the Minister recently, I was informed that last year there were 202 telegraphists in the metropolitan disof the trict of Sydney, and 180 in Melbourne, is and in this year's Estimates provision is made for 218 in Sydney, while no change but is made in the strength of - the Melbourne staff. But, although the Sydney staff is to by be increased by 16 permanent hands, only 52 of its officers receive an allowance into respect to typewriters, and 85 in Melbourne, while this year it is proposed to give it to 54 officers in Sydney, and to 103 a in Melbourne. The allowance is to be extended to 2 more men in Sydney, and to 17 posmore in Melbourne, notwithstanding th.it the Sydney staff is already larger than the Melbourne staff, and is"" to be increased this year by 16. Thirty officers in Sydney ot who use their own typewriters for Departwork do not receive any allowance. the There are four typists in Melbourne in the same position, but it has been intimated that their claim for consideration will receive attention, so presumably they will be placed on the same footing as their fellows. in I ask the Postmaster-General to look into unthis matter with a view to giving the same I treatment to all officers. To my mind, it is a wise thing to allow officers to provide Men get better acquainted with their own machines than typewith others, and take greater interest in and no alcare of them. No doubt the Department intends to apply this policy to the whole it Commonwealth. I do not know what is being done in regard to officers at Brisbane, Adelaide, and other centres, but the same treatment should be extended to all. I ask the honourable gentleman to give consideraof tion to the claims of the thirty typists honorin Sydney who are not receiving an allowance, placing them on the same footing 222, male attendants 2,059, as their fellows, and to see that no differdants ence is made between the Sydney and Meldays bourne staffs. Replying to a question which I asked a few weeks back, he said practiare cally that it was not proposed to make of any change in the' present Estimates, but fact I ask him, in the interests of justice, to deal with all his officers alike. The posilieu tion of the thirty officers in Sydney who are not receiving allowances is as much titled to consideration as is that of the four ment officers in Melbourne who are in a like posicompensation. tion. Differences of treatment are sure to create the impression that, the administramates tion is not impartial. To give allowances have to some officers, and to deny them to others, iswilldone, makes it appear that fair treatment is not meted out to all. Therefore, the sooner all are placed on the same footing, the better it will be for the officers and for the permit. Public Service. A knowledge of type_5.* This writing is practically a sine qua non so far cial as promotion is concerned. At any rate, competent typists are preferred to those who have no knowledge of typewriting, it is not right to allow some men to provide their own machines, without compensating allowances, while others what is considered adequate compensation. That would entail on all the officers sirous of promotion the necessity of acquiring proficiency in this particular. Acplaced cording to Hansard, as shown on page off. 3,715, T, on the 23rd September, asked Postmaster-General the following quesfactory tion :1. What number of days in lieu are due to supervisors, monitors, and male and female phone attendants in the Sydney Metropolitan Telephone Exchange area for performing duty on public holidays? 2. How many monitors and attendants are affected, and for what length of time have the days in lieu been accumulating? 3. Is it practicable, and if so, is it the intention of the Department to at once arrange to clear off these arrears of time due, or if not practicable to so arrange, will the Department consider the advisability of paying those concerned a day's salary for each day in lieu due? What is the total amount required to liquidate the indebtedness of the Department to these officials? 4. For what period is the recreation leave of absence due to the supervisors, monitors, and male and female telephone attendants in the Sydney Metropolitan area in arrears? 5. What arrangements does the Department intend to make to bring the arrears, if any, up to date? To that the Postmaster-General plied :1. There are 3,098 days in lieu due to - ials mentioned, viz., supervisors 19, monitors Mr Thomas Brown. a n c i female atten798. 2. There are 487 officials affected, and the in lieu extend over the years 1906, 1907, 1908, and 1909*. A small number of days only due for 1906-7, but could not be disposed owing to lack of monitorial staff, and to the that no additional staff was provided for on the 1908-9 Estimates. 3. It is not possible to clear off the days in at once, as the staff is short-handed owing to the absence from the 1908-9 Estimates of any enprovision whatever for additional staff. Payis not made for holidays worked, the law providing that time in lieu is to be given as It is the intention to appoint the additional staff provided on the 1909-ro Estias soon as possible after those Estimates been approved by Parliament. When such it is expected that all arrears of leave be met in about fifteen months. 4. There is no recreation leave for 1908 due to these officials. . The leave for 1909 has been disposed of as rapidly as the staff available wilt See answer to No. 3. makes an average of 6{ days per offifor 4 years, equalling if day per annum. The great proportion of this accumulated overtime is due to those who receive the and lowest remuneration; and the Department, owing to the shortness of hands, has not been able to carry out the scheme of are given allowing days off in lieu. On a previous occasion, prior to 1906, there was a similar deaccumulation, and the Government then on the Estimates a sum sufficient to pay the employee's, instead of allowing days As, under present conditions, the holithe days cannot be granted, the most satisway of dealing with the matter, in the interests of the officers themselves, and the to promote the efficient working of the Detelepartment, would be to again pay them, and give an opportunity, under improved conditions, to prevent any .further accumulation.",31
116,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,The employees might prefer the holidays.,32
117,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"Then let them have the holidays instead of the money; but I think that they would prefer the latter, rather than that the present friction, worry, and dissatisfaction should be continued. I trust that the Postmaster General will give the matter his best consideration, and dispose of the difficulty as soon as possible. Sir JOHN QUICK' (Bendigo-Post master-General) [12.52] - I have stated previously that, while some of the officers are granted an allowance for the reuse of their own typewriting machines, there are others not in the enjoythe offiment of that privilege. The practice has been introduced of allowing operators who use their own machines £ 6 per anbe num ; and this I regard as very substantial. It may be, however, that in some offices, including the Sydney office, there were, prior to the introduction of the practice, a number of Departmental machines; and, of course, in respect of these no alGeneral lowance can be expected. Doubtless apparent anomaly arises in that way. I Departmental machines are available, offiCapital. cers will not be allowed to use their private machines, and be paid for the use of them. I can assure the honourable member that all the offices where the operators use their own machines in the absence of mental machines, they are allowed £ 6 each per annum without any discrimination. cannot displace Departmental machines in order that operators may have this privieasy lege.",32
118,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"How is it that there are thirty men in the Sydney office' who use their own machines, and are not the cities. granted the allowance?",33
119,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,It may be that those officers are using their private macities chines in preference to Departmental machines.,33
120,Mr HALL,Unknown,"If there are no Departof mental machines available, then the who use their own machines will get the times. allowance?",33
121,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"Decidedly , and without any favouritism or discrimination. Overtime is a vexed question, and a long standing grievance, which I have inherited from my predecessors, and which is dething cided partly by practice and partly by law. The law, I understand, is that clerical officers are not entitled to cash payment for overtime, and the Public Service ComVmissioner would not certify for such a pay-. ment in their case ; but non-clerical cers are allowed cash payment. however, accept the suggestion of the honwould orable member, and consult the Treasurer as to the legal and financial aspect of matter.",33
122,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,The Public Service Commissioner is the man to consult.,33

Mx. KING O'MALLEY (Darwin) [12.58] - In view of the many complaints, I suggest that the Deputy Postmastersshould be abolished, and that there the should simply be an officer in each State, f subject to the head at the Commonwealth If this were done, when an honourable member wanted anything for his constituents, he could apply to the in Postmaster-General, who would only have to touch a button in order to insure that Departthe request was complied with. We Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.15 p.m.",33
126,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,"It is very to get things done in the city where the people have every convenience already,-but I am speaking on behalf of the men who produce that which maintains Destroy the Australian cities, but leave the farmers, and we will build more cities; destroy our farmers, and our will swim in their own stew. If the reform which I advocate were brought about, we should no longer be at the mercy Deputy Postmasters-General who are men not in harmony with the spirit of the We want responsible officers who will take their orders from head-quarters when the button is pressed. The man in Melbourne who has control of this mighty Department should not be wasting his time over tiddledy-winking affairs. When somesubstantial is wanted, he ought to be able to press a button and let others come forward to take their orders from him. I would also ask the Postmaster-General whether he could make some arrangement with offithe Tasmanian Government whereby the I shall, trains between Launceston ancl Hobart not waste so much time at little sidings, but run to their termini fast enough the to allow the coaches to make an earlier start in their turn for their termini. That would enable the mails to be delivered at outside places earlier in the evening, and allow the business people in those thriving the centres, which are throbbing with life and progress, to reply to the large cities next Under present arrangements, it takes two days for them to send a reply. coach leaves Burnie, for instance, late in the afternoon, and does not reach StanI t leaves Stanley again early in the morning before the business men can reply to the letters I may received by the mail which arrived the night before. Cannot the Postmaster General arrange with the Tasmanian railway authorities that the trains shall not simply k i ll time at sidings as they do now? The contractors for small post offices in the country are being sweated, and many of them have come to me with tears, in their eyes to tell me that they do not make sufficient to feed their horses. I would urge on the Postmaster-General the desirableness of giving them a little rise if possible. They should get what President Roosevelt would call "" a square deal."" There are a number of these small contract post-offices in Tasmania, and especially in the electorate of Darwin. salary is miserable, and the Postmaster General should remember that an increase, however small, would be a great encouragement. The contractors take a great deal of trouble to oblige the public. come in at all hours for their mails, and are cheerfully accommodated. I know that the income from some of the contract post offices is not sufficient to warrant an increase, but as the Department is a Socialistic institution the idea is not to make great profits at one particular place so much as to aggregate the profits from all places and distribute them on a Christian basis. By that means the. strong shall bear the burdens of the weak, and the big cities will furnish a small part of their income to help the people in the small places in the back blocks, who are deprived of all the comforts of piogressive civilization. The time has also come when a system of wireless telegraphy should be installed at King Island, which has a population of betAveen Soo and 1,000 people, including hundreds of Victorians who have gone there lately. They haA'e a boat service only about once in three Aveeks. I belie\'e that if the \ ernment made a contract Will the Union r Steam-ship Company arrangements could be made for the boat running between Melbourne and Strahan to call at Sea Elephant Bay at least once a Aveek.",33
127,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Is it a good harbour?,34
128,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,"A very good harbour, and fairly Avell land-locked. Although there is no pier at present, the mails could ahvays be landed in small boats. It is a thriving little community, and I Would urge the Postmaster-General to give it communication Will the mainland by Avireless telegraphy. The system seems to have been perfected enough to allow that Avork to be undertaken. Another matter which I wish the Postmaster-General and the Treasurer to note is the existence of a steam-ship ring in Tasmania. Nearly all the other States have"" the benefit of a great trans-continental railway system, but the population of Tasmania, comprising - 196,000 of the most intelligent citizens in the uniA'erse, are absolutely deprived of intercourse Will the rest of the CommonAvealth, except at the dictation of a private steam-ship ring. I haA'e received complaints from many shippers in various Tasmanian tOAvns, but they tell me that they dare not come out into the open lest they should be deprived of all opportunity of The shipping their goods. Why should these things be in the tAventieth century ? Why should the business people of any community be at the mercy of a ring, hoAveA'er important and poAverful? The time has. Farmers come for the Government to take action to crush these rings out and give the people the benefit of IOAV freightage, or to establ is h a direct steam-ship line betAA'een Tasmania and the mainland. That Would not cost much, and I assure the Treasurer that if the .Government Would adopt my. proposal for a national postal banking system, I could run the undertaking Avithout having to borroAV a penny. I ' wish noAv to complain bitterly of the embargo AA'hich the other States have placed on potatoes from Tasmania. We have the freest Constitution in the Avorld, provided that the States are compelled to comply Will itsprovisions. No one knoAvs that better than does the Postmaster-General, Avho is part author of a valuable Avork on the Constitution. We look to those Avho are familiar Will the Constitution to see that it is not violated by parochial-minded Go- gentlemen in the States Avho, if they ran up against it, Would not understand its meaning. The miners of Kalgoorlie and. remote gold-fields in Western Australia are deprived of the opportunity of obtaining the delicious red-skinned potatoes produced on the North-west Coast of Tasmania, owing to the failure of the CommonAvealth Government to perform their sacred duty under the Constitution. The Victorian Minister of Agriculture, Mr Graham, a sincere and  ister of Agriculture in NeAv South Wales, has not kept his promise. There has never been any Irish blight in Tasmania. As a matter of fact, if the blight were present in any district it could be smelt from a distance of thirty miles. In 1846 and 1847, Avhen it Was prevalent in Ireland, Will the result that nearly 1,000,000 died of starvation, and 2,000,000 emigrated to America, it could be smelt in England. I ask the Commonwealth Government to take action to see that the embargo against the introduction of Tasmanian potatoes into certain States shall be removed. The Fusion Government, backed up by its big majority, is not prepared to .stand up for the people of Tasmania. Section 92 of the Constitution provides thatOn the imposition of uniform duties of Customs, trade, commerce, and intercourse among the States, whether by means of internal carriage or ocean navigation, shall be absolutely free. Then, again, I would direct the attention of the Minister to section 109, which provides thatWhen a law of a State is inconsistent with a law of the Commonwealth, the latter shall prevail, and the former shall, to the extent of the inconsistency, be invalid. Notwithstanding these provisions, no action has been, taken by the Commonwealth Government to secure to Tasmania her legitimate rights under the Constitution. Tasmania entered the Federation without imposing any special conditions, but, owing to the action of other States, a large proportion of her potatoes are now rotting on the coast. All the requests of the other States in regard to the quarantining of districts alleged to be affected with blight have been complied with, and yet producers are not permitted to send their potatoes to other parts of the Commonwealth. The Constitution is being violated, and the compact made with Tasmania abrogated. For less than that the State of South Carolina seceded from the Union, hoisted the Confederate flag, and commenced a war which cost a thousand million pounds, and took five years to crush out.",34
129,Mr LIVINGSTON,Unknown,"Barker) [2.37] I am pleased that the honourable member for Darwin has again brought this matter before the Government. My own district has been very badly served. Thousands of tons of potatoes are annually produced there, but because a trace of Irish blight was found in a small garden patch not six feet square, the whole of that beautiful district, which produces absolutely clean potatoes, has been quarantined. The people of New South Wales, Western Australia, and Central Australia desire to obtain supplies of potatoes from my electorate, but cannot secure them. The Commonwealth should take action at once. Potatoes will not keep very long, and they are particularly wanted at the present time in the central districts of Australia. If the Commonwealth Government can do anything, they should take action at once. If they cannot, let them say so, and we shall then, make an effort to alter the law. I trust that my fighting friend, the honourable member for Darwin, will continue to keep this question prominently before the Government.",35
130,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"Coolgardie) [2.38] Some time ago I drew the attention of. the Postmaster-General to the condition of affairs in connection with the post-office at Meekatharra, a very important and rising centre of population in Western Australia. So far, nothing has been done to supply the conveniences which are necessary'. The business of the office has increased very much of late, owing to the rapid growth of population, and the officials are being greatly overworked. I have here a letter which reviews and emphasizes my previous complaint. In this communication it is pointed out thatOne of the assistants at the post-office - at Meekatharra was compelled to work till he was fairly knocked out, and is now on sick leave, overwork being the cause. This is one of many cases where closer attention should be given to public requirements in districts that are rapidly advancing. Possibly some other Department is really responsible for the delay in effecting repairs to postal buildings, but I trust that the Postmaster-General will give a hint to his officials to be a little more active.",35
131,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,I will.,35
132,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"I .should have added that Meekatharra will shortly be the railway terminus, so that it will soon be a considerable business centre. There is another long-standing grievance on the part of the residents of Mount Ida, a-very remote township in Western Australia, which has neither telegraphic nor telephonic communication with the outside world, although the population comprises several 1 hundred people. When an accident occurs, a messenger has to ride a distance of some 70 miles to secure a doctor. The position would not be so bad if medical assistance could be summoned by telegraph or telephone - As it is, it takes about two days to secure medical attendance fromMenzies. Deaths have often occurred whichmight have been prevented had telegraphiccommunication existed. At various times I have brought before the Government the advisableness of carrying a telegraph line from Menzies to Mount Ida, but have always received the stereotyped reply that the line would not pay anything like the io per cent, on cost of construction and maintenance which the Department requires. It is about time that a new principle was adopted in dealing with these remote districts. surer knows that the policy now pursued is not that which he adopted when in control of the Government of Western Australia, and I invite him to say whether, hadthere been no Federation, a telegraph line would have been carried to Mount Ida long ago?",35
133,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Is not nearer than Menzies is to Mount Ida?,36
134,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"Yes ; the distance from Leonora is said to be only 50 miles, but I have received from the Deputy Postmaster General a communication which throws some doubt on that estimate. The estimated cost of constructing a line from Leonora to Mount Ida is £ 3 , 2 2 0 . The Divisional In spector reports that the annual revenue would be £ 7 0 8s. 6d., whereas the amount required to reimburse the Department would be £ 3 6 1 per annum, leaving an estimated deficit of £ 2 9 0 . I invite the attention of honourable members to the way in which remote districts are being treated by the Department. The principle on which the Department works is that it will not connect a district by telegraph or telephone with another centre unless the line promises to prove remunerative. In other words, purely business principles are adopted. Such a policy is really a bar to settlement.",36
135,Mr HARPER,Unknown,It . is a great mistake.,36
136,Mr MAHON,Unknown,It retards settlement very considerably. I very much doubt whether the divisional inspectors take all the factors of a case of this kind into account.,36
137,Mr HARPER,Unknown,Facilitie s create revenue.,36
138,Mr MAHON,Unknown,Exactly ; and it has been proved by experience.,36
139,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Is it not a fact that a report, recently presented, shows that a great many of the estimates have been under the mark.",36
140,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"I believe so. Whether we continue to carry out works with loan money or with revenue, the Government should reconsider the principle of refusing all facilities except those which promise to be payable. It may be said that it is not strictly the business of the Postmaster-General to assist in the development of the country, but it cannot be forgotten that the Department spends much more in subsidizing a European mail service than is necessary merely to secure the transport of mail matter. Were the poundage system adopted, we should have to pay only one-third or one-fourth of the present subsidy for the transport of mail matter to and from Europe. The Trea- Mr Frazer - About .£40,000 was the estimate.",36
141,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"The difference between what would be the poundage charges and what we now pay, may the regarded as an expenditure in the interests of the producers for whose benefit a fast line of steamers is subsidized. But the Department while Leonora sometimes contending that its business is merely to receive, despatch, and deliver letters, telegrams, and newspapers, is not consistent in its attitude. Not only does it subsidize the European mail service for the benefit of our producers, but it carries on such services as the Melbourne-Sydney telephone, which is not likely ever to pay. Were the receipts for official conversations deducted from the earnings of that line, an enormous and startling deficit would be shown.",36
142,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,No guarantee of profit was demanded before the line. was constructed.,36
143,Mr MAHON,Unknown,No .,36
144,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,But some of the Melbourne representatives ' contended that a guarantee should be asked for.,36
145,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"The honourable member for Yarra was the first to draw attention to that fact. A guarantee should have been demanded in that case, if such a demand was ever justifiable.",36
146,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,The line is said to pay well.,36
147,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"If the estimated value of the Departmental business were deducted from the statement of earnings, it would 'be seen to be a losing concern. I have received a letter from Mr William Smith, a resident of Menzies, with whom I . am well acquainted, saying that if the Department has made up its mind not to give a telephone service to Mount Ida, he would be willing to establish a pigeon post. That, he says, is feasible and practicable, and there are such posts in other parts of the world. He has had a good deal of experience in connection with homing pigeons, and says that he believes that after training, birds will convey despatches between Menzies and Mount Ida in a little over an hour. He makes the reasonable request that some little assistance should be extended to him by the Department, to enable him to make an experiment in the matter. The Department might fairly grant this request, if it thinks it impossible to undertake the erection of a telephone line. Another matter with which the honourable member for Kalgoorlie will probably deal, was brought under my notice when I visited Kanowna, as Minister of Home Affairs. I understand from Mr Deane's report that it is proposed to start the railway to Port Augusta from Kurramia, instead of from Kanowna, to avoid some little grading difficulty. A letter from the town clerk of Kanowna assures me that the wood trains running to Kurramia from Kanowna needed only one engine for haulage, whereas two are required from Kurramia. I presume that before the construction of theline is finally decided upon, another survey will be made of that end of the route. must not be forgotten that Kanowna is a very fine town, and that it is more desirable to have the junction there than at a place where there is little or no population, and few conveniences. It is to be presumed, however, that Kalgoorlie will be the changing station. It is certainly desirable to adopt the route which offers the fewest natural difficulties. The Treasurer must be' aware of the needs of Mount Ida. No more deserving work could be undertaken than its connection with other centres. The district is being settled by a pioneering population, and it is this type of settler who possesses the first and strongest claim to consideration and encouragement.",36
148,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"Melbourne Ports) [2.55] - I have already drawn the attention of the Government to the case of a man named Anderson, who joined the Naval Department of Victoria in 1878, was transferred to the Postal Department as a fireman in 1887, and was retired last year, at the age of sixty-five years, without a pension. For the last eighteen months, I have been in communication, by letter and personal interview, with the various Departments concerned. The last letter I received in reference to the case, came from the Treasury, and is as follows :Referring to your recent inquiry relative to a claim for pension by Mr Charles Anderson, ex-stoker, Victorian Naval Forces, I have the honour, by direction of the Treasurer, to inform you that as Mr Anderson was not in the State service at the time-24t h December, 1S81-of the passing of Act No. 710, it would appear that he is not entitled to a pension. I am enclosing a copy of opinion given in a similar case. The papers left by you with the Treasurer are returned herewith. The case of a man who joined the Department on the 29th March, 1879, was discharged on the 16th July, 1880, and re-employed on 19th July, 1882, is mentioned as a similar one. Mr Anderson was retired at the end of 1880, in the interests of economy, and was sent for by the Government at the end of 1881, but being then at Brisbane, was not taken on until ist January, 1882, or seven days after the passing of the Act abolishing pensions in the Victorian Navy. The Departments admit that the case is a hard one, but say that the man is not entitled to a pension. He, however, contends that, with others, he was assured by the Treasurer of the day, Sir Bryan O'Loughlin, that they would be given the same rights of pension as if they had been in the service at the time of the It passing of the Act. In proof of that statement, he produces a discharge, showing continuity of service from the 2nd November, 1878, until his transfer to the Postal Department in 1887. No doubt, the Government would be willing to pay the pension if it could see a justification for doing so. I suggest that the Treasurer migh't appoint a Board of three officers of his Department to deal-with the case.",37
149,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,The State would not agree to the payment of a pension unless the man were legally entitled to it.,37
150,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,The State cannot go beyond the discharge which it gave.,37
151,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,The facts are stronger than the statement on the discharge.,37
152,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"A Government Department has no right to ignore a mistake made thirty years ago. This man served for twenty-eight years after his re-appointment. The man's discharge is proof that he had continuity of service, and, I believe, that the State Government would, under the circumstances, admit that he has some claim. The Federation would not have to pay the money, but, as he was a servant of ours for eight years, I think the Treasurer ought to take some little interest in the matter. I have no complaint to make against the Treasurer or his officials in this connection; but this man believes he is wrong, and I , as the representative of the electorate in which he lives, am condemned, not only by him but by the whole of the public servants who support the claim. I am sorry to make the matter public, but it is such a glaring case, that the course was necessary.",37
153,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"Hindmarsh) [3.5]. - I should like to refer to the answer which the Postmaster-General gave yesterday in regard to the telephone charges to business men as compared with the charges made to the business men of Melbourne, Sydney, and Brisbane. It would not be fair, of course, to expect the Postmaster-General to re-arrange the whole of the telephone rates until he has received the report of the expert Commission; but I do not see why he should not be able to place the whole of the business men of the Commonwealth on an equal footing. matter of fact, the expert Commission will be able to tell him nothing that is not known to himself, or was not known to his predecessors; and the position is one that cannot possibly be defended. Adelaide business men have to pay £ 1 0 for exactly the same service that is given to business men elsewhere for £ 6 ; and something should be done, if only by way of compromise, until the report of the expert Commission has been received. Thefiguresin the Department show that both the telegraph service and the postal service pay handsomely in Adelaide, and that there the organization is quite up to date.",38
154,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"I could not act on the suggestion of the honourable member without consulting the Treasurer, inasmuch as it would involve a large loss of revenue.",38
155,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"All private subscribers are placed on the same footing, and I think there would be no difficulty in obtaining the consent of the Treasurer to the removal of the injustice under which the Adelaide business men now suffer. I do not think that any large loss of revenue would be involved; but if the Postmaster General is concerned on that score, why did he reverse the arrangement of his predecessor, which would have meant an increase in receipts, and equality for all? The Postmaster-General cannot blame honourable members if they persistently, keep bringing these questions under his notice.",38
156,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,How many subscribers :are interested?,38
157,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"I have not the actual figures, but I believe there are a fairly large number; in any case, if the - number be small, the effect on the revenue cannot be serious. The Postmaster-General, while saying he was not satisfied that the telephone service was a non-paying one, gave the Victorian Chamber of Commerce the benefit of the doubt, whereas any request by a private member on behalf of a small section of the community, is met with a refusal. Perhaps the .best thing I can do is to suggest that the Chamber of Commerce, the Chamber of Manufactures, or the South Australian Branch of the Employers' Federation should wait upon the Postmaster-General, when he may be found as willing to do the fair thing as he was to do the unfair thing at the request of the Victorian Chamber.",38
158,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"Riverina) [3.7] - Are the Government"" prepared to take a more serious view of the position in regard to the As a restrictions imposed by certain States against other States on the introduction of produce, more particularly potatoes?",38
159,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"The Attorney General has told us that he has advised on the matter, though I have not yet seen his opinion.",38
160,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"The Constitution provides for a perfectly free interchange of products between States, but it has been overridden by means of internal regulations prohibiting the introduction of products and live stock, because, perhaps, in a small portion of a particular State, there is some disease. Notwithstanding that nine-tenths of the State may be absolutely free, the whole of the. State may be quarantined. Riverina is not a potato-growing district, and never could be without irrigation ; and the people there have to depend for their supply on Victoria and Tasmania. In consequence of the restrictions imposed, potatoes have gone up to famine prices; and, even if the object be to reserve the market for the producers in-the north of New South Wales, supplies cannot be got from there because those who control the affairs of the State are so unfederal as to. refuse the necessary railway communication. As showing how ridiculous and hurtful these prohibitions are, I may say that, during this season, there has been undue interference at the agricultural shows along the border line - On the Murray, for instance, there are irrigation settlements where potatoes are grown, and there is not a suspicion of disease; and yet growers who desired to exhibit potatoes for the purpose of educating the people as to the possibilities of irrigation, were refused permission. Potatoes are £ 1 0 a ton when they should be half the price; and I think'the Federal Government ought to use the powers they undoubtedly possess when they see the Constitution being so strained and overridden. Only a short time ago, through the Prime Minister, I expressed to the State authorities of New South Wales the desire of a large number of ray constituents for a railway extension of fourteen miles to connect with a Victorian system, so as to enable the growers to get their products to the Victorian market. A deputation followed my letter, but the Minister in New South Wales, while admitting that the arguments of the deputation as to the line paying and so forth were perfectly valid, bluntly said that such a railway would not be in the interests of New South Wales, and, therefore, he could not recommend it . If that is not straining the Constitution I do not know what is ; and under the circumstances it is time that the Federal Government made a very strong pronouncement.",38
161,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,The Attorney-Genera! told me that either a State or an individual would have to move in the matter.,39
162,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"But if no one moves then the Federal Government should do so, either by representations to the State Government, or in any other way the Attorney General may advise. I call the Postmaster General's' attention to the fact that I am inundated with letters, which I send on to the Department nearly every day, complaining about the telephone service; but, even where the Department approves of the works that are desired, the reply is always that there is no money available. If there is one part of the community more than another which should have preference in telephonic communication, it is the people living in the country, rather than those in the towns and cities. It is the more necessary for them, because by its means life may be saved or danger from bush fires and other causes may be averted. I notice in this morning's paper that a telephone service now connecting two Victorian towns, 50 miles apart, is to be replaced by a much more expensive system. The existing condenser system may not be perfect, but it is still usable, yet while money is refused for any kind of a telephone service in many country districts, about £ 1 , 2 0 0 is to be spent without warrant in giving those two places greatly improved communication. It would be only in Keeping with justice and equity to allow the existing system, however imperfect, to remain until at least other portions of the community, which have now no telephonic communication at all, are supplied with it in some form.",39
163,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,Does the honourable member think that Victoria gets too much money as compared with other States?,39
164,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,I do not say so.,39
165,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"T ha t improved service is to be given in order to provide telephonic communication for the intermediate stations, which cannot be supplied by the condenser system. If the honourable member wants to promote his own cause, he ought not to attack other causes.",39
166,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"As the Postmaster General has referred to it, I may mentionthat the line to which I refer is in his own electorate, running from Bendigo to Echuca.",39
167,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,That work has been recommended for years past.,39
168,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"But the people there are already getting a service of a kind, while my electors and others are getting none.",39
169,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,Ne w South Wales has received more money than Victoria in proportion to the population.,39
170,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"That is not my point. My point is that the existing system between those two places, even if indifferent and imperfect, should be allowed to remain until other people have been given some kind of service.",39
171,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,Why does not the honourable member leave other districts alone?,39
172,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,I should not have mentioned that case if other districts were being supplied.,39
173,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,The present service between those two places is not effective for growing requirements.,39
174,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"It is better than none at all, and is capable of being used for the purpose for a number of years to come. Surely the honourable member, who has as much knowledge of country requirements as I have, can realise the necessity for ordinary facilities in remote districts.",39
175,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"I have done more for the country districts than any previous Postmaster-General, and yet the honourable member is not satisfied.",39
176,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,The honourable member and his predecessors have not done for the country districts anything like what they should have done.,39
177,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,The Bendigo and Echuca telephone service is a country district one.,39
178,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"There are other people in the country who get no communication at all, and yet hundreds of thousands of pounds are being spent in the cities in duplicating or undergrounding lines, which might have been left on the poles until the country districts had been supplied.",39
179,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"Moama , Echuca, and Deniliquin will have the benefit of the trunk line from Bendigo.",40
180,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"I am speaking on behalf of the whole"" of the vast territory of the Riverina. Moama and Deniliquin are not complaining, because they have telegraphic communication. Those for whom I am pleading have no communication whatever, and simply ask for telephone lines. I am surprised at the Postmaster-General displaying heat over the matter. I give him credit for doing all he can, but I want him to give preference to country districts as against the larger cities and towns. I have no desire to make complaints in the House. flood the Department as it is with correspondence, and it is as tiring to me as it must be to other honourable members to get replies day after day to the effect that no funds are available, or that the work has been approved of but must wait its turn. While those replies are sent out by the Department, other works, such as that to which I have just alluded, are brought to the front, and money is spent on them instead of being used for purposes to which it would be better applied. I am sorry the Minister of Defence is not present. wished to call his attention once more to the necessity' for providing a rifle range on the other side of the Murray in New South Wales, for the benefit of the people there, and also of the people of Swan Hill , Victoria. I find, however, that I can effect nothing. I make representations in the House and elsewhere, but nothing is done. A little while ago the honourable member for Wimmera and myself waited upon the Minister on this subject. We went to a considerable amount of trouble in interviewing people. We discovered that the land was there, and could be obtained, and that the Minister had power to acquire it, but there the matter rests. There should be no delay in cases of this kind. The same remarks apply to the application for the formation of a light horse corps at Deniliquin, but it is of no use for me to continue, as the Minister is not present. I presume that he will not hear anything about what I have said, or will take no notice of it if he does hear it. There are other matters which I wish to bring under the notice of the Minister of Home Affairs, but he also is absent. When a Supply Bill is before the House, Ministers should pay the House the courtesy of being in their places to listen to complaints which honourable members feel it their duty to make on behalf of their constituents. As the Prime Minister is present, may I appeal to him to take prompt and active steps to point out to the State authorities that they are outraging and overriding the Federal Constitution by their provincial enactments forbidding the free interchange of products between State and State? This matter has been dealt with by the honourable members for Darwin, Bass, Wilmot, and Barker, but the matter affects not only those gentlemen and their constituents, but also large portions of other States. If those State restrictions are to be allowed to continue, we might as well close our doors; and give the States preI dominance at once, because' fhey are preventing the accomplishment of true Federation, and the free interchange of products from one end of Australia to the otherobjects which the Commonwealth was created to accomplish. With these restrictions, we are no more free than we were in preFederation days, with Customs Houses on the borders. This matter deserves the serious and immediate attention of the Government. I trust that, before Supply is again asked for, Ministers will be in"" a position to state that they have taken defiI nite action, and that some good has ensued.",40
181,Mr WISE,Unknown,"Gippsland) [3.27] - Does the Postmaster-Geneial intend to continue the present policy of the Department with regard to new mail and telephonic services in country districts ? The present idea that the Department is a business concern which should be made to pay, and that no new mail or telephonic service or extension thereof should be granted unless it can be shown that it will - pay, is absolutely erroneous! When a small number of settlers - in the backwoods ask for extra services, they receive a report stating that the cost is so much, the estimated revenue so much, and the deficiency so much, and that before anything can be done, they must guarantee the deficiency, and enter into a bond for a number of years. That is a wrong basis upon which to carry on the Department. As the Prime Minister pointed out in a speech on postal questions last year, the first object of the Department is to be a great national institution, to promote social and business intercourse throughout Australia. The question of making it pay is altogether a secondary consideration. No country mail or telephonic service will pay when started. None of them is expected to pay. The telephonic and postal services of the his cities did not pay when first established, and the revenue of the whole State was called upon to make up the deficiencies. Similarly the revenue of the Commonwealth ought to be drawn upon to make up deficiencies in connection with new services in country districts. My utmost sympathy has always gone out to people who settle in the back-blocks. I recognise that they do not go there from patriotic motives, but to bet- practice. ter themselves, but in bettering themselves and opening up country lands they are rendering a great service to the whole community. They suffer quite sufficient deprivation when they go into the back-blocks by cutting themselves off from the comforts and pleasures ot civilized life in more settledcommunities, and the Government ought to do everything in their power to make their existence as comfortable and pleasant as possible when doing their pioneering work. That can be achieved by the Commonwealth by means of mail and telephonic services, and by the States by providing roads and railways. 1 had occasion some time ago to-speak to the Postmaster-General in regard to this matter, and whilst he was certainly sympathetic, he seemed to be unable to get away from the view of the Permanent Head that his Department should pay. It appears to me that the only way to get Over the difficulty would be to provide on the Estimates a sum to make good these deficiencies. If that is to be done let done, although it is the veriest farce to money only to return it to the same pocket. The money must come out of the general revenue. The only difference is that under such a system the Department concerned flatters itself that it is paying its way cause the general revenue is making good the deficiency caused by non-paying services; but the deficiency would still have to be made good under ordinary circumstances out of the Consolidated Revenue. I do not think that every person should have mail service or telephone communication at his back door; but wherever there is reasonable settlement in the back blocks, there should be a reasonable mail service, and, where possible, telephonic communication. As the honourable member for Riverina has pointed out, these telephonic extensions are of immense importance to the people in cases of sickness or accident. In country districts many people have to ride 60 or 70 miles to obtain the services of a medical man. It is bad enough to have to wait in cases of sickness or accident until a doctor is able to ride 60 or 70 miles to render service; but when the persons concerned have to wait until a messenger can ride that distance to summon him and bring him back, lives must often be sacrificed. The principle of requiring the residents of a district to which a telephone extension is desired to guarantee the deficiency, whilst good in theory, is absolutely bad in There is no means under the law of compelling the residents to contribute to the deficiency, and it is simply a case of the willing horse being overworked. Very often the men best off in a district will not pay a penny, but take the benefit of the service obtained by means of the contributions of their poorer neighbours. I cast no blame whatever upon the Postmaster General. I know that he is sympathetic, but I should like him to consider this question, and to let us know at once whether he is going, whenever a reasonable case is made out, to grant telephonic communication and mail services, even where those services will not pay, or, if his Department must show a good balance-sheet, he will see that a substantial sum is placed on the Estimates to make good the deficiencies that may occur in connection with such extensions.",40
182,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"Bendigo-Postmas ter-General) [3.34] - In reply to the complaints that have been made with regard to telephone extensions, I should like to reit be mind honourable members that in the Works vote and Buildings (Appropriation) Bill, passed by Parliament this session, a large and substantial sum was set apart for carrying out telephonic and telegraphic works in the several States. That vote is probably the be- largest that has ever been granted by this Parliament for the purpose. When the Bill was before the House, I submitted lists showing the various works in each State on which that amount was to be expended. Everything done was fair and above board. Honourable members knew the destination of the money, and nothing was left to my discretion subsequent to the vote. The amount for which that Act provides, therefore, has been completely appropriated to purposes approved by Parliament. I admit that since then a large number of applications have been received from all parts of the Commonwealth for works equally as important and as urgent as some that were approved and provided for in the Works and Buildings (Appropriation) Bill. But honourable members ought to remember that I cannot sanction works for which funds are not provided. Whilst I know that the honourable member for Riyerina and the. honourable member for Gippsland have been urgently pressed by their constituents to try to induce the Government to carry out many works which no doubt could be justified, some more completely than others, they must admit and recognise, as public men, that the powers of my Department are limited by the financial resources placed at its disposal by Parliament.",41
183,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"We do, but more provision made for such works.",42
184,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"Handsom e provision was made this year for new works. If we had doubled the vote, I do not think we should have been able to spend the whole amount this year owing to the inadequacy of the supervising staff and the inadvisableness of enlarging that staff to meet a temporary demand which in future will probably be kept well in hand - It would give me the greatest pleasure to be able to sanction every work that would pay or presented a reasonable prospect of paying in time to come. No penurious policy has my sympathy. I believe in a forward, progressive, and developmental policy; but my desires and those of the Government are limited by the finances at our disposal. I hope that it will be remembered that the big instalment of the Works' vote included in this year's appropriation is but the first of a three years' course of expenditure. In the second year a large number of works now pressed so effectively by honourable members will receive consideration, and so with other works in the succeeding year. But honourable members must inform their constituents, as I have told them, that the powers of the Government are limited, and that all these works cannot be carried out at once. I thoroughly sympathize with the policy enunciated by the honourable member for Riverina and the honourable member for Gippsland as to the urgent necessity of increasing telephonic and telegraphic means of communication in country districts, ancl shall do all that I can to support it. But whilst honourable members are justified in advocating the construction of works within their respective constituencies, I hope that they will not attack concessions granted to others.",42
185,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"Adelaide) [3.37] - A few moments ago the honourable member for Hindmarsh drew attention to the inequality in the matter of the telephone flat rates in the various States. I wish to add a few words because an interjection made by the Postmaster-General seemed to indicate that if the consequent loss of revenue will not be too great, there is some hope of his effecting the desired change, so far as Adelaide is concerned - In this respect we are not asking for the expenditure of money or dealing with' what has or has not been voted. We merely ask the Minister to remove an inequality that inflicts a distinct injustice upon a certain number we want of subscribers in one State capital. To do that it is unnecessary to amend an Act of Parliament. All that is required is the alteration of a regulation. By a stroke of his pen the Postmaster-General could effect the change, and so do justice to subscribers who at present are being imposed upon. I suggest most respectfully to him that it would be unfair to compel these persons to continue under the impost until the. Committee, appointed to inquire into the financial side of the telephone and telegraph branches of the Department submit their report - I do not know when we shall receive a report in respect of even one State, much less all the States. It may be twelve months before the Committee will have completed its very arduous labours, and in the circumstances I suggest that it would be possible for the Minister to effect the desired change without waiting so long. Might I remind the honourable gentleman of his own interjection, namely, "" How many subscribers are affected by this unjust impost?"" A report from his officers will show that they are not numerous, yet the impost is unjust and the effect of its removal upon the revenue would cause no inconvenience. While the amount is infinitely small to the Commonwealth, it is unjust to the individual subscribers who are suffering, and it is unfair that the impost should continue. I do not say, because the change might involve too great an alteration in the revenue, that the subscribers to the Adelaide Exchange should be put on a level even with those in Brisbane, but I do ask, and, I think, with all justification, that they - may at least be put on an equality with subscribers to the exchanges in the two other large centres of Melbourne ancl Sydney. I hope that the Postmaster-General will see his way clear to obtain a report from his officers and to effect the desired change. Question resolved in the affirmative.
