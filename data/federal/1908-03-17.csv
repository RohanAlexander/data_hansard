3,Mr MAUGER,T ELEGRAPH IC COMMUNICATI ON,"The damage done by the floods in the north appears to be far-reaching and serious, and the restoration of telegraphic communication will involve some time, and considerable expense. I shall lay upon the table of the House the telegrams that I have received on the subject.",15

6,Mr FISHER,T ELEGRAPH IC COMMUNICATI ON,"In regard to the interask ruption of the telegraphic service with the north, I desire to ask the Postmaster-General whether he will arrange for a cheap service through New Zealand during the period that the interruption continues? It is a serious thing for the whole of Queensland to be cut off from communication with the southern States for two days, and the Government ought certainly to take some steps to ascertain the state of affairs which exists in that portion of Australia. Will the Postmaster-General do his best to arrange for a reasonably cheap service to and from Queensland through New Zealand ?",15

12,Mr WILKS,T ELEGRAPH IC COMMUNICATI ON,"Has the Prime Minister received official verification of the report published in the press that the Government of the United States of America have accepted the invitation extended by him, on behalf of the Commonwealth, to the American fleet to visit Australia. If so, will he invite the British Government to have special naval representation on the occasion of the visit, so that the ceremonies may partake of something in the nature of a British-American naval demonstration in Australian waters?",15
13,Mr DEAKIN,T ELEGRAPH IC COMMUNICATI ON,"The Government are not yet in receipt of the official reply. The invitation was tendered through the British Government, and the reply will follow the same channel. No doubt a proper recogI nition of the visit of the fleet by the British squadron will be arranged by the I m perial Government.",15
14,Mr KING OMALLEY,T ELEGRAPH IC COMMUNICATI ON,I desire to the Prime Minister whether a port of Tasmania is included amongst those to be visited by the American Fleet?,15
15,Mr DEAKIN,T ELEGRAPH IC COMMUNICATI ON,"The invitation to the 1 American Fleet is to visit the Commonwealth of Australia. I presume that when, the acceptance reaches us, or soon after, we shall know the ports they propose to visit, though, as I say, the invitation covers the whole of the Commonwealth.

Mr HUTCHISON - Can the Attorney-General inform the House of the reasons that prevented the case of The King versus Harris, Scarfe and Company being proceeded with recently at Adelaide, seeing that the High Court had arranged to sit obli.ee the press. there ?",15
16,Mr GROOM,T ELEGRAPH IC COMMUNICATI ON,"Negotiation s for a settlement of the case had been started, and were, at the time, nearly concluded.",15
17,Mr BATCHELOR,T ELEGRAPH IC COMMUNICATI ON,I should like the Attorney-General to say whether full details of the terms of any proposed settlement will be published ?,15
18,Mr GROOM,T ELEGRAPH IC COMMUNICATI ON,"Yes . The terms of the .settlement will necessitate an appearance in Court, and the whole case will be made public.",16
19,Mr TUDOR,T ELEGRAPH IC COMMUNICATI ON,But the settlement will be arranged in private.,16
20,Mr GROOM,T ELEGRAPH IC COMMUNICATI ON,"I have been informed of the general principles of the proposed settlement, but am not in possession of the whole of the details. I ask the honourable member not to press the question, because I cannot make any further disclosure at this stage. say that the Crown issued certain informations-, and the defences to them were demurred to on grounds of law. Negotiations have been going on in regard to the pleadings, and certain settlements have been arrived at, details of which I have not yet received from the Crown Solicitor. The judgment in the case will have to go to a single Judge, and be entered up in Court. MOUNTED CADETS: MILITARY OFFICERS.",16
21,Mr FAIRBAIRN,T ELEGRAPH IC COMMUNICATI ON,"I desire to know whether the Minister of Defence noticed in the press of yesterday some serious statements made by Captain Rushall, commanding officer of the Melbourne Cavalry, in reference to his retirement from the Forces. The statement is in reference to the Mounted Cadets, and is as follows :The boys have no rifles, no belts, no bayonets, no haversacks, no capes. They have nothing cept their horses, saddles, bridles, and uniforms, all of which they have themselves provided. If the Minister did notice that statement does he propose to have steps taken to remedy this state of affairs, and secure services of this valuable officer?",16
22,Mr EWING,T ELEGRAPH IC COMMUNICATI ON,"I did see the statement referred to, and the case originated in this have been very much stimulated. way. It is laid down by the regulations that an officer shall hold only one posistimulus tion in connection with the Defence Forces. For instance, a man may not be an officer in the Artillery and in the Light Horse at the same time; and so he cannot be an officer of cadets, and also an officer of Horse.",16
23,Mr FAIRBAIRN,T ELEGRAPH IC COMMUNICATI ON,Hav e the boys none the accoutrements mentioned ?,16
24,Mr EWING,T ELEGRAPH IC COMMUNICATI ON,"I am not aware of the fact, but I shall look into the matter, and, if such should prove to be the case, I shall endeavour to get over the difficulty. not desire to say any more about the at present.",16
25,Mr MCWILLIAMS,T ELEGRAPH IC COMMUNICATI ON,"In view of the answer just given I desire to know whether the Minister of Defence will take into consideration the advisability of amending the regulation which provides that an officer, holding a commission is compelled to resign that commission so soon as he takes up an appointment in connection with the cadets. For instance, a school teacher may be a valuable officer, but the moment he takes charge of the cadets, as he must do in connection with the schools, he is I may compelled to resign his position in the volunteers or the militia. I trust the Minister will' see the advisability of giving greater range, so that officers, under such circumstances as I have indicated, may be allowed to continue to give their services in both capacities?",16
26,Mr EWING,T ELEGRAPH IC COMMUNICATI ON,"Under such circumstances as those described an officer is seconded for the time being-it is not a question of absolute severance. My personal opinion is, with regard to the cadets, that, it would be wise .to permit militia officers, who are prepared to give their time, to accept appointments. That is my personal opinion, but beyond that I do not think the honourable member will ask me to go at present. TARIFF : STIMULUS OF INDUSTRIES : IMMIGRATION.",16
27,Mr JOHNSON,T ELEGRAPH IC COMMUNICATI ON,"Can the Minister of exTrade arid Customs inform us whether any stimulus to Australian manufactures has followed, or is expected to follow, the imposition of the new Customs duties?",16
28,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,T ELEGRAPH IC COMMUNICATI ON,"Yes ; and the I should be very glad if the honourable member will allow me to give a great many instances of where Australian industries The honourable member must have seen this in his own city of Sydney, or he goes about with his eyes closed.",16
29,Mr KELLY,T ELEGRAPH IC COMMUNICATI ON,"I desire, following on that question, to ask the Prime Minister Light whether, in view of the stimulus given to Australian .manufacturing industries by the of recent imposition of higher duties, the honourable gentleman will further assist these industries by advertising in the United Kingdom the opportunities which Australia offers to industrial immigrants particularly,I do and by arranging to assist such immigrants case with reduced fares, and by such other means as may be found necessary, in order to show that the Commonwealth is ready to encourage immigration without waiting any longer for the States.",16
30,Mr DEAKIN,T ELEGRAPH IC COMMUNICATI ON,"I received no intimation that this question was to be asked, and until the last few words thought.it would be possible to give a short and favourable answer. But, as a matter of fact, we are still in communication with the States, and I am exchanging letters with the Premier of New South Wales in connection with these very questions.",17
31,Mr KELLY,T ELEGRAPH IC COMMUNICATI ON,"My question relates to industrial immigrants, and not to immigrants for the land. Mr DEAKIN.""-The whole question has been discussed in the correspondence which will shortly be laid on the table of the House. METEOROLOGICAL FORECASTS.",17
32,Mr BATCHELOR,T ELEGRAPH IC COMMUNICATI ON,I desire to ask the Minister of Home Affairs whether he has received a report as to the advisability of reverting to local meteorological forecasts ?,17
33,Mr HUME COOK,T ELEGRAPH IC COMMUNICATI ON,"The Minister has furnished me with a report from the Commonwealth Meteorologist, Mr H . A. Hunt, and as it is a somewhat lengthy paper, I propose to lay it on the table. immediate information of the honourable member, however, I may say that the report, amongst other particulars, states that out of a total of sixty-two forecasts, thirty-two were correct, eighteen were partially correct, and twelve were failures. The report adds that had the forecasts been issued from Adelaide, the probabilities are that they would have been still more unsatisfactory than has been the case, for in framing the forecasts in the Central Bureau, the Commonwealth Meteorologist has. the advice not only of the best South Australian expert, but also the combined opinions of the central staff of experienced meteorologists.",17
34,Mr BATCHELOR,T ELEGRAPH IC COMMUNICATI ON,"Upon Sunday last the official forecast issued by the Meteorological Department for South"" Australia generally was ""fine and warm."" As a matter of fact, the day was cold, and wet. Would that forecast be included amongst those to which the Minister representing the Minister of Home Affairs has referred as "" partially correct.""",17
35,Mr HUME COOK,T ELEGRAPH IC COMMUNICATI ON,"I would recommend the honourable member to read the whole of the memorandum which has been submitted in regard. to this question, and which has already beeni laid upon the table of the House. When he does so, perhaps he will find an answer to the question which he has just put. FEDERAL CAPITAL SITE.",17
36,Mr JOSEPH COOK,T ELEGRAPH IC COMMUNICATI ON,"I desire to ask the Minister in charge of the Federal Capital site matter a question, without notice. I understand that it is proposed to make visits to certain proposed sites before the question is finally decided in this House, and I should like to know ""whether the time of these visits has been fixed, and when we may expect the matter to be ripe for decision by Parliament?",17
37,Mr DEAKIN,T ELEGRAPH IC COMMUNICATI ON,"The Government are projecting no visit, but honourable members have expressed a desire to see one or two sites. I understand the visits will take place within the next fortnight.",17
38,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,T ELEGRAPH IC COMMUNICATI ON,"Nex t Saturday week, and, perhaps, on the following Saturday.",17
39,Mr DEAKIN,T ELEGRAPH IC COMMUNICATI ON,"But those visits do not necessarily imply any delay in the necessary preliminary steps for the introduction of the Bill. ADMINISTRATION : PAPUA. For the Mr BOWDEN - I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether the Government propose to take early action in regard to the appointment of an Administrator in Papua, and whether there is any truth in the report that it is proposed to appoint Judge Murray ?",17
40,Mr DEAKIN,T ELEGRAPH IC COMMUNICATI ON,"The vacancy has not yet arisen technically, nor, when it does arise, is there any immediate urgency for the appointment. On the contrary, this appointment, together 'with certain other changes, will require to be considered by the Government, and brought before this House, before any definite action is taken. HI GH COMMISSIONER BILL.",17
41,Mr JOHNSON,T ELEGRAPH IC COMMUNICATI ON,I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether it is the intention of the Government to introduce the Bill relating-to the appointment of a High Commissioner during the current session?,17
42,Mr DEAKIN,T ELEGRAPH IC COMMUNICATI ON,"All questions relatingto the current session are necessarily ambiguous, on account of the uncertainty which exists concerning its duration. If the session be a short one, I doubt whether lr will be possible, during its continuance,. to introduce the Bill to which the honourable member has referred. If , however, it should be prolonged, the measure in question will most certainly be brought forward. SECRET DRUGS, CURES AND",17
43,Mr WILKS,T ELEGRAPH IC COMMUNICATI ON,"I wish to ask the Prime Minister a question relating to the report of the Royal Commissioner upon secret drugs, cures and foods. In the Age of Saturday last the statement appeared that the Parliamentary Medical Committee appointed to deal with the report had declarecl that the Government were holding back the circulation of the document in question, and that it would be necessary to introduce a Bill to protect the Royal Commissioner, as the contents of the report are not covered by parliamentary privilege. I desire to know what is the attitude of the Government in regard to the report in question, and whether it is necessary that a protecting Bill should be introduced to cover the matter of privilege?",18
44,Mr DEAKIN,T ELEGRAPH IC COMMUNICATI ON,"It is necessary that such a Bill should be introduced, and the Attorney-General is now engaged in drafting it. ' I hope that it will be laid on the table of the House in a day or two. POSTAL ADMINISTRATION.",18
45,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,T ELEGRAPH IC COMMUNICATI ON,"I wish to know whether the attention of the Postmaster-General"" has been directed to the following remarks, which are reported to have been made by the Secretary of his Department, and which recently appeared in the press"" Any sensible man would know,"" said the secretary, referring to the article in the Herald, of - F r i d ay last, ""that no relief can be given iirilil officials are appointed. What has to be done before a permanent hand can be appointed ? The postmaster has to ask for it. f t has to be reported on by the inspector. It has to be approved by the Postmaster-General. It has to be passed by the Public Service Commissioner, and then the question of money comes in. Men cannot be put on until there is money to pay them. . . . master-General himself cannot appoint a messenger boy. He has to apply for what he wants. ferred to, we cannot be expected lo be responsible at head-quarters for the inefficiency of men. They are not appointed by the Postmaster-General, and he cannot remove them from their offices. No other large 'business establishment would ever expect to carry on under the conditions the Postmaster-General is bound down to."" If the attention of the Minister has been directed to the foregoing remarks, does he think that the permanent head of his Department should reflect upon the policy adopted by this Parliament, and by the Ministry, under whom he holds office? If he does not, will he take steps to see FOODS. that in future any expressions of opinion upon matters of policy emanate from the Minister himself, in that discreet way in which he generally deals with such matters? I think it is unfortunate that reflections should be cast upon another Department of the Commonwealth, and upon - the policy of the country, by the permanent head of the Postal Department.",18
46,Mr MAUGER,T ELEGRAPH IC COMMUNICATI ON,The statement to which my honourable friend has drawn attention is largely correct. The question of the advisableness or otherwise of the permanent head of the Department giving expression to opinions upon matters of policy is one which will' receive attention. NA VETERANS.,18
47,Sir JOHN FORREST,CRIMEAN AND INDIAN MUTINY,"Before the Christmas adjournment I asked the Prime Minister whether he would ascertain how many veterans engaged in the Indian Mutiny and the Crimean War were inmates of charitable institutions of the State, and he promised to make inquiries into the matter. I now wish to know whether he has any information upon the subject to give to the House?",18
48,Mr DEAKIN,CRIMEAN AND INDIAN MUTINY,"I have obtained an. incomplete list, which, of course, it did not seem desirable to present to the House, because odd veterans are to be found in various parts of the Commonwealth. I think, however, that the complete list will shortly be available, and it will then be laid upon, the table ST. PATRICK'S DAY.",18
49,Mr WILKS,CRIMEAN AND INDIAN MUTINY,"I wish to ask the Postmaster-General whether he recently issued the following memorandumOfficers of your office desiring to lake part in The Post- St. Patrick's Day procession on 17th inst. should make application for h.ilf-holiday on day in question. If their services can be As to the delays and losses re- spared without public inconvenience, applications will receive favourable consideration. It is alleged that this memorandum was issued on the 12th inst., and I desire, to ask the Minister whether he will issue a similar memorandum prior to St. George's Day, St. Andrew's Day, and St. David's Day ?",18
50,Mr MAUGER,CRIMEAN AND INDIAN MUTINY,"I may tell the honourable member that T know-nothing whatever of the circular in question. I desire to add that similar facilities are afforded to postal employees in every State upon public holidays. The action in question - was taken by the Deputy Postmaster-General in accordance with the custom that has obtained for some years. K ALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A which RAILWAY SURVEY.

54,Mr HUMECOOK,CRIMEAN AND INDIAN MUTINY,"If that promise was made, no doubt the Minister's instructoms. tions to the party will give effect to it. OATH OF ALLEGIANCE .  the Prime Minister been called to the following report, which appeared in the Argus of 20th February last, of a speech made by the honourable member for West Sydney, at the annual picnic of the Wharf Labourers' UnionNothing was easier for them than lo bring about a condition of things that would be distasteful to the country by a cessation of work. They had never broken an award of the Arbitration Court, although they were under no obligation' to observe it, seeing they had been denied preference. I wish to know from the honourable and learned gentleman if a statement or assertion made by a member of the House to induce persons to break the law is in accordance with the oath of allegiance which he takes on being sworn in ?",19

Five honourable members having risen in their places, Question proposed ",19
56,Mr HUTCHISON,CRIMEAN AND INDIAN MUTINY,"Following upon the reply of the Attorney-General to a questo tion I put to him on the subject, I have taken this action because I wish to know whether, in any settlement arrived at, the Government is to be a party to the compounding of a felony. It should not be' possible for the public to think for a moment that this or any Government would be allowed by Parliament to do such a thing as Ever since the right honourable memgo ber for Adelaide ceased to administer the Customs Department, the comment has been procommon that justice is not being done to the revenue, as it was in his time, by the punishing of persons defrauding the Cus",19
57,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CRIMEAN AND INDIAN MUTINY,That is a very serious charge to make against his successors.,19
58,Mr HUTCHISON,CRIMEAN AND INDIAN MUTINY,"It is a veryserious charge; but I , and many .others, have been led to think that there is ground for the common statement that the Customs Department does not appear to be entirely free from taint. Since the resignation by the right honourable member for Adelaide of the portfolio of Minister of Trade and Customs, case after case has been reported in the newspapers, but the names of those committing offences have been kept back. This leads. to the suspicion that there is something. of the backstairs method in the present settlement of dispage . putes, which should not be tolerated.",19
59,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CRIMEAN AND INDIAN MUTINY,That is a charge against the present Minister.,20

74,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CRIMEAN AND INDIAN MUTINY,Is this sort of thing from that meted still going on?,20
75,Mr HUTCHISON,CRIMEAN AND INDIAN MUTINY,"Yes . It is complained that in Adelaide, at present, there is no audit staff, such as there is in allof the other States. Only one audit officer is employed there. I believe that complications have prevented the staff being placed on the footing that prevails in other States, quesbut I do not want honourable members to imagine that, although there is only one honCommonwealth audit officer in Adelaide, the accounts of the Customs Department are not being audited. I cannot say how into long these alleged fraud's have been going",20
76,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CRIMEAN AND INDIAN MUTINY,Some of us do not We know anything about the case. What are,20
77,Mr HUTCHISON,CRIMEAN AND INDIAN MUTINY,I have not all the facts.,20
78,Mr BATCHELOR,CRIMEAN AND INDIAN MUTINY,The case itself is immaterial to the question before us. The point is whether a case of this kind should to Court. be dealt with in open court..,20
79,Mr HUTCHISON,CRIMEAN AND INDIAN MUTINY,"Or settled privately in the office of the Minister. I less hope that no big case will be privately settled; all should be treated alike. Under it the old system, a reputable firm could be like brought before the police court for a mere has error of judgment, but nowadays the I practice is for the Minister to. deal pria big vately with such matters - All cases should be dealt'with in open court, so that the public may know the real facts. I should prefer to deal with a man who had never defrauded the CustomsDepartment rather than to patronize a man who had been - convicted of doing so. There is; however,' a far more important principle a involved. When it was alleged that how Charles Tucker had defrauded the Department of Trade , arid Customs of about £30,000, the people were astounded. Yet we find from the report' of the Auditor General that the administration is still Many . of the officers who were administering the Department when the Tucker frauds took place still retain their positions, and no change has - been made in respect of the office of Collector. The Auditor-General shows that, instead of the Department ha.ving been defrauded of £30,000, it has in that way lost at least £60,000, to say nothing of what has happened during ten years in respect of which no record can be obtained. This firm ought to be brought before the Court in order that we may discover whether or not it has been doing what Tucker did. I sincerely hope that it has not, but I believe that either frauds or offences covering very large sums have been entered into by the firm.",20
80,Mr KELLY,CRIMEAN AND INDIAN MUTINY,Is the honourable member sure of his facts? His statement is a very serious one.,21
81,Mr HUTCHISON,CRIMEAN AND INDIAN MUTINY,"It is alleged that serious frauds have been committed, and I wish to ascertain whether that allegation is correct. The honourable member must not put into my mouth statements that I do not make.",21
82,Mr KELLY,CRIMEAN AND INDIAN MUTINY,I thought that the able member said he - believed that such things had happened.,21
83,Mr HUTCHISON,CRIMEAN AND INDIAN MUTINY,"So I do, but I cannot prove that they have. I should not have taken the extreme step of moving the adjournment of the House had I not strong grounds for the belief that all is not right - that not only a civil, but a criminal offence has been committed.",21
84,Mr KELLY,CRIMEAN AND INDIAN MUTINY,"Would the honourable member make that statement outside, where he would not be sheltered by privilege?",21
85,Mr HUTCHISON,CRIMEAN AND INDIAN MUTINY,"Why should I? I once declared that I would not say in Parliament what I was not prepared to say outside, and my adherence to that resolution cost me £350. The man of whom I spoke was Charles Tucker, who is now in gaol.",21
86,Mr FISHER,CRIMEAN AND INDIAN MUTINY,How did he get a verdict ?,21
87,Mr HUTCHISON,CRIMEAN AND INDIAN MUTINY,"There was a property jury, and one of Tucker's relations was a member of it.",21

90,Mr WILKS,CRIMEAN AND INDIAN MUTINY,I suppose that the honourable member is speaking of what is current rumour in Adelaide?,21
91,Mr HUTCHISON,CRIMEAN AND INDIAN MUTINY,"The Minister, if he chose to speak, could show that there is something more than mere rumour involved. This is one of the most serious matters that the Court could deal with, because it involves the reputation of one of the largest companies in Australia. I certainly have no desire to injure any firm, but, on the other hand, I do not wish the revenue, and,"" consequently, the taxpayers to be injured. There are some men who think that they have a perfect right to get at the Government if they can do so, and they are merely looked upon by many as smart business people who are doing that which is immoral but not illegal. Such practices, to my mind, should be both illegal and immoral. T am not prepared to remain silent whilst a case like this is being hushed up in a private office. To show the laxity of the administration at Port Adelaide, I would point out that when Messrs. Meucke honour and Company were acting as agents for Messrs. John Martin and Company the payments to the Department on behalf of the principal item were much larger than they were whilst Tucker acted as their agent. In an extract from the report of the Chief Clerk of the Audit Office, which appears in Appendix C to the report of the Auditor General, it is shown thatFollowing Tucker's appointment, the payments to the Customs on John Martin and Company's account in July and August 1884, totalled ^243 os. 6d., as compared with ^981 gs. 4d. for the corresponding months of the previous year, when. Messrs. Meucke and Company were acting as agents. The Chief Clerk shows that for July and August, 1893, the duty payable by John Martin and Company, after allowing 7 per cent, for charges, was £1,018 16s., and that the amount actually paid to the Department was only £ 1 9 0 2s., or a shortage of £828 14s. In the months of January, February, July, arid August, 1894, the amount - payable by the company was ^£2,088 is. 2d., but the amount actually paid was £205 8s.. 9d., the .shortage being no less than £1,882 12s. sd.

John Martin and Companyrespect of duty was £4,068 7s. 2d., out of which there was paid to the Customs the of ^1,940 19s. i d . , thus leaving a shortage It is remarkable that year after year this state of affairs prevailed at Port Adelaide, and that notwithstanding that the volume of merchandise handled on behalf of Messrs. John Martin and Company was the same as before, the Customs authorities did not notice the falling off in revenue from that source. The firm of John Martin and Company is one of the most' reputable in Australia; but it was victimized as the result of its effort to do at good turn to a relative of a member of the company. I trust that when the Government are called upon to determine what payment it shall make in respect of the amount short paid on its behalf by Charles Tucker,.they will extend to it some consideration. There can be no doubt that the firm honestly handed over to Tucker, as its agent, every penny for which it was liable in respect of Customs duties, and that Tucker, to whom, as I have said, they tried to do a good turn, robbed the Department. When such things are possible, something must be wrong with the administration of the. Department in South Australia. right to know whether in this case a mere error of judgment has been committed, or whether a criminal offence has been perpetrated. I believe I shall have the House with me when I sav that our desire is that every individual, whether influential or not, shall have justice. I hope that no suspicion that corruption exists in the Department will be allowed to remain in the public mind; but if important cases are settled in private, the public certainly will suspect that there is something wrong - Having regard to the lax state of affairs which has prevailed and the comparatively trifling attempts that have been made to remedy the defects in the administration, we certainly have cause for dissatisfacion.. I trust that the Attorney-General will inform the House that this case will not be settled except in the most public manner. '",21

An action against this firm was instituted in the High Court, and on the pleadings certain defences, involving questions of law, were raised by way of demurrer.. . The matter that was set down for. hearing by the High Court was the determination of the points of law so raised. Late last week certain negotiations transpired, which obviated the necessity for the - questions of law being dealt with by the Court. The firm in question - were charged on seventeen sets of charges - with having passed false entries with intent to defraud. The fullest investigation was made by the Crown Solicitor', by counsel in Adelaide acting on behalf of the Department, by the Department itself, and by a . solicitor in London, who, acting on behalf of the Commonwealth, had access to all papers there relating to the case.

But certain individuals are to be charged with f r a u d . . In regard to the firm, the charge of intent to defraud will be withdrawn; but, at the same time, the proceedings are to be continued against them.

The latter gentleman has, perhaps, had more experience of Customs matters than most, and I think we - can say that he has been eminently successful - in bringing parties to justice. in this matter has been the subject of most anxious investigation, and, as I say, we must admit on the reports, that the firm has not benefited from the frauds. On the whole, I 'think - that justice is being done in the settlement which is now being made.

117,Mr GROOM,CRIMEAN AND INDIAN MUTINY,"Thos e who committed the frauds will be prosecuted.

132,Mr HUTCHISON,CRIMEAN AND INDIAN MUTINY,"At any rate, that is what I understood. I am glad to know, however, that these charges are to come into Court. But while it is quite true that; in the face of the evidence in their possession, the .Government are taking the only possible action, the inquiry of the honourable member for Grey, as to who has obtained the advantages of the frauds, is most pertinent. This is a matter the Customs Department ought to look into; and I am very glad the question has been raised. I have never known a fraud to be committed without somebody receiving benefit, and if the firm did not receive the benefit of these seventeen distinct frauds, the intermediaries must, have done so. It is necessary that Parliament should know how these interthe mediaries benefited.",24
133,Mr GROOM,CRIMEAN AND INDIAN MUTINY,I have told honourable members that proceedings are to be taken against those intermediaries.,24
134,Mr HUTCHISON,CRIMEAN AND INDIAN MUTINY,"What I said was that there were strong grounds for suspicion that the firm were implicated, and that a fairly large sum was involved. We' cannot say whether the charges which will come before the Court represent the whole of the amount of which the Customs have been defrauded, because, I take it, that only those charges which can be sustained will be put forward. In another case, which has been mentioned, a number of sums were involved, but the Government could not proceed with every charge, and the offender was sentenced, to eighteenmonths, while he ought to have been sentenced to eighteen years, and then he would have got off cheaply, scoundrel that he was. I ami glad the Attorney-General has made a statement to the House, and if he had done so in reply to my question, it would not ,have been necessary to move the adjournment.

143,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,RECEPTION OF COMMODORE,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow1. The Department is aware that opium is being introduced into Australia notwithstanding the prohibition. 2.

Mr Mauger - The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow1. It is not proposed to curtail postal facilities in country districts, except-that in some few cases, where the business is very small and very few letters are posted and received, the frequency of the mail services have been or aTe proposed ' to be reduced to accord with actual requirements. The total provision for inland mail services, apart from those carried by the railways, asked for on the Estimates-in-Chief for the"" current year, exceeds that of last year by £6,300, and it has been found necessary to ask .for a further sum of £4,500 to meet the actuaT necessities of this financial year in this respect. The States are also to be paid £25,000 additional for the half-year ended 30th June next for the carriage of mails by the railways, and as all the passenger and mixed trains are now available for mails, greater facilities will be afforded generally, and particularly in country districts. I shall be pleased to inform members in every case of any curtailment of postal facilities in their electorates, but cannot undertake to issue public notices of such curtailments and"" the reasons there for. 2. The policy of the Department,'as shown by my reply to the previous question, and the increased facilities lately given in country districts, is to afford every facility required by the business to be transacted, so far as the money at its disposal will allow. 3.

150,Mr ARCHER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Capricornia) [4.15] - I do not intend to occupy much time in completing the remarks which I was addressing to the House when the debate was adjourned on Friday last. The principal matter to which I desire to direct attention is that, whilst - I and a great rainy other honourable members are quite prepared to clothe the Government with the powers necessary to secure the conviction of trusts or combines operating in restraint of trade, and to the detriment of the consumer, we desire that that power shall, as far as possible, be removed from the sphere of political influence. In Committee, I hope that some such proposal will be adopted. feel sure that the result I have indicated can be achieved without depriving the Government of the power with which we wish to invest them.",27

153,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Canno t the honourable member foreshadow it now, so that we may be afforded an opportunity of thinking it over ?",27
154,Mr ARCHER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"As a matter of fact, it was foreshadowed in a leading article which appeared in the Argus this morning. The article, to a great extent, has taken the wind out of our sails.",27
155,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I have not read the leadject ing article which appeared in the Argus of today.,27
156,Mr ARCHER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I am exceedingly sorry that the honourable member does not attempt to improve his mind by reading that publication.,27
157,Mr BATCHELOR,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Boothby) [4.17] I read the leading article in reference to this Bill, which was published in the Argus this morning; but I cannot say that I gained a great deal of light from it. To me it appeared to be merely a re-hash of the criticism which emanated from the front Opposition bench on Friday last.",27
158,Mr ARCHER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,That does not detract from its value.,27
159,Mr BATCHELOR,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"No ; but the article does not throw any additional light upon the subject, and spoken words are traders [322 ] 7 occasionally much more effective than are printed words. I must confess that the remarks made by the leader of'the Opposition on Friday last impressed me a great: deal more than did the leading article which appeared in the Argus of today.",27
160,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"What was the position, previously taken up by that journal?",27
161,Mr BATCHELOR,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I do not know. I am not avery consistent reader of that publication. All I know is that upon this Bill the Argus takes up precisely the. attitude adopted by the leader of the Opposition.. I do not intend to discuss the details of this measure. I merely wish to say that we can hail it as the first of a series of amending Bills dealing with antitrust legislation. Last session we passed the principal Act, and, though it has not yet been brought into operation, an amending Bill is already required. I do not I blame the Government for this. The problem with which we seek to deal is a most complex and difficult one, and I shall not be at all surprised if , before the close of this Parliament, we are called upon to consider yet another amending Bill . Mr GROOM. - Huma n nature is constantly changing.",27
162,Mr BATCHELOR,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Condition s areconstantly - changing. There is no doubt that it is very difficult to secure a conviction in the case of trusts and combines.. American experience has demonstrated that.. Even after a conviction has been obtained,, the public will be fleeced in some otherway. As soon as the Court has' decided) that a certain method of fleecing the consumer is illegal, the trusts will adopt some other method. . They will attain their obby a different means, and, as a result, we shall be constantly called upon to pass amending legislation. It goes without saying that the object of the Government is not to break up trusts and combinations.",27
163,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"There are lawful and unlawful combinations.""",27
164,Mr BATCHELOR,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The Government merely seek to regulate these combinations so as to prevent the grosser evils which usually flow from them. One of the difficulties'connected with all anti-trust legislation is that it necessarily assumes that what is perfectlv lawful in the case of the individual is illegal in the case of combinations. In the Mogul Company dispute, Lord Chance'lor Hnlsbury said-I have been unable to discover anything done by - the members of the associated body of other than an offer of reduced freights. to persons who would deal exclusively with them; and if this is unlawful it seems to me that the greater part of commercial dealings, where there is rivalry in trade, must be equally unlawful. The Ix>rd Chancellor was therefore of opinion that, if the granting of rebates was unlawful, the greater portion of our commercial dealings, where rivalry exists in trade, was equally unlawful. As a matf ter of fact, nearly all the unlawful acts committed by trusts-act s which have led to wholesale reprisals and to general concreated. demnation-ar e committed by individuals without exciting any public alarm. Whilst those acts may not be considered perfectly right, they are certainly perfectly legal. For instance, the act of securing a monoThe poly closely resembles the action of a keeper who-havin g seen a customer enterthe ing his rival's establishment to purchase prise itself. some goods-tell s him upon the next occasion that he enters his store that he had tetter get all his goods where he purchased his sausages. There are two ways in which any anti-trust legislation which may devise can be dodged by these comthe binations. One is by forming an amalgapolies mation. The provisions of the measure would not apply where only' one firm was concerned.",27
165,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The Act punishes all comis binations with intent to injure or destroy. Mr BATCHELOR,-Inten t is exceedLegislatures ingly difficult to prove. Could one firm be called a combination?",28
166,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The law applies to every person who enters into or engages in a bination. A firm might be liable for monopolizing or attempting to monopolize.,28
167,Mr BATCHELOR,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Onl y if it did something in restraint of trade. To vour to prevent competition is a perfectly lawful act for any individual or any and it seems to me that amalgamation would enable combinations to dodge the law. The British trusts are largely together by what are termed "" gentlemen's agreements,"" of which there is no docuknow mentary evidence,, nothing being put on paper; and those who have gone carefully not. into the operations of trusts say that some of the most pernicious effects of combinatative tion are due to these arrangements, which the law cannot get at. Therefore, do you will, you cannot surmount the difficulland ties which are entailed by these attempts prevent combination. The members of the Labour Party take no responsibility nexion with the matter. This is' the alternative of private enterprise. cates of unrestricted private enterprise are now brought to this pass : that they have to introduce a Bill which is, in the highest degree, repressive of public liberty, in order that there may be some semblance of free competition. The Labour Party has its alternative.

168,Mr BATCHELOR,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Certainly . The choice is between two alternatives; monopolies managed by and for the benefit of we a few private individuals in opposition to interests of the community, and monoworked by the State in the public interest. I admit that legislation may prevent the grosser abuses which have accrued in the United States of America.

The entire control of an industry, the power to fix the prices at which raw matecomrial shall be paid for and finished products sold, should not be exercised by private individuals; it should be exercised only by the State for the benefit of the endeacommunity. Honourable members may say that this is Socialism. It is common sense. firm, I do not care anything for Socialism as such.

180,Mr BATCHELOR,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I do not wish to take over more than it may be necessary in the public interest to take over. Everything depenas on the view held as to where the public interest begins and ends. If a man works up a business until it becomes a monopoly, for the control of which Parliament must continually legislate, the State should take over the enterprise, since it has become too large for one man to run in his own interest.

Mr. JOSEPH COOK' - Then the honourable member prefers them to the old time business methods. does the",29
190,Mr BATCHELOR,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"No ; I hold that such a state of affairs is inevitable. But after all, is it not idle to say that one prefers conditions that obtained some fifty or sixty years ago to those now ruling?. We cannot get face to face with the exact circumstances of trade of half a century ago, but perhaps the conditions then prevailing were the most suitable for the time being. We have nowadays huge business organizations, and huge firms are being amalgamated at a very rapid rate. I have just read a most interesting book, The Trust Movement in British Industry, by H . W. Macrosty, which cannot be said to be antagonistic to or in - support of trusts. It is really a short history of the formation of the principal trusts in Great Britain. In his survey and conclusions the writer saysGreat as is the extent to which industry has passed into the hands of large combinations, greater still is the domain still subject to the individual, trader. In other words, the most that the writer can say of the movement is that the proportion of British trade not controlled by combinations is greater than is that under their direction. He goes on to sayBut the encroachment on the realm of free competition steadily progresses, though not at the feverish speed of six or seven years ago. We have to reckon with the probability, to use no stronger term, though ""one might, without exaggeration, say - the. certainty, that we are in the early stages of the evolution of the form which industry will take in the future.",29
191,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Does he traverse the operations of the trusts already in existence with ' a view of showing what terrible octopi they are?,29
192,Mr BATCHELOR,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"No . He shows the extent to which they have grown, and what is the best and"" most permanent form to - secure certain results. He takes an un-biased view of the' trust movement, but I should say that he is if anything rather favourable to it . The control of trade by combines is rapidly approaching completion. I do not object to that. On the contrary, I hold that it is a natural evolution. The alternative to a Bill such as that now before us is to nationalize any industry in clanger of becoming a monopoly. The Go- vernment have chosen to attempt to regulate trusts, and I understand that the Opposition support them in that effort, but object to some of the details of their - scheme.",29

196,Mr BATCHELOR,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I could with the utmost consistency vote against it , .but the honourable member could not.

198,Mr SALMON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,They are now merely hibernating.,30
199,Mr BATCHELOR,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"That is so. They are now setting out on their career in Australia, but they know that they are being closely watched, and that there is a strong public feeling against them. That knowledge, to some extent, keeps them in check. They have not yet reached a stage at which they could exercise wide control. Combinations in England, in the first place, have taken the form of trade associations to regulate prices, and have passed on to various stages until they reach the point at which vast amalgamations have been thought necessary. We have an illustration of this in the Goates sewingthread combination, which practically governs the sewing-thread industry of the world. It began as a small combination of a few individual firms, but gradually absorbed .or crushed all its rivals. If trusts are let alone, - or encouraged by the law, they will rapidly develop as they have done in America. America is the great home",30

210,Mr BATCHELOR,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The honourable we member will find in the book much that is a very serious reflection on some of the business methods adopted by British combines. The writer does not pretend to deal with the ethics of trusts; but only with the extent to which they obtain control of .industries and their effects up to the present.,30

212,Mr BATCHELOR,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I said that it is inevitable; I did not say whether it is good or bad. The terms "" g o o d "" or "" b a d "" in connection with an inevitable evolution of industry such as trusts, is idle. To say that trusts are "" good "" because it is necessary under the present conditions that businesses should become larger and larger and get into fewer hands, seems a misuse of the word-trust s are good and * necessary in some respects; but they are bad in other respects. In so far as trustification leads to the cheapening of products, it is certainly good.",31

214,Mr BATCHELOR,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The honourable member is malting me repeat myself.

218,Mr BATCHELOR,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Certainly ; when trusts become monopolies I desire them be taken over by the State. When trusts reach the stage at which they control dustries, they, should not be in the hands .individuals; when they reach the stage which they can exercise their powers against - the interests of the community, it is time the community owned them.

The honourable member knows in his inner consciousness, as we all know, that the best we can hope for is that this legislation will stave off for a time the inevitable result that certain businesses, when they become monopolies, must be controlled by the community. I do not like to accuse an honourable member of want of sincerity, but I think any one might be suspected of want of candour, if he said he expected by this legislation, for all time to control trusts.",31

224,Mr BATCHELOR,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Exactly ; the result has been that trusts have been formed with the sole object of annihilating competition. Even in the United States of America, where there is the greatest play in the world for competition the trusts have absolutely annihilated it. The natural evolution of unrestricted free competition is the formation of trusts which dominate entire industries, and put an end to competition. honourable member seriously say that there is free comside petition in the United States of America Opposiwith their high protective Tariff?",31

My intention is to .vote, so far as the details of the Billare concerned, with in the Government; and if the Opposition of. were in the place of the Government, I at should do the same. In a measure such as this, I leave the Government to decide for themselves what they think is necessary, confident that all such measures will be found totally inadequate to prevent the formation of trusts, which will constantly call for more legislation, and ultimately lead to their absorption by the public for the benefit of the public. Mr. JOSEPH COOK [5.3] - I have listened very carefully to the various expressions of opinion of honourable members in the Labour corner on the question of the repression or otherwise of trusts. The Labour leader began the other day' by chiding us over - here for the different attitude we take on this occasion from that we assumed in regard to the principal measure when it was before the Chamber. He said he. was glad to see we were taking a more favourable view of this legislation now than we did on the previous occasion. Immediately afterwards he was followed by his predecessor in office who told us plainly that, while he proposed to support the Government, he did not believe the measure would do any good-that it was only a stage in the failures that must take place before the final necessity was seen by the community of taking over these huge nolies. That is a consistent attitude on his part-it is ""the attitude he has always assumed. I well remember that in his speech on the principal measure he frankly admitted that he had no faith whatever in this kind of regulative legislation as applied to trusts. Why, therefore, should ' we be chided by the present leader of the Labour Partv with regard to any want of sympathy with the proposal ? I said then, and I say today, that honourable members who welcome this legislation, and assist the Govern-' ment to pass it, are simply making hypocritical pretence. They are passing legislation which they say beforehand they are confident can be of no practical value.",31
228,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I say that it is the nearest step I can get to my desire,32
229,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Then nearest step to the honourable member's deobject sire is to solemnly and deliberately enact a failure? ' Mr MCDONALD - Hear , hear.",32
230,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"That is frank. Why does not the leader of the party say the same? However, we must go to the rank and file in order to ascertain the party's true attitude. We are told that community must pass through a series of is, failures in order that the evolution of the trustification of industries may in time to the absolute necessity of the taking over of industries by the State.",32
231,Mr WATSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"If the honourable member says he can successfully regulate trusts, we shall give him every assistance.",32
232,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"So the honor(Parramatta) able member says; but, at the same time,, he has the reservation in his min.6V-nay, he has expressed .a belief-that all this legislation must end in failure; no one has made that clearer than has the honourable member for South Sydney. It is^ useless, in a debate of this kind, to make use of the general terms which are being constantly indulged in by members of the Labour Party. For instance, the leader of that party, in an attitude of complacency, and with all the force of axiomatic truth, said that what he wants is economic justice to every man. I do not know one who would controvert that proposition. We, on this side are just as eager to give economic jus-, tice to every individual as is the honourable member. Then the honourable member for Boothby told us today that what he desires is the minimum of collective contror consistent with the public interest. That is mono-- a very definite statement indeed. But what on earth does it mean ? We could ail say. the same; and I ask whether honourable members do not see that those idle generalities do not help in the discussion, of thisserious question ? If I require light, I must leave those honourable members and their generalities, and discuss the concrete proposals of the Government. The honourable member for Boothby., to embellish h.isspeech, must needs quote from a writer who declares that there is a great number of trusts in Great Britain. When challenged by me to say what the opinion of the writer is regarding the character of the trusts-whether harmful or helpful to the community-the honourable member could not quote a single line.",32
233,Mr BATCHELOR,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I told the honourable the member that the book was written with the of not inquiring into that question ,32
234,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Quite so; but where then, is the relevancy of the quotations to a Bill of this kind. Everyone knows that there is a great deal of trustificationgoing On all over the world; and we admit, as the honourable member admits, that this is an evolution of our modern industrial life, and that the process seems to be prothe ceeding-apace. But what I venture to saythat it is too early to be confident as towhat the ultimate effect of this trustificalead tion is to be. Honourable members say,. "" Here are trusts, therefore they are ar» evil, and will k ill the community if we <Jo not kill them."" That was the expression of the Prime Minister the other night; and. I say it is a little too early to begin talk so definitely as to the ultimate effects. Mr .MCDONALD - The expression that of the President of the United States of America.",32
235,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I do not know of human nature. that he is the final economic authority in the world. May I remind the honourable are sent to gaol. member that the President of the United States of America said that under no cirwould cumstances must we do anything that will hurt a trust, so long as it is engaged timately in co-operative enterprise.",33

With my hono.*able friends opposite, I recognise that trusts are growing apace throughout the whole industrial world. But in my judgwith ment-and I endeavour to keep my mind the open to all the facts of the case-w e are now beginning to see what are their natural We are beginning to perceive that the difference, between those trusts which are most harmful and those which least harmful springs from the nature as of the case itself. We are beginning to recognise that we cannot make the operation of trusts harmful in their character It is to the general community in connection with products in which there is world-wide production and competition. We may set that down as an economic law. ' Trusts become an evil only where competition is .stifled.",33
254,Mr WATSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,To stifle competition is the object of trusts.,33
255,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I am pointing out that it is impossible for trusts to stifle competition in those products which . operations. are in general use throughout the world, and as to which there is a degree of competition.",34
256,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"There could not be a beef trust for instance? Mr. JOSEPH 'COOK - What is hap-pening in America? What is making the operations of trusts so harmful there ? The very thing that protectionists will never admit. It is the prohibitive Tariff of the United States which is making the opera-, tion of these trusts so great an evil. The Attorney-General talks about the Beef Trust. Let him reflect"" upon the duty that is imposed upon preserved beef in the United States, and he will then see why that trust has exercised so baneful an influence. In the first place, the Legislature has decreed that there shall be no external competition in the matter of beef. Having shut out the competition of the world, the Beef Trust set about working harmful results to the people inside the ring.",34
257,Mr SALMON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I have heard the honourable member say dozens of times that a duty does not operate so soon as a country begins to export.,34
258,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,'What has that to do with my argument?,34

' I am not now arguing the question of free-trade versus protection. I am merely debating whether it is right to impose prohibitive duties upon those products, the control of which may lead to the establishment of monopolies. Wherever we can preserve the element of' competition by regulating our Tariff we shall have trusts whose operations are less harmful in their character than would otherwise be the case. In proof of this statement we have only' to compare the trusts of Great Britain with those which exist ;in America"". It is idle to. single out individual cases. The fact remains that it is impossible to institute a parallel between the trusts of Great Britain as a whole and the trusts of America, either from the stand-point of their harmful character or of the magnitude of their",34

263,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Does that settle the matter? 'Let us take the figures relating to the capitalization of these trusts, and compare them. .We shall then be'.able to draw our own inferences, apart altogether from what newspapers may say. I am not here to defend the trusts of Great Britain any more thanI am those of America, where they are exceeding their proper function, which is to supply the people with goods at a fair price, whilst paying those engaged in their manufacture fair wages. So long as trusts work no harm to the community, what cause of complaint have we against them? Economic production ought to be encouraged - all over the world. So long as trusts do not attempt to unfairly manipulate prices or to drag down the wages of their employees, nothing can be urged against them.",34

So long as healthy competition is preserved in respect of those products in which a trust deals, its operations can. never become harmful. What have trusts endeavoured to do in regard to copper from time immemorial? They cannot succeed in securing a monopoly in that metal, try as they may. Neither can they secure a monopoly in respect of products for which there is a world-wide demand and in which, there is world-wide competition.",34

This brings me to an interrogation Svhich I should like to put to the Minister in charge of the Bill - What is the case for the Bill? We have not had it stated. We have been told that the Solicitor-General says that the Bill is necessary. Why? The Act has been on the statute book for nearly two years. The Government declared that there were in existence in Australia and elsewhere trusts, malign in character and operation, to destroy which legislation was needed. But, after two years, nothing has been done, and we are told that further power .is wanted. The Government, so far as we know, has not taken a trust before the Court. a mere _ Mr GROOM - I explained that five or six cases had been investigated,-' but that the parties concerned refused to allow us to see their agreements, without which it would be impossible to prosecute.",35
279,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Will not these agreements still be refused? In his second reading speech the honourable gentleman stated that precedents are to be found in the later American-Acts for some of the powers asked for in the Bill . Is it pro-' posed to follow American legislation? Is legislation similar to this operating in the United States?,35
280,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Yes . The present Attorney-General of the United States has prosecuted successfully some of their biggest combines.,35
281,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The honourable gentleman also said that the United States Government is rigorously and successfully enforcing these laws.,35
282,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,It has recovered some very heavy penalties within the last twelve months.,35
283,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Is that statement conclusive? We want, not to recover penalties, but to remove trusts of a harmful character ",35
284,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,In the United States of America the Government is exercising other remedies. It is obtaining injunctions to restrain.,35
285,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I gather that the trust legislation of America is succeed- ing.,35
286,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,It has been made more effective than it was.,35
287,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,What trusts has it broken up?,35
288,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"That is a pertinent question. We should take care not to repeat the constant failures of America. I admit that our conditions are not similar to those of the United States. It is useless for honourable members to try to make it appear that our trusts are as harmful as those of America. They are not, and never will be, unless we put in their hands that great weapon for the destruction of healthy competition, a prohibitive Tariff.",35
289,Mr JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"And land monopolv. Mr JOSE PH COOK - I was Very much amused by the statement of the honourable member for Boothby, that America is the home of the boodler and the trust fiend, but the one country in the world which has unrestricted trade.",36
290,Mr BATCHELOR,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Unrestricte d competition.,36
291,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Is it not absurd, in view of the American Tariff, to say that there exists there unrestricted and uncontrolled competition. It is the country where there is least competition.",36
292,Mr BATCHELOR,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"There is unrestricted competition amongst its citizens. Mr JOSE PH COOK - In dealing with world-wide problems, one must proceed on world-wide data. To cite the case of America is therefore to bring forward an irrelevant illustration, which, does not help the elucidation of this matter. The countries to which we should pay regard are those where there is healthy and legitimate competition, and where, consequently, trusts are not nearly so harmful as they are in America. If there were a little more competition in America, the trusts there would be infinitely less harmful. - Mr BATCHELOR - The honourable member is dodging the issue by dragging in free-trade.",36
293,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"No j and I do not wish to do so. There is a difference between dragging in free-trade and so regulating the Tariff as to preserve the ele-r ment of competition between one country and another. The honourable member himself does not wish to surround Australia with a Tariff wall as high as that of America. During the Tariff debates, he told us that he did not desire prohibition for Australia.",36
294,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,But he voted for it prettv often.,36
295,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Yes ; though sometimes he voted with us for lower duties, showing that he possesses a glimmer of reason in connection with these industrial and fiscal matters. I do not quite understand one of the definitions which the Attorney-General has seen fit to put into the Bill . The Bill says that to "" answer questions"" means that the person on whom the obligation of answering is cast shall.' to the best of his knowledge, answer all questions on the subject mentioned that the Comptroller-General or the person namedl by him shall ask. I suppose it is sought to compel the person, on whom the obligation of answering is cast to answer allquestions.",36
296,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Upon the subject mentioned.,36
297,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"On any subject mentioned by the Comptroller-General. Surely he should be compelled to answer only questions relating to the inquiry?""",36
298,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The words must be read in connection with proposed new section 15B.,36
299,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The definition, says that the person interrogated must . answer all questions.",36
300,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,It follows the precedent of the Customs Act.,36
301,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Are the cases the same?,36
302,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The principle underlying the procedure is the same. Mr JOSE PH COOK - In an examination under the Customs Act, what is desired is to find out whether persons are committing fraud, and whether duty is obtainable upon certain goods, a very small matter compared with the hauling of men to Court, to be imprisoned or heavily fined, perhaps, for the commission of some act detrimental to the community. So far as I know, there is no' harm in making a man answer all questions relating to goods unlawfully in his possession by reason of the fact that duty has not been paid on them The indictable offence created by the principal Act is a different matter. Therefore, the greatest care should be exercised in making provisions taken from the Customs Act apply to the control of trusts. I should also like to know what person is likely to be appointed to act for the Comp-' troller-General ? Is an ordinary Customs official to be sent to a firm engaged in a large way of business to say, "" Show me your books, and let me take extracts from them, with a view to using them against you later o n "" ? - Such-a power should be jealously guarded and surrounded with every possible safeguard. The person charged is to tell the Customs official everything about his business and its ramifications, and to answer every question which the Comptroller-General or the person named by him may ask, and the averment in the information against him is to be deemed to be proved in the absence of proof to the contrary. Throughout the principal Act, "" intent "" is dealt with, the Act being made to apply to those who inas tentionally deceive the Minister, and intenpointed tionally try to work their malign influence upon the community. But intent is speciunusual, ally exempted under the Bill. It is protrials. vided that the Bill shall not apply to is the substance and essence of the cipal Act. To what then does it apply? What is meant by the statement in the proposed new section 15A that the ments of the prosecutor contained in information in any prosecution for an fence against sections 4, 5, 7, 8, or 9 the Act shall be deemed to be proved in the absence of proof to the contrary?",36
303,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Inten t must be proved in every case.,37
304,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Then it seems to me that the substance of the principal Act is exempted. What is left?,37
305,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The fact that an agreecial ment has been entered into.,37
306,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Does the Attorney-General say that while the averment in the information is not at this stage be deemed evidence against a trust in matter of intent, it will at a later stage be so deemed?",37
307,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,No . Evidence of intent must be given in every case. The Crown must prove intent.,37
308,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I do not know how it will do so. The Court must detersurrounded mine whether there was intent. But intent being the sum and substance of the prinought cipal Act, and being excluded under the Bill, what is meant by the statement that the averments of the prosecutor shall deemed to be proved in the absence of proof to the contrary ? The utmost that should agree to is that, if a person who charged does not furnish-proof to the conbe trary, the statement of the prosecutor shall rogation. be deemed to be evidence in the case. Why does the Government fear to let the Court decide upon the evidence?",37
309,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The Court wpuld have to decide upon the facts.,37
310,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Then does this provision mean anything at all. In a prosecution for an indictable offence guilt of the defendant must be established ' by evidence, I presume on the part of prosecutor. If so, what is there left which this precious clause can apply ? There is the further provision, relating the production of the books of trusts, the taking of copies, and the investigation their affairs generally in a compulsory way.. And for what purpose? For the purpose, the leader of the Opposition so clearly out, of building up a case against them. In British communities that is an procedure in connection with such I do not say at present it is un- ' what necessary. I do not take that attitude; prinbut we have a right to ask the Minister why this new departure is proposed? He ought to give us the facts on which is based averthe demand of the Government for this the extraordinary power. Before any such ofpower is exercised by a mere officer there of ought to be the direction of a Judge that it shall be exercised. If it is necessary to make the proposed preliminary investigation let it be done on the order of a Judge. Let us surround the whole processes of interrogation and inquiry by a judicial atmosphere rather than let loose a Customs officer to conduct what, after all, is a judiinquiry to secure evidence upon which to build up a case.",37
311,Mr SALMON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,And the judicial atmosphere on the part of the Department is to what importers object to in connection with the the administration of the Customs Act.,37
312,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"When the Department begins to inquire into the business of trading concerns, with the expressed in-. tention of building up a case against them, it should have the authority of a Judge for its action, and the interrogation should be with such limitations and directions as the Judge thinks fit. That step at least to be taken in proceedings that are of vital concern to the people interested, and are so closely connected with be the industrial life of the community.",37
313,Mr WH IRVINE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The security of we which the honourable member speaks is reis quired even in civil actions. A Judge must satisfied that there is a case for inter,37
314,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,It seems to be the very essence of fairness that there should be such a security. If this procedure is to be adopted let us divest it of every suggestion of political significance and surround it with a judicial atmosphere.,37
315,Mr SALMON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The honourable member the should have supported the action taken this afternoon by the honourable member for the Hindmarsh, who urged that all Customs as to cases should be tried in the proper way.",37
316,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I did not hear to the honourable member for Hindmarsh. My point is that if it is necessary to take these of extra powers-and I use the word "" extra "" in relation to these matters as distinct from the ordinary processes of investigation in connection with criminal offences-the officer who exercises them should have the authorization of an order of the Court. I shall be glad to hear the Attorney-General ' these matters. He should tell us plainly what are the defects of the principal Act and why it has been found impossible proceed under it against huge trusts, the Government allege are harmful, the operations of five or six of which they say have already been investigated, to which they wish to take action, but unable to do so by reason of the inadeto quacy of the principal .measure.

At the same time, I recognise that there is great difficulty in obtaindoes ing sufficient evidence to enable proceedings to be. taken against a trust.

322,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"What is called an "" unwith derstanding "" is sometimes arrived at.",38
323,Mr SALMON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Quite so. I know of one or two that are at present in operation, are loyally observed by the parties to In them, although no agreement has actually been committed to paper. In these circumstances, it is impossible to secure a conviction, and if we are to deal with trusts further power is necessary. I frankly admit that'at present trusts in Australia have not assumed such proportions as to cause the community to feel that they are bur; but history teaches us that it will be only a matter of time before they o one extend their powers and show us what the they are capable of doing. We are now endeavouring to control, not to obliterate, them. Our sole desire is to secure that ihe community will not be injured by their We can do that only by dealhe ing with them in their infancv. If we from taking action until they had assumed the proportions of some of the trusts in the United States of America, we should find ourselves almost as powerless are the authorities there. For these reasons I feel sure that honourable members on all sides of the House, no matter what their views may be as to what should be the ultimate aim of legislation of this character, will unite in placing on the statute-book an effective measure. must. admit that the principal Act is not effective. The Minister has told us that it is not. As one who has had a little experience in Victoria, . 1 ' can assure honourable members that a Minister of the Crown could occupy no more humiliating position than that in which he finds himself called upon to administer a law which really confers no power uponhim. What could be more humiliating"""" to a Minister than that he should be compelled to compound felonies, as was done in Victoria-and is still done, in my opinion, by the Department of Trade and Customs of the Commonwealth-simpl y because of the ineffectiveness of the law at his command? There is no more humiliating position for a Minister or for a people who find themselves unable to check an abuse, or to control the growth of trusts and combines, and direct into proper channels the development of industry. I hope that the House will speedily agree to the motion for the second reading of the Bill , and that, when we go into Committee, the Attorney-General will either give, us a sufficient reason for his request that enormous powers should be placed in the hands of an individual, or that he willamend the Bill in the direction indicated by the deputy-leader of the Opposition.",38
324,Mr KNOX,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Kooyong) [5-53]-- . ' is expedient to pass a measure of this kind, it is certainly desirable that it should made effective in its application. The torney-General has told us that under principal Act it has been found impossible to obtain the information necessary to enable action to be taken against trusts. Whilst concurring in the. necessity of ing the Government the requisite powers, feel that the Attorney-General has not taken the House into his confidence, with sufficient frankness informed it of special difficulties that have been met and which have rendered it necessary introduce this amending Bill. I hope that at a later stage he will explain why larger powers are sought, and that the House will agree with the general prirciple that the original measure shall be made that way now. effective.

As has been so well and ably presented by previous speakers, this Bill ' We proposes to ask persons, who may be absolutely guiltless, to proffer information, which may incriminate them; and even if those who are suspected be guilty, I hold that such a procedure is contrary to British law. In Committee, however, it mav bepossible, by amendment, to give the Minister the powers which he deems to be necessary to enable him to obtain the necessaryinformation j and to that end I shall assist, provided the proposals are on fair and legitimate lines. I entirely concur with the view, that we are placing too great a power in the hands of the Comptroller-General. At the present time the Commonwealth is fortunate in the Comptroller-General, whose honour and integrity are above suspicion ; but it is possible that, in the future, we may not always be successful in securing the services of so discreet and discriminating an officer. I agree in the view that evidence should, from the commencement of the proceedings, be secured under the authority of a Judge, whose position guarantees his absolute impartiality. The two points I have mentioned constitute, in my opinion, the chief objections to the measure A Comptroller-General, however capable he may be in the discharge of his important duties, must necessarily have a bias in favour of the Department in any action which he has to initiate on what he believes to be justifiable information. I am not I£ lt prepared to vote against the second readbe ing, but I hope that in Committee, while Atsecuring the fullest powers to obtain inforthe mation, the Government will see the desirability of modifying their views, so as fo* make the measure more equitable and just y. and to that end I hope amendments will begivsubmitted, which will commend themselves,, I not only to this House, but to the public generally. There is not a single honourable and member, I am sure, who approves of comthe binations and trusts which operate against with, the public interest, or to the detriment of to - trade and commerce, or who believes that they should be allowed to carry on illegitithese mate operations without intervention.",39

At present, however, I hold that those extraordinary powers are not necessary, and that all the information should be obtained judicially in the prooer way. I regard this as not a party question, but a national question; and honourable members on all sides of the House should join in an effort to produce an equitable measure so as to prevent in Australia conditions which have arisen in the United States, and which have recently been conducted? brought so prominently under the world's notice.

To the extent that the original measure and this not amending Bill can prevent such a state of affairs arising, I am heartily with such When the original measure was before us, I not only tried to modify what adI considered to be some of its unfair provisions, but I pointed out that it would be ineffective for its purpose. The then Atbe torney-General did not agree with me on the latter point, considering as he did that the measure would prove sufficiently operative, but, now, the present Government, asking for an extension of powers, prove that my criticism was justified.",40
335,Mr WH IRVINE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The Act has been practically a dead letter.,41
336,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Tha so; and I desire to point out how little can be accomplished even under the amending Bill. This is not wholly due to the tion, though in part it is. The ineffectivethe ness of the measure is in some degree.due to the Constitution, which makes.it possible for trusts to evade both the original Act and the Bill. The Commonwealth canwhat not proceed against a trust operating in State only, unless it is a corporation, even in the latter case, I am doubtful ther the Commonwealth could succeed.",41
337,Mr WATSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,There is fair argument in favour of the presumption that the Commonwealth could succeed.,41
338,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I am ing very doubtful, having in view under the Constitution to deal with corporations.",41
339,Mr WH IRVINE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,There is at least a very great doubt.,41

A trust has only to split itself into firms or individuals tion operating in the States separately, and in thewhich apparently quite distinct from one andeemed other, in order to avoid the provisions of proved :both the original measure and this Bill. I admit that that is not. the fault of the Government, but is due to the circumstances of the Constitution; and unless the States choose to co-operate with the Commonwealth I venture to say we shall secure very little effective result. It must not be thought that those powerful organizations, who have proved themselves elsewhere to be able to evade what appeared to be the most drastic legislation, from which even lawyers sidered there was no escape, will allow themselves to be overcome when there is a simple means of effectingtheir purpose. Therefore, however drastic we may make this Bill, so long as our powers under Constitution are limited, I doubt i shall achieve much in the way of the effective suppression of trusts. of the provisions of this Bill-if they do trusts. not go further than they ought-the means of reaching the end in view has adopted. If the Attorney-General stated more fully the reasons why the Government require to be vested with powers, possibly we might have formed somewhat different opinion. by not think that he has put into operation . even the powers that he can exercise under the principal .Act.

344,Mr WATSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,-On e big trust was advised by counsel that the provision relatto the payment of rebates in the printhe powers cipal Act is of no effect.,41
345,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"If that be so, I am afraid that a good deal of the rest of the Act can have no effect, for in no place is its language more precise. be Paragraph d of section 6 reads. . . Unfair competition means competiis unfair in the circumstances, and following cases the competition shall be to be unfair unless the contrary is (d) If the defendant, with respect to any goods or services which are the subject of the competition, gives, offers, or promises to any person any rebate, refund, discount, or. reward, upon condition that that person deals, or in consideration of that person having dealt, with the defendant, to the exclusion of other persons dealing in similar goods or services. That section seems to be much clearer than conare some other portions of the Act. Yet the Attorney-General says that he had not such the power necessary to obtain a conviction. If he. could not succeed under that provi' sion, how can he' expect to succeed under' the the much more vague provisions of the Staf we tute?

350,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I know that that is one of the great difficulties experienced in this connection.,42
351,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Does the honourable member contend that the Bill does not go far enough in some directions, and that it goes too far in others?",42
352,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I contend that it has been complicated by the introduction of the fiscal element. The principal Act should have dealt with the operation of trusts in the Commonwealth, whether they were operated by external or internal organizations. The fiscal element to which I have alluded, which seeks to restrain what might be legitimate competition should have been eliminated. Its introduction has .rendered the measure more difficult to operate. Clause 4 of this Bill declares that in any prosecution for an offence against the Act', the declaration of the prosecutor shall 'be deemed to be .proved in the absence of proof to the contrary. To my mind, 'the less we use such a provision, the better. If sufficient evidence is not forthcoming to show that a trust is operating injuriously to the interests' of the public, I do not know that it is wise for the Government to interfere, and I do not believe that they will be able to successfully interfere, under the provisions of the principal Act, with the amendments now proposed. A somewhat similar provision was inserted in the principal Act. This Bill extends that power, and unless its exercise can be safeguarded by some means which will entirely remove it' from political influence, I shall be very loth to support it. If such a power is to be exercised, it should be strictly guarded. We should not allow political influence a chance to operate. The powers of the Comptroller-General, - both under the principal Act and under this Bill, are extreme. Under this Bill,, he will be permitted to establish a star chamber, to hale persons before him to ask them any questions that he. chooses. These they are compelled to answer under a penalty of £5°- Mr WATSON - The remedy is proportioned to the disease.",42
353,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"If such a power be necessary, the Comptroller General ought not to exercise it. The answers given to questions put by him are subsequently to be used against the party charged with an offence. I should like to know whether the Minister has provided any means for the taking down of that evidence with a view to proving that the testimony subsequently given by the Comptroller-General is strictly accurate.",42
354,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The procedure followed is exactly the same as that adopted under the Customs Act.,42
355,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"But the provision in this Bill goes much further than does that in the Customs Act. It covers the whole area of commerce in other relations than that of the payment of Customs duties. Under the Customs Act, the one thing which the Comptroller-General is required to do, is to ascertain that he receives' the proper amount of duty. ' But under this Bill, he may be moved to action by a rival of the party charged with an offence, or by one of the Iatter's discharged employees. Thereupon the alleged offender would be haled before him, subjected 'to a searching cross-examination, and when he had extracted from him all the information that he desired, he would use that information against him in evidence.",42
356,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The proposed sub-section 15A, relates to the use of evidence against a trust.",42
357,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"But the intention is that a person may be brought before the Comptroller-General. It would be the. same thing in the case of the representative of a trust, except that the proceedings might then, be brought either against him or against the trust. The provision is open to most improper use. I agree that we might obtain the services of an autocrat who could exercise the multifarious powers of the Comptroller-General - whic h are getting more arbitrary every day-betterr than a Parliament or a Court; but the objection to autocracy is that, while, at one time,. you may have a suitable man at the head of affairs, at another time may have there an entirely different and unsuitable man. There is too much tenThe dency in our legislation to recognise that have at the head of the Customs DepartB ment a very honest and able man-whic h - because I admit-and .to act as if he, or some one exactly like him, would always fill that office. As a matter of fact, we know that there will be a succession of Ministers of Comptrollers-General, some of whom ship will be scrupulous and some less so; some biased by political opinions, and others biased-. We. must provide for this, not frame our legislation on certain lines simply because we now have at the head of the Customs Department an excellent offibines cial in whom we have the utmost personal confidence. The authority whom we should set up should be one more important and more judicial than most Customs officials educate us. are likely to be. That authority, should have the power to say whether certain persons should be questioned, and, if-quesof tioned, what questions should be put them. There were one or two .other matyou so."" ters to which I intended to allude; but I shall defer my remarks in regard to them until the Committee stage is reached. I striction. take objection now, as I have done before, to the readiness with which it is proposed to delegate to others powers which should lie exercised only on the responsibility the Minister, and especially the tenAmerica dency to make an autocrat of the Comptroller-General. Administrative work is competition. being unnecessarily' piled on the Customs Department by the passing of Act after Act, so that its head, e'ven if he possessed the ability to deal judicially with the cases coming before him, must have time to devote to the consideration of fine points of distinction, and to questions of right and wrong, that, in my opinion, vent it . powers such as are given in this Bil l to the Comptroller-General should be given to sfxme other authority', and other powers should be exercised only by the Minister responsible to Parliament.

365,Mr HALL,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"On that point we differ. Honourable members shut their eyes to the state of affairs now existing in England and in America.

Coastal - Shipping Combine, and yet they us that competition will maintain it ",43

367,Mr HALL,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I do not condemn combinations per se, though it is strange, since the honourable member told us two minutes ago that competition would continue in spite of all efforts to prevent it , that he now says that the miners are forcing the mine-owners to combine. We have been told by the Opposition that the measure introduces methods unknown to . British law. The honourable member for North' Sydney said- I think correctly-that it will establish a tribunal like the Star Chamber, making the Comptroller-General of Customs an autocrat. The leader of the. Opposition and the honourable member for Parramatta contend that the measure introduces a new principle, by shifting the burden of proof from the accuser to .the accused, making a man appear guilty until he has proved that he is innocent. Its provisions are undoubtedly stringent, and such as the extraordinary nature of the conditions which continually arise through the operations of trusts can alone justify. Believing that the evils associated with trusts cannot be overestimated, I am prepared to go as f ar as the Ministry asks us to go in providing for their control.",44
368,Mr JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"If fines were effective, would the honourable member proceed to the torture to extract information? That is the logical conclusion.",44
369,Mr HALL,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I think not. A Ministry, finding that trusts are, like disobedient children, continually causing trouble, is justified in bringing forward measures which it thinks will control them.",44
370,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,There is no universally accepted rule for the management of recalcitrant children.,44
371,Mr HALL,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I am aware of that. Let those who own such children support them. Private enterprise and competition are the children of other parties in this House; the child of the Labour Party is national ownership. I am prepared to go as f a any other man in helping the. Government to experiment in connection with' the trolling of trusts; but I believe that there is only one solution of the problem, and wish to guard myself from the charge on some future occasion, when this legislacombination tion has proved useless, that I have been willing that Parliament should spend time in passing measures of this kind.",44
372,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I suppose the honcotton orable member will admit that he who does not believe in a remedy is hardly tl.e person to apply it?,44
373,Mr HALL,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The Ministry believes' irk. this remedy, and asks us for permission to* apply it . If the Labour Party were in power, it would propose for the control of combines, not measures like this, but the measures which its members have openly 'advocated at all times-method s that areembodied in the objective of our movement - the nationalization of monopolies as they arise.",44
374,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The Labour Party were in office for four months, and did not take a successful step in that direction.",44
375,Mr HALL,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I am aware that the honourable member at one time expected a good' deal from our movement, but I did not know that he believed our party, duringfour months in office with a very slender majority, could change the whole face of industry. I have some difficulty in following the contentions of honourable members who have spoken against the proposal of the Labour Party to nationalize monopolies. The honourable member for Parramatta, as I understood his argument-and I do not wish to misrepresent him-contende d that we could not have a trust stifling competition in the necessaries of life . not Mr. JOSEPH COOK - I did not say that.",44
376,Mr JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"For instance, how could the production of wheat be controlled by a trust ?",44
377,Mr HALL,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The fact that it is not so controlled is no evidence that it will not be - In that respect the honourable member for Parramatta and the Labour Party are at one; we have no desire to nationalize the wheat production of Australia. Our proposal is to nationalize only monopolies, that arise. If the honourable member did not contend-and I accept his assurancethat he did not-that we could not get a trust to stifle competition in necessaries",44
378,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I said there could be no harmful combination where there r as was healthy world-wide competition.,44
379,Mr HALL,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Then I venture to join conissue with the honourable member, and to say that where there is a possibility of I world-wide competition harmful combinations have arisen. Take, for example, the in respect of sewing cotton. The Coates' Trust is a world-wide one,' conits trolling the wholeof the sewing cotton trade of the world, with the result that is dearer today than it was fifteen years ago, when competition prevailed. best Then we have the Beef Trust of America, already established in England.",44
380,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Cotto n grown all over the world.,45
381,Mr HALL,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,It is grown in different continents.,45
382,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,In very few countries.,45
383,Mr HALL,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"That may be, but the number ought to be sufficient, if the honourable member's contention is correct, to prevent a harmful trust arising in connection with cotton production. If the honourable member says that only those things which grow in' every continent are free from the operations of trusts, he cuts down the possibility of our maintaining competition in connection with the great bulk of articles that are in common use. I dare say that the great majority of the articles in every-day use are not produced in all parts of the world. If that be so, the honourable member does not go very far; it is no satisfaction to us to know that only those articles which are produced all over the world can be controlled by trusts.",45
384,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Is it not better that we should inquire into the surroundings of trusts that are admittedly harmful?,45
385,Mr HALL,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I do not see much purpose in merely inquiring into their surroundings. The question which this House and the country have to decide is what is to be done after the inquiries have been made. We have ample evidence of the evil that trusts can do, and we now await from honourable members who are opposed to the nationalization of monopolies a solution of the difficulty before us. T venture to say that it will not be found in this Bill. The honourable member for Tarramatta seems to think that many trusts are harmless-that the number of harmful trusts are few. When I asked him to name a few of the harmless trusts, he assured us that only about twenty-three out of some hundreds of trusts in America were returning dividends. Is that an answer to the question? Does the honourable member contend that trusts which do not returndividends are necessarily harmless in their operations?",45
386,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"When they are not - paying dividends, they cannot be very successful. They cannot continue very long on their losses.",45
387,Mr HALL,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"No ; but they will change their losses into profits. - Mr. JOSEPH COOK ,£500,000,000 are invested intrusts which are not returning one copper. is not Mr HALL - Most men when floating their business enterprises into trusts endeavour to get as much as possible for them; and if people are foolish enough to purchase scrip at - a very high price, it is quite possible that they will not get any return on that outlay. But let the trusts retain their monopoly long enough, and we shall not have £500,000,000 invested' in them at a loss.",45
388,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Le t them keep on making losses, and they will grow rich.",45
389,Mr HALL,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I do not suggest that, but I know many firms-and the honoiable member knows of many-that have found that it paid them to make losses for a year or two-until they had crushed out competition-and that they were soon able then to make good their losses. One of the features of the successful establishment of trusts is that they have to submit to losses for a few years, with the full knowledge that in time they will reap if they faint not. We have received from the Opposition the assurance that trusts cannot exist here as they prevail in America-that there is no danger of their having in Australia the harmful effects that they have had in America. I do not know on what ground that contention is based. When I consider the age of this country, the extent to whichrings and combines already operate' here, and the evil effects manifested in connection with their operations, I cannot understand why they should stop short of what trusts in other countries are doing.",45
390,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Trad e unions will be brought under this law. . Mr HALL - I am prepared to apply the same principles to trade unions.,45
391,Mr WATSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Hear , hear; let them submit their books for examination.",45
392,Mr HALL,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The unions do not object to that being done. In most of the industrial disputes that arise, it-is the other side that objects to give full information.",45
393,Mr BATCHELOR,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Trad e unions are quite prepared to be taken over by the State.,45
394,Mr HALL,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I am sure that they are. Having regard to the cry that we bear almost incessantly as to the evils already existing in connection with trusts, I do not know what ground there is for the hope that no bad effects will arise from them. The honourable member for Moreton towards the end of last year entertained the House at Nearly considerable length with a' recital of the evils of the Shipping Combine. How can it be said that there is no danger of great evils arising from trusts in Australia when the very men who come here to uphold private enterprise and to oppose the extension of the functions of the State give evidence as to the evil tendencies of the Shipping Combine in Australia? In such, circumstances, how can we hope that there will be no ill effects from the establishment of trusts ?",45
395,Mr JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,No . one denies the existence of the evil. The difference of opinion is as to the method of dealing with it .,46
396,Mr HALL,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I do not think that, the honourable member speaks for the Opposition generally.",46
397,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,He does.,46
398,Mr HALL,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The honourable member for Parramatta spoke of beneficent trusts, although, like myself, he is not a judge of tobacco, he assured us that the tobacco tainable here now was better than could be secured when there was no Tobacco Trust.",46
399,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,He said that he had so informed.,46
400,Mr HALL,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,And obviously believed that it was so.,46
401,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The tobacco here finitely better than the tobacco of Italy of France, where there is a regie.",46
402,Mr HALL,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I .know that when some honourable members take a tour through France on a motor car, and see the Frenchhuman men contentedly smoking that which suits - them, or they would not use it , they come away satisfied that the tobacco obtainable there is the worse that could be smoked.",46
403,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Does not the honourable member think that he would be in a better done. position to judge if he had been there and had smoked the tobacco?,46
404,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Order . The debate is passing altogether beyond the scope of the Bill . The question is that the Bill now read a second time, and I ask the orable member not to be drawnaside by interjections, but to pursue the discussion of the Bill itself. Mr HALL ! - I wish to put before the House as clearly as I can the view that method of dealing with trusts embodied in this Bill is not calculated to be f u l : I do not understand how honourable members can console themselves with .the idea that we shall have in Australia only trust ! harmless trusts. The honourable member North Sydney said that he would reply the question that I put to the honourable member for Parramatta. as to the names of some of the harmless trusts of which he spoke, and proceeded to say Combine properly managed might be a harmless one. I do not hope to see in this country any harmless trusts. I do not believe that men combine for a public good, but rather for their own good. We have been told that, so long as competition continues, no great harm can be done by trusts : but I think that the object of trusts is rather to wipe out competition. We may safely say that if men be given power, they will use that power whenever it suits theu.i to do so. If we allow trusts to arise in which a few men can combine, they will rob the public if the opportunity presents itself. It might be possible to have harmless trusts if all merchants and manufacturers were philanthropists, and went into and the business for the good of the country.",46
405,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"It might be obpossible, if they were all wise.",46
406,Mr HALL,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"That , of course, depends on what standard of wisdom is set up. I been have always understood that those commercial men who are regarded as the wisest, are those who make as much money out of their business as they can; and that is the is inobject of trusts. I do not complain on or that score, because, as we have been told today, it is only human nature. We are warned that before we can materially alter present conditions, we must alter poor nature. I do not know that human nature is either all good or all bad, as some honourable members seek to make out ; but I do know that in the name of human nature many good and many bad, and many brave and many cowardly, things are What I say is that, if people are put into a position of power without responsibility, in the way that directors of trusts are, they will use the position for. the benefit of their own pockets; and so long as that continues, so long - will legislabe tion of this class be ineffective. We sughongest that when this legislation has been found to fail , and is discarded-whe n honourable members, who are prepared to introduce the Star Chamber, and upset the principles of law which have prevailed for the centuries, recognise the failure-w e shall turn to the only true remedy, and nationsuccessalize monopolies as they arise.",46

409,Mr HALL,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Operate d by the same human nature, but for the benefit of the community. Honourable members can easily see the difference by contrasting the Sydney tramway organization with the Melbourne tramway organization. Mr KELLY.""-The Melbourne tramways are a delegation of Government monopoly",47
410,Mr HALL,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I am afraid that is a distinction without a difference, so far as my argument is concerned.",47
411,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Is the honourable member prepared to say that the conditions of the tramway employees in Sydney is ultimate ideal of Socialism?,47
412,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Will the honourable member for Werriwa kindly take his seat? The interjection by. the honourable member for Parramatta is just one of those to which I referred a few minutes ago. The honof orable member for Werriwa would be able to proceed with his speech without the slightest difficulty but for interjections this kind, which draw him off the track his argument.",47
413,Mr H ALL,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"There is no doubt that the older countries. same human nature controls both systems, but the difference is obvious. The users the trams, and the employees on the trams, all reap the benefit under public ownership and Government control, whereas if the tiams be in private hands, the users are robbed every time they make a journey, those in Melbourne paying more than their trip is worth when comparison is made with the fares charged in Sydney. The reason is, of course, that those who control the private enterprise are responsible none but the shareholders, and the more they can rob the public, and the less wages they can pay the better, - because to benefit their own pockets. of public enterprise, however, the very opposite effects are seen, because the adopposite. vantages are shared by the public, and the employees are better treated. vote for the proposal of the Ministry, willing to let them have another try to control private enterprise, and continue competition. But, as every who has marked the trend of industry during the last two or three - decades, we legislation. shall find after all our efforts that it is impossible to maintain competition in age lik° ours.",47
414,Mr WH IRVINE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Flinders). [8.17]. - After the full discussion of this B i I do not propose to occupy the attention the complaint that it is too drastic. of honourable members for more than should a few minutes. I shall not allow myself to be drawn into .a discussion of general subjects as the honourable member for Werriwa did, but I propose rather to deal with the merits of the Bill . I should like, however, to say that for some of the reasons to which the honourable - member himself alluded, I am one of those who are in favour of an effective system of anti-trust legislation being enforced. I believe that those who are opposed to the introduction or the realization of socialistic ideals will find - themselves compelled ultimately to grapple with the the undoubted evil and danger which, under our modern conditions, results in the aggregation of very large amounts of capital, massed together for certain purposes. Therefore it is essential that those who look into the future and the future developments social and political life, not merely in countries like America, but in young countries like Australia, should pay attention of to the dangers when they are in a nascent of condition, and not wait until they have developed in the way they have in I am quite in sympathy with those who desire to have of effective legislation - not too drastic, but as effective as necessary - for the purpose of preventing the growth of associated capital in such form as is likely to be ultimately dangerous to the social and political freedom of the community. But, of course, in this, as in everything else, we must prescribe the medicine with some degree of proportion to the disease. And the only question, I take it, with which the to House is now concerned, is whether this particular measure is or is not unnecessarily drastic, having regard to the presentit tends conditions of Australia. In the case Mr WATSON - Legislatio n is always tondrastic according to honourable members",47
415,Mr WH IRVINE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The honourable I shall member makes general observations of that kind, but one might say, with at least equal reason, that legislation is usually too drastic if it emanates from the party to which one knows the honourable member belongs.",47
416,Mr WATSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,We did not suggest this,47
417,Mr WH IRVINE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"In most of the an cases when legislation, emanates from the Government which derives its life's spirit from the party which the honourable meml l , ber lately led, we have usually to reiterate I like to say that the Attorney-General - who m I should be the. last to accuse of doing anything intentionally to mislead the House-presse d on our attention an analogy which is no analogy, in referring to some recent American legislation. Let me for one moment ask the attention of honourable members while I refer shortly to the history of American legislation on this subject. Honourable members know that in 1890 or 1892, I forget which year, the United States. Congress passed what, is known as the Sherman Act, which is the - origin of the Australian Industries Preservation Act. The Sherman Act was very wide in its scope, just as is the Australian Act of 1906. The first section of the Sherman Act indicates the general lines on which it proceedsEvery contract, combination in the form trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, with foreign nations, is hereby declared to illegal. Then the section goes on to sayEvery person who shall make any such contract,- or engage in any such combination or conspiracy, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanour. That Act was not limited to any one particular trade, but was intended to meet cases of conspiracy in restraint, or-as was ultimately held-in injurious restraint of trade. It did not necessarily mean all restraint, but restraint injurious to the public j and it made such combination illegal in any kind of trade or business. That, of course, is very wide; and the Act was brought into existence at a time when all kinds of combination in America had reached the point which many thoughtful men considered was becoming dangerous to the freedom of individual citizens engaged in ordinary industries. That Act was followed in the Australian legislation, the more drastic provisions being, to some extent, curtailed. The Australian Act of 1906 was not limited in its application-just as the Sherman Act was not-but it regarded as an essential in its operations that some combination or conspiracy should be shown, the effect of which was necessarily detrimental to the interests of the public. I think the Attorney-General will agree with mei that the words "" to the detriment of the public "" are really the controlling words of the Act which we are now amending. That is one line of legislation universal in its application, so far as all industries are concerned, but it is rigidly limited, because the fact can be ascertained only after full proof has been brought be Mr W. H. Irvine. fore the Courts called on to deal with the matter-namely , that the combination is to the detriment of the public. The Attorney General referred to some recent American legislation, giving, as he said, equally drastic powers of inquisition, t|he terms 1 of which have been followed in the Bill. Let me remind honourable members that the class of American legislation to which the Attorney-General referred ran along totally different lines, and was for totally different purposes. In - 1887, before the Sherman Act, there was passed in America an Act to. regulate trade and commerce between the States, and the conduct of particular classes of persons or corporations, who were conducting the great carrying operations between the States-in of other words, the great railway corporations and monopolies throughout the whole of the or States. It was then becoming apparentbe as it has become more and more apparent since-that these great and powerful corporations had risen to such a point that their operations threatened, not only the liberty of individuals, but the liberty, and even the integrity, of some of the constitutional institutions upon which they had to depend. That was the great danger. That was the danger created bythese powerful corporations which had been invested with enormous monopolies by the States-eithe r by the individual States or by the United States through their legislative channels. These monopolies were often used for the purpose of carrying on an^ internecine war between great capitalistic organizations in which the interests of - the individual citizen were absolutely ignored, leading, as we all know, to disaster in the liquidation of stocks and shares in which the leaders of these organizations sometimes engaged. That was the great evil which had to be coped with-a n evil which had reached dimensions far beyond those attained by ordinary trade and business corporations, and to cope with which Parliament thought it necessary to provide some special machinery. What took place ? In 1887 Congress passed an Act to regulate commerce. That Act, I think, deals entirely with the operations of carriers. T have not had the opportunity of reading through every portion of it / but the Attorney-General will correct me if I am wrong. It opens with the wordsBe it enacted, That the provisions of this Act shall apply to any corporation or any person or persons engaged in the transportation of oil or other commodity, except water.",47
418,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The Inter-State Act originally applied to carriers engaged in Inter-State commerce. Mr VV. H . IRVINE - That is so. Subsequently it was enlarged specially to meet - the case of the Standard Oil Trust and other bodies similarly situated. But the whole object of this legislation was to - deal with these great paramount corporations, which had been invested with vast power owing to the growth of population in the United States of America. It was confined to them. We must always recollect that. Any legislation introduced to meet such special and vast dangers as were then apprehended-danger s which have not yet been met-ca n scarcely be safely accepted as a precedent which should guide us in framing a general law relating to such trusts when they do not exist.",49
419,Mr WATSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,A trust exists in the carrying trade around Australia.,49
420,Mr WH IRVINE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,There is no monopoly of the ocean.,49
421,Mr WATSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,In practice there is.,49
422,Mr WH IRVINE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"In one sense there may be-in the sense that the aggregation of capital always tends to create a certain kind of monopoly. But the establishment of the class of monopolies dealt with by this legislation in America was due to the fact that a comparatively limited number of powerful corporations controlled - necessarily so from the powers granted to them by Parliament-the whole of the carrying trade. By means of their vast capital, and by direct and indirect means employed upon legislators and private individuals, they were able to obtain a control which almost amounted to a universal tyranny.",49
423,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,A condition of things which happily cannot obtain here.,49
424,Mr WATSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,It obtains around our co&st*,49
425,Mr WH IRVINE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The honourable member is referring to the Shipping Ring. Assuming that such a ring does exist-an I dare say that it does,49
426,Mr WATSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The shipping companies themselves admit it - Bill to,49
427,Mr WH IRVINE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Assumin g that to discharge similar functions. such a combination exists, it merely falls within the class of combinations which rive their power from the aggregation a number of persons possessed of capital who agree to be bound by certain rules have said before that we ought to have some legislation to control, such monodo, polies. But to adopt the forms of legislapolitical tion which were introduced in America, to administer the powerful medicine that was at the last stage administered by the United States to cope with the terrible disease which had developed, and which still remains uncured, can hardly be accepted as a safe guide by this Parliamentin dealing with the comparatively immature disease with which we have to cope.",49
428,Mr FRAZER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Is it not a fact that that "" p o w e r f u l medicine"" failed to cure in those cases because it was not strong enough ? Mr WH IRVINE . ^ - I have said that the power of the railway corporations in America was so immense that even this legislation was not strong enough to effect its purpose, and that it had to be reinforced by the legislation to which I have referred. In 1906, it was so reinforced. We ought not to accept such legislation as a guide to us in the legislation which we are now asked to enact. But let us see what was the character of the legislation passed by the United States Congress. Did it give to an official under political control the power to enter into any man's house, to inspect any man's, business, to take possession of any man's books, and to apply an inquisitorial scrutiny into a man's private affairs without any kind of judicial inquiry? Nothing of the kind. In the first place, Congress created an Inter-State Commerce Commission. Instead of a Comptroller-General of Customs-a n irresponsible official, or, rather, an officer who is responsible only to his political chief-bein g vested with this enormous power, a strong judicial tribunal was created, which, by the very terms of its constitution, was absolutely freed from all political influence. That is the first point that has to be noted.",49
429,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I referred to the creation of the Inter-State Commerce Commission.,49
430,Mr WH IRVINE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"But the Attord ney-General did not tell us how it was constituted, how vastly it differed in its character from the proposal under this invest a single officer with power That, j.udicial tribunal was composed of men whodewere appointed for a period of - six years, of who were to be absolutely removed from-' political influence, and who were placed in . I such a position that they could discharge1 their judicial functions as a Court should' without fear or favour, and without bias of any kind. That is the first distinction which I draw between the American legislation and that which we are now asked to enac .",49
431,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I referred to the fact that a Bureau of Corporations was constituted, and that the Commissioner was vested with the same powers as the Inter-State Commission.",50
432,Mr WH IRVINE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I think that the Attorney-General did. But I wish to refer to the particular part of the Act of 1906 which the honourable and learned gentleman cited as a precedent, with a view to show that the powers grantedby Congress at that time were vested in a Commission which was purely a judicial body. When I come to analyze those powers, I find that they were not anything like so wide-al though they were, granted under circumstances of extreme emergency to a judicial tribunal specially created for the purpose - as are the powers which we are asked to grant under this Bill.",50
433,Mr FRAZER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Probably the moderation of that law accounted for its failure.,50
434,Mr WH IRVINE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"It has not yet had time to be a failure, seeing that it was only passed in 1906. I have already pointed out that our circumstances are totally different from those which obtained in the United States. The law to which I have referred relates to a particular class of persons whose vast monopoly rendered it necessary to subject them to control. Now let us look at the powers themselves. They are set out. in section 20 of the Act of 1906, which says The Commission is hereby authorized to require annual reports from all common carriersthat is, all carriers engaged in Inter-State traffic, which practically means the railways onlysubject to the provisions-of this Act, and from the owners of all railroads engaged State commerce as defined in this Act, to prescribe the manner in which such reports snail be made, and to require from such carriersthis is the point upon which the Attorney General reliedspecific answers to - all questions upon which the Commission may need information. It then goes on to enumerate the matterswhich they are entitled to investigate. It saysSuch annual. reports shall show in detail the amount of capital stock issued, the amounts paid there for, and the manner of payment for the same; the dividends paid, the surplus fund, if any, and the number of stock-holders;, the funded and floating debts, and the interest paid thereon; the cost ancT value of the carrier's property, franchises, and equipments; the number of employees, and the salaries paid each class; the accidents to passengers, employis, and other persons, and the causes thereof; the amounts expended for improvement each year, how expended, and the character of such improvements; the earnings and receipts from each branch of business, and from all sources; the operating and other expenses; the balances of profit and loss; and a complete exhibit of the financial operations of the carrier each year, including an annual balance-sheet. The provision is thus limited to many matters which would appear in the balance-sheet of any public company under our Companies Act. Probably it includes a few others, but these are clearly defined. The questions into which even this judicial tribunal was authorized to inquire were clearly restricted to certain specified matters upon which it was considered necessary that it should have knowledge in order that effective control might be exercised over these great organizations.",50
435,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,But - the next paragraph has reference to contracts and agreements.,50
436,Mr WH IRVINE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Yes . It readsSuch reports shall also contain such information in relation to rates cr regulations concerning fares or freights, or agreements, arrangements, or contracts affecting the same as the Commission may require; and the Commission may, in its discretion, for the purpose of enabling it the better to carry out the purposes of this Act, prescribe a period of time within which all common carriers, subject to the provisions of this Act shall have, as near as may be, a uniform, system of accounts, and the manner in which such accounts shall be kept. It must give statistical information as to all the freights and fares which are charged, because these were specially made subject to the control of the Inter-State Commission, and as to all contracts made in connection with their business, because they were contracts for carriage'..",50
437,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,That is more than is in the inter- ordinarily required.,50
438,Mr WH IRVINE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I think that it is. In a few matters of that sort the Act does go a little further than does our own Companies Act. But can it be urged that that is any precedent for the kind of legislation, that we are-now asked to enact? Under this Bill we are invited to allow the Comptroller-General of Customs, who is directly under political control, to ask any question of any individual that he chooses. He is limited only by his own discretion as to the questions which he shall put to any person whether he be one of the principals of a firm, a manager, a clerk, or an office boy, or whether he be an entire stranger to the particular business that is being carried on. He is at liberty to ask anything, that he may think in any way relevant to a crime of which he has not yet even sufficient prima facie evidence to put before a judicial tribunal. That is the kind of legislation before us. Whatever may be urged in favour of it, the circumstances under which the American Acts were passed make them no precedent for us. Let me shortly examine a few of the provisions of the Bill. The Attorney-General told us that it is a machinery Bill. Torquemada, when putting before the Spanish Inquisition a newly-invenfed thumb-screw or improved boot, might have commended it as the introduction of more effective machinery, and in that sense only can this be termed a machinery Bill. means adopted might be jusLified in some great national emergency which made if necessary to go beyond the ordinary British methods of getting information, and to adopt more drastic steps. I do not attach as much weight as some honourable members have done to the provision regarding the onus of proof, though it introduces a principle repugnant to British' instincts of fair play, and adopted only in certain classes of legislation, such as the acts relating to insolvency and Customs administration. I do not complain of its introduction here, because of the saving clause that an averment of intent in an information shall not be deemed to prove such intent, and if we refer to the Act we find that intent is the sub : stantial thing to be proved. The effect of the provision is to avoid some formal proofs which might othenvise be necessary.",50
439,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,And it might save a technical nonsuit.,51
440,Mr WH IRVINE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Yes . The provision may be a convenient one, and I do not take much objection to it, seeing that intent has to be proved.",51
441,Mr SAMPSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Would it not have been enough to use the word ' ' evidence'' instead of the word "" p r o of "" ? Mr W. H . ..IRVINE - I do not think that that matters. It is evidence which, if uncontradicted, will amount to proof.",51
442,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"That was the interpretation of the New South Wales Court; that, in the absence of evidence from the defendant, it should be evidence against him.",51
443,Mr WH IRVINE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Coming to another part of the Bill, I may say that I have never seen a provision such as the proposed new section 15B, sub-sections r and 2. It enacts thatIf the Comptroller-General believes that is, without evidence, with or without reason, for any cause, on any hint given by any personthat an offence has been committed against this Part of this Act, he may by writing under his hand, require any person- . Any person whom he believes to be capable of giving any information. There is no limit to the person or class of persons who may be asked, or to the kind of questions that may be asked. They are not required to be relevant' to the as yet unThe proved and unfounded charge, and are to be left entirely to the discretion' of the ""official. The provision continueswhom.he believes to be capable of giving any information in relation to the alleged offence to answer questions and to produce documents to himor to some person named by him. Any person refusing or failing to answer questions or produce documents when required to do so becomes a criminal in the eye of the law, and is liable to a penalty of £$o. Sir JOHN QUICK.'-Can the Comptroller-General summon a man to the Cus- toms House to answer questions?",51
444,Mr WH IRVINE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"He can compel him to come and bring his books, although he may have received no complaint froiu any person on oath, and no evidence of any kind. The .suggestion of the acting leader of the Opposition, if adopted, would provide a rational safeguard to this provision, while leaving it effective. I understand it to be this: The Comptroller-General, or other officer, intrusted with the carrying out of the law, shall, if he has ground for believing that there is a case for investigation, bring it on affidavit before a County Court Judge, a Police Magistrate, or some other judicial person, and if the Court is convinced that there is a prima facie case ' to warrant an inquiry, it .shall authorize such interrogatories as may seem reason-' ably necessary to elucidate the truth. Thaiis a power now possessed in civil ca""ses. Surely, if the law does not think it fit that without safeguards one man shall dive into the recesses of another man's mind, or have access to his papers or business secrets, for the enforcement of a civil right, it will be at least as careful in regard to a criminal obligation ? ",51
445,Sir JOHN QUICK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Would the honourable member allow an accused person to be so interrogated ?,52
446,Mr WH IRVINE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I would allow him to be interrogated if the Comptroller General had satisfied a judicial authority that there were grounds for believing that an offence had been committed; but the interrogatories to be delivered should be such as the Judge might determine as reasonable. As a matter of practice, interrogatories are not submitted to a Judge unless the other side objects to answer them; but where they are directed to the ascertainment of facts which may render a man liable to the criminal law, the person charged should have an opportunity to argue before the Judge that the questions sought to be put to him were riot fair. If a man is allowed to be interrogated under the civil law, he has the opportunity to show that the right to interrogate is being pressed beyond fair limits, and it should be so in this case.",52
447,Mr CROUCH,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Simila r powers are given under the Customs Act.,52
448,Mr WH IRVINE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"As a number of honourable members have pointed out, that is a totally different measure. In this case, it is proposed that an official who may choose to say on any evidence which to his mind may seem sufficient, "" I believe that the accused is a party to a conspiracy, and guilty of an offence,"" may search into the man's conscience, go through hisbusiness, investigate his books and private records, to make out a case against him. a totally different power from that given under the Customs Act, and, if given at all, should be fettered with safeguards at least as great as those attaching to the ordinary interrogations of civil procedure. I hope that the House will not, .by pressing this kind.of machinery to absurd extremes, deprive the whole legislation of practical' effect.",52
449,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Darling Downs-At torney-General) [8.52] - During the debate honourable members have raised objections, and asked questions in regard to> the principles of the measure, which I wish to answer before going into Committee. The honourable member for Flinders said that legislation should always be appropriate to the evil that exists, and should provide a sufficient remedy to cope with it. It is for that reason that the Bill has been introduced. He stated that my analogy is not - complete; that, in the United States, combinations of railway, companies and carrying companies monopolized the highways of commerce, on which the trade and foodstuffs of the country had to be carried. He therefore justified the stringency of the powers conferred by the Inter-State Commerce Act. But the evils aimed at' were not solely connected with great carrying corporations; it was found necessary in America to pass laws dealing with corporations of all kinds.",52
450,Mr WH IRVINE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I pointed that out.,52
451,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"In 1890, the Sherman anti-trust law was given general application, its purpose being to prohibit every contract or combination in restraint of trade orcommerce .among the several States, or with foreign nations, whether made by carriers, manufacturers, producers, or shippers.",52
452,Mr WH IRVINE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I mentioned that. My argument was that although Congress found it necessary to apply the general Act, it never dreamt of applying such drastic machinery provisions under that Act.",52
453,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"That is the point to which I am coming. In 1894, what is known as the Wilson Act, was passed. That Act contains anti-trust provisions forbidding unlawful restraints and monopolies by and between importers, or persons, or corporations engaged in importing any articles from any foreign country into the United States, when designed to operate in restraint of lawful trade or free competiThat is tion in lawful trade or commerce, or to increase the market price in any part of the United States, of imported articles, or of any manufacture into which such imported article enters or is intended to enter. Up to that time, proceedings taken against various corporations had not been altogether successful. The problem then before Congress and the people was in what way the necessary evidence could be obtained to secure a successful prosecution in respect of not only railway corporations, but other great combines. In 1903 a Bureau of Corporations was established as a subdepartment of the Department of Commerced It was decided that there should be at its head a Commissioner to be appointed by the President, and to receive a salary of 5,000 dollars per-annum. A Deputy Commissioner and certain other officers were also to be appointed, and the Commissioner was to have power and authority fo secure information in regard to the organization, '.conduct, and management of the business of any corporation, joint-stock company, or corporate combination, excepting common carriers subject to the Commerce Act engaged in Inter-State or foreign commerce. It was also provided that, in order to accomplish the purposes mentioned, the Commissioner should have and exercise the same power and authority in respect ofcorporations, joint-stock companies, and combinations, subject to the provisions of the Act, as were conferred on the Inter-State Commerce Commission.",52
454,Mr WH IRVINE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,That was in 1903.,53
455,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Yes . The honourable member'spoint was that when the United States of America was called upon to deal with powers of this inquisitorial nature, i,t determined to constitute a Commission. I am pointing out, as I did the other .day, that an individual Commissioner was appointed, and was intrusted with the powersthat were possessed by the .interState Commission. Mr W. H . l'RViNE -^-What they did in 1903 was to give to the Bureau the powers that were then possessed 'by the Inter-State Commission. That Commission then possessed none of the powers which the honourable member takes as precedents for the proposals now before us. They were first conferred in 1906.",53
456,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I think that the statement made by the honourable member is scarcely correct. I think he will find that section 20, in the Act of 1903, which he read, was practically complete.",53
457,Mr WH IRVINE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"At all events, it related only to big corporations. """,53
458,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Combine s were rapidly forming in the United States of America, and as they were paralyzing trade and commerce within the States, it became necessary to give these wider powers.' Combinations having harmful effects upon producers and consumers sprang up, and it became necessary to deal effectively with them. In the latest report I have of the Attorney-General of the Umited States of America-whos e Department is intrusted with the administration of this law-it is stated thatThe Department of Justice is without organization for the investigation of suspected offences, though the general appropriation for the enforcement of this and laws of like character made by Congress in 1903 has to some extent supplied this deficiency. The report is for the year 1906. is then pointed out that notwithstanding this difficulty, lengthy inquiries were made, and a series of prosecutions were, conducted. Figures are given showing up to the year 1901 the result of the prosecutionsFrom the date of the enactment of the law to the beginning of President Roosevelt's Administration in 1901, 16 proceedings were begun and have been concluded- 5 of them were indictments, in all of which the Government failed, and 11 of them were petitions in eguity, in which the Government, prevailed in 8, and failed in 3. The report then goes onSince the beginning of President Roosevelt's administration, twenty-three proceedings have been begun under this law, seven of which have been concluded, and sixteen are pending. A statement then appears as to the proceedings which have been concluded. The honourable member for Parramatta requested me to give him an instance where in later years a prosecution in the United States of America had been successful. The Attorney-General here deals with seven individual cases in which proceedings were successfully taken. In one caseA combination between two competing interState railways, whereby a majority of the stock of each was taken over by a holding company in exchange for shares of its own stock at an agreed valuation, with the purpose and effect that the two railways should come under common control and management, and that competition between them should be suppressed, was held to be unlawful, and dissolved by the Supreme Court. That was the case of the Northern Securities Company v. United States. The next prosecution was in respect of a combine dealing with fresh meat. That combine was also declared unlawful, and an injunction was issued. In another case a combination for the manufacture of paper was declared unlawful and enjoined by the Circuit Court in the same way.",53
459,Mr WH IRVINE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The honourable member is proposing that a medicine which is suitable for a man in a raging fever shall be taken by a man who wishes to avoid a cold in his head.,53
460,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"No . But we all know that prevention is much better than disease. The honourable member's contention is that we should leave combines alone. He says in effect of a combine, "" It is only a little chap. Give him a hiding and that will cure him. After he grows up you can, if you like, put him in gaol."" We know that the evils exist in the United States",53
461,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,All these trusts are It still sailing on despite the prosecutions.,53
462,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Is that so? One has been dissolved.,53
463,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,But the Trust is still in existence. The question - now being discussed in New York whether the duty on paper should not be removed.,54
464,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,In the cases cited orders rebates ? we're made and any one who .disobeyed them would be guilty of contempt of Court. At pages 973-4 of the volume to which I have referred details of other prosecutions be found. ' The Attorney-General of the United States of America is now in a better position than he was to obtain information to enable him to prosecute combines.,54
465,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Can the honourable member point to a single case where legisexistence. lation in America has prevented trusts exercising a harmful control ?,54
466,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I can show that legislation there has created offences in respect which prosecutions have been successful.,54
467,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,And what has happened ?,54
468,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"In one case, as I have shown, a corporation was declared and was dissolved. In other cases corporations were declared unlawful, and those who took part in them were enjoined not to carry on their operations.",54
469,Mr SALMON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,In another case the mema bers of a combine had to disgorge.,54
470,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,And we have learned by cable that in addition to that an injunction has been obtained and heavy penalties posed in some instances.',54
471,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"My impression is that those trusts are still going on. - Mr GROOM - There may be attempts to evade the law. It is true that legislation has not rooted out trusts in. America, my reading goes to show that it is acting as a preventive. If we cannot root out an evil that is no reason why we should not attempt to deal with it as far as we confidential ? can. The honourable member. for Laanecoorie and others have asked whether wider powers for which we ask are necessary. My answer is that they are. The Crown Solicitor was instructed to investigate the operations of various trusts in Australia.",54
472,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,What trusts?,54
473,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I am prepared to menagreement tion them. There is for instance the Conthat fectionery Combine, the Oil Combine, the Brick Combine, the Coal Combine, and several combines dealing with machinery.",54
474,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,And the Shipan ping Combine? Paper Mr GROOM - Not the Shipping Comis bine. I have mentioned quite sufficient to show that action has been taken.,54
475,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,What about,54
476,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"the y were inquired into. The Crown Solicitor went full y into the matter, and there are in the possession will of the Department complete confidential reports, which I could not be expected to disclose. The position is this: Combine A is alleged to-'be in restraint of trade. We know from the documents that have been filed that there is an agreement in . We approach those whom we from know to be members of the combine, but they decline to show us a copy of the agreement. We know that from the effects of of the combine on industry it is acting in restraint of trade, and that persons are being injured.",54
477,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Suppos e the Department took proceedings against them, would not the Judge direct them'to supply illegal the information sought? . Mr GROOM - Not in a case for penalties. Under'the existing Act. it is open to persons who enter into a lawful combine to file with the Attorney-General copy of their agreement, and, by doing so. they are protected subject to the provisions of the Act. But let us take the case that I was citing when interrupted. imThere is an agreement within the knowledge of the individuals concerned, and we know by its operation what is its effect upon trade and the public generally. But as soon as we attempt to prosecute that combine in a Court, we are faced with the fact that we cannot prove the existence of an but agreement. Where the agreement is lawf u l , what harm will be involved in an officer of the Department being allowed to inspect it, seeing* that he must treat it as",54
478,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"If the averment of the Dethe partment were made evidence in proof, really would not that be sufficient ?",54
479,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"No , the averment of the Department that an agreement exists is only deemed to be proved in the absence of proof to the contrary. The defendant is entitled to go into the box and. say the is perfectly innocent - We ask the Comptroller-General shall, before instituting proceedings, have a right to go to the parties and say, "" We have a complaint on oath that you are engaged in unlawful combine. I am satisfied from the inquiries made, by the officers of the Department that a combine exists. I now ask you to produce your agreement."" If the parties concerned are engaged in a lawf u l business, what harm can be done them by requiring them to produce the agreement to the Comptroller-General, who is under an obligation of secrecy. He dare not disclose the contents of the agreement, but if the agreement is unlawful, the parties can be called upon to disclose its contents.",54
480,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Are these agreements secret?,55
481,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,They are. .,55
482,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"And , are not binding except in honour?",55
483,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"That is another .matter. In one particular instance we got a copy of a written agreement; but when the parties were confronted with it , they said that it was not the agreement under which they were working^ In another case we were successful enough to get the agreement in so far as it related to trade within the State,' but it was ascertainedthat' there was another agreement which extended beyond the States- a verbal agreement.",55
484,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"What is there stop the parties from giving a "" cooked "" agreement ?",55
485,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,They are under an obligation to give the proper agreement.,55
486,Mr SALMON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Coul d any party to the agreement claim damages under law for a breach ?,55
487,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I do not think so - If an agreement is made the parties are bound under the Bill to disclose it. No agreement can be made contrary to the law of the land.,55
488,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The original Act makes all such agreements invalid,55
489,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"In many cases, under the original Act, not ments but acts are required to prove offence.",55
490,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"In one or two instances, such as an attempt to 'monopolize. I provided that any person who, as prinvestigation cipal or agent, enters into any contract becomes a member of any combination - with intent to restrain and so forth, may be proceeded against; so that the case depends, entirely on the fact of a combination being in existence. I do not think that the provision in regard to the onus of proof is very drastic. We cannot go into Court, and, on a simple production of a declaration, call upon a man to dewords :fend himself; we have to prove intent on positive evidence. We do not desire to go into Court, and have the decision given against us because there is no proof of an agreement on which the charge is based.",55
491,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Inten t has to be proved? ,55
492,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Yes .,55
493,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Then to what do the words "" shall be deemed to be proved "" refer ?",55
494,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I shall give an illustration. A person is charged with having therefore, entered into a contract, and so forth, with intent to restrain trade. In such case, under the proposed provision, it will not be necessary to prove that he entered into a contract, or that the contract was in 0 relation to trade and commerce with other countries or amongst the States, because the averment will be sufficient*proof. But we shall have to go further, and establish by positive evidence that the agreement alleged is made with intent to restrain trade.",55
495,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Then the words to "" s h a ll be deemed to be proved."" do not relate to the intent? ",55
496,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,They relate to the agreement.,55
497,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The averment should be deemed to be proof that there is an agreement? ,55
498,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Yes , or of any other allegation that is made. . Mr KELLY - As to the detriment of trade ?",55
499,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Inten t has to be proved.,55
500,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Then proof of the intent of the agreement has to be given? - Mr GROOM - Proo f of intent of the parties; we give all the proof that - we agreecan obtain; and intent is judged from an. the acts and surrounding circumstances. I can assure honourable members that the powers are asked for by the Solicitort is General, who, after the most careful inof concrete instances, is satisor fied' that without them the Ac? cannot be effectively administered. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bil l read a second time. In Committee : Clause 1 agreed to. Clause 2Section three of the Principal Act is amended by adding at the end thereof the following * * * * *' ""Answer questions"" means that the person on whom the obligation of answering questions is cast shall to the best of his knowledge information and belief truly answer all questions on the subject mentioned that the Comptroller General, or the person named by him shall ask. "" Produce documents"" means that the person on whom the obligation lo produce documents is cast shall to the best of his power produce to the Comptroller General or to the person named by him all documents relating to the subject matter mentioned.",55
501,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"North Sydney) [9.17] - There is a difference between the wording of the definition of "" Answer questions"" and the wording of proposed new section 15BV In the definition the questions'must be ""on the subject mentioned/' which is most vague, whereas, in the proposed new section, the questions must be "" in relation to the alleged offence."" It will be seen that, according to the interpretation clause, the Comptroller General is in no way limited as to the questions he may ask, whereas he is limited in the proposed new section. I move-^That the words "" o n the subject mentioned,"" lines 8 and 9, be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the. words in relation to the alleged offence.""",56
502,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Darling Downs-Attor ney-General) [9.19]-- I ask the honourable member not to press the amendment. The drafting of this definition is exactly the same as that of the corresponding clause in the Customs Act. Section 38 of that Act providesAny person making any entry shall, if required by the Collector, answer questions relating to the goods referred to in the entry. The words in the definition clause do not in any way extend the powers of the Comptroller-General, but merely cast upon the person the obligation to truly answer the questions, which must be in relation to alleged offence.",56
503,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Then - why not say so.,56
504,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I submit that the definifeel tion clause does say so. The "" subject mentioned"" is the subject-matter of .the questions, which can only be "" i to the alleged offence."" This drafting has stood the.test of six years' operation in Customs Act.",56
505,Mr SALMON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Laanecoorie) [9-23] The effect of the amendment is that an offence would have to be charged before person could be called upon to answer any questions. I ask the. Attorney-General whether it is intended that a trader shall not be called upon to answer any questions until a charge has been laid against him?,56
506,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Darling Downs-Attor ney General) [9.24] - Unde r the proposed new section 15B, the Comptroller-General, having received information of an alleged offence which he believes to be true, may desire information, perhaps from manypersons, retail traders and others, some of whom might not wish to give it ; and he is empowered to go to any one of ' those individuals and ask questions.",56
507,Sir JOHN FORREST,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"There must be an "" alleged offence.""",56
508,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"There must be an offence, but not necessarily an offence by the person to whom the questions are addressed.",56
509,Mr CROUCH,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Under the proposed section 15c, there must be.a complaint on oath made to the Comptroller-General before he can apply the provisions of the proposed section. 15B.",56
510,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The provisions of 15s are intended to allow of preliminary inquiries being made. It is designed to deal with persons who can give information. Let us suppose that a question arose as to whether a combination existed, and was operating in restraint of trade through a number of retailers. We should be able to ascertain the object of the trust only by securing information from the retailers.",56
511,Mr CROUCH,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Corio) [9.27] - The Attorney-General reads the words "" alleged offence"" as meaning the offence to which reference is. made in line 1 of the proposed section 15B?",56
512,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Yes .,56
513,Mr CROUCH,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The Attorney-General will find that the Court Will attach importhe tance and meaning to the words "" alleged offence."" I take it that, an ""-alleged offence"" must be one which is initiated upon the allegation of a third party. I confident that the Court will interpret those words as relating to a different offence from that referred to in line 1 of n relation the proposed section 15B.",56
514,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Darling Downs-Attor the ney-General) [9.29] - The proposed .section 15B reads;If the Comptroller-General believes that an offence has been committed against this part of this Act, he may by writing, under his hand a require any person whom he believes to be capable of giving any information in relation tto the alleged offence to answer questions, and to produce documents to him or to some person :named by him. Obviously the words "" alleged offence"" can refer only to the offence which has been previously alluded to.",56
515,Sir JOHN FORREST,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,What is the differ--ence between the proposed section 1513 and .the proposed section 15c?,57
516,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The proposed section 35B gives the Comptroller-General of Customs power to .obtain information from certain individuals in respect of an alleged offence. It is intended to be used only against persons who can give that information, whereas the proposed section 15c is intended to be used against corporations which have agreements within their possession.",57
517,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Wentworth) [9.31] - I \inderstand the Attorney-General to say that the words proposed to be inserted, by the honourable member for North Sydney will not alter the real effect of the clause?",57
518,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Oh , no.",57
519,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Does the - AttornevGeneral believe that the questions put by the Comptroller-General of Customs under this provision will relate only to the offence with which the person is charged?,57
520,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Yes .,57
521,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Then we ought to make, the meaning of the'provision plainer. I can - scarcely see any need for a definition of "" answer questions.""",57
522,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,An exactly similar provision is incorporated in the Customs Act.,57
523,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"But I do not hold that two wrongs necessarily make a right, and 1 do not thiiik that we ought to hold tenaciously to the wording of any particular Act. If it is necessary to define what "" answer questions "" means, I really think that we ought to make it quite clear that in the proposed section 15B the questions to be put by the Comptroller-General to any person must have relation to the offence alleged to have been committed. An Act which requires so many legal minds to determine its meaning can scarcely be regarded as perfection. As a layman I should prefer to incorporate in this provision language which will clearly show what we mean.",57
524,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Parramatta) '['9.33] - There is nothing in the proposed section 15B which limits the questions to be put by the Comptroller-General to an "" alleged offence,"" though it is quite evident from the wording of the provision as a whole that his interrogations should be so limited. Under the clause in its present form the Comptroller-General might question the member of a combine regarding his private' income. There is nothing in the provision which limits his questions to the "" alleged offence."" He might interrogate any person as to his private affairs.",57
525,Mr SALMON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Under those circumstances he would not lie entitled to an answer.,57
526,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Le t the honourable member read the definition clause, which says""Answer questions"" means that the person on whom the obligation of answering questions is cast shall to the best of his knowledge, information, and belief, truly answer all questions on the subject mentioned that the Comptroller General or the person named by him shall ask.",57
527,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Le t the honourable member read the whole of that definition into the proposed section-15B, and he will understand its ""full meaning.",57
528,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The proposed section 15B. fails to limit the questions put. by the Comptroller-General to the "" alleged offence,"" just as it fails to limit the production of documents to the "" alleged offence."" Under its operation that officer would be at liberty to roam all over the kingdom for the purpose of ascertaining what was the private income of a member of a combine with a view to discovering whether or not he was engaged in legitimate business.",57
529,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"North Sydney) [9.38J - I have followed the Attorney General's reference to'the Customs Act, and I find that the definition section in that Statute has a different relationship to the provisions which it governs from the definition clause in this Bill.",57
530,Mr CROUCH,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Unde r the Customs Act the provision is limited to the Collector of Customs, and does not extend to any person named by him.",57
531,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The words "" subject mentioned "" used in that Act have reference to the right of the Customs authorities to question- a right conferred under several provisions of that Statute.' The words '.' alleged offence "" could not be used because the right to question extends to. many different matters. Consequently the words '' subject mentioned "" were employed, meaning the subject mentioned in the. section where the t necessity, to answer questions is imposed. When we turn to the section of the Customs Act quoted by"" the Attorney-General we find that it definitely specifies the matter to which the questions must relate.",57
532,Mr CROUCH,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Look at paragraph G of section 234 of the Customs Act. That goes much further.,58
533,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,""" Refuse - or fail to answer questions or to produce documents."" Questions are there confined by the definition to questions on the subject mentioned in any clause enforcing the answering of questions. Proposed new section 15B (1) provides that any person whom the Comptroller-General believes to be capable of giving information in relation to the alleged offence may be summoned by him to answer questions. But it does not say that the questions shall be in relation to the alleged offence. The Minister says that the provision means that the questions shall be in relation to the alleged offence.",58
534,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,That is - the intention.,58
535,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"If the Minister will, when we come to clause 4, make that clear, I shall be satisfied to allow this clause to pass.",58
536,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I promise to consider it.,58
537,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"If the Minister says that it is intended that the questions shall be in relation to the alleged offence, he should not object to making .that clear. To the ordinary reader, it does not now appear clear. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. Clause agreed to. Clause 3 (Amendment).",58
538,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,What are offences excluded from the jurisdiction of the High Court?,58
539,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Darling Downs-Attor ney-General) [9.47]--The Bill creates three new offences - Under proposed new section 15B it is an offence to refuse or fail to answer questions;. under proposed new section 15c, it is an offence to fail to produce or hand over books j and under proposed new section 15E it is an offence to disclose information gained in the exercise of powers conferredby the measure. Section 13 provides that no offence against this part of the Act which is an indictable offence shall be tried' before a Justice of the High Court, indictable offences going into the State Courts, .where there is the machinery for trying them. offences which I have named .being minor offences are to be prosecuted in any State Court, so that the time ,of the High Court may not be taken up in dealing with minor matters. Clause agreed to. Clause 4Part II . of 'the Principal Act is amended by inserting therein after section fifteen the following sections :15A. In any prosecution for an offence against sections four, five, seven, eight, or nine of this Act the averments of the prosecutor contained in. the information declaration or claim shall be deemed to be proved in the absence of proo.f to the contrary, but so that(a) the averment in the information of intent shall not be deemed sufficient to prove such intent, and (i) in all proceedings for an' indictable offence the guilt of the defendant must be established by evidence"". .",58
540,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,It might be convenient to deal separately with each of the proposed new sections in this clause.,58
541,The CHAIRMAN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"It is not customary to divide a clause. Sir ' j OHN - QUICK (Bendigo) [9.51:] I invite the attention of the Attorney-General to an omission from proposed new section 15B (1) of the preliminary requirement of a complaint on oath made in writing provided for in proposed.new section 15c (1). I submit that there is no reason for this omission. The Comptroller-General' of Customs, as a public officer, ought not to be required to move on his own motion against any private individual. As a preliminary to requiring any person to answer questions relating to a supposed offence, the his - informant should be called upon to swear an information .on oath. The Comptroller-General cannot go to a firm or individual and say, "" I demand to see your books,"" unless some one has taken the responsibility of making a complaint, on oath in writing. The power to call upon persons to answer questions in writing is more extraordinary than the power to order the production of documents, and should be stirrounded - with safeguards to protect individuals or firms from harassing, unnecessary, and unjustifiable investigations. A public Department should not be called upon to make fishing inquiries until some person has accepted the responsibility of setting the law in motion. If a private individual says "" I believe that there is a The three conspiracy in restraint of trade, and I wish you to move in the matter,''"" the Comptroller-General of' Customs may fairly reply, "" I shall do so if you will take the responsibility of swearing an information."" Why should the Comptroller-General be called upon to compel persons to answer questions before some person has stated upon oath that he has reasonable grounds for believing that an offence has been committed ? It must be presumed that some one has supplied him with information, because he could not move unless he believed that an offence had been committed. How could he believe that an offence had been committed unless he had received some private information? If he had, he should call upon the informant to record oh oath his belief. That would be a justification for departmental action. It seems to me that too big an onus and responsibility is thrown upon a public officer by requiring him to launch what is, so to speak, a criminal proceeding-callin g upon persons to appear before him to answer questions-unles s he has some protection in the shape of an information on oath. I think, therefore, that the Attorney-Genera] ought to agree to insert in proposed section 1.5B the wordsWhenever a complaint on oath has been made in writing to the Comptroller-General that any person or any foreign corporation, or any trading or financial corporation formed within the Commonwealth, has been guilty of any offence against this part of this Act, the Comptroller-General, if he believes the complaint to be well founded, may by writing under his own hand require any person whom he believes to be capable of giving information in relation to the alleged offence to answer questions. That would make the foundation of jurisdiction in both cases similar, and prevent the exercise of these two powers being anomalous, by, in the one case, casting the onus upon the Comptroller-General, and in the other requiring him to equip himself with sworn information. I do not think that the amendment I suggest would in anyway impair the operation of this power. I desire to support the power, and to make it thoroughly effective, but I do not see why the Comptroller-General should require sworn information in one case, and not in the other. I hope the Attorney General will make this law appear just and well founded by associating*the exercise of the first power with the same conditions precedent as are associated with th?. exercise of the second power.",58
542,Mr FULLER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Illawarra) [9.57] - Be fore the amendment suggested by the honourable member for Bendigo is proposed, I wish to move an amendment of the proposed section 15A. There has been a good deal of comment upon it , and it has been pointed out that the provision that the [323] averment of the prosecutor contained in the information shall be deemed to be proved in the absence of proof to the contrary is un-British. I propose to move That the words "" to be proved in the absence of proof to the contrary "" be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" f r i m d facie evidence of the statements therein contained.""",59
543,Mr CROUCH,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,What is the practical difference?,59
544,Mr FULLER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The result of my amendment would be that every accused person would be bound to answer the charge. As the clause now stands, the averments of the prosecutor are to be taken as absolute"" proof against the accused person in the absence of proof to the contrary, but under my proposal every accused person would be bound to answer the charge. If he did not, he would be convicted on the averments contained in the information. If we determine that those averments shall be deemed prima facie evidence against the accused if he does not answer them, the. Judge before whom the case is brought will be absolutely free to consider the case on its merits as submitted to him.  vides that an accused person shall be deemed guilty in the absence of proof to the contrary. I fail to see in what respect the amendment would vary that position.",59
545,Mr FULLER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I merely wish to give, an accused person full opportunity to have his case stated before a Judge, so that it may be dealt with on its merits. The. provision as it stands is contrary to all that we have been accustomed to.",59
546,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Darling 'Downs-At torney-General) [10.4] - I am afraid that the Committee will not realise the distinction which the ""honourable and learned member is trying to make. The clause as it stands is in keeping with the view expressed by Mr Justice Owen in the decision of the Full Court of New South Wales in the case of ex parte Healy. that If the accused gives no evidence, his guilt must be taken to be established; but if the accused does give evidence, and the magistrate upon the whole of the evidence before him has any doubt as to the guilt of the accused, it is his duty to give him the benefit of the doubt, and acquit him.",59
547,Mr ATKINSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Why not insert those words ?,59
548,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Because the clause is in itself sufficient. We simply provide that where a person is charged with an offence and declines to give evidence of a matter absolutely within his own knowledge, the case against him shall be deemed to be proved.",59
549,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Supposing that he could not give evidence? Mr GROOM. - It is impossible to contion, ceive of such a case, if he has any defence.",60
550,Mr JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Such a case occurred New South Wales.,60
551,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I have before me the port of that case, and the facts are not*as the honourable member suggests. magistrate who heard the case made a miscertain take, and the Full Court overruled his deficiently cision.",60
552,Sir JOHN FORREST,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"What is the obthe contrary. jection to the use of the words ""prima facie evidence "" ?",60
553,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The clause as it stands is in keeping with provisions embodied several other Acts that have proved satisdiseases factory. We have been told that this vision is unusual. In a judgment given by Chief Justice Marshall, in a similar case, we find this statementThe Act under which this seizure was made proves the contrary. declares that "" in actions, suits, or informations to be brought, where any seizure shall be pursuant to this Act, if the property be claimed by any person, in every such case the onus bandi shall be upon such claimant. See i Story, Laws, c. 128, 71, p. 633 (1 Stat. 678, In this case, then, the US. are hot required Courtlo establish guilt, but the claimants must prove innocence. It is not the duty of the Judge to justify the Legislature, but surely, if , in any case, such a legislative provision be proper, it is in this. The fact is generally premeditated, and is perpetrated under all the precautions and in all the secrecy which ingenuity can suggest, and the means of proving innocence, at least,' to a reasonable extent, which is all that can be required, stte in possession of 'the accused'. In such a case, he may, without a violation of principle, be required to prove his innocence. In such a case, the absence of testimony, clearly in the power of the - claimants, if not supplied by other equivalent testimony, must be Tatal. Those words are absolutely in point when we consider the subjecf-matter with which we are dealing.",60
554,Sir JOHN FORREST,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Would not the same argument apply to every criminal charge?,60
555,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The provision applies only to a. particular case where the information is within the knowledge of the person charged. In many criminal proceedings, the onus of proof is, in specified matters, thrown upon the accused. There is, for instance, such a provision in the Foreign Enlistment Act.",60
556,Sir JOHN FORREST,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"This is not ordinary procedure in criminal cases. Why is the procedure laid down in this Bill different from that adopted in a case of felony ? . Mr GROOM - In such cases, the facts are easily capable of proof by the prosecubut this Bill deals with a class of cases where the defendant should have no in difficulty in calling rebutting evidence. There is a similar provision in the Customs reAct and the Excise Act, as well as in the English Consolidated Customs Act of 1870, The which provides that in any information, matters shall be deemed to be sufproved on averment, unless - the defendant in such case can bring proof to",60
557,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The instances cited are in connection with the Customs.,60
558,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"But there are similar in cases, for instance in connection with the of animals. In such cases, the prodefendant is presumed to have known of the disease until he shows to the satisfaction of the Court that he has not-that is, he is presumed to be guiltv unless he In that, as in the cases immediately under discussion, the made contrary is easy of proof. This is not an f r o - unusual provision, as is shown by the following extract from a decision by Mr Tusc. 22). tice Owen in the New South Wales The view I take of s. 144 is simply this, that it. relieves the Crown from the necessity of proving their case in the first instance by oral evidence, and allows the averment of the prosecution contained in the information, declaration, or claim, to be f r i m d facie proof of the charge preferred against the accused. But when the information has been put in, and all the. evidence produced is before the tribunal, then it appears to me that the tribunal has to determine upon the whole of the evidence before it, whether the Crown has established the guilt of the accused or not. The section referred to in that judgment is in the very words proposed in the Bill before us. Further, it is an advantage to have the.same phraseology throughout the Statutes.",60
559,Mr CROUCH,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I rise to a point of order. As to the procedure upon this ' clause, I suggest that the proposed new sections contained in it should be submitted to the Committee separately, although you, Mr Chairman, have ruled that the clause must be taken as a whole. It must be admitted that the circumstances. are somewhat unusual, seeing that we have three proposed new sections all contained with the in the one clause. If we decide, in regard to the amendment of the honourable member for Illawarra, that the word? are to stand, those, of us who desire to have proposed new section 15A omitted, will be deprived of an opportunity of voting to that end.",60
560,The CHAIRMAN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"No matter how the clause may be divided with a view to suiting the convenience of the Committee, it will still be clause 4 of the Bill. There is thing to prevent an honourable member from moving any amendment he thinks proper in the proposed new sections as they come under review in the ordinary course.",61
561,Mr CROUCH,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"But if the Committee decided that part of the proposed new section 15A shall stand, can we vote that the proposed new section be struck out altogether ?",61
562,The CHAIRMAN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Even if we divided the clause as suggested, and we amended any part of proposed new section 15A, that proposed new section would still have to stand as part of clause 4; we could not go back and omit it ; so that we should arrive at exactly the same position that we are now in. If in Committee we commenced to divide up a proposed clause we might possibly be led into difficulty, because then it would be open to honourable members, to divide proposed new subclauses, so that there would be no finality.",61
563,Mr WYNNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Balaclava) [10.15] - My desire, is to move that the proposed new section 15A be struck out.",61
564,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,We desire first to deal with the amendment of the honourable member for Illawarra.,61
565,Mr WYNNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,If we strike out the proposed section there will be no necessity for an amendment.,61
566,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I rise to a point of order. I understand that the honourable member for Illawarra has moved an amendment.,61
567,The CHAIRMAN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,No.'amendmen t has been moved up to the present. The honourable member for Illawarra suggested an amendment but he did hot formally move it.,61
568,Mr WYNNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"To my mind the proposed new section 1.5A is neither more nor less than a lazy man's way of proving a case. Ever since the Magna Chartait has been assumed that a man is innocent until he is proved to be guilty. But the Attorney-General now desires us to take a contrary view. This is to establish a very bad precedent. In the case of the unfortunate woman who was murdered at Ballarat, the departure proposed in this Bill would, if extended, mean that any person seen in her company before her death might be pre[3*3]--2 sumed to be guilty, and find it impossible to prove his innocence. The proposed interrogation is following the system of the French, although there is not the slightest objection to the suggestion of the honourable member for Flinders to have interrogatories on the order of a Judge, as in a civil no- proceeding. But to say that a person must be assumed to be guilty on the averment of the Crown is un-English and unprecedented. In the case of mining accidents the averment or complaint is prima"" facie evidence, but that is a civil and not a criminal proceeding. Under the Bill, however, any person who cannot prove his inno cence may be. fined or imprisoned.",61
569,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,No ; if it be an indictable offence everything must be proved.,61
570,Mr WYNNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"But if a person is unable to pay a fine he must go to prison, and have a black mark against him all the rest of his life, so that the result is the same asin a criminal charge. Why should the Crown say that it is too muchtrouble to get up the evidence and prove a case?",61
571,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I explained that sometimes it is-not possible to obtain the agreement.,61
572,Mr WYNNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"There may be cases without an agreement, as the Attorney General mentioned. There is the case of the confectionery trade.",61
573,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I did not 'mention any trade by name.,61
574,Mr WYNNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The Attorney-General indicated that there were cases brought before him.. In this House I produced a copy of the Confectionery .Combine's agreement, bearing the name of the solicitor who prepared it-, and it seems to me there ought hot to be any great difficulty in subpoenaing the people associated therewith, seeing that there were copies of their signatures. I am not in favour of trusts, but I . do not desire to see punishment inflicted on' innocent men who may not be able to prove their innocence, as must be the case in many instances.",61
575,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The amendment of the honourable member for Balaclava will preclude any amendment of the proposed new section.' If the amendment be put and negatived it will mean that the proposed new section must stand, and therefore cannot be amended.",61
576,Mr WYNNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I shall be happy to withdraw the proposal I have indicated .if any honourable member desires to placo aramendment before the Chair.,61
577,The CHAIRMAN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"If the honourable member for Balaclava submits his amendment now, and it is agreed to, it will preclude any further amendment in this proposed new section. I suggest that he could attain his object by moving as a test quesrion that the first words "" In any prosecution "" be omitted. Any subsequent amendment it was desired to move would then not lie interfered with.",62
578,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Wentworth) [10.23] A number of honourable members might '-.yes quite prepared to see the pioposed new section pass with the arriei-dmerit of - the honourable member for Ilia: warra, but would not be - prepared to accept it unamended. Consequently I suggest that the best time to test the feeling ' of the Committee would be - after that amendment has been dealt with. I suggest that course because a number of honourable members' would support the proposed new section if it can be made to read in the way that they desire. Progress reported. SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT. Motion (by Sir WILLIAM LYNE) agreed toThat the House at its rising adjourn until 3 o'clock tomorrow afternoon. House adjourned at 10.28 p.m.",62
