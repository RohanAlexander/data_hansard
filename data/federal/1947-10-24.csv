1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. J. S. Rosevear) took the chair at 10.30 a.m., and read prayers. NATIONALIZATION OF BANKING . petition",11
2,Mr HAMILTO N,Unknown,"Swan) [10.31] - I present a petition fro m certain electors of Western Australia, in the divisions of Perth, Fremantle, Forrest, Kalgoorlie and Swan, the total number of signatures on which is 31,74.7, praying that no further steps be taken by the Government to nationalize the banking system in Australia without first taking a referendum of the people on the subject. I point out that the petition was sponsored by the Citizens Rights Association in Western Australia. The original intention of the association was to conduct a State-wide campaign, in order to obtain as many signatures as possible in the short time that was available to it between the 4th ancl the 10th October. Furthermore, it will be noted that each of the petition forms contains the roll number, name, address and signature of the elector. In most instances, the roll number of the individual has been attached, and his name has been struck through, on the master Commonwealth electoral rolls in the possession of the association, thus ensuring avoidance of duplication, and a check of the authenticity of the signatures. In this task, the association was somewhat hampered by reason of the fact that the Commonwealth electoral rolls in Western Australia are still dated August, 1946. It is understood that new rolls are to be printed shortly. Some of the names on the petition do not appear on the rolls in the possession of the association. Nevertheless, the association is certain, and it guarantees, that they are names of persons who have passed the age of 21 years and have become enrolled. Others relate to electors who have changed their addresses. I vouch for the signatures. I assure the House that the petition is respectfully worded, concludes with a prayer, and is otherwise in conformity with the rules and orders of the House. I have very much pleasure in movingThat the petition be received.",11
3,Mr DALY,Unknown,"I rise to order. The honourable member for Swan (Mr . Hamilton) has presented a petition containing 31,747 names. If I understood BANKING. you correctly, Mr Speaker, you said recently that any member presenting a should be in a position to verify the accuracy of its contents. I should like to know how the honourable member is able to vouch with a fair degree of accuracy for the signatures of persons in many different electorates. Is not the presentation of a petition frivolous when an honourable member cannot say whether or not the signatures which appear on it are genuine? Recently, the honourable member for Calare presented a small petition from Trundle, in his division. Mr SPEAKER,-Order ! There is only one petition before the House.",11
4,Mr DALY,Unknown,"I was merely about to point out that I checked that petition, and found that some of the signatures on it were duplications. How are we to know that that has not occurred m a n y times in this instance?",11
5,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"In regard to the authenticity of petitions, I have not at any time said that honourable members who present them should be able to 'verify all the names that appear on them. All that I have said is that the House, out of courtesy, usually receives the petitions, and expects honourable members who present them to take reasonable precautions to ensure their genuineness. That, does not imply that an honourable member must peruse over 30,000 signatures.",11
6,Mr HARRISON,Unknown,Is it ' permissible to speak on the motion for the presentation of a petition?,11
7,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Yes .,11
8,Mr HARRISON,Unknown,Wentworth) [10.35] - I should like to take this opportunity to make one or two pertinent observations. It seems that the electors of Australia who are not represented by honourable members on this side of the House have no opportunity to present their views on banking to this Parliament otherwise than by the method adopted by the honourable member for Swan (Mr H a m i l to n ). I have seen in the newspapers published in the electorate of the honourable member for M a r t in ,11
9,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order ! The House is now considering a petition received from Western Australia, not one from the division of Martin .",12
10,Mr HARRISON,Unknown,"No , but I am pointing out",12
11,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member may not point it out. He must restrict himself to the petition under consideration.,12
12,Mr HARRISON,Unknown,"I am doing so. The electors of Australia have no opportunity, except through the good graces of honourable members on this side of the House, to express their opinion on banking to the House. Electors of constituencies represented by Government supporters have tried by every means in their power to have petitions presented, but without avail. Their own representatives refuse to present their petitions, leaving them no alternative but to act as have the electors whose petition the honourable member for Swan has sought to present - today.",12
13,Mr ANTHONY,Unknown,"I rise to a point of order, and ask for your ruling, Mr . Speaker, as to whether debates should be allowed On the motion for the presentation of a petition. May's Parliamentary Practice, fourteenth edition, from which you yourself often quote, states at page 802, on the subject of the presentation of petitionsIt is to the representatives of the people that petitions are chiefly addressed, and to them they were sent in such numbers that restrictions have been necessarily imposed upon the discussion of their merits. Formerly, the practice of presentingpetitions had been generally similar to that of the House Lords; but the number had so much increased (/), and the business of the House was so much interrupted by the debates which arose on receiving petitions (g), that Standing Orders dealing with the matter were adopted in 1842 and 1853 (Standing Orders Nos. 75-79). In accordance with these orders, member, on the presentation of a petition, read the prayer and make a statement as the parties from whom it comes, the number of its signatures and its material allegations. the electors of Fremantle. Therefore, according to established liamentary practice, no debate is allowed on the motion for the presentation of a Minister. petition, and I take the point that further debate on the present motion is out of order.",12
14,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"O u r only obligation to look to the procedure of the House of Commons for guidance is when our own Standing Orders are silent or do not exist. Our Standing Orders provide for the restriction of debate on certain motions. Where no restriction is i m posed under the Standing Orders on a debate I have always ruled, if a ruling were required, that the debate should ensue. I propose to allow the debate to proceed.",12
15,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,Fremantle) [10.41]. - I would not have made a comment on this,12
16,Mr ANTHONY,Unknown,I rise to a further point of order.,12
17,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order !,12
18,Mr HOLT,Unknown,"I refer you, Mr Speaker, to Standing Order 89",12
19,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! The honourable member for Fremantle,12
20,Mr HOLT,Unknown,"I refer you to Standing Order 89 Mr SPEAKER,-Order ! The honors able member for Fremantle has the call.",12
21,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"I would not have intervened in this debate but for the statement by the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Harrison) that a petition presented by the honourable member for Swan (Mr Hamilton) included the signatures of certain electors of the division of Fremantle. Mr Holt interjecting,",12
22,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member for Fawkner must be careful or he will be removed from the chamber.,12
23,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"The honourable of member for Wentworth stated that the electors must use Opposition members in order to secure the presentation of a petition to this House, conveying the clear innuendo that petitions have been a presented to Labour members fro m may Western Australia. I wish to make it to perfectly clear that I have not received any petition to present to this House from Petitions parfrom electors of other electorates have been directed to mo and to the Prime There was, I think, an intention on the part of the honourable member for Wentworth, to create an impression that it was necessary to use the good offices of the honourable member for Swan for this purpose because of some failure on our part. I assert clearly that I have not received from the electors of Fremantle any petition on this matter to present to the House.",12
24,Mr THOMPSON,Unknown,Hindmarsh) [10.43]. - Like the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Beazley),13
25,Mr SPENDER,Unknown,Mr Speaker,13
26,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order !,13
27,Mr SPENDER,Unknown,Mr Speaker,13
28,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order ! honourable, member for Hindmarsh is addressing the Chair.",13
29,Mr THOMPSON,Unknown,"I would not have risen to speak on this matter but for what was said by the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Harrison) and a statement which I read in a newspaper circulating in my electorate, that an nonorable member opposite had presented a petition from the people of my electorate.",13
30,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! The honourable member is not entitled at this stage to discuss a petition from the electors of South Australia. The question before the Chair is whether a petition from certain electors in Western Australia should be received.,13
31,Mr THOMPSON,Unknown,"I agree that all petitions should be received. In reply to the allegation of the honourable member for Wentworth that Government supporters will not present to the House petitions on the subject of banking and the statement in the press that an Opposition member had to do so in their stead, I affirm that no person in my electorate has ever sent to me a petition or other matter that I have not been willing to present to the House.",13
32,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! honourable member must address his remarks to the question whether a certain petition from Western Australia should be received.,13
33,Mr THOMPSON,Unknown,"I deprecate the statements made by the honourable member for Wentworth, particularly the allegation that when petitions have been presented by honourable members opposite they have been ridiculed by honourable members on this side of the House. I make my own position clear. I have never raised any objection to the presentation of a petition on behalf of any people no matter whence they come. I can only say that I have no objection to petitions, and that any petition sent to me for presentation to the House will be presented if it is in order.",13
34,Mr SPENDER,Unknown,"I desire to raise a point of order on the Standing Orders themselves. Standing Order 89 providesEvery petition, which according to the Kules of the House can be received, shall be brought to the Table by the member presenting the The same, and no discussion upon the subject-matter thereof shall be allowed, Mr SPEAKER , - That is correct.",13
35,Mr SPENDER,Unknown,"The point of order that I ask a ruling upon is this: Once a petition, which according to the rules of the House can be received, has been brought to the table, can discussion then proceed upon the matter ? Secondly, if , in accordance with the Standing Orders, a motion is moved, is any discussion permissible, having regard to this standing order? Mr SPEAKER,-The standing order is very clear. As I pointed out earlier today] we refer to the House of Commons rulings and Standing Orders only when we have none of our own to cover a situation. Standing Order 89 providesEvery petition, which according to the Rules of the House can be received, shall be brought to the Table by the Member presenting the same, and no discussion upon the subject-matter thereof shall be allowed. These petitions relate to banking. It would be absurd for the Chair to allow a discussion on banking or the Banking Bill 1947 under cover of a petition about banking, but, if any honourable member were in a position to challenge the authenticity of a particular petition, he could do. so, or any honourable member The might take the view that the continual petitioning of the House was intended to unduly influence honourable members and protest against any petition being received. I give that merely as an illustration. The House, having been asked to receive a petition, has the right to debate whether it should receive it or not, but the subject-matter of the petition cannot be debated. T think that is quite clear.",13
36,Mr BUBKE,Unknown,"I desire to make a personal explanation. I understand that during my temporary absence a petition was presented from people in my electorate, and that the statement was made, or the inference conveyed, that it had to be presented by the honourable member who presented it because I was unwilling to present petitions. I have two comments to make. The first is that the honourable member who presented the petition from my electorate has a big enough job to represent his own constituents and will have a bigger job to continue to represent them.",14
37,Mr HAMILTON,Unknown,I did not imply anything about the honourable member.,14
38,Mr BURKE,Unknown,"Secondly , no petitions have come to me for presentation to the House. In fact, from correspondence J have received, I have formed the strong suspicion that the petition in question was prepared by the honourable member who presented it. Whether inside or outside this chamber honourable members will find me a ready contestant.",14
39,Mr HOWSE,Unknown,"I , too, desire to make a personal explanation.",14
40,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member may take part in the debate. He has no need to make a personal explanation in order to do so.,14
41,Mr HOWSE,Unknown,"Calare) [10.49] - The honourable member for Martin (Mr. Daly) recently made a charge against the people of Trundle, a town in my electorate. He said that their signatures were duplicated on petitions presented to the House. That is utterly false. If the honourable member for Martin has not the decency to apologize publicly to the people of Trundle, who are not accustomed to, and resent, his allegations, would you, Mr Speaker, direct him to write to each of those people whom he has slandered apologizing to them?",14
42,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I am afraid that is not within the power of the Chair.,14
43,Mr LEMMON,Unknown,"I rise to order. When the honourable member for Swan (Mr. Hamilton) was presenting a certain petition he mentioned that the document contained signatures from the electorate of Forrest. I quite believe that that is true. The honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Harrison) then rose, and stated that the honourable member for Swan had been compelled to present a petition which contained the names of persons residing in the electorate of Forrest, which I have the honour to represent, because I would not present the petition to this House. The statement that I had received petitions and would not present them to the House is untrue. I have not received a.petition to present to the House or to the Prime Minister (Mr Chifley). The only petition which I received contained about eight signatures, and was addressed to me. Further, the statement that I had refused to present petitions to the House is a reflection on me, and I ask that the honourable member for Wentworth withdraw it. Mr SPEAKER,-The Minister for Works and Housing (Mr Lemmon) has complained that an insinuation by the honourable member for Wentworth is offensive to him. I ask the honourable member to withdraw it.",14
44,Mr HARRISON,Unknown,"May I be permitted to explain, Mr Speaker Mr SPEAKER,-No . The honourable member must withdraw or apologize.",14
45,Mr HARRISON,Unknown,"I refuse to withdraw, unless it is at your immediate direction. Mr SPEAKER,-It is.",14
46,Mr HARRISON,Unknown,"Ver y well. So that there shall be no further repercussions, I withdraw the statements. I have no desire to be suspended for a month this time.",14
47,Mr DALY,Unknown,"I desire to make a personal explanation. The honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Harrison) implied today that I had received petitions, in relation to banking, which I would not present to the House. Tn common with the honourable member for Perth (Mr. Burke) and the Minister for Works and Housing (Mr Lemmon), I have never received any petitions to present to this House, and, consequently, have not refused to do so. Further, I suggest to the honourable member for Calare (Mr. Howse) that he check the list again before be makes insinuations against me, and ensure that he presents to the House accurate information. Question resolved in the affirmative. Petition received.",14
48,Mr HAMILTON,Unknown,"Before I move that the petition be read, must I bring it to the table?",15
49,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"For the benefit of the honourable member for Swan, I shall read Standing Order 89 againEvery Petition, which according to the Rules of the House can be received, shall be brought to the Table by the Member presenting the same . . . Motion (by Mr HAMILTON) agreed toThat the petition be read. Petition read.",15
50,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I suggest that, in future, honourable members would be well advised not to pay undue attention to the Standing Orders in this respect because of possible repercussions.",15
51,Mr CONELAN,Unknown,"I rise to order. It appears that the honourable member for Swan (Mr Hamilton) has only delivered to the Clerk about half the signatures on the petition. Do you not rule, Mr. Speaker, that he should also deliver the remainder today?",15
52,Mr HAMILTON,Unknown,"The petition bearing 46,000 signatures which I still hold is addressed to the Prime Minister. Other petitions in relation to the nationalization of banking in Australia were presented as follows.:By Mr ADERMANN, from certain sions electors of the division of Maranoa. By Mr BERNARD CORSER, from by certain electors of the division of ""Wide Bay. By Mr DAVIDSON, from certain electors of the division of Capricornia. Petitions received and read. DUTCH NEW GUINEA. JAPANESE SETTLEMENT.",15
53,Mr FRANCIS,Unknown,"Has the Prime Minas ister seen the press report that Mr W. desired amenity? Teeling, a member of the British House of Commons, who has just completed a tour of Japan, believes that the Japanese should be allowed to send their excess population to Dutch New Guinea? Does the right honourable gentleman believe that any such development could possibly meet with the approval of the relatives of the thousands of Australian soldiers who died fighting against the Japanese, or of those ex-prisoners of war who suffered badly at their hands? Will the right honourable gentleman indicate the Government's views on Mr Teeling's statement, and, if they are opposed to what Mr Teeling is reported to have said, will he protest to the British Government against such statements being made, or such ideas being put into the minds of the Japanese ?",15
54,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"I noticed last night a press reference to a statement that had been made by a member of the British House of Commons. The Government has received no official intimation of any proposal such as that mentioned. Naturally, it has never considered the matter. I do not think it was suggested that the Japanese should be permitted to enter Papua and New Guinea. In my view, that would be most unwise, and certainly would not have the consent of the Government. ELECTRICITY SERVICES. COUNTRY RETICULATION. Mr FULLER,-Throughou t country ' districts in my electorate, various shire councils are carrying out an extensive programme of electricity supply extenfor the benefit of primary producers. The estimated cost of the extensions at Tumut is £53,000. Delay is being caused the shortage of such materials as transformers, copper cables and insulators. Will the Minister representing the Minister for Supply and Shipping take the matter up with, the State authorities in New South Wales, with a view to having the necessary equipment made available at the earliest possible date, and thus assist to give a necessary stimulus to the speeding up of primary production, well as the provision of this much",15
55,Mr DEDMAN,Unknown,"The question relates to the activities of my department rather than to those of the Department of Supply and Shipping. The allocation of certain materials is undertaken by the secondarv industries division of the Department of Post-war Reconstruction, but it applies only as between States and does not extend right down to individuals in the different States. I fully appreciate the need for the provision of electricity supplies in rural areas, and assure the honourable memher that I shall take""the matter up with the New South Wales authorities in order to see whether supplies can be made available expeditiously for the purpose mentioned. CIVIL AVIATION. NA CANBERRA.",15
56,Mr RANKIN,FLIGHT OF AIRCRAFT FKOM LAVERTON TO,"Recently , I asked the Minister for Air a question, and he requested me to supply further particulars. ""With that request I now comply. Was --aircraft A65-123 flown from Laverton to 'Canberra on Wednesday, the Sth Octoher? - If it was, was the instruction given to the "".Royal Australian Air Force that ""very important persons "" were to be flown in iit *o Canberra? What are the names of Wie persons who travelled in it, and what was the reason for their visit? Did the crew fly the aircraft back to Laverton without, any passengers? How much petrol was used on the forward and return journeys ? In view of the frequent ministerial statements emphasizing the importance of conserving petrol, and the further rationing recently imposed, how does the Minister justify the flight of this aircraft?",16
57,Mr DRAKEFORD,FLIGHT OF AIRCRAFT FKOM LAVERTON TO,"On the date mentioned, an aeroplane was flown to Canberra because, on the previous day, another aeroplane on which I was to have travelled was found to be defective upon my arrival at the airport. The replacement was made, not on my instructions, but in compliance with orders that were issued by the Royal Australian Air Force. It was flying empty to Canberra. It carried my wife and the wife of my private secretary, who otherwise would have travelled by Trans-Australia Airlines, with which airline my wife had been booked to travel. In consequence, the aircraft that was returned was that which flew me to Canberra, not that which has been referred to in the honourable member's question, and in an article that was published in a weekly journal which has not a reputation for truthfulness in the allegations that it makes, but on which the honourable member apparently relies. It is, therefore, clear that an aircraft was not flown for the special purpose of bringing any person to Canberra, and that the aircraft which brought the persons I have mentioned was not returned empty to Melbourne. The quantity of petrol consumed was that which is customarily used on a flight of that kind. The flight of the aircraft to Canberra was due entirely to a defect in the machine that was intended for my use. I had to use another machine in order that I might reach Canberra in time to attend a Cabinet meeting. On occasions, the honourable member has taken advantage of the opportunity to .use aircraft to travel between Canberra and Melbourne, yet he apparently objects to Ministers using them for official purposes. SENATOR S. K. AMOUR.",16
58,Mr HAYLEN,FLIGHT OF AIRCRAFT FKOM LAVERTON TO,"I address a question to you, Mr Speaker, concerning privilege, and the forms and orders of the House. Yesterday, you made some comments in regard to gross misreporting by acertain newspaper and the subject of privilege, and said that you would take certain action. I now ask you whether you have taken that action and, if you have, with what result ? Have you read today's newspapers, particularly the Sydney Daily Telegraph? In view of the assault that was made on the privilege of which you spoke, will you have the subject-matter that appears on page five of today's Sydney Daily Telegraph read to the House, or would it be possible to have it incorporated in Hansard, so that it may become a permanent record?",16
59,Mr SPEAKER,FLIGHT OF AIRCRAFT FKOM LAVERTON TO,"Hon. J. S. Rosevear). - In fulfilment of the intention that I expressed yesterday, I scanned all the daily newspapers, in order to ascertain whether any other journal had offended to the degree to which the Sydney Daily Telegraph had. .1 confess that I was unable to discover that any other journal had so misrepresented the position. So that there will be no misconception, nor any speculation as to what I have done in the matter, I propose to read the letter - which I forwarded to the representative - of the Sydney Daily Telegraph. It was in these termsMy attention has been drawn to a frontpage editorial, appearing in the Daily Tele.graph of today's date, under the heading "" They cannot censor us-yet"" , in which the - following appears:Last night the free and independent news service of the Australian Broadcasting Commission was censored. The Joint Committee on the Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings forbade the Australian Broadcasting Commission to re-broadcast an incident which happened in Parliament. In my view only one interpretation can be placed upon the above mentioned statement, and that is that the Joint Committee on the Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings was responsible for certain incidents not being broadcast in the Australian Broadcasting Commission's news service. The suggestion is completely untrue and, in my view, a gross reflection on the above mentioned committee. The Joint Committee on the Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings acted strictly in conformity with a principle adopted by both Houses of Parliament, the principle being"" (4) Re-broadcast of questions and answers - Withi n the limits of time available, the following parliamentary proceedings should be re-broadcast by the Australian Broadcasting Commission between 7.20 p.m. and 7.55 p.m. on each sitting daySenate proceedings-Question s - out notice and on notice and answers thereto; House of Representatives proceedings-Question s without notice answers thereto."" Your paper, in common with other papers, enjoys certain privileges in the Commonwealth Parliament, not enjoyed in any other parliament in Australia, and the continuance of the enjoyment of those privileges in the House is a matter entirely at the discretion of the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives. t have consulted with the President, and he concurs, that your newspaper should be given 24 hours to completely refute the imputations contained in the above mentioned editorial ; otherwise the privileges enjoyed by your staff will be immediately cancelled. That letter was forwarded to the representative of the Sydney Daily Telegraph, and a statement was submitted to me of which I did not entirely approve in the first instance. was amended to my satisfaction, and was properly presented to the public today in a very prominent part of the newspaper. I am satisfied that there has been a complete retraction of what was unquestionably an untrue statement. QUESTIONS'. REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS : LAND SALES CONTROL - IMPORT LICENCE: FAR EASTERN ' EXCHANGE PROPRIETARY LIMITED.",16
60,Mr HARRIS ON,FLIGHT OF AIRCRAFT FKOM LAVERTON TO,"I have here an answer which I have just received to a question which I placed on the notice paper on the 15th May last, concerning the cost of administration of Land Sales Control, and the answer contains very debatable matter. On the 26th September last, I asked a question concerning an import licence for the Far Eastern Exchange Proprietary Limited, which was not answered until after the Estimates, on which this matter might have heen dLcussed, had been passed. That answer also contained highly debatable matter. Will the Prime Minister explain the reason for the delay in answering those questions? Is it due to the fact that the Government desired to withhold answers to questions of a touchy character until an opportunity to debate them during the consideration of the Estimates in this House had passed ?",17
61,Mr CHIFLEY,FLIGHT OF AIRCRAFT FKOM LAVERTON TO,"The honourable member for Wentworth and other honourable with- members may accept my assurance that no delays have occurred in answering questions, except those caused by the physical and difficulty of preparing the answers. Some questions involve a great deal of investigation hy departmental officers in preparing answers. The officers are often overworked in an attempt to prepare answers to questions which are sometimes, I confess, asked only in the hope of making political propaganda out of them. The instruction to departments is that, subject to carrying out other necessary work, officers shall prepare answers to questions as soon as possible. What other Ministers do is a matter for themselves to decide, but so far .as my department is concerned, I am not going to take away from their duties senior officers who may be engaged on urgent work, such as the preparation of bills for presentait tion to the Parliament, so that they may spend days delving into statistics to answer questions. Subject to that provision, all questions will be answered as soon as possible. In regard to the question mentioned by the honourable member, no attempt was made to delay the preparation of the answer. I spent part of Saturday afternoon going through the file associated with the subject-matter of the second question mentioned by the honourable member before I approved of the answer, and that is a practice which I try to follow whenever possible. However, I may be delayed by important work, and that probably applies to other Ministers, also. UNESCO. AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION.",17
62,Mr LANG,FLIGHT OF AIRCRAFT FKOM LAVERTON TO,"Furthe r to my question yesterday regarding the appointment of Mr S. P., Lewis as a representative of Australia to the Unesco conference in Mexico City, will the Prime Minister inform the House whether he is aware that Lewis is a notorious Communist, and holds an important position in the inner Communist organization in Australia? Is it a fact that Lewis has indicated that he proposes to visit France, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia and Greece, in addition to Mexico, Canada and the United Kingdom? Have vouchers for his expenses been approved by the Department of External Affairs, and to what amount? Has the Prime Minister considered all reports that have been received from the Commonwealth Investigation Service regarding Lewis's activities, and is it a. fact ' that Lewis is going to head-quarters of the Comintern in Europe, as a direct representative of the Communist party of Australia? Will the Prime Minister give an assurance to this Parliament that, in view of the serious disclosures regarding Communist subversion, no Communists will be permitted to represent Australia at international gatherings? Will the Government cancel Lewis's credentials and passport forthwith?",18
63,Mr CHIFLEY,FLIGHT OF AIRCRAFT FKOM LAVERTON TO,The Minister for Postwar Reconstruction will answer the question.,18
64,Mr DEDMAN,FLIGHT OF AIRCRAFT FKOM LAVERTON TO,"The activities of Unesco in Australia come under my department. When the matter was raised in this House recently, I got in touch with the Director of Education, Professor Mills, and I have received from him the following telegram:Mr Mcdworth was recommended for membership of the delegation by the National Cooperating Body (Visual Arts) nnd by the co-ordinating committee of National Co-ordinating bodies. Mr Lewis was recommended for membership of the delegation by the Australian Teachers' Federation, which represents State, school teachers of all States except Queensland, a membership of 21,000. Both Mr Med worth and Mr Lewis are officers of the New Soutli Wales Department of Education. The Director General of Education, New South Wales, informs mc there is no information in the records of the department as to what political views are held by Mr Medworth or by Mr. Lewis, and there has never been any complaint raised to the department that they have attempted to introduce any political views into their work within the department. The Government has no information whatever as to whether either of these gentlemen belongs to the Communist party. The delegation was selected on the basis that there shall be a representative of the teachers' union, and the union has approved of Mr Lewis. The Department of Education in New South Wales will, I hope, agree to make him available for that purpose. The Australian Government will bear the cost of the delegation, which consists of five members, to the conference in Mexico City. Whether Mr Lewis or Mr Medworth will be able to visit other countries rests almost entirely with the Department of Education of New South Wales. If it grants them facilities and leave to visit other countries, that is the business of the department. It has nothing 10 do with this Government. The delegation has been chosen in the only democratic way possible.",18
65,Mr LANG,FLIGHT OF AIRCRAFT FKOM LAVERTON TO,But my question has not been answered.,18
66,Mr SPENDER,FLIGHT OF AIRCRAFT FKOM LAVERTON TO,What about dollars for the trip?,18
67,Mr SPEAKER,FLIGHT OF AIRCRAFT FKOM LAVERTON TO,"On a number of occasions, I have pointed out that an honourable member may, subject, to the Standing Orders, ask a question in any way he likes. In the same way, a Minister may reply in any wav he likes, provided he conforms with the Standing Orders. He may even refuse to answer the question at all.",18
68,Mr CHIFLEY,FLIGHT OF AIRCRAFT FKOM LAVERTON TO,Dollar s are being provided for the journey as far as Mexico City only NEWSPAPER OFFICES. BAN ON INSPECTION.,18
69,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,FLIGHT OF AIRCRAFT FKOM LAVERTON TO,"I have received a letter from the headmaster of a school at Kalangadoo in my electorate who states that he proposed to take the children on a visit to Adelaide, some miles away, and while there to give an opportunity to inspect the premises of the Advertiser newspaper office. letter was written to the office of newspaper asking for permission to spect the premises, and the following may be averted? reply was received:Respecting your letter of the 15th instant asking permission for children from your school to make a visit of inspection to view the printing of a paper and the running our plant. The ban which was imposed during the war period prohibiting parties from this operation has not yet been lifted, we are unable at this juncture to extend to your members the necessary invitation. Sliould, however, the restriction celled at a later date, we will be pleased grant the desired permission for a visit by pupils. Will the Prime Minister state what earthly good purpose is served by hibiting people from looking over a newsdoing paper plant?",18
70,Mr CHIFLEY,FLIGHT OF AIRCRAFT FKOM LAVERTON TO,"I was unaware of the existence of the ban to which the honour the able memher has referred. I have no be done expeditiously. knowledge of any regulation which might have prevented such a. visit being made. It is possible, however, that some wartime regulation remains which was taken advantage of by the newspaper to refuse the request. It would appear that the continuation of such a restriction, if one exists, is unjustified, and the necessary arrangements will be made to remove it. There may be another side to the matter.

If the statements are correct, will the right honourable gentleman indicate whether the Government has given consideration to the future of Manus Island in the light of these de",19
74,Mr CHIFLEY,FLIGHT OF AIRCRAFT FKOM LAVERTON TO,"I have seen certain statements regarding the reduction of the size of the British Fleet. I heard very briefly early this morning that Mr. Alexander had made a statement in the beHouse of Commons indicating that the press reports were incorrect. The Australian Government has had no official information from the British Government in respect of this matter? Manus Island has been discussed not only with makthe Government of the United States in regard to stores and supplies there, but also with the Defence Council. In addition, two Ministers have visited the island to examine the installations there. The general question as to whetherAustralia should accept some responsibility in regard to the maintenance of the installations at Manus Island has been discussed. Just how much can and will be done there I am not in a position at the moment to say. The honourable member may, however, rest assured that the matter is well in hand. WIDOWS' PENSIONS.",19
75,Mrs BLACKBURN,FLIGHT OF AIRCRAFT FKOM LAVERTON TO,"Unde r Social Services Consolidation Act the term "" widow "" seems to be fairly elastic in order' to achieve the humanitarian purposes of that legislation. With this in mind, will the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Social Ser : vices indicate whether, in his opinion, the Australian wives of Indonesians who have been detained in Australia and are still recognized as Australian citizens may be classed as widows under the Act? If so, can arrangements be made to have the widows' pension given to these women so that they can pay for rent and food during the time they must remain in this country ? If the existing requirements of the act will not allow this, is it in the power of the Minister to extend the provision in order to meet these special circumstances ? Has the Minister' discretionary power to enable him to do so?",20
76,Mr HOLLOWAY,FLIGHT OF AIRCRAFT FKOM LAVERTON TO,"I did not clearly understand the category of women referred to by the honourable member in the first part 'of her question. Power is vested in the Director-General of Social Services to treat all applications for widows' pensions on their merits. I feel sure that the women referred to by the honourable member will be treated just as sympathetically as are deserted wives of overseas ex-servicemen who, in comimon with deserted wives generally in Australia, are granted pensions, provided that their applications conform with the requirements of the act. Difficulties exist in some cases in defining the domicile of deserting husbands. The Director-General of Social Services has, however, been directed not to withhold payment of the widows' pension because of legal difficulties associated with the domicile of a deserting husband. I shall bring the honourable member's question to the notice of the Minister for Health and Social Services and furnish her with a full report. CORNSACKS.",20
77,Mr ABBOTT,FLIGHT OF AIRCRAFT FKOM LAVERTON TO,"Is it a fact that owing to the Government's failure to notify the farmers of Australia of vital information relating to the supply of cornsacks, namely, as to the quantity in stock in Australia, the number of bales on the water and the approximate dates of deliveries in Australia, the extent of the the orders placed in India and the approximate supply dates in respect of those orders, great confusion and dissatisfaction exists among the farming communities? Will the Minister for Oomimerce and Agriculture indicate whether it is a fact that he will not disclose this information because the position is so deplorable that he is afraid to do so?  to make a statement in the House at a very early date outlining^ every step taken in regard to providing adequate supplies of cornsacks and other means of handling the forthcoming wheat crop. PRIVILEGE. NA BROADCASTING COMMITTEE.",20
78,Mr HOLT,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"Fawkner) [11.30] - I have an urgent motion of privilege to submit to you, Mr Speaker, and to the House, in these termsTliat it is not a breach of privilege for an honourable member to discuss the decision of a statutory committee exercising an executive function"" when such a decision is not required by statute to be reported to the House. The motion is, I think honourable members will agree, one raising an important question of not only principle, but also practice affecting the conduct of the statutory committees functioning within the Parliament. Yesterday, in respect of a matter that had arisen, you read the following extract from May:By the ancient custom of Parliament ""no net done at any committee should be divulged before the same be reported to the House"" [ j ) . Upon this principle the Commons, on the'21st April. 1837, resolved, "" That the evidence taken by any select committee of this House, and the documents presented to such committee, and which have uot been reported to the House, ought' not to be published by any member of such committee or by any other person"". On that reading from May, you declared that .1.', acting as a member of a statutory committee, and disclosing the grounds upon which I had dissented from a decision of that committee, had been guilty of a breach of privilege. That is a serious charge to be levelled against any honourable member of this House, but my own personal position is not of so much importance as is the grave restriction that a ruling of that kind would place upon the operations of many parliamentary committees, which cannot be compared in their functions with the select committees of the House of Commons, on whose practice you, Mr Speaker, drew in making that ruling. I direct the attention of the Parliament to the specific terms of the statute under which the Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings Committee has been appointed. In 1946, the Parliament passed the Parliamentary Proceedings Broadcasting Act, and, by section 14 of that act, the Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings Committee is given power- I emphasize the word "" power ""-to determine the conditions in accordance with which a rebroadcast may be made. The full text of the section is as follows:14 - (1.) The Committee shall have power to determine the conditions in accordance with, which a re-broadcast may be made tion of the proceedings of either House of the Parliament. (2.) No re-broadcast shall be made of any portion of the proceedings of either House the Parliament otherwise than in with the conditions so determined. Honourable members will see that the mittee is not required to make a finding, report that finding to the Parliament then await the action of the Parliament in respect of its finding. The committee me. is given the express power, in fact the responsibility is thrown upon it, of determining the conditions under which re-broadcast shall be made. So there is with him. no occasion under either that section o:r any other part of the act for the mittee to report to the House the decision that it makes. I allude to recent events and the decision that the committee The question arose as to whether proceedings in this place, which had occurred in the time normally devoted to the asking of questions and the giving, of ministerial answers, should be rebroadcast. That was a question of the type that the committee was charged, with the responsibility of determining, and Mr Speaker very properly called the committee together to give a decision on that matter. A discussion took place and a decision was given. Far from any report being required from the committee to the Parliament before action could be taken, both in the express terms of the act and in fact, action was taken immediately upon the decision that the committee gave, and Mr Speaker, as chairman of the committee, put in train the action that the committee had taken. He, as a member of the committee and without any express direction from the committee, but presumably exercising his rights as a. member of the committee,, which had reached a decision and proceeded to implement it, made a statement to the press. The statement appeared in at least two newspapers.",20

83,Mr SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,That is totally untrue. I assure the honourable member of of that before he goes any farther; but he accordance can proceed if he likes.,21

88,Mr SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,That is totally untrue. The only statement that I verified was the apology in the Sydney Daily Telegraph.,22

Is it competent for you, as Speaker, when a matter affecting your own interests, or the discharge of your duties, is being debated, to interrupt ? Is not your proper function to reply at the end of the speech and not interrupt the speech ?",22

95,Mr HOLT,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"Are you ruling my motion out of order? - Mr SPEAKER - Yes , as not being a question of privilege. It is not a direct question of privilege. Further, it is an abstract motion that should be put on the notice-paper for debate at some other time.",22

99,Mr SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,This is one motion of dissent on which I will speak.,22
100,Mr HOLT,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,But you will not allow any one else to speak.,22
101,Mr SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"In accordance with the Standing Orders, the debate on the honourable member's motion will be adjourned until tomorrow.

102,Mr ANTHONY,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"Mr Speaker, I have taken a point of order. I asked for a ruling from you as to the functions of Mr Speaker in debate. You did not reply to it. You simply ordered the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr. Holt) to resume his seat. I now ask you for a ruling on my point of order.",22
103,Mr SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"The honourable member again intervenes. Very often he does so and gets his colleagues into trouble. When the honourable member for Fawkner made charges against Mr Speaker, Mr. Speaker corrected him because he did not want him to be misled and be responsible for something that he could not prove. If anything, I was trying to help the honourable gentleman. I had been considering all along whether or not his motion was in order. Now that he has raised the question I will repeat it. I ask honourable members to notice the wording of the question: "" That it is not a breach of privilege for an honourable member to discuss ""-no t divulge- "" decision of a statutory committee exercising an executive function when such decision is not required by statute to be reported to the House "". In my view, that is not a motion of privilege, but a question of - which notice should be given in the proper way. The Chair was very tolerant. It allowed, in my view, too much tolerance. The Chair has always the right to determine whether or not privilege is involved. I have decided that it is not. I have ruled the honourable gentleman's motion out of order, and the honourable member for Richmond has not been helpful to him. BANKI NG BILL 1947. SECOND READIN G. Debate resumed from the 23rd October (vide page 1305), on motion by Mr. CHIFLEYThat the bill be now read a second time.",22
104,Mr WILLIAMS,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"Robertson) [11.39]. - Undoubtedly , this bill is creating great interest in the minds of the has what have been described people of Australia. The exagger- "" ated nature of the advertisements of the private hanks in their campaign against the bill, and the inflammatory speeches which are being made in the electorates in opposition to it , have siderably alarmed some of the people, are inclined to accept as true what they hear alleged against the Labour party, and what they read in the newspapers. The tends to pursue. founders of the Commonwealth Constitution were wise men. Surely they did not write into the Constitution powers which tliey thought the Parliament of the Coma monwealth would never use. Some people assert that the Government is acting I wrongly, and has no power to nationalize banking and that, in any event, it should ascertain the views of the people, hy way of referendum, before it proceeds with this legislation. W it h those views, not agree. It is the duty of a government to lead the people, and to carry out ageously without fear or favour the policy which it considers will be beneficial to great majority of the people. The vernment must also stand up to any person people of Australia. or group of persons who exercise power against, the people's welfare, and ensure that ordinary justice and economic fare shall be maintained in the country. Regarding the referendum, which Opposition contends the Government a private bank? should hold, I remind the House when the Commonwealth Bank B i l before this Parliament in 1912, opposition to the measure then was just as fierce strong as it is today. Had a referendum then been held to determine whether government of the day should proceed with the Commonwealth Bank Bill , proposal would have been defeated, and Australia now would be without the great Commonwealth Bank that has done so them much to assist, in the development of our country. ' Now, the Parliament of the Commonwealth has no special power legislate with respect to the maintenance of full employment, and no direct powei to legislate with respect to the economic prosperity and welfare of the people Australia. The State governments are the ordinary governments of the country. The Parliament of the Commonwealth has power for particular purposes. It as enumerated "" or "" selected "" legislative powers. The High Court, which is regarded as the guardian of our Constitution, has held that there is no legal obstacle to the Government using the conCommonwealth Bank as a means of aiding who - government policy with respect to employment and economic conditions. This is the policy which this Government in The Government has steered Australia through the troubled times of war. It is a great thing to w in a war, but it is disastrous thing to lose the peace. The Government has brought victory in arms. t must now protect all the people against disaster in time of peace. The war has made, not only great changes in a physical sense, but also changes in the minds of men. In the few years since the outI canbreak of World War II . , we have been thrust forward many decades. This Gocourvernment has sacred obligations. For instance, it has a sacred obligation to use the all its powers, to make a better country Goand a better way of lif e for the In all these discussions, the one word which haunts the minds of many people is "" security "" wel- - securit y against want and old-age, security for wives and children, security in employment ancl in the home. Wha't the security can any one obtain from Bank loans are that repayable on demand, and interest l was charges and conditions of lending are on a "" take it or leave it "" and basis. But a wise government can give to the people security by a proper directhe tion to the Commonwealth Bank-the people's bank. By the judicious use of the the credit of the country, we can encourage and maintain full employment, assist people to buy their homes by advancing money at a very low rate of interest, and help the States to develop education, and build and maintain hospitals. The to privilege of taking possession of the people's money ancl having the power to use it for private gain has always seemed to rue to be a privilege so great that it of should not pass from the government of any country. In addition, the accumulation in one private bank of the deposits of thousands of people, who have no voice in determining its policy, becomes great that it lends itself to abuse. I refer honourable members in this conlie. nexion to the following statement which appears on page 197 of the report of Royal Commission on Monetary and Banking Systems:A decrease in the supply of money results in some people having less ability to buy jjoods and services than they had before. They Are forced to spend less, which results in a reduction of the incomes of the people from whom they usually purchase. This lessened demand is thus transmitted through the community, nnd results in some restriction of the total volume of 'production, and in some unemployment of men and resources. An increase in the supply of money results' in some people having greater ability to buy goods and services. If these people spend tlieir increased incomes, the increased demand for goods is transmitted through the community. So long as unemployed men and resources are available, the increased demand - for goods will result in some increase duction, with some consequent increase in the - employment of men and resources. An investor has no say and no influence on policy or conduct of the private trading banks, but such an investor will, as ,an elector, have some influence on the policy of a government bank. should we tolerate a position which allows the strong hands of private financiers to control and regulate the business of the country by retarding or loosening credit and thereby becoming a power greater than the Government itself? Those who mind the people's money should so conduct themselves that their every action is Ln the public interest. We therefore maintain that the Government has not only a right but also a duty to assume control of the private banks of this country. Let us see how that is to be done and whether any injustice will result to anybody, or whether anybody will be placed under any disability as the result of the assumption of the control of the trading banks by the Commonwealth. The average citizen will not be adversely affected in any way. He will still be able to go to the branch of the bank with which he has been dealing and consult its staff and manager. The bank building, the bank staff and the bank procedure will be maintained as in the past. All procedure with which the client is familiar will be - maintained for years. Any change will Mr Williams. be effected in a gradual manner and so banking facilities that now exist will continue to be available. The aim will to improve banking facilities for the people. In this connection, I quote the the following observations by the Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) in his second reading speech:I would emphasize that under this measure there will be no interruption or disturbance of the usual banking facilities available to the Australian community. The bill provides that the private banks shall maintain their services until they are taken over by the Commonwealth Bank. As the banks are taker, over, either through the acquisition of their shares or of their assets, they will be kept in operation as going concerns.' Customers will not notice any difference after the control of the bank with which they have been dealing has passed to the Commonwealth Bank. They will be able to continue their banking business without change or interruption. The Commonwealth Bank will be exof pro- panded and its methods improved. Any retarding influences will be cut away. Local bank managers will be empowered to act quickly and on their own initiative. In short, anything that the managers of the private banks can do now, the managers of the branches of the CommonWhy wealth Bank will be empowered to do. The managers of the private banks, as a matter of fact, will still be in their places. They will still be able to see their clients and carry on their business as they do now. Prompt financial accommodation will be available. It has been said that the freedom of the people will be lost under this legislation. I disagree with that statement. Of course, we all are aware that all reforms and all laws must affect somebody. When we curb free action by the trading banks to batten upon the public we stop the individual from running from one private bank to another; but the banks will continue to function as they do now. We should remember, too, that State banks will continue to function. Long ago governments began taking away the freedom of the people in one respect or another. Every one today has to go to a government post office or to travel on a government railway. All this talk of loss of freedom in relation to banking has been much exaggerated, and it will not bear examination. It has also been said by those who are opposed to this measure that a government 'bank will expose all business transactions to government departments. But the Commonwealth Bank is today just as strict in guarding and protecting the interests of its clients as are the private banks, and in the future business transactions will be just as carefully protected. In this regard I direct the attention of honourable members to clause 11 of the bill, which readsIt will be the duty of the Commonwealth Bank(e) to observe, except ns otherwise required liy law, the practices and usages customary among bankers and, in particular, not to divulge any information relating to, or to the affairs of, a customer of the Commonwealth Bank except in circumstances in which it is, in accordtion ance with law or the practices and usages customary among bankers, necessary or proper for the Commonwealth .Bank to divulge that information. In regard to the divulging of information, it must be remembered that private banks are required, under existing conditions, to divulge information in certain circumstances. They may be required to - divulge information to a conrt of law, or, in proper circumstances, to the Commissioner of Taxation. The Commonwealth Bank, under this legislation, will divulge information only in accordance with the law. By and large, it is an established legal principle that there is a contractual - obligation existing between a bank and its customers. Honourable members may rest assured, as may the general public, that the Commonwealth Bank will act strictly in accordance with the law in this regard. The bill provides that it shall be imperative for the Commonwealth Bank to treat as strictly confidential the affairs of its customers. It has been .argued that the Commonwealth Bank .authorities may act in a slow and tedious manner, as it is said that certain government departments act, and that prompt financial accommodation will not be available to customers. I can only repeat that the staffs of the private banksw ill still be retained' in their employment, .at the same work and they will still follow the same banking practice as hitherto. Surely it will not be suggested that these efficient officers will' change their attitude to their clients for the purpose of sabotaging the people's bank. The officers of the private banks will be maintained in their jobs, and will be full y protected in respect of all their rights. In fact it seems obvious that their positions will be improved. The bank employees are safeguarded in the bill against any worsening of their conditions, and they will gain all the added advantages of the Commonwealth Bank service. Provision is made in the bill for the appointment of committees to ascertain the terms and conditions of ' employment. Subclause 4 of clause 47 of the bill readsWhere the committee finds that, under any of the terms and conditions of employment nf a person as so ascertained, a benefit is, in accordance with the practice of the private bank concerned, or of the trustees, managers or administrators of a provident or superannuafund of that private bank, a benefit which is, or would have been, granted but that there is no legally enforceable right to that benefit, those terms and conditions of employment of that person shall, for the purposes of this Part, be deemed to include a legally enforceable right to that benefit. The bill provides that they shall now have those matters legally guaranteed to them. In that regard, the officers of private banks could not be worse off, and in all probability, will be far better off than they are now. It has been alleged, too, that this measure is favoured by the Communists, and that it is an attack upon the right of private ownership, for which reason it should he shunned by all right-thinking people. It is said that we are the dupes of the' Communists, arid are only doing their work. That, we deny. No political patty has fought the Communists so hard as has the Labour party. At election time, we are opposed by the Communists. Because the Communists also believe that the nationalization of banking is right, that does not prove that it is bad for the nation. The Communists believed that we should fight nazi Germany. Does any honourable member opposite suggest that on that account we should have discontinued the struggle against Germany? That the Communists also believe in the nationalization of banking is quite beside the point, and has no relevancy. It' has been said' that the bill is an attack on the right of private ownership. It is not On the contrary, it .provides that the right, privilege and power of hanking shall reside with the people, and not with small, powerful groups. Let us see how private banking interlocks with powerful business groups and monopolies. I could refer to the directors pf all banks, and their connection with other companies in the business community, but I shall content myself with a reference to one or two. Mr E. R, Knox, chairman of the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney Limited, is also a director of Colonial Sugar Refining Company Limited, United Insurance Company Limited and Perpetual Trustee Company. M i . Orwell Phillips, vice-chairman of the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney Limited, is also a director of Tooth and Company Limited, North Coast Steam Navigation Company Limited and United Insurance Company Limited. Mr E. W. Fairfax, a director of the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney Limited, is also a director of Colonial Sugar Refining Company Limited, and John Fairfax and Sons Proprietary Limited. Take, now, some of the directors of English, Scottish and Australian Bank Limited. Lord Aldenham is a partner in Antony Gibbs and Sons, bankers, deputy chairman of Westminster Bank, chairi man of Australian Pastoral Company, a income director of Commercial Union Assurance ably Company Limited, English, Scottish and Australian Bank Limited, and other - profits, companies. Sir Clive Baillieu is a director of English, Scottish and Aus10 tralian Bank Limited, Dunlop Rubber exchange Australia Limited, Imperial Smelting Company Limited, Zinc Corporation, the Midland Bank, Trinidad Leaseholds, &c. lossthemselves Sir George Schuster is a director of further Westminster Bank, Westminster Foreign is Bank, Commercial Union Assurance levied Company Limited, Southern Railway leave Company, English, Scottish and AusPublic tralian Bank Limited, Bank of New Zeasions land, New Zealand Loan and Mercantile Agency Company Limited and East ing India Coal Company, as well as chairthe to man of Allied Supplies and Home and be Colonial Stores. One could continue indefinitely reciting the names of direcgentleman tors of banks, and showing their conreduction nexion with other companies. Afr. Williams. obvious that the Australian trading banks are completely interlocked with all the great capitalist institutions in the country. That adds to their tremendous power. We are not holding against these gentlemen that they have been so successful as to become directors of banks or insurance companies. I mention the matter merely in-order to show the real power which they wield and the influence that they have on economic conditions in this country. Public ownership of banks will strike a blow for the rights of the average citizen. It will give him a share in the huge profits of the banks, as well as in the privilege of banking. It will free him from the grip of the financial barons and international financiers. We are not taking away the freedom of the people, as has been suggested by some persons who are addressing meetings in the electorates, but are adding to it. For too long have the private banks dictated the policy. of governments in this country. Let us consider what happened when Australia was "" on its knees"" in 1931. Sir Alfred Davidson, general manager of the Bank of New South Wales, then laid down policy for the guidance of the governments of that day. This is what he saidAs a first stop towards economic recovery t is recognized that the loss of national should be spread as widely and equitas possible. The loss in the national income has, up to the present, been borne by the primary .producers, the recipients of the unemployed and incomes from rent and interest in the degree by which they have been reduced or forgone. The reduction of per cent, in real wages and the increase in rates have already spread the loss more evenly throughout the country, and when full effects of these measures have worked out, the process of spreading the will have been nearly completed. A measure working in the same direction the increased tax on incomes from property in the last budget. The net effect is to one group of incomes only unaffected by the national crisis. These are incomes to Service officials and recipients of penand other allowances from the Commonwealth Government. Unless reductions are made in these payments on a scale correspondthe fall in national income, members of community in receipt of such incomes will placed in a specially privileged class. Honourable members will recall that that succeeded in having effected a of pensions, allowances, Public It is Service salaries and so forth. We must remember that the Commonweal tb Bank bas bad remarkable success, and bas financed Australia in two wars, notwithstanding that it has been hamstrung by the policy of conservative governments. When established, it was under the control of a governor. But in 1924 the Bruce-Page Government set up a bank board, without a mandate from the people, and appointed to it influential men who were interested in many concerns that were allied with the private trading banks. In that way, the Commonwealth Bank was "" throttled back "" ancl sabotaged. As a matter of fact, matters became so confused that the effect was that the trading banks, through their friends on the Commonwealth Bank Board, dictated the financial policy of the government of the day. Eeference has previously been made to a letter that was written by Sir Robert Gibson, chairman of the Commonwealth Bank Board at the time, to' Mr Theodore, then Treasurer of the Commonwealth. I shall omit from it those parts which I consider it is not necessary to read. He saidSubject to adequate and equitable reductions in all wages, salaries, and allowances, pensions, social benefits of all kinds, interest and other factors which affect the cost of living, the Commonwealth Bank Board will actively co-operate with the trading banks and the Government of Australia in sustaining industry and restoring employment. So we see that the Chairman of the Commonwealth Bank Board at that time was lining up with the trading banks of thi;. country and telling the Australian Government, which had been elected by the people, what financial policy it should adopt. For the most part, the private trading banks are controlled by shrewd, hard financial heads, who are actuated by the selfish instinct of making their companies pay the highest dividends. In the conduct of their business, they have no particular concern for the general state of the nation. We consider that thi-; great privilege and power which the banks have to exorcise so much influence on tha economic conditions of the country should be in the bands not of private men but of the Government, in order that the people may be protected. When we consider some of the conditions that existed in this country up to World War II , we must admit that they were a disgrace to all ' governments. Poverty, want, fear, slum.« and malnutrition are conditions of which we have no reason to be proud. It would be difficult to recall one law for which - honourable gentlemen opposite have been responsible that has made any marked difference on the course of this nation's history. The need for post-war reform, in my opinion, is so manifest that it must not be too long delayed. Prosperity is now at full tide. Some honourable members consider that, for that reason, we should adopt the philosophy of doing nothing. But we on this side of the Houst are political realists. We realise the wisdom of improving the economic system, by destroying the abuses that have crepi into it . Australia is fortunate indeed in having a Prime Minister and governmeni with the courage to do the right thing, even though that means forcing on ourselves a conflict with the most powerful influences in Australia today.",23
105,Mr WHITE,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"Balaclava) [12.15] - I i appears that the mild-mannered honourable member for Robertson (Mr . Williams) was put up to speak so that it may be thought that the bill is. an innocuous affair. Indeed, he seems to have deluded himself into that belief. He told us how much better off the employees of trading banks would be when they were transferred to the Commonwealth Bank, and how the customers would not know the difference after the trading banks had been nationalized. He sought to convey the impression that the Commonwealth Bank would be a kind of home away from home-that the Government was providing, in effect, the modern equivalent of the bread and circuses with which the Roman emperors sought to propitiate the people of Rome in the declining days of the empire. Unfortunately for the argument of the honourable member, I have here a resolution passed by the United Bank Officers Guild, which saysWe resent being turned into a mob of civil servants, run on red tape and a book of rules, simply to be pushed around by a Prime Minister bent on a socialization plan. . The honourable member referred to - the great success which had been achieved by the Commonwealth Bank. The Commonwealth Bank is a central bank, and there should be such an institution in every country. It should be given control over certain aspects of a nation's currency and credit, and the Commonwealth Bank has already been given all the control needed in any civilized community. Under this bill, however, the private banks are to be liquidated. What is the record of success of the Commonwealth Bank as compared with the trading banks? In his second-reading speech on the bill, the Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) made a mistake to which reference was drawn by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies). The Prime Minister saidTogether with its associated institution, Commonwealth .Savings Bank, it has pre-eminently the bank for the average and woman. To-day it has a far greater number of depositors than the whole of the private banks taken together. At the end of this year the number of deposit accounts the Commonwealth Bank and theCommonference wealth Savings Bank was about 3,S0O,00O, wherens the number of deposit accounts with the trading banks was I..250.000. That statement, made in the Parliament, ancl broadcast to the country, deliberately intended to mislead the doUnder people. The Prime Minister knows very well that the trading banks do not savings bank departments. If we subtract the number of savings bank accounts held by the Commonwealth Bank we find that the number of trading accounts which it has is only 223,000, and among the total of accounts is included all those which were taken over from the New South Wales Savings Bank. No doubt, the Commonwealth Bank will also take over the Government Savings Bank in Victoria, if the Government wins out. This bill, designed to destroy our mercial banking system which for generations has been essential to our economy, is a major instalment of State socialism. This is actual national socialism, on the Nazi model, ancl of a kind never previously inflicted upon any English-speaking people. Hitler originbelieve ally called his party the National Socialist Labour party, which stood for the centralization of all power. In the same way, this Government deaf ear. proposes to centralize all power in Canberra. Power should be decentralized, particularly in the case of banking that the local bank manager may be the friend of the farmer, and his adviser and helper in time of trouble. Socialists Ur. White. our midst may approve of this action by a government with no mandate for such a policy, but the spontaneous upsurge of democratic feeling shows that the people as a whole will not be flouted. I propose to quote the opinion of the deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand, a man with some honour in his own country, Mr. Walter Nash, who is a Labour man, and the Treasurer in the Government of New Zealand. This is what he saidThere has been some argument in our party about taking over the trading banks. Perthe sonally, I think these banks are doing a become better job than we can make of it. man The Bank of New Zealand is a national bank, and is necessary for the economy of April the country. The views stated by Mr. with Nash, when speaking at a Labour conagainst the proposal for the nationalization of the trading banks, are approximately interestingUnder the present system customers who are dissatisfied with one bank can take their was business to another bank. this. a State-owned system they could not have That should be obvious. There is an association among the trading banks, but no monopoly, yet the Prime Minister advanced the specious argument that the private banks tended to become a monopoly, and therefore should be abolished. There have been socialist signs and portents by the Government for a considerable time. Although we sought to have a referendum taken on this vital proposal, it has been refused. We moved a vote of no confidence in the Governcomment, but the debate was "" gagged "". Honourable members have received scores of petitions bearing many thousands of names protesting against the nationalization of banks. They have also received thousands of letters and hundreds of telegrams to the same effect from people who that the nationalization of banking would constitute an affront to the democratic way of life. To all such protests, however, the Government has turned a I have received letters from farmers telling me, that in time of so drought, one of the trading banks hascome to their help with a timely overdraft. In other instances, bank managers in had tendered valuable advice. I propose to quote the opinion of Archdeacon O'Donnell on this issue. Honourable members opposite may claim that this is an attempt to raise the sectarian issue, but it has already been raised and I maintain that, in a crisis of this kind which affects the fundamental liberties - of the people, every one is called upon to state where he stands. The archdeacon said that.if Senator MCKenna, the Prime Minister's right-hand man, could prevail iiipon the honourable member for Denison (Dr Gaha) to make way, he would contest the seat on this issue against Senator MCKenna, but so far the challenge has not been taken up. Speaking in Hobart in August of this year Archdeacon O'Donnell saidNationalization of the trading banks, to Communists, is a great gift . . . It would injure many business firms. It would be .the first step towards making Australia a totalitarian State, and its people slaves. There has undoubtedly been a trend towards socialism, and how could it be otherwise? The honourable member for Robertson remarked with unction that the Labour Government had guided Australia through the war. It is, he said, a great thing to win a war. really believe that the Government thinks that it had something to do with winning the war, rather than that victory was achieved by the strong arms of our fighting men, and by our association with a great Empire. However, it was necessarily a total war, and so the Government assumed control over practically all activities in the country. Now, Ministers have become power-crazed, and will not relinquish their power over the people. It is only necessary to recall how the Government has acquired city property, and evicted the tenants. The Department of Civil Aviation has turned people out of Henty House.",27
106,Mr ACTING DEPUTYSPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS, The honourable member is getting away from the subject-matter of the bill.,29
107,Mr WHITE,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"I am speaking of the steps which have been taken by the Australian National Airlines Commission, which, has had £4,500,000 allotted to it",29
108,Mr ACTING DEPUTYSPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS," - Order ! The scope of the Banking Bill is sufficiently wide to enable honourable members to discuss it for the full length of their speeches without introducing extraneous matter. The Chair does not intend to allow a discussion on the airlines, or on evictions from city property.",29
109,Mr WHITE,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"Ver y well, I will not touch upon the other socialistic tendencies of"" the Government. Perhaps they are too well known to the people already, and everybody has been affected in some way. The introduction of this bill is a vital step, and bears every mark of the true totalitarian technique. The Government's proposal amounts to economic and industrial conscription. It does not merely affect shareholders in the trading banks. the Their shares will be acquired, and if they go quietly the Government will reward them with remissions of taxation. Otherwise, their shares will be taken in any case, and paid for, perhaps, with inflated currency. In April, 1917, Lenin made this statementWe are all agreed that the first step towards communism must be such measures as the nationalization of banks-on e State bank, as huge as possible. That is already nine-tenths I of the socialist apparatus. I have already referred to what will happen to the employees of the trading banks. They are uneasy in the knowledge that they are to become public servants. However, the Government's proposals affect every person in the community. Some people may think that they are safe because they have no account with a trading bank, but .wage earners may be affected if a government monopoly bank refuses to advance to an employer sufficient money to pay wages on Friday night, merely because the employer is not - persona grata with the manager of the local branch, or because pressure is brought to bear by a trade union to declare his business black. It seems to me that the only industry which can be expected to thrive under the proposed system is the form-filling industry. Apart from that, the change will produce only frustration with people standing in queues, and the general - fruits of totalitarian methods of government. This springs from the foul Communist creed which originated in the mind of Marx when he tried to improve on socialism. The followers of Marx believe in perpetual revolution, and in playing down to the worse instincts of men. The Government is playing tlieir game, and how it will all finish we can well imagine. It all fits in with the Fascist conception of the State as expressed' by one whose name is well known to all of usThe Fascist conception of the State embracing; outside of it no spiritual or human values can exist, much less have value. That statement was made hy Mussolini, who held that the individual existed for the State, and the mild-mannered member for Robertson said practically the same thing. I prefer the philosophy of Abraham Lincoln, who, when urging the people of his country to finish the work which was begun by the soldiers who died in the battle of Gettysburg, asked them so to direct their efforts that "" government of the people, by the people, for the people should not perish from the earth "". Lincoln's papers were put aside at the date of his assassination in 1864 and, by his instruction, were not opened until 1947. After his papers had been opened this year his son gave this statement to the world, a statement that we should cherish as a dictum for all time, and it has particular reference to this billThe legitimate object of government for n community of people whatever they need to have done but cannot do at allor cannot so well do for themselves in their separate and individual capacities. In all that the people can individually do for themselves, government ought not to interfere.",29
110,Mr HAYLEN,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"""Why does not the honourable member quote Lincoln on banking?",30
111,Mr WHITE,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"Lincol n stood for freedom and was bitterly opposed to people who, like the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Haylen), were only too willing to become the submissive slaves of communism and its twin brother, socialism. The so-called Australian Communists, the servants of Russia, the profiteers in discord and traitors to their native land, support the Government's proposal. The Communist Workers' Voice, as far back as the 10th August, 1934, revealed the revolutionary activities of the fifth column conspirators in a two-page seditious manifesto headed in big letters with the slogan, "" Raise higher the banner of Lenin and Stalin for a Soviet Australia "". The means by which nationalization was to be achieved wereset out as follows: The first acts of such a revolutionary government would be to immediately proceed to expropriate without compensation all banks, insurance companies, large enterprises, railways, big departmental stores, and convert them into socialist property. .is allThat was followed by"" this treasonable declarationTo conclude a fraternal alliance with theSoviet Union and Soviet China, arm all toilers and create a mighty revoluntionary Red army.. These were the aims of men in Australia, who are the allies of the Government today. Honourable members opposite say pitifully, "" These men opposed me at the elections"", knowing full well that the Communists had no chance of winning seats in this Parliament. The Communists are members of a minority party in Australia, just as they are in every other country; but they acquire power because of their revolutionary activities",30
112,Mr DALY,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,That is not so.,30
113,Mr WHITE,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"As the honourable member for Martin (Mr Daly) knows, in New South Wales, something like twenty unions are dominated by Communist union leaders who call the tune at union is to do meetings. Questions were asked only today about the expenses of Communists going abroad being paid by the Government, and Ministers agreed that that was so. The Government has no mandate to introduce this measure. It is true that nationalization is included in the platform of the Labour party, the objective of that party being stated to be the nationalization of the means of production, distribution and exchange. We all recall that momentous conference in 1921, which was presided over by the right honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin), who later became Prime Minister, in which the party laid down its platform as including the socialization of all sources of production, the nationalization of banking and of all the principal industries. At that conference were some members of the Labour party who are now in the Cabinet. I instance the Minister for Air (Mr Drakeford) and the fact that he was a signatory of the infamous manifesto that was issued from the conference. Also present as chairman was the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr Holloway) who told us recently how Ohristian communism was and who has been the grand appeaser in labour problems throughout the years, giving way inch by inch to the demands of his Communist friends. Sitting alongside him as secretary of the conference was his aide-de-camp, "" Jock"" Garden, who today occupies an office in the Commonwealth Bank in Sydney as the aide and liaison officer of the Minister for Labour and National Service. But, although, nationalization has been included in the platform of the Labour party since 1921, it has never been a part of the party's policy. It is idle for the Prime Minister - to say that it is. To prove that it has never been part of the party's policy, I quote the essential words of the policy speeches made by labour leaders throughout the years. In 1911, Mr Fisher saidThe Commonwealth Bank was not to displace, but to compete with private banks. In 1931, the r i g h t honourable member for Y a r r a (Mr S c u l l in ) saidThe Commonwealth Bank was intended to be a trading institution, and to operate freely in competition with the private trading banks. Again, in 1934, the right honourable ber for Yarra saidThe bank will be free to enter upon a of vigorous competition with the private banks. The honourable member for Bobertson spoke of a letter from Sir Robert Gibson, chairman of the Commonwealth Bank structure Board, in which Sir Robert recommended try. the making of certain "" cuts "" in expendilie ture, both governmental and private. After that proposal had been accepted method by the Labour Government, the then bank Prime Minister, the right honourable bank member for Yarra, re-appointed Sir Robert Gibson to his post as Chairman of the Commonwealth Bank Board for a further period of seven years. present Prime Minister, as a Minister in the Scullin Government, also agreed to zation the Premiers plan, which is so trenThe chantly criticized today. In 1943, the late Mr Curtin saidThe Labour party will not socialize any industry during the war. The present Prime Minister, speaking on the Commonwealth Bank Bill of 1945, saidThe Government is also convinced that active competition by the Commonwealth Bank with the trading banks and other financial institutions will ensure that these services shall be supplied to the people of Australia adequately and cheaply. When introducing the Banking Bill of 1945, which now effectively controls banking, the right honourable gentleman saidThe bills which have been brought do%vn are designed to adapt the banking system . . . to provide the Commonwealth Bank, as leader of the banking system, with adequate powers to serve the national interest. Why, then, is the right honourable gentleman now seeking these confiscatory powers? Speaking as a member of the Royal Commission on Monetary and Banking Systems, which sat during the depression, the right honourable gentleman saidTliere is no justification for the view that the trading banks, in order to enlarge their profits, deliberately expanded credit to produce a boom and then contracted so as to produce a depression. What hypocrisy has been demonstrated in the Parliament by Labour members in their attempts to foist upon the country memthis confiscatory measure! I come now to a statement made by the Minister for policy Post-war Reconstruction (Mr Dedman). I feel sure that the electors of Corio will not be pleased at his subsequent change of face. The honourable gentleman said I turn now to what I consider to be the of the hanking system in this counI consider that it ought to have at its apex a central bank, under which there should functioning the various banks that undertake trading activities. The alternative would be, of course, to have only one undertaking the activities of the central and monopolizing the whole field of trading banks as well.",30
114,Mr DEDMAN,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"He a r , hear!",31
115,Mr WHITE,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"But listen to w h at the The honourable gentleman the n saidThat could perhaps he described as nationalior socialization of the banking system. Government has not selected that system, but proposes an alternative which it thinks is better fitted to this country.",31
116,Mr DEDMAN,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,The Government at that time selected the alternative.,31
117,Mr WHITE,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"No sooner had the honourable gentleman returned from his so called activities at Geneva than he gave a press interview in which he saidCertainly the Government could do banking 'inoro efficiently than the major banks. The honourable gentleman, who is custodian of the long-haired hoys who advise the Government, said that the Government could take over the hanks and run them with 5,000 fewer clerks.",32
118,Mr DEDMAN,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,I have denied that.,32
119,Mr WHITE,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"-He must have got into a serious row with his chief over that. That attitude might explain why there are to be found, dotted all over the Commonwealth, employment offices and staffs, involving a pay-roll amounting to more than £500,000 per annum! viously, these officials are waiting for the grand time when conscription of labour again comes into force. I propose to quote the Minister again, because his words provide very much better arguments for the Opposition than they do for the Government. At the recent by-election at Collingwood, in Victoria, the honourable gentleman, changing his political .coat from the one he wore two years before, saidNationalization of banking will control money in all forms. The working man will know what that means very shortly! Something has been said during this debate about secrecy and the inviolability of the private affairs of the customers of the banks. At the commencement of his second-reading speech on the bill the Prime Minister saidIt will be the responsibility of the Commonwealth Bank under this legislation(o) to observe, except as otherwise required 1-y law, the practices usages customary among bankers and, in particular, to maintain strict secrecy within the law the affairs and dealings with its customers. It has been contended that the customers will not notice the change, that there will be no Gestapo business in the Government's nationalization plans. However, when the banking bill was brought down in 1945, the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction (Mr Dedman) was reported in this wayThere has come into my possession a communication which throws some light on the Sound Finance League, namely, an extract from a letter sent by the manager of one of the trading banks to his chairman of directors in England.",32
120,Sir FREDERICK STEWAKT,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,Did the honourable gentleman obtain that document as the result of the exercise of censorship.,32
121,Mr DEDMAN,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"This document came into my possession quite legitimately, and not through the censorship. It reads"" My idea is that something in the nature of an expanded ' Sound Finance Leaguewith a properly equipped staff, including a competent publicist and economist of note, should be heavily subsidized by the banks. This body would publish articles and broadcast them, through the press everywhere, by radio, &c. It would enter into any controversy, Obnewspaper or otherwise, and by extensive propaganda endeavour to educate public opinion."" He went on to explain that this bank manager",32
122,Mr DEDMAN,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,I invite the honourable member to read on.,32
123,Mr WHITE,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"Not with s t and in g that to do so will take up some of my valuable time, I accept the honourable gentleman's invitation. The Minister said this was what the bank manager had written to his chairman of directors in EnglandThe idea is that it should be purely in the national interests-ou r selfish interest is interlocked with this. The cost may be £20,000 or £30,000 a year, or even more, but spread among the banks that is nothing if it means our survival as independent trading banks. If they used their organization for advertising on the radio and in other ways they were perfectly within their rights in doing so. The Minister invites me to read on, as he knows there is mention of himselfI t is noteworthy that the most outspoken attacks on the banks were made by Dedman, who has made some study of economics and and finance. He should not be underestimated. I knew that bank manager, because he as to happened to be a neighbour of mine. He told me that he had dictated the letter to his typist, and that no one but himself and the typist knew of its contents. He posted it himself. Yet, strangely enough, it came into the hands of the Minister. It is obvious that the correspondence of the private banks was being scrutinized,. even in 1945. We can easily foresee what will happen to the accounts of thousands of people who will be forced to bank with the Government monopoly bank. One has only to consider the type of men who were selected by this Government for appointment as conciliation commissioners recently to visualize what will happen should this iniquitous proposal be given effect. In my view, of all the new appointees, only one impartial conciliation commissioner was appointed, namely, Brigadier Blackburn, V.C. All the others were men who have paid tribute to this Communist-socialist Government. As soon as the Government takes over the affairs of the private banks the Gestapo will begin their work in earnest. The people of V ictoria are the only ones who can pass judgment on this infamous proposal, which is being bludgeoned through the Parliament. They should defy this legislation by all the means within their power, and show their contempt for such perfidious collaborators as the Prime Minister and the Premier of Victoria, Mr Cain, and all the chicanery that has been associated with this proposal. Labour candidates will be defeated at the Victorian election, and the new Victorian Government will be able to establish State trading hanks if it chooses to do so. Victoria must be the bastion in the fight and make an example of this Government. What is to be the effect of this legislation? It is untrue that the private banks have been monopolistic. The Minister for Air used that allegation as justification for the establishment of a government-owned airline, unfortunately with success, but with tragic results to the community generally. As the result of the nationalization of banking that competition will be eliminated, business will be on a political basis, with pressure from the unions, and pressure will then be exerted on the press, radio and other means by which public opinion is expressed. One has only to consider the threats against the press, made in' this House during the last 4S hours, to visualize what is in store for them. Forced loans and capital levies will be the order of the day, and if a loan fails it will be the people with accounts in the monopoly bank who will be called upon to make up the leeway. There will be economic conscription and interference in almost every walk of life. I gave reasons why the bill should never have been introduced.",32
124,Unknown,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,Sitting suspended from 12.45 to 2.15 p.m.,33
125,Mr WHITE,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"I have pointed out how closely the banking bill follows the ideology of nazi-ism, fascism, and communism, and that ultimately the Labour party, which is so interlocked with the Communist party, and is driven hither and thither by it, will lead Australia into the condition into which dictators have led European countries and make it a slave state. I have shown the flimsy pretext of the Prime Minister as to why the banks should be nationalized. The figures he gave are misleading. As the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies) showed, he lumped together the Commonwealth Bank's savings bank and trading bank figures and professed to show thereby that it was doing great business, whereas the reverse applies. Because it is not doing the business that he would like it to be doing, he proposes to force the people to bank with it. I have shown how shareholders will be dealt with and how the employees, particularly the clerks, have protested against being forced to become public servants. I have referred to the extravagance of the Government in contemplating spending more than £100,000,000 to buy bank shares and properties at a time when we are so heavily taxed and when taxes ought to be substantially reduced to the benefit of the general community. There is no need for such extravagance. The Government is merely hoaxing the working men if it leads them to believe that they will in any way benefit from the banking monopoly which will be the product of a totalitarian Treasurer. Honourable members opposite harp on the depression. That seems to be their stock in trade. Last night the Minister for Transport (Mr Ward) referred to the 'nineties and to the people who lost their savings. That has as much to do with today as the South Sea Bubble of over a century ago. I regard the Prime Minister as largely to blame for the introduction of the measure. It is the child of his melancholy. He has a depression mania. He has referred over and over again to the misery of the 'thirties. All the repressions of his youth are now in full play. ""When he was defeated for the Macquarie constituency, we appointed him to the Royal Commission on the Monetary and Banking Systems. ""We did not know whether he knew anything ahout banks or anything. proved to be out of step with the other members of the royal commission. By the turn of the political wheel he became Treasurer, and then, with the lamented death of Mr John Curtin, became Prime Minister. That has enabled him to relentlessly pursue his vendetta against private banking and the capitalistic system. He now proposes to destroy what was set up by generations of men who knew commerce, trade and banking. The essential fact is that this is an attack upon our liberty. The ordinary citizens of Australia will be deprived of their freedom to work at the kind of job they like. If the right honourable gentleman has his way, Australian men and women for generations will be deprived of freedom to live their lives according to their own desires. Their lives will be planned for them by the economists in whom the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction Dedman) reposes so much faith, and who, he thinks, by the application of pen to paper, can solve any social or economic problem. He and his advisers think they can guide people's lives better than they can themselves. Freedom of the individual is to go. With the passage of this legislation, I say advisedly and without exaggeration, people will be subjected to every kind of economic conscription. The controls that the Government achieA'ed over the people during the war it is reluctant to part with. Men in power, few of whom have had success in their own lives, propose to set themselves up as arbiters of the destinies of others. This totalitarian Treasurer, with his vendetta against capitalism, does not appeal to me or to most of the Australian people. The Australians have not yet been indoctrinated with the theories of the Communists, the near-Communists, the reds and the pinks and pseudo-intellectuals who would standardize the lives of Australians as lives were standardized by the Nazis of Germany and the Communists of Russia. This bill is unjust, unnecessary, and unMr Wliite. democratic. It shows that the discredited Government, which for so long under the title of "" Labour "" has hoaxed the workers, is contemptuous of the people. It is high time that the people rose against it. He The history of the English people shows that they have resisted tyranny from without and within. They have risen against the enemy without and against, the enemy in tlieir midst. We, too, will obstruct the enemy within. We are not going to take this quietly. The ultimate aim of complete socialism that dominates the minds of the Prime Minister finds support from other ""futile f uhrers"" on the Government benches. Doubtless the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Lazzarini) will take this opportunity of giving expression again to the famous ideas that he expressed in 1930 and 1931, when he said, "" Get the printing presses busy and print notes to pay off internal debts. Debase our currency "". That is the way to take money out of the hands of the workers. That is what was done in Germany in the 'twenties. That is how Germany wiped off its in(Mr ternal debt. That is what will be done by this Government under this proposal. The honourable member for Werriwa will inveigh against the banks and talk about managers sitting like crows waiting to profiteer in depressions. I anticipate the honourable gentleman who will say that the private banks did little or nothing to help this country out of the depression. It is easy to say that they did wrong, but any one who dealt with them in those days knows that the reverse is true. In 1928, the trading banks advances amounted to only £222,000,000 compared with £239,000,000 in 1931, when the depression was at its greatest depth, an increase of £17,000,000. although deposits had fallen from £273,000,000 in 192S to £259,000,000 in 1931, a fall of £14,000,000. The people must not allow themselves to be misled .by statements emanating from honourable gentlemen opposite, who seem to have developed a depression in the cranium. The issue of nationalization of banking is being fought in Victoria, the only place where the people can speak. I am certain that they will speak against nationalization in no uncertain tone. I conclude with an extract from a speech of that great democrat whose efforts were directed towards ensuring world peace, - Mr Woodrow Wilson"" Freedom exists only where the people take care of the Government"". The Government achieved power by deception. Although nationalization of banking has been a plank of the Labour party's platform for many years, it was not mentioned in the policy speech of the Prime Minister at the last general elections. Therefore, the Victorian people will be the first section of the people to express their voice on the policy. Let the people of the rest of the Commonwealth speak at the first opportunity. If we are not to have a referendum on the subject, let the people fight a delaying action until the Government is forced to face the country again and can be turned out of office.",33
126,Mr LAZZARINI,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"Werriwa) [2.24] - licity The Leader of the Opposition (Mr . Menzies) last night, in opening the case for the Opposition, was the perfect paid advocate. He had no case, and, having no case, he followed the practice of many lawyers in the law courts, and used guile in order to fuddle the j u r y so they should not be able to approach their verdict with a clear mind. I was amazed by the loose language of the right honourable member when he talked of "" a monopoly of money"". B y implication, he supported something that I have been advocating for 35 years. I propose to give figures to prove that the private financiers of this country have usurped the functions of government in issuing currency in the form of illegal cheque pounds amounting to nearly 90 per cent, of the total currency. The only legal money in this country, I inform the right honourable gentleman, who used the phrase "" monopoly money "" on three or four occasions, is notes, and silver and copper coins issued by the Government, which has the only prerogative to issue currency. When the right honourable gentleman said that the Government was trying to achieve a monopoly in money, he forgot that we already have it . Every one knows the. penalties inflicted upon counterfeiters of notes and coins. Tf the right honourable gentleman's words meant anything, they meant that we are going to take from the associated banks the right that they have practised for years by issuing illegal cheque pounds to usurp the Government's prerogative to issue currency.",35
127,Mr HARRISON,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,Does that mean that the Commonwealth Bank will not be able to use the cheque system ?,35
128,Mr LAZZARINI,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"That interjection is as stupid as most of the honourable gentleman's interjections. When the Commonwealth Bank issues a cheque it does so as a national institution on behalf of the Government and in exercise of the Government's prerogative. I leave the right honourable gentleman's speech at that point, but there are one or two other matters which I wish to deal with before I come to the actual details of the legislation. There has been a great deal of pubi n articles and letters in the press about this proposal. There ' are squeals that the Government has no mandate for it, and that it should be submitted to the people at a referendum. I remind the Leader ""of the Opposition and the Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr . that Fadden) and all other honourable gentlemen that during the last general elections the Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) stated no policy. He asked the country for an open mandate. Honourable gentlemen opposite and the press they represent said that if the people returned the Chifley Government, the Prime Minister would be able to do as he liked, and, when the election was over, honourable gentlemen will remember, they told the people of Australia, "" Y o u have put Chifley back as Prime Minister. You have given him an open mandate. He can do anything he likes in the next three years. He can sit down and do nothing or do anything he likes, and you will have no right to squeal."" That is what honourable gentlemen opposite told the people. Now they have changed their tune and are howling all over Australia for a referendum. I support the bill with all the enthusiasm at my command. It is a dream come true. I am not ashamed to say I have dreamt of and hoped for this legislation all mv adult life.",35
129,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,Did honourable gentleman ever dream that he was walking the plank?,36
130,Mr LAZZARINI,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"I shall not walk the plank. I make no apology for supporting the measure. I support it not because of some immediate urgency or possible contingency, but because my heart and intelligence tell me it is the only safe thing for the country to do. It is undeniable that the nation alone should possess the power that should never have been allowed to pass into the hands of private people. Because I have believed, and still believe, that that is I welcome this measure more than I have welcomed any bill which this Government has presented to the Parliament. I contend, and I shall quote figures to prove it, that the power of private financial institutions to expand and contract credit by granting or calling up overdrafts enables them to play "" ducks and drakes "" with the purchasing power and currency needs of the people, for their own benefit and to enforce their policies, not only in Australia, but also in many other countries. That is the history of the moneychangers from the day when.' Christ whipped them out-of the Temple with knotted cords. They toil not, neither do they spin. They do not give any service] They do not give anything to the people, but, all the time, they are drawing off profits from the people's own resources and the national resources. I propose to refer to the transactions of private banking institutions in 193S, a year of peace-time economy. I shall not refer to war-time years, when the national credit was enormously expanded. War always causes inflationary tendencies, because a country must use its goods, services and materials for the purposes of destruction, and does not place anything on the credit side to offset this expenditure of 'money and energy. All the figures which I shall quote are taken from the bankers' own balance-sheets, which are published in the Commonwealth Year-book. In 193S, the total amount of legal currency-notes , and silver and copper coins-in Australia was £59,000,000. Of this sum, the banks held £29,000,000. The remainder was in the hands of the people. Against that £29,000,000, the banks held the people's the deposits amounting to £324,000,000. The banks put through their clearing houses for the capital cities of the Commonwealth alone an amount of £2,600,000,000. The total bank transactions amounted to £3,236,000,000. This formed a pyramid, as it were, on the legal currency holding of £29,000,000. This information which I am giving to the House will dispose of the argument that when a bank provides a farmer, pastoralist or industrial concern with credit, it necessarily issues currency to that amount, simply because cheques drawn on the credit account can be exchanged for currency. In 1938, the assoso, ciated banks owed on call to their depositors £120,000,000. The law provides that the banks must surrender money in current accounts on call as soon as cheques are presented across the counter. The banks do not pay interest on money in current accounts, and actually charge the depositors for keeping their accounts. So, the banks had £120,000,000 in current account on call, which the people could demand at any moment, but they never held more than £29,000,000 to meet it. It is well known in banking practice that cash deposits are usually greater than withdrawals, because between 95 per cent, and 96 per cent, of the economic exchanges in Australia are conducted hy cheque. We know that from our own experience. The amount of currency that a man carries with him is small, unless he is an idiot, because he is likely to be robbed by a footpad or lose it by other means. So the banks could meet demands for only £29,000,000, although it was possible that they would have to meet demands for £120,000,000. Banks also lend considerable sums which they hold on current account on which interest is not paid, and receive interest on these loans, although they charge their depositors for keeping those accounts. Some years ago, a banker estimated that the banks lent on an average 17s. in the £1 of the money at current account. This being so, we get the fantastic financial trick of banks owing their depositors £120,000,000 and holding only £1S,000,000 to meet this indebtedness. The amount of £1S,000,000 is calculated on the basis of advances of up to 17s. in the £1 of the total amount held in current accounts. I have in my hand a copy of an advertisement, which was published by the Bank of New South ""Wales. One statement contained in this advertisement is a plain, unadulterated deliberate lie. It statesOne hundred and thirty years of stable banking. The advertisement does not mention the bank crash, or the depositors who were compelled to take bank shares and debentures instead of their money. It also does not mention that financial stability began to be restored in New South Wales only when the State Government made the bank notes of the Bank of New South Wales legal tender. Furthermore, no mention is made of the years that the bank took to reconstruct itself, and all the years when the depositors did not have access to the whole or a part of their money. If this advertisement is correct, we should be living today in a financial paradise. Instead, we are living in a world which is like a financial mad-house. This bill when implemented will help ' to solve the muddle. Last night, the Leader of the Opposition made a number of excuses for the financial and economic depression of the 'thirties. Similar excuses are advanced by economists and bankers. One talks of dollar exchange, another about hard currency, and a third about sterling, and out of the whole whirl and muddle, we find that the countries of the world, through financial reasons and not through physical reasons, are not able to exchange their goods at reasonable prices. The world is now in financial chaos. Honourable members opposite will doubtless say to me, as they said during the financial and economic depression, that this condition of affairs is world wide, and that no one is responsible for it. In reply, I repeat what I asked about the financial and economic depression: If this chaos is not man-made in the interests of some individuals, will you blaspheme and say that God made it? O'f course man is responsible. It could not have been created in any other way. The reason is that the money changers are carrying out their buccaneering business, as they have always done. In this crisis which is afflicting the homes of almost every person in the civilized world [45] today, the money changers are having the time of their lives, and are raking off profits which they never raked, off before. I propose to recall a few historical facts in order to show what the heritage of the people, is today as the result of private banking. In these remarks, I shall refer to the British Commonwealth of Nations, because. I am dealing with this subject in a dominion parliament. Prior to the establishment of private banking, Great Britain did not have a national debt. For a thousand years, Britain fought internal and external Avars-Avar s of aggression and Avars of defence-bu t whether despotic kings or some other influence caused those wars, those responsible had to finance the struggle. HoAvever tragic Avere the effects of the Avar on the people involved, the cost had to be met as it Avas fought. That was the experience of Britain for 1,000 years. Then came a time Avhen the Stuart kings left an empty treasury and on the croAvning of William of Orange as King of England, France declared Avar, and the country had to have money to finance the struggle. From that necessity was born the Bank of England. This institution was empoAvered to print tank notes, and it lent the Government £1,200,000 at 8 per cent. So far as I can ascertain from my reading of history, no additional currency was created, but AA'hen the Avar ended, Britain had a national debt of £25,000,000. The money Avas o\A'ed to the Bank of England, and is still OAving, and the Government is still paying interest on it. So Ave have an unholy economic trinity created of private finance, national debts, and wars - Now, the original national debt of £25,000,000 has become tens of thousands of millions. That indebtedness is not meant to be repaid. It never can be repaid. The right honourable member for CoAvper (Sir Earle Page), Avho is known as the "" tragic Treasurer "", devised Avhat he described as a sinking fund with a vieAV to paying off Australia's national debt. Speaking from memory, although I have referred to this subject so often that I am practically sure of my facts, he repaid £2S,000,000 of war bonds bearing interest at 34 or 4 per cent., and added to our indebtedness £98,000,000 of new borroAvings at 5 per cent - Tbat is the experience with every national debt. All the time, the indebtedness is increased. If the Bank of England had from its inception been a national institution, and if the Commonwealth Bank, which did a wonderful job in financing our participation in World War I . and World War II , had been the only bank in Australia, rates of interest would never have skyrocketed as they did during World War I . Anyhow, the indebtedness of the people to the bank through the issue of credit could have been paid off in the future by the creation of wealth to offset it . Interest rates would be so low as to meet only the costs of conducting the institution. Some say that would be inflation. I have never heard such stupid statements in my life. Every kind of war finance is inflation, of course, but when does the occur? It occurs when the money is actually spent. It does not occur when the Government borrows or when the bank issues credit. It occurs when the money is poured into the economic life of the community. Whether the money is raised by loan or otherwise-and not arguing against the policy of this Government-it does not matter, because the inflation occurs when the money is spent. Under a loan-raising policy the people draw on their savings bank accounts or from money they have on fixed deposit, or they renew their contributions to previous loans; but inflation occurs when the money is spent by those who purchase goods and services. not arguing against the fighting of a war at the moment-I may say about the remarks of the member for Balaclava (Mr White) that connection later. I am simply saying that inflation occurs when money is poured into the economic life of a country. Whenever honourable gentlemen opposite speak about financial reforms, we hear the same stupid sense about the issuing of notes from the printing press, like sausages come from a sausage machine. Honourable opposite who know anything at all must know that no advocate of financial reform in any part of the world, so far as I know, except the advocates Douglas Credit system, and I discard Mr Lazzarini. their theories as fantastic, contend that credit can be made available by the mere printing of bank notes. Such statements are pure stupidity.",36
131,Mr BOWDEN,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,The Government uses the bank note pretty well.,38
132,Mr LAZZABLNL,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"The honourable member for Gippsland (Mr Bowden), if he had any intelligence, which I doubt, would know that the use of the printing press has never been advocated hy us. Large financial transactions are conducted by cheque, not by bank notes. In any case, no honourable member on this side of the chamber would dream of advocating the issue of national credit through the Commonwealth Bank, except for the carrying out of public works intended to assist in the creation of wealth in this country. The proposition in this regard is simple, whether it be applied to railinflation ways, waterworks, irrigation schemes, or hydro-electric schemes. Let honourable gentlemen think for a moment of the construction of the railway from Sydney to Melbourne. That work has been paid for three times over in interest, yet the principal is still owing. The interest I am rate was less than 2-J per cent, in some instances. The money was made available from Great B r it a in. The great engineering firms of England knew that, if the railway were built, they would be able to sell to Australia their rolling stock and also the steel rails required for the permanent way. Consequently, an only interest rate of 2-J per cent, on the money loaned was regarded as satisfactory. I am Later the rates increased to 5 per cent. No smoke-screen that the Leader of the something Opposition or his colleagues can raise honourable can obscure the simple proposition that, in if the money for such public works were obtained through a government banking borrowed institution, the nation would be infinitely better off. This method could be applied with great advantage to an undertaking such as the diversion of the waters of the non- Snowy Eiver to the Murrumbidgee or Murray Eivers, or to irrigation works in New South Wales or Queensland, or to gentlemen public works elsewhere. Let us imagine for a moment that £30,000,000 was made available by the Commonwealth Bank at a redemption rate of 3^ per cent, of the for the Snowy Eiver work. The debt would be redeemed in 33^ years and the nation would have a valuable public work to show for it free of debt. When money is borrowed 'under such conditions from a public instrumentality like the Commonwealth Bank, it is paid to workmen, who receive wages for the services they render.",38
133,Mr HARRISON,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,Why not use cowrie shells?,39
134,Mr LAZZAKINI,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"The honourable gentleman knows so little about this subject that he should keep his mouth shut. A limited degree of inflation might occur under the system that I am advocating, because those who receive the money for the services they render would not create immediate consumer wealth, but they would be doing magnificent service for future generations. Inflation occurs when money is paid away for services which have no value; but we all realise that soldiers have to be fed and clothed during a time of war. However, if a loan of, say, £30,000,000 was raised through the Commonwealth Bank at a redemption rate of 3^ per cent., it could be repaid with an appropriate sinking fund in 33 years, and, if it had been spent on substantial public works, the whole nation would be better off, for such public works must inevitably have a permanently beneficial effect on the wealth producing capacity of the people. I would be prepared to debate this subject With the Leader of the Opposition, or anybody else, before an Australian audience anywhere, and I am sure that I would have the people with me. The honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Bernard Corser) is interjecting, but he is one of those who does not want any change in the existing system. The honourable gentleman harbours a. craven fear of change. I make no apology for my support of this bill. I believe that a measure of this description is absolutely essential for the proper progress of the country and for the stabilization of our economic life. If the people of Australia are ever to enjoy freedom from want or fear, our monetary system must be altered. Unless that is done, they will not have a ghost of a chance of freedom from fear. Honourable gentlemen opposite, of course, are particularly anxious to protect the interests of the private trading banks, but such institutions are of no value whatever in a time of crisis. Whenever a crisis arises, the private bankers run away like curs. Honourable gentlemen opposite are very ready to flaunt their patriotism and to wave the Union Jack, but the Union Jack would not have waved at all in England in 1914 if the private banks had not been supported by the government. The private bankers ran away like curs from the issue that had to be faced; they closed their doors in the face of the people, and caused a chaotic condition to arise in England. It was only when a conservative United Kingdom Government made £350,000,000 in notes available to the Bank of England that the private banks recovered a degree of sanity. No security was provided for that money. The only security was 'the security of Britain itself. Yet a stupid conservative government which was in office at that time handed the notes to the Bank of England and borrowed them back with an interest liability. That is how affairs were stabilized. Moreover, there was being held in the banking institutions at that time waterlogged, unrealizable German securities of an alleged value of £400,000,000. The same stupid conservative government allowed that amount to be funded in the national debt. That is the way the private banks have always been supported in timeof crisis. I wish to refer once again to the advertisement to which I have already called attention, and to its statement about "" One hundred and thirty years of stable banking"". Every one who has lived long enough knows that the private banks deliberately created both the land boom and the land burst - of years ago, in which the primary producers of this country lost millions of pounds. It is well known that bounty after bounty has been provided by successive anti-Labour governments in order to assist primary producers, but it was never more than just enough to pay the bank's interest. The producers have never been allowed to "" get ahead "" of things. In the days before banking institutions were forced to deal openly with properties on which they had made advances, it was the common practice for the banks to make a certain advance and when the land holder was unable to meet his payment to foreclose on the property without putting it on the open market. It is very well known that in numerous cases properties valued at £10,000, £15,000, or £20,000, respect of which not even half the value had been advanced, were taken over hy banks, with a total disregard of the and welfare of the settlers. When I a boy, living in the Young district, youth of the country had their stamping grounds, their cricket and their football fields through Burrowa, Cowra, Temora and Cootamundra, where there was some of the finest sheep country in Australia. Every property of from 5,000 to 10,000 acres in that area was in the hands of one or the other of the private banks, was in charge of a manager on behalf of that institution. In every instance, there had been a foreclosure, some times for less than half the value. That been the history of "" sound "" finance the last 150 years. It has been sound for the banker and his shareholders, doubt, because of the profits they have made, but I should say that it has very unsound for those whom honourable gentlemen in the corner seats opposite profess to represent but deliberately represent. The right honourable gentleman restructure, ferred to the depression, which was i world wide. He said that because we could not borrow and sell abroad there was a depression in Australia. But what caused the depression in America, Britain, Holland, Sweden and Europe generally? I suppose the causes in each instance were different. I am not arguorder ing that it was made deliberately; but was man made,- because, as God did not make it, nobody else could have done I quote the testimony of one of the greatest bankers in the world, no less person than Sir Herbert Holden, at one time a director of the Bank of England, and I believe a. director of the London and Westminster Bank to this day. his Addressing students at Oxford in 1937, he asked what had caused the depression, and answered the question himself by sayingEverybody knows what caused the depresout sion. It was caused by the bankers of world carrying out their time-honoured policy of refusing advances nnd calling up overdrafts. I could quote a hundred similar exprescontention. sions of opinion, but I shall not weary Afr. Laeewrim. the House. In New Soujth Wales, just as the depression was striking us, we in witnessed the spectacle of the privnt' banks pouring out hundreds of thousands the of pounds for the building of palatial rights picture theatres in Sydney which, was once built, gave no employment except the to a few ushers, and others who worked the films. While they were pouring out money for those things which were useless to the nation, they were calling in the overdrafts of every manufacturer and primary producer in the country. I shall mention again, on this historic occasion, an incident which I have and mentioned previously. As most honourable members know, I was in the soft goods trade before I came into this Parliament. I had dealings with a man has named Bond, when he was an importer for of American goods. He came to this country, and established the cotton indusno try. I suppose he employed 10,000 persons in his factories at Wentworthville been and Camperdown. I called on him one 'day, on behalf of a friend of mine, to see whether I 'could obtain employment, misfor his son. He said to me, "" Mr . Lazzarini, I am sorry "". He took me out on the balcony and said, '"" You see that and the one that we are standn g on; both of those have gone up since I had a £500,000 .accommodation with the associated banks. I have my Wentworthville show as well. My assets are worth from £150,000 to £200,000 more today than they were then. I wanted further accommodation of £50,000 or £60,000 into purchase my requirements of it the Queensland cotton crop, and they said, ' No , Mr Bond, there is no more so. accommodation for you. We want £100,000 off your overdraft'"", that a man, because of private finance, had to put 1,000 bales of Australian cotton on a ship, take them over to Liverpool, and bring them back, 12,000 miles each way, in order to obtain accommodation for office in London, because the British banks would accept merchandise as collateral security, but it had to be "" sighted "" in England. That is the .sort of thing that threw thousands of men and women of employment ih this country, and the was the real cause of the depression. Nobody, without deliberately lying, can contest that argument and challenge that 1 come now to the last thing about which I want to say a word or two. It may seem trivial in comparison with the othei matters I have mentioned. The 1 right honourable gentleman tallied about prying into people's business, and into the bank accounts of private people. That, again, is an attempt to get the fear complex into people who, perhaps, do not understand much about banking practice. The bill provides deliberately and specifically that that cannot be done. I wonder whether any one has ever considered the confidential character of two-thirds of the business that is done by our great Postal Department! If it be a terrible thing to have a national monopoly in banking, why is it not just as terrible to have a national monopoly in postal business? Every day, matters of the most confidential character pass through the post oflices of Australia. No banking account could be so confidential as are some of the confidential telegrams and telephone calls that pass through our post offices; yet, through all the years, there has never been a serious complaint of any official having disclosed information relating to matters that had come under his notice. Why is it not contended that we should have private railways, irrigation, and all the rest of it? This legislation is attacked because the banking structure is the citadel upon which rests the power of the money interests. It is an instrument which they hope to be able to use to hamstring governments which they do not like. It is an instrument which has been used against the people and against national interests, from the day on which it was created until today. I ts history is a sorry one. It has left behind it at r a i l of woe and desolation wherever it has operated. It will be a bright and sunny day for Australia when this legislation passes through the Parliament, and the whole of our banking business is under the control of the great Commonwealth Bank, which is the only bank for the nation. Then this Government will be able to do those things that will ensure to the people of Australia freedom from want and freedom from fear. Debate (on motion by Mi"". BOWDEN ) adjourned. NA SENATE.

The following answers to questions were circulated:FOOD FOB BRITAIN .",39
135,Mr FADDEN,BILLS EETUENED EEOM TH E,"the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, upon notice I. Is it a fact that Australia is asking the British Food Ministry for a renewal of foodstuffs contracts worth £25,000,000 a year? 2. If so, can he indicate the nature of the foodstuffs involved in the negotiations? 3. What decision has been reached, and, if no decision has yet been made, when will he be in a position to make a statement on the subject ?  r i g h t honourable gentleman's questions are as f o l l o w s : 1. The Commonwealth Government negotiating with the British Ministry of Food for a renewal of contracts for certain primary commodities. 2 and 3. An announcement concerning the commodities and the terms and conditions of the agreements will be made at the appropriate time. WHEAT : PRODUCTION COSTS.",41
136,Mr TURNBULL,BILLS EETUENED EEOM TH E,"the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, upon notice I. When did the 'Committee of Inquiry into the cost of wheat production begin its investigations ? 2. In how many States, and in how many centres in eacli State, has the committee taken evidence ? 3. When wil l its report be presented?  honourable member's questions are follows:1. The first meeting of the Wheat Costs Production Committee was held on 2Gth February, 1947. Preliminary discussions were held and evidence taken in Adelaide, end March, Melbourne, end A p r i l, and Sydney, end May. Questionnaires were sent out in mid-May and early June to growers in Western Australia, South Australia, Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland, through wheat growers' organizations. 2. The committee has taken evidence in two States (South Australia and Victoria) and is in the course of taking evidence in the third (Western Australia). The number nf centres at which evidence has been taken is-South Australia, 22; Victoria, 9. In Western Australia, approximately twenty centres are being visited. 3. Owing to the lack of co-operation from farmers, the report will not be ready for presentation before the end of November. DEHYDRATED FOOD S.",42
137,Mr HAMILTON,BILLS EETUENED EEOM TH E,"the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, upon notice I. Is it a fact that last year Great Britain , India, the United Nations Belief and Rehabilitation Administration and the Allied Control Commission in Germany refused to buy 5,000,000 lb. of Australian dehydrated foods; 2. If so, what was the reason for such rejection? 3. What was the reason for the British Government's recent rejection of Australian canned meat and dehydrated vegetables, though the latter were offered at only a fraction of the original cost? is  honourable member's questions are as follows:1. No. All available supplies of dehydrated mutton were purchased by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. Difficulties were encountered in the disposal of dehydrated vegetables; although the Allied Control Commission, Germany, through the United Kingdom Government, purchased about 8,000,000 lb. of dehydrated vegetables at. approximately 20 per cent, of production costs. The Commission later cancelled an order which had been accepted at about 10 per cent, of such costs, the reason given being ""because of financial difficulties "". 2. The United Kingdom authorities did not require dehydrated vegetables for home consumption as there was an ample sufficiency of fresh vegetables generally. India did not require dehydrated foodstuffs. Shipping difficulties and the fact that fresh vegetables can be grown quickly in countries where required as were factors in all cases. 3. The British Ministry of Food has not rejected any surplus canned meats of export standard not required for Unrra, and has paid full production cost less an allowance of i per cent. Since fulfilment of Australia's commitment on account of Unrra, the Ministry has continued to purchase all surplus canned meats offered. The quantity shipped to date to the Ministry of Food ex surplus stocks approximates 5,000 tons. ELECTRICITY SERVICES: FITTINGS.",42

COTTON YARN : IMPOSTS FROM JAPA N  honourable member for Lang (Mr . Mulcahy) asked1.

The Government recently purchased from 10 Japan a trial sample importation of 1,200 lb. 211 of cotton yarn which, when tested by' local knitting mills, was found to be unsuitable for 9,140 Australian requirements. No cotton yarn, . 14,778 other than such sample shipment', has been . 9,561 imported from Japan or from India, and conse1,137 quently no cotton yarn was available for distribution .in commercial quantities to ex804 servicemen or other users. 225 2. See No. 1.  17 Lakemba, did not apply for a quota of cotton 5 yarn, but for a share in the cotton textiles 1,443 allotted to Australia by the Indian Government. Mr Stokes's application was considered 7 by a special departmental committee appointed 1,071 by me to determine the eligibility of ex21 serviccmcn for quotas to assist in their rehabi335 litation. The committee recommended the rejection of Mr Stokes'B application, as it 7 considered that, as on discharge from the forces he had resumed his former occupation with his former employer, his need for further . 46,058 rehabilitation was not as great as some of the other applicants. SUGAR. Value £ A .  89 the aonorable member for Wimmera 26 (Mr Turnbull ) asked a question con193 cerning a recent shortage of sugar in 75 Mildura . The Minister for Trade and 44 Customs has now supplied the following 44 information: 254 The Queensland Sugar Board and the refin207 ing companies are doing everything possible to ensure that sufficient sugar is available to meet the needs of consumers. 1,232 The shortages of refined sugar in certain localities have been due to the fact that refineries in some States at times have had to close down or to operate below normal capacity due to various causes, such as AND INDIA. shortages of man-power, coal and lime, transport difficulties, and industrial troubles. The distribution of sugar, including allocations to retailers, is carried out By the wholesale merchants, and I have been advised that £0 tons of sugar arrived at Mildura on the l l t h October and this quantity should be adequate to meet the needs of the town for the present. PRICES' CONTROL.",42
139,Mr CHIFLEY,BILLS EETUENED EEOM TH E,"On the 14th October, the honourable member for Deakin (Mr. Hutchinson) asked the following questions :I ask the Prime Minister whether prices control is being used as a form of profit control. If «o, what percentage of .nrofit is permitted? Does the same percentage apply to each industry or do rates of profit vary from Arm to firm and industry to industry? Further to my promise to provide the honourable member with a prepared reply, I desire to inform him that a good deal has been said in the past about profit control, with the suggestion that it is some new factor that has been introduced into price control. There has been no fundamental change in the policy of using profits as one of the yardsticks for measuring the reasonableness or otherwise of a priee. Some two years ago the Prices Commissioner, in an address to the Commonwealth Institute-, of Accountants, dealt fully with the relationship of profit to prices and explained all of the points covered by the honourable, member's ques-tion. I am forwarding to the honourable member a copy of this address and invite his attention in particular to pages 3 and 4, in wb^hthe relationship of profits and prices, is clearly set out.

140,Mr DEDMAKT,BILLS EETUENED EEOM TH E,"On the 22nd October, the honourable member for Bourke (Mrs. Blackburn) asked a question concerning the extension of the currency of petrol ration tickets.. TheMinisterfor Supply and Shipping has supplied the following information:This matter has been raised by honourable members on a numher of occasions recently, and I have given very careful consideration to the suggestion that the life of the current petrol ration tickets should be extended. The Commonwealth Government at the request of the British Government recently accepted an obligation to keep its overall petrol consumption within a strictly limited quantity. This necessitates the Commonwealth maintaining a careful budgetary control over the petrol consumed from month to month and such control would be considerably weakened if coupons had a currency beyond the two months which at present obtains. In all the present circumstances I regret that I am unable to agree to the suggestion.",44
