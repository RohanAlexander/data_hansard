I ask the honourable gentleman if lie has received a report from Mr Swinburne?",12
2,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,"I do not think it advisable to make such informatiou public in connection with a matter in regard to which litigation is proceeding, bub as the honourable gentleman was connected with the case when in office as Postmaster-General, I have from time to time given him information in regard to it, and I have no objection to telling him privately what I know in this matter, but I would rather not make the information public. SMALL-POX OUTBREAK.",12
3,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"Has the Prime Minister received a communication from the Lord' Mayor of Sydney, intimating that a very important and influential body of citizens desires the Government to remove the quarantine embargo from Sydney?",12
4,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I have. I saw it juBt before arriving at the House.,12
5,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"I ask the Prime Minister what has become of the suggestion emanating from this side of the House, in which he concurred, that a Committee should be appointed to consider the best way to deal with the smallpox epidemic? The honourable member said he would consider the appointment of a Committee.",12
6,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Obviously , nothing has come of the suggestion so far. The whole matter is receiving consideration. NAVIGATION ACT.",12
7,Mr ARCHIBALD,Unknown,"I wish to know from the Prime Minister when ib is his intention to issue a proclamation bringr ing into force the Navigation Act, which recently received His Majesty's assent)",12
8,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The Department is engaged in framing the necessary regulations, and in making all other preparations for organization prior to the bringing of the Act into operation. I am nob able to say ab presenb when the precise time for thab will arrive.",12
9,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Is the preparation of regulations and the organization of the had Navigation Department the only thing standing in the way of the proclamation!,12
10,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I do not know - what the honourable member means. If - he will make himself more explicit, I shall be glad to answer his question. TESTING OF EXPLOSIVES.",13
11,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"I ask the Prime Minister, in regard to the establishment of a testing station for explosives, whether '.the Governments of the States have been - approached about the matter. If so, has he received any replies from them, and, - if he has received such replies, will he lay them on the table of the House?",13
12,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Represen tations were made to the Governments of the States by my predecessor, and, so far as I know, there is no objection to laying the papers asked for on the table of the Library. NORTHERN TERRITORY. POKT DARWIN FREEZING WORKSPURCHASE OF SHEEP.",13
13,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"A statement appeared - in one of the newspapers some time ago to the effect that the Ministry has definitely abandoned the idea of having Government freezing works in the Northern Territory, and has entered into negotiations with a private company for the establishment of such works. I shall 'be glad to know if that statement is - correct.",13
14,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"The idea of establishing freezing works has not been abandoned, although, as the honourable member for Barrier will see, the sum of Â£25,000 - does not appear on the Estimates. For Some time past I have been trying to ascertain whether an English company will establish freezing works at Port Darwin. There was an idea of establishing works at Wyndham, with the possibility of having two within a short - distance of each other. I have had negotiations with an English Company of high repute, though I cannot say yet whether they will end in the establishment of freezing works at Darwin. If these negotiations should fail, there are, I believe, other companies and firms ready to discuss the question.",13
15,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"I wish to ask the Minister of External Affairs whether there is a definite understanding that the Government as a Government are not to pro-ceed with the erection of freezing works at Darwin, but that if suitable arrangements can be made with a private company they will hand over to it the carrying out of the work? In other words, is it the policy of the Government not to put up the works as a Government concern?",13
16,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I think that I may say it is not the policy of the Government not to put up freezing works, but the preference of the Government is to have it done by private enterprise if the conditions are such that we can adequately protect the public interest, and the interests of all stations which are nob tied up to particular companies who may do the work; but if we fail, then the question of providing works-perhap s on a smaller scale than was originally intended, but adequate to the necessities of the Territory-wil l be considered.",13
17,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,It is not the intention of the Government at present?,13
18,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,Not at present.,13
19,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"I desire to ask whether the Minister of External Affairs or his predecessor bought 200.0 ? sheep for the Northern Territory a little time ago, and, if so, are they all dead, or how many are dead?",13
20,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I am not aware that there was a purchase of 2,000 sheep. If the honourable member desires information, I shall try to get it for him tomorrow. JUNIOR POSTAL MECHANICS General if he will have regulation 481 altered. Under it all mechanics from the age of eighteen to the age of fifty are classed together. Could not the regulation be amended to include youths of sixteen? Provision is made for youths of fourteen and a half to sixteen, and then there is a jump.",13
21,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,"Thes e regulations were made by the Public Service Commissioner, and do not come under my purview. SMALL-POX OUTBREAK.",13
22,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"In view of the alleged serious trouble at the Sydney Quarantine Station, I wish to ask the Prime Minister whether he has read the account of persons who have been patients there, and noted their complaints about \fclie insanitary and other conditions prevailing there? - If so, will he cause inquiries to be made, and have the complaints attended to? MT. JOSEPH COOK - If the honourable member will bring under my notice - auy particular cases showing bad conditions at the.Quarantine Station, they will be inquired into. The last report I read from a discharged patient was entirely in favour of the treatment he had received at the station. EISHER MINISTRY. - Mr EISHER - Is the Prime Minister correctly Teported as having said recently, at Parramatta, I think, that if the La'bour Government had continued in office they would Jiave been sure to impose additional taxation ? Further, did he say that - his own - Government were compelled to increase the expenditure on account of the draft Estimates of 'the previous Government?",13
23,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I did not say - that. I 'said 'that - on taking office we found such a condition of things that when the draft Estimates were - presented, they were very (much inflated, and ""we had to take off some millions. I am - quite saware that - at the time of the late Government leaving office, the end of the finan-cial year, there 'had been no Estimates considered; but I do not know that that helps my honourable friends in the. .slightest degree. In the first place, the draft Estimates ought to have been submitted months before that time.",14
24,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Month s before the 31st May?,14
25,Mr JOSEPH OOOK,Unknown,"We took office, I think, on the 25th June; that is, right alt 'the end of-the financial year, and no Estimates had been submitted. Estimates 'were then submitted to us, and we had to take some millions off them, and I do not hesitate to say that in my - opinion .there would have been extra taxation imposed had my honourable friends retained office.",14
26,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Prime Minister what justification he has for the statement repeated here, that the previous Government would have imposed further taxation, seeing that a statement to the contrary had 'been made to the public ? Is - he aware-havin g had five years' experience in a State - Government, and - one year's - experience, at least, in Commonwealth Government-that all Estimates when sent in by the Departments are generally about 20 or more per cent, above the commitments for the year? And, further, does he wish the people or this House to believe that he is making a statement based on his experience, when he says that the draft Estimates were such that he could not prevent great additional expenditure being incurred at the present time?",14
27,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I am not aware that draft Estimates are always 20 or 25 per - cent, more than they ought tto be, although I can well ibelieve that to be the case in connection - with a Government which proved itself so extravagant as did that of my honourable friends opposite. I can very well understand it to be so under tlieir rigime.",14
28,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Goo d business.,14
29,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"My general belief that there would have been further taxation, if the late Government had remained, is based on the r-usb upwards of the expenditure during their three years of office, and .from what we know of their financial administration in a general way. WIRELESS AS A WEAPON. Mr 'BAMFORD - Has the attention of the Prime Minister been directed - to ;a - cablegram in this morning's press reporting a (discovery of an invention by an Italian scientist-Signo r Ulivi, I think ithe name is-by which mines can - be exploded - at a considerable distance without direct communication, with what the inventor lerms F rays? If so, will the hon-oraJble gentleman make the fullest inquiries into the matter before engaging The in further naval expenditure? Mr. JOSEPH 'COOK - I shall be very glad indeed to make any inquiries which are necessary in that direction. MELBOURNE CUP. Mr KING O'MALLEY - In view of the fact that next Tuesday will be the great national holiday- a day on which all Christians will go to the races and the semi-Christians to picnics-will the Prime Minister on Friday adjourn the House until Wednesday at 3 o'clock? Mr. JOSEPH 'COOK - I am quite - unable to say yet what will be done, but the matter will be - considered. PRIVILEGE ",14

31,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Is it the intention of the honourable member to conclude with a motion ?,15
32,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"Yes , sir.

I think this article goes beyond what is fair in editorial criticism, and I therefore move That the comments of the editor of the Argus concerning the progress of the business of Parliament are mischievous, and are not calculated to assist the Government in carrying out its policy.",15
37,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order ! A motion of that kind is not in accordance with our Standing Orders. Standing order 285 readsAny member complaining to the House of a statement in a newspaper as a. breach of privilege shall produce a copy of the paper containing the statement in question, and be prepared to give the name of the printer or publisher, and also submit a substantive motion declaring the person in question to have been guilty of contempt. The honourable member will require to put his motion in terms which accord with those laid down in that standing order.",16
38,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"I can very soon supply the name of the publisher, because I have it here.",16
39,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The Standing Orders require that a motion of this kind shall be framed in such a way as to declare the person who is responsible for its publication to have been guilty of contempt.,16
40,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"Then I would like to add to the motion the words, "" and that the editor of the Argus is guilty of contempt.""",16
41,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member will also require to include in his motion the name of the printer or publisher ,16
42,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"Then I ask leave to amend my motion so as to make it readThat the comments of the editor of the Argus concerning the progress of the business of Parliament are mischievous, and are not calculated to assist the Government in carrying out its policy, and that the editor of the Argus and Henry Burrell, the printer and publisher, are guiltv of contempt.",16
43,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,"Darwin) [3.30] - I do not see much in the motion, because this newspaper has no influence, and it is a mistake to think that it has. I wish to be fair to the pool Argus. In the first place, it is read only by people of this country who suffer from various troubles, and who sit in tlieir chairs and are being xiursed. In the early days, when I used to travel over the country, I found that the people, if they wished for news, read jubi- the Age, and that, when they requiredsomething to wrap their sausages in , they bought the A r g u s ; but, even then, the Government, under the sanitary regulations, stepped in , because the paper was so full of poison that it was thought the children of the community would be in jured. The dangerof a motion like this is that it will give the newspaper a circulation, whereas, at present, ib has none, except amongst those who are dying or are preparing to die. Therefore, I cannot see much in the motion. Question resolved in the negative. NA",16
44,Mr BURNS,PERSONAL EXPLANATIO N,"The Argus of Thursday last reports me as having, in an interjection, .suggested that the honourable member for Capricornia should call the Speaker names and get "" chucked out."" I never uttered such words in this chamber, and I give the statement an unqualified denial. BEEF TRUST.",16
45,Mr SHARPE,PERSONAL EXPLANATIO N,"Is the Minister of Trade and Customs in a position to give this House any information in regard to the Beef Trust now operating in Queensland ? When I asked the Attorney-General a question on this subject last week, I was informed that the Minister of Trade and Customs was making inquiries, and I think that there sliould be sufficient in formation obtainable in Queensland to be now laid before the House.",16
46,Mr GROOM,PERSONAL EXPLANATIO N,"The Department of Trade and Customs is certainly watching over the matter of a Beef Trust in Australia. Honourable members will - see, however, that it is not possible for us to give, at every stage of every inquiry, the information that may be in possession of the Department. I can say that the Department has no sympathy whatever with any trust or combination likely to interfere with the industries of Australia.",16
47,Mr SHARPE,PERSONAL EXPLANATIO N,There is sufficient evidence to establish the fact of a Beef Trust. ,16
48,Mr GROOM,PERSONAL EXPLANATIO N,The Department is - watching over the matter with the closest care and scrutiny.,16
49,Mr TUDOR,PERSONAL EXPLANATIO N,"Eve n if the Customs Department finds out that Messrs. Swif t and Company are erecting works on the Brisbane Biver, and that that firm belongs to the American Beef Trust, is it possible to do anything to stop them ?",16
50,Mr GROOM,PERSONAL EXPLANATIO N,"I do not know whether the honourable member's question is in tended to obtain information or impart information. The Commonwealth has jurisdiction over the exports and the sea trade of Australia, and whatever powers the Commonwealth possesses, we are prepared, if occasion arises, to exercise.",17
51,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIO N,"I take the opportunity, once again, to point out that, properly speaking, I should not have allowed the question by the honourable member for Yarra. I have pointed out on previous occasions that it is distinctly out of order to ask further questions arising out of replies given 'by Ministers to questions already asked, unless the object of the further question is to elucidate an answer already given. It is not in order to follow up a question with further questions based on the answer given, and thus probably give rise to something very much in the nature of a debate or dialogue. The matter must not proceed further in the form of questions and replies. Mr BRUC E SMITH - Has the M in ister of Trade and Customs any intention whatever of interfering with the business of Messrs. Swift and Company in a way in which he would not interfere with the business of any other company?",17
52,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIO N,"That is another question of the same nature to which I have just referred, and if answered, may lead to a further series based on the Minister's reply.

Will he inform the House whether the methods claimed by Mr Balsillie as improvements of his own on the Marconi methods are now being practised, and whether they are claimed to be portion of the infringements for which the Marconi Company is proceeding against the Commonwealth? 3. Is not the Telefunken system, which the late Postmaster-General (Mr Frazer) proposed to purchase, involved in the questions to be settled by the litigation - referred to?",17
54,Mr AGAR WYNNE,MARCONI COMPANY,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are1, 2, and 3. The Marconi Company have filed their statement of claim, and the Government has filed its reply. An order was obtained from the Court by the plaintiffs to enable them to inspect certain Commonwealth Wireless Stations, and this inspection has been made by the plaintiff company. I do not think it is advisaHe, as a rule, to answer questions in cases where litigation is being carried on, but I may state I am advised that the Government has a good defence to the action.

61,Mr BRUCE SMITH,ORGANIZATION IN WESTERN,I understand that a month's Supply is now asked for at the rates provided for in the Estimates foK last year.,18
62,Sir JOHN FORREST,ORGANIZATION IN WESTERN,"Yes . O u r proposals will be dealt with in detail in> the usual way during the consideration of the Estimates. There is nothing out of the ordinary in this Bill to which todirect attention, except that the measuremakes no provision for an advance to the Treasurer, because I rely on the passing of the Appropriation Works and Buildings Bill this week. That will provide money for the carrying on of the works, and buildings, aud will unburden the A d vance Account. Of course, if there should be delay in the passing of the measure, I shall have to come to Parliament soon for an advance for the purpose of making payment for works that are now being proceeded with all over the country, but I do not anticipate the necessity for that. So far as my memory serves OF EX- me, it is not usual for a Government to ADMINISTRA- ask for Supply before it is wanted. The Supply for which I now ask will be imBALSILLIE- peratively necessary on Friday, and from* Tuesday to Friday is a good time to allow COMMIS- for the passing of a Supply Bill through both Houses of the Parliament.

Believing that to be so, I ask my honourable friends to give TRAVELa speedy passage to this Bill .",18
63,Mr FISHER,ORGANIZATION IN WESTERN,"Wide Bay) [3.46] - I NA appreciate the terms and manner in TYPISTS. which the Treasurer has asked for ' a month's Supply. I understand that some amount remains to the credit of his A d vance Account, but not very much. It is a compliment to him that anything is left, because he is a good spender. He asks that the Bill may be passed practically without discussion. No doubt, grievances have been voiced very freely of late, but the head of the Government, and others on that side, take good care by misrepresentations outside, of the mosfc gentle and cut-throab kind, to mislead the public as to the position of the Comfor monwealth finances, and as to the finanthan cial administration and policy of the late Government. I asked the Prime Minisvernment ter today whether certain statements tributed to him by the press, reflecting on the action of the previous Government, and expressing his belief as to what that Government would have done had it been returned with a majority, were true, and he affirmed that they were. It was an outrage for him to assert that this party sive expenditure. would break its pledges to the people. saidHe had no warrant for doing so, and has no evidence that we have ever broken our there pledges. The honourable gentleman's statement was a gratuitous insult to Labour party, though quite in keeping with his general conduct outside. honourable gentleman made the statements to which I refer at Parramatta, in conhe nexion with the opening of a Liberal Institute, in which, according to the report, he has a personal interest, having taken Â£ 1 0 0 worth of shares.",18
64,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA,No ; Â£ 5 0 worth100 shares at 10s. each.,19
65,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIA,"I accept the correction, but the authority for mystatements is the following telegram which appeared in the Argus of yesterdaySydney, Sunday - The Prime Minister (Mr. Cook) attended a meeting held at Parramatta on Saturday night for the purpose of inaugurating the Liberal Institute, ancl he put his name down for ,fioo worth of shares in the Institute. The report continuesReferring to the nnances, Mr Cook said : "" I would ask the working man to remember that the average working man is contributing Â£ i ios. 4d. more in taxation now than he was three years ago. Mr Hughes claims that all the social acts for the last twenty years have been due to the Labour party. If that be the case, a part of it must be the heavy rents which w-e have to pay today. In the State arena the Labour party has finished with a huge deficit. Mr Fisher certainly left us a surplus, but he left us plenty of debts to pay. After cutting down their Estimates by some millions, we just manage to make ends meet."" To-day he admitted that the Estimates are not the Estimates of his predecessors, but, according to the report which I have read, he said at Parramatta that they were.",19
66,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA,"I say now that they are, in a sense.",19
67,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIA,"It is like the Prime Minister to blow hot and cold in this way. The Attorney-General, if he were at the head of a Government, would no more think of throwing the responsibility the Estimates on to his predecessors of cutting off his head. The responsibility for Estimates lies with the Gothat brings tbem in , otherwise atthey have no standing. Apparently, this ""Government is prepared to remain in office on any terms.

He acknowledged that had no evidence to support it . If he looks up the meaning of the word "" solemnly,"" he will see that he is playing it fairly low down.

68,Mr JOSETH COOK,AUSTRALIA,"I thin k that you are a good judge of what is ""low down.""",19
69,Mr EISHER,AUSTRALIA,"I do not pretend to be a good judge of the opinions of anybody, but I do claim that if I make a mistake in fact, I take the earliest opportunity of correcting ib.",19
70,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA,I made no mistake whabever.,19
71,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIA,"In solemnity, perhaps nob, but in fact, yes. In no instance have we, as a party, gone against our pledges to the country. No new taxation was proposed, and no new taxation would have been imposed, and the attempt of the present Government to raise a new and fresh issue would in another sphere be characterized by the proper term, and the people who continue to make use of such statements, without evidence, would undoubtedly be put outside of ordinary decent society. That is jusb aboub how the matter stands. Bub whab is behind the general statement that the previous Government had expended very much more during their term of officethan did the Deakin Governmenb in 1909-10? There is no comparison bebween thab year and the years 1910-1911, 1911-12 and 1912-13. The expenditure on new works in that period, the amount of new social expenditure, the increases in the invalid and old-.age pensions, the maternity allowance, the gradual growth fif the Public Service, the increase in the remuneration of State employees, and very large expenditure on defence, exceedpeat ing anything in previous years, show clearly the reasons for the increase. the present Government been in office, would they have refrained from pending the money that was available on such enterprises of the Commonmonths. wealth ? Did not the Liberal party, did not the Prime Minister himself, whilst sitting in Opposition, did not the honourable member for Gwydir, and others, during the years prior to the expiration of the Braddon section, point out how that you are sure ? the various services of the Commonwealth were being starved, - as regards public tical effect. works and equipment, and the payment to employees? Immediately the was available the previous Government took every proper step to get the works carried out on national lines. more.

107,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA,"No , it was",21
108,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIA,"The matter is a littl e technical, and it easily lends itself to the tactics of the Prime Minister in public. But the facts are admitted by the Treasurer, who understands that we started from the same day as did the agreement between the States and the Fusion Government.",21
109,Sir JOHN FORREST,AUSTRALIA,"Yes , but that was curtailing it by six months.",21
110,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIA,No ; we started as I have just said.,21
111,Sir JOHN FORREST,AUSTRALIA,That is point I made.,21
112,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIA,"We carried out the terms of the States agreement, but the Prime Minister said that we ante-dated the agreement.",21

114,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIA,"The Prime Minister, unlike the Treasurer, who knows the facts, said that we ante-dated the payment six months from the day of the agreement.",21
115,Sir JOHN FORREST,AUSTRALIA,"Your s was a years' agreement, but ours was not.",21
116,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIA,That is another matter.,21
117,Sir JOHN FORREST,AUSTRALIA,"The States agreed to our proposal, but not to yours.",21
118,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIA,"I need not pursue the matter further. The Treasurer now admits clearly that we carried out our pledges to our electors. did not object to the payment of 25s. per bead fora period, but we did object to a provision for the payment of that amount being embodied in the Constitution. Before and during the election, I stated that if we were returned we would pass a measure providing for the payment of that amount for ten years. That proposal was carried out to the very letter. We agreed to all the principles embodied i'n the agreement, in cluding the special payment of Western Australia.",21
119,Sir JOHN FORREST,AUSTRALIA,"Yes , but the States did not agree to that, you know. at that",21
120,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIA,"The States got, and are getting now, an amount exactly in accordance with their agreement, and, if it is to be altered, it can only be altered by the Government. It was passed by the previous Government. If there is any risk, it will probably lie with this Government. But that was not the charge which was made against us. The charge was not. that we had taken from the States payment for six months, which the Fusion party would have given them. There is another of the misrepresentations which it is very easy to make and publish abroad, but so hard to refute. I have stated before the difficulty under which we, as a party, labour through having no central press to publish our statements of fact. It is only by continuous iteration and reiteration that we can hope to catch up to a set of statements that are contrary to the facts. I have figures showing not the comparisons between the proposed expenditure of the present Government and the expenditure of the previous Government. The figures show that our Administration was even more economical and more careful than the present Government indicate by their Budget proposals. did. I will content myself by making a general statement. We under-spent our revenue, whereas the present Government are already over-spending. Our commitments would not have been in excess of our finanten- cial position had we retained office, aud the gratuitous statement, first given out as a fact, but now modified by the Prime - Minister to a solemn opinion that he entertains, that if we had been returned we would have imposed other taxation, must be greatly discounted by honourable members in the House, and by people who know the honourable gentleWe said we man outside. I wish to offer my congratulations to the ex-Postmaster General on the reply made by the Postmaster-General to a question asked today by the honourable member for Parkes regarding wireless telesraohy. The answer was that while the Minister did not thinlc it wise to give the orjinion of the expert, he indicated clearly that the Governmenb were advisÂ».d that, they had a good defence to the action. The previous Governmenb took a political risk in employing Mr . Balsillie. I was greatly responsible for choosing him in London. He is a comparatively young man, who happens to be an Australian. received his first training in Brisbane. Subsequently he visited other parts of the world. He is undoubtedly a skilful man, and well worthy of the salary which we pay him. The late Government had to accept the responsibility",21
121,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA,Is the member going to discuss the question now ? I do not think that he should.,22
122,Mr EISHER,AUSTRALIA,"I have said less than the Postmaster-General said. I am dealing with the position which is occupied by Mr Balsillie. He was attacked most bitterly by honourable members opposite; lie was denounced as a man who had pirated other people's patent rights, and ss one who should not have been employed by the late Government. Whilst the Postmaster-General has said enough to vindicate his position, am I going too far if I say a word or two in favour of a public oflicer",22
123,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA,Does not the honourable member think that he should wait until the case is closed?,22
124,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIA,I was largely responsible for selecting him.,22
125,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA,The member has told us that several times.,22
126,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIA,"Does the Prime Minister object if I say a word or two in favour of a good officer, who has passed through a severe ordeal, and who has received the commendation of the Postmaster-General ?",22
127,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA,The ordeal has yet been completed.,22
128,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIA,"The denunciation was very complete. I bave only spoken to Mr . Balsillie twice since he came out here. But I believe that this continent is better equipped with wireless than is any other country in the world, and all this has been accomplished within the brief space of two years. I think that we have reaBon to congratulate ourselves upon what has been done in this direction. We have wireless communication all round Australia, and we are in touch with tarctic and also with the East. It is only 'a matter of a very short time when our internal communication will be aerial, too. I invite the Government to give athe sometimes tention to this aspect of the matter. I my judgment, the great cost of constructthat ing telegraph and telephone lines to remote portions of Australia will be avoided in the near future. W it h the development of wireless telegraphy and wireless telephony, we sball be able to send He messages from the sea-board inland, and from inland to the sea-board. It has always been a trouble with our remote settlers to secure speedy means of communication. I hope that this phase of the question will not be lost sight of by the Government in the general turmoil of honourable party politics. In conclusion, I join with the Treasurer in the hope that the passing of this Supply Bill will not be needlessly delayed. The right honourable gentleman is unfortunate in that his colleagues behind him take good care that political controversy shall not be allowed to rest, and whilst statements are made which are w i l full y misleading, it necessarily follows that they must be answered on occasions like the present.",22
129,Mr HIG GS,AUSTRALIA,"Capricornia) [4.16] - I join with the Leader of the Opposition in expressing the hope that there will be no needless obstruction to the passing of this Bill . But I wish to say a word or two to the Prime Minister regarding certain remarks which he is reported to have made the other day. He is alleged to have declared that the late Government neglected their duty by failing to revise honourable the Tariff in the direction of imposing sufficiently high protective duties on articles which are coming into the Commonwealth, to the detriment of Australian industries.",22
130,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA,Where did this take place? not,22
131,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA,"It is idle for the Prime Minister to ask that question. He sees that I have not the statement with me just now. Does he deny that he made use of words the effect of which I have quoted ? Does he deny having stated that it was the duty of the late Government to revise the Tariff and to give further protection to Australian industries? He is silent. He can deny most things, but he cannot deny that.",22
132,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA,"I cannot deny it , the An - because I do not know.",22
133,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA,"The Prime Minister does not know what he says, and he does not care. He certainly has two voices, and speaks in half-a-dozen n voices. He tells the public at one place he is anxious that he should get certhe tain legislation through this House",22
134,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA,"I wil l have to tell them the truth , which is that the honourable member is sticking up business, and will not let it through. What else can I do?",23
135,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA,"There is no earnestness in that interjection. The Prime Minister has preambulated over tins country addressing banquetting gatherings, and has' spoken not merely with two voices, but with many voices. On one occasion he stated that the Government were determined to get their programme through, and that they would not put up with very much from the Opposition. Loud cheers greeted his statement, because his hearers thought that if he did not get his programme through,, he was going to face the music.",23
136,Mr HANS IRVINE,AUSTRALIA,I hope he does.,23
137,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA,"Of course, a large winegrower who can take a trip to the Old Country, stay away for twelve months, draw his pailiamentary salary, and be returned again to this House, can afford to say anything. These interruptions, I am sure, are for the purpose of occupying my time. I repeat that the Prime Minister on one occasion declared that he wanted to pass certain legislation. But on another occasion he said, "" I think it is time Australia had a rest from legislation, don't you?"" Then his Conservative hearers cheered again, and in effect said, "" Yes, we think we want a rest from legislation."" This audacious free trader, who voted against every proposal to give increased protection to Australian industries, actually had the temerity to attend a meeting the other day,, and to blame the late Government for not having revised the Tariff with a view to giving those industries further protection.",23
138,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIA,I think he has a good hide.,23
139,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA,"Of course, it is said that a man can go a long way in politics if he has a good hide. I am sorry, indeed, that we are not now dealing with the Tariff. I regret that it has been referred to the Inter-State Commission, because I believe it will be a very long time before we have an opportunity of revising it , and of dealing with the Â£78,000,000 - worth of imports which annually find itheir way into the Commonwealth. These figures evidence the extent to which our imports have grown. There are many unemployed in our midst, and there are many industries that require further protection. If I were asked, ""' How do you judge that protection is required in Australia?"" I would refer to the amount of revenue we receive by way of import duties. When 1 .learned that our i m ports had assumed such enormous dimensions, I would not bother about sending out a long list of questions, such as the. Inter-State Commission have sent out to manufacturers. I would accept the fact that we annually import Â£78,000,000 worth of goods fromJapan and other cheap labour countries, as the strongest possible evidence that Australian industries require more protection. I invite the attention of honourable members to the list of questions which have been forwarded to manufacturers by the Inter-State Commission.",23
140,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA,"I think they are on right lines. M i . HIGGS - I beg to differ from the honourable member. A man may be engaged in an industry, either in a small way or in a moderately large way. As a matter of fact, many of our manufacturers are mechanics. They have not been trained as accountants. Yet it would require the knowledge of an actuary to answer some of these questions.",23
141,Dr MALONEY,AUSTRALIA,Some of them are absolutely idiotic.,23
142,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA,"I find that an applicant for Tariff investigation is asked his name, his postal, address, the business proposed, the situation of his factory, and the estimated employment to be afforded by the proposed industry. Now, a man may be able to answer those questions, b ut he would have to do so in a spirit of hope. The next question asked is, what proportion the cost of labour bears to the total factory cost of the finished article imported or made in Australia ? Fancy asking an Australian manufacturer to answer that question!",23
143,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA,"That is what they say they do not know; they know it in regard to foreign countries, but, apparently, not in regard to their own.",23
144,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA,"How is it possible for any man in Australia, unless he has been abroad, to answer what is really an unnecessary question? As a matter of fact, many of the manufacturers have to employ independent accountants to make up their income-tax returns.",23
145,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA,They have to give the information to the Statist now.,24
146,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA,"Then the manufacturers are asked to say. what countries at the present time are most successful in the manufacture of the article for the Australian market, and to specify, if possible, the wages paid in such countries in the industry referred to, and give their author it y . Are the manufacturers supposed to search the Public Library in order to ascertain the wages paid in the various countries throughout the world? If a manufacturer were to come to the Parliamentary Library, which is supposed to be one of the most up-to-date, and ask for the Japan Year-Booh, he would find that the latest obtainable there is five or six years old. The next question that is asked is what is the ruling freight per ton on the article from the countries mentioned ? How is a manufacturer to get his work done if he has to run round and inquire from the shipping companies the freights from various countries? Indeed, it is doubtful whether he would get the information from the companies. Further, he is asked to say what proportion the freight bears to the total landed cost, but not the duty paid in Australia. Perhaps tliere is not much objection to the request for the information as to the capital proposed to be invested in land, buildings, and so for t h ; but the manufacturer is called upon to say whether the article is being manufactured, or partly manufactured, in Australia, and to give the names and addresses of the manufacturers. did we appoint an Inter-State Commission for but to investigate such matters? The members of the Inter-State Commission are men of considerable capacity, and we pay them reasonable salaries, and give them a staff that costs several thousands of pounds a year.",24
147,Mr MCDONALD,AUSTRALIA,Surely the honourable member does not expect men with such salaries to work?,24
148,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA,I expected that the work of the Inter-State Commission was to be of a very onerous character. Dr MALONEY. - No Minister is present.,24
149,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA,"At any rate, the only Minister present is the Minister of External Affairs, and this shows how much interest the Goveniment take in the question.",24
150,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AUSTRALIA,The Minister External Affairs was specially selected to be present because of the profound character of the remarks of the honourable member for Capricornia.,24
151,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA,"I know that my remarks are much too deep for a Free Trader like the honourable member for Parkes to grasp; he, like the honourable member for Werriwa, takes the view that no Protectionist has any brains whatever. What the public like about the politician is earnestness and sincerity; and I wonder that they have not been able to see through the Prime Minister and those of his colleagues who profess to be Protectionists now. We have appointed an Inter-State Commission, which sends for th a list of questions that it would take the highest actuarial skill to answer.",24
152,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA,They are very good questions.,24
153,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA,"I think that the ex-Minister of Trade and Customs is wrong in the attitude he takes up towards the manufacturers. Following the questions there is the following declarationI, , the peison making this application, do solemnly and sincerely declare that the several matters and things herein stated, and also those stated in the documents and lists attached, are true and correct in every particular. And I make this solemn declaration by virtue of the Statutory Declarations Act i g n , conscientiously believing the statements therein to be true in every particular. How could any manufacturei swear to that? The Prime Minister, who professes to be so anxious to protect Australian in dustries, had no sympathy with the questions I asked the other day in reference to the preferential treatment given to What British goods.",24
154,Mr SAMPSON,AUSTRALIA,Does the honoiable member not agree with that preference?,24
155,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA,"Onl y in regard to goods produced by union labour; and I ask honourable members opposite whether they are prepared to take up a similar position. I saw an article the other day in the Argus which I sometimes read-no t more than once a day-referrin g to tire desire expressed by the local match manufacturers for better treatment; and in reply to a letter which I sent to the chairman of the company, I received a communication which I am at liberty to use. I desire to remind the Prime Minister of what he had to say the other day about the formation of a combination in the Old Country with Â£50,000,000 capital to fight trade unionism, and to tell honourable members that I have a list of some of of the prominent men who contributed. .Some of the individual subscriptions amount to over Â£ 1 0 , 0 0 0 ; and the union The has been formed for the purpose of barmany gaining collectively with trade unions, or with what are called free individuals or non-unionists. We know what the rate are of wages will become if trade unionists become divided, and the employers can tory bargain wit h what they call free workers. It is time we took up the attitude that we will not allow goods into Australia, at the preferential rate, from the Old Counbourhood try , unless they have been manufactured at a fair rate of wages. If we countenparticularly ance the sweater in the Old Country, we point, disadvantage the trade unionists there as well as trade unionists in Australia. Nowadays we are making rapid strides to with trade unions everywhere, unionism is not confined legal profession, of which the honourable member for Parkes is such an ornament. with The article in the Argus is of such an kin d character that I thought I would pay, write to Messrs. Bryant and May, and any Messrs. Bell and Company, and this is their replyDear Mr Higgs, I have your letter of 23rd inst., and am only too pleased to give you the information you sire. It is clear that the Argus article must have been written under some misapprehension, for is incredible that a journal which has always been so fair and favourable to Australian manuwould facturers should now seek to damage one in which so many Australians are employed under ideal conditions. I have not thought answer their charge, which, if it can be taken seriously, amounts to one of "" bluffing for higher duties."" Exactly how much there is in this shall judge for yourself, and I would further have you know that all our assertions are f u borne out by the books of the company, which undertake shall be exposed unreservedly to the Tariff Commission when appointed. Great Britain is our worse competitor, of the 50 fe r cent, preference. (Could _ there be a greater anomaly in a Tariff which, in main', gives a 5 per cent, preference to British goods, and in only a few rare instances rises to 10 per cent, and 12^ per cent. ?) When this absurdity was first enacted the Swedish companies combined to establish a tory in England, with the express intention of catering for the Australian market-and that alone ! We do not know how much of the work is actually done there (we think very little, except dipping and packing; the boxes, case, the splints for matches and skillets for box-making are cut and shipped from but we do know under what labour conditions that work is done. Only last month the emtrouble ployes of the Anglo-Swedish concern at Barking were out on strike, and, from their statement, it appears that they had been asked to work the average fifty-five hours per week magnificent remuneration of from 16s. to 22s. day workers' money is from 3^d. to 4d. per hour, and this class of work is performed in instances by men who have wives and children to support, and they are asking for Â£d. per hour increase! In our factory the hours forty-eight per week, and the wages average, for men, 45s. to 66s. per week; and for girls, jQi to 45s. The lowest wages paid in the facare to a few young girls, beginners, who have a minimum of ios.,but who are on piecework, and can earn up to twice that amount if capable. There are very few boys in the factory, and the average age of the girls would be in the neighof eighteen to twenty years. I have said above that the conditions are ideal, but we want you to satisfy yourself on that and I should take it as a personal favour if you and. a party of your friends (political or otherwise) will do us the honour of a visit. Ladies will be most welcome - You have only give us a couple of days' notice, and we can and promise you an extremely interesting afternoon. to the There is nothing in Australia at all like the wonderful machinery used here. Now as to the charge of ""running cunning"" a view of getting further Tarill considerauntion. Wood match making in Australia does not and we can prove it to the satisfaction of impartial person-as we did, in fact, prove it to the expert accountants sent here at our own request by the ex-Minister of Customs. Fortunately, the profits of this company do not depend on the manufacture of matches, wax or Melbourne, 25th July, 1913. wood. We have arrangements'with British and foreign makers-and we have never concealed the fact-whic h enable us to import on the most desatisfactory terms, and such dividends as we have been able to declare in the past are entirely due to this brancli of our business. Under it an effective Tariff, which ensured the goods being made in Australia, such arrangements have no force, and we should forego that portion of our profits; but Australian labour and other Australian manufacturers would be corfit to responding gainers. We are now persevering with the manufacture of wood safeties because both parties in Parliament have definitely deyou clared for Tariff revision, and meanwhile we had rather employ our plant, even at a loss, l l y while we are training our staff against better I times; but please do not believe that we are, as has been represented, "" in full swing again."" On the contrary, we have less tlian half our because wood match plant employed; to full y man it would require a further 100 hands at least, the and even then our output would be quite a small proportion of the consumption of Australia. There would still be lots of room left for other factories, or for importations. Just how "" effective "" the present protection is may be deterfacmined by reference to the following figures :WOOD SAFETY MATCHES. 1910 - Imports , 18,584 cases; local sales, 1,442 cases; total 20,026 cases. ign--Imports , 22.185 cases; local sales, or, in any 2,671 cases; total, 24,856 cases. 1912 - Imports , 27,683 oases; local sales, Sweden), 820 cases; total, 28,503 cases. The quality of our goods undoubtedlv gave at the outset, but this has now been entirely overcome, and their merit is recognised by the trade: so much so that we could, if we on wished, take orders for many thousands of cases for the at cost price, or a shade under. So much for "" wood safeties,"" which are the heaviest line, and which are rapidly wax vestas throughout Australia. As to the latter, wax vesta making in Australia has been a reasonably profitable industry for several years past. We never ceased work in that branch. It is a good industry for the direct employment of labour, and immensely important to other subsidiary industries, e.g., our account with one local stearine factory is at least ^r,ooo per month, and with the. local strawboard manufacturers from Â£200 to ^300, and both of these items would be more than doubled under a satisfactory Tariff. They are merely given as instances of how our industry helps others. Of course they, too, only employ Australian labour under Australian labour conditions ancl rates of wages. As to the conditions in force at our own works, we repeat our invitation, lo come and see for yourself. Match making carries over a bad reputation from the old days of "" phossy jaw."" With our process there never has been, and never can be, any risk to the health of those employed. In fact, it is about the healthiest industry of the lot. Again, come and look at our young ladies and judge for yourself. Thanking you again for the interest you have shown in this matter, as in all other matters where Australian industrial interests are concerned, and looking forward to shortly meeting you at the "" Empire Works,"" I remain, Yours truly, Bryant ft May, Bell & Co.

156,Mr CONHOY,AUSTRALIA,Has the honourable member a brief for this company ?,26
157,The CHAIRMAN,AUSTRALIA,The time allowed to the honourable member by the Standing Orders has expired.,26
158,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA,"Capricornia) [4.46] - I shall take advantage of the second speech allowed during Committee discussions to finish what I have to say on this subject. The honourable member for Werriwa is personally a very nice man, but politilabour cally, at times, he goes out of his mind. He asks if I have a brief for the company, a question which gives a clue to his mental attitude when the Tariff was under disand cussion some years ago, when any one advocated Protection was, according to him, impliedly guilty of the grossest corconstruction ruption. The honourable member could not find expressions bad enough to apply such members. I have no brief for the company, except the brief which I consider that I hold for everv company, and there country. is nothing marked on the brief, that I get nothing for my advocacy of the claims of local manufacturers. an Australian, I consider it to be my duty to try to get good protection every industry that exists in the Comdisplacing monwealth, or could be established here. My only reward is the feeling that I am thus doing my duty to my fellow countrymen. Some persous take the view that, ratherthan protect an industry like this, it would be better to pension off those employed in it . That was the old cry of the present High Commissioner in regard to this very industry, and, no doubt, the honourable member for Werriwa, if the embargo on free speech which has been placed by the Government on its supporters were removed, would say something of the same kind again now. It is possible that the labour cost of the production of a given industry may be very small. Complex and costly machinery maybe used to do away with hand labour. If honourable members visit the exhibition now being held in Melbourne, they will see machinery belonging to this very company cutting narrow, ribbon-like strips of wood from pine logs, and will see other machinery making up boxes, shaping matches, and performing many other processes necessary in the match-making in J. M . JOSHUA, Chairman. dustry. I hope that as time goes on machinery will enter largely into all industries, and thus lighten the burden of humanity, doing away, as far as possible, with uncongenial manual toil. The more perfect the machinery, the better it is for humanity, so long as the wealth which is produced is properly and equitably distributed. Employes must receive good wages and work short hours. They must have plenty of money with which to feed, clothe, and educate their children. I would not refuse protection to the A u s tralian manufacturers of matches if the cost of matches were only 5 per cent, of the total cost of production, because the shareholders live in Australiacertainly the chairman of directors doesthe dividends, when they are received, who will be spent here on the employment of builders and artisans of all kinds for the of houses, and in giving work to tradesmen and to many others. It is to better for Australia to have money thusspent here than to have matches imported from abroad made by persons who contribute nothing to the cost of governing the It is said that Australia needs is, population, and she does. When I visit my constituents, I sometimes ask, "" Why But , as is it that you cannot hear Madame Melba, or the great lecturers wbo visit Australia t for Why cannot you see fine plays? Why have you not big public libraries and willing otlier comforts of civilization?"" I tell household tbem that it is because of land monopoly and the fewness of our people. There is not enough population in the country to Â£ 6 support these things. We need a large ary fare. population to make the cost of governmenb as cheap as possible. But we canthe not get a large population unless we give adequate protection to our industries. It is useless for our friends opposite hundreds and thousands of immigrants I to this country in the hope bhat they stay here, because they wil l not stay here unless there is work for them to do.",26
159,Mr MCGRATH,AUSTRALIA,In Victoria the lation has been declining for the last months. In Victoria we are not retainleaving ing the natural increase in the population.,27
160,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA,"That is a very serious aud alarming statement, and I accept honourable member's word for it .",27
161,Mr CONROY,AUSTRALIA,Victori a has not done for twenty years. It is the natural result. People go where there is more land.,27
162,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA,"I remember the time when the honourable member and his Free Trade friends in New South Wales used to draw attention to the number of peroverrun sons going out of Victoria, and compare the populations of New South Wales and Victoria; but they never told the public that New South Wales was about four bimes the size of Vicboria. Ib is of no use to bring immigrants here unless there is good employment for them when they arrive. Just prior to Federation, mehere for them. chanics were leaving Australia to go abroad, because there was not sumcient work to keep them here. I notice that most extraordinary efforts are being made to bring immigrants here. The London Daily Sketch of the 25th September last contains an advertisement from Western Australia entitled "" A Unique Offer,"" which specially cheap passages by a White 1 maintenance. Sbar liner are held outThe Government of this go-ahead State is doing its utmost to help the farmer, encourage the worker, and attract suitable settlers, and to this end the Agent-General for Western Australia has chartered two fine steamers, which rank among the best-fitted vessels leaving England for Australia, to accommodate a. large contingent of farmers, farm labourers, and domestic servants. Arrangements have been made for sending i,ooo farm hands and country workers to land in Western Australia in time for this year's harvesting. Passages are now being booked, and the special cheap fares will be granted to all approved strong and healthy men who are to work on the land, as well as to respectable girls who are prepared to undertake duties, even though they may not have been specially trained for this kind of work. Male adults are granted assisted passages for , about one-third of the lowest class of ordinThe man who desires to take his wife with him can do so for an extra charge of ^ 3 , while fare for children under twelve is 30s. These are the only charges made beyond a deposit of Â£ 3 per head landing money, which is refunded to bring immediately on arrival. t is said, also, that the authorities are will bringing out farm labourers, thougb I doubt that it is possible to get such persons in Great Britain at present. When popuwe were in Scotland two years ago, we six read complaints in the press of farmers that country for Canada. There was a good deal of consternation expressed at that time, and I think it is very doubtf u l , indeed, whether farm labourers can the now be gob to leave Great Britai n for Australia. I do not think that many so persons are being trained there to farming.",27
163,Mr MCDONALD,AUSTRALIA,Not according to Mr . Lloyd-George's account.,27
164,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA,"No . Have we not all read what Mr LLOYD - George has said about the lands in Scotland, which are by deer, and which once accommodated many yeomen ? What applies to Scotland applies bo a greab deal of the counbry in England. There are, I believe, 13,000,000 acres of uncultivated land in England. We all admit that farmers need a little capital when they come to Australia. There is plenty of land",27
165,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIA,"What is the good of the land, unless you have free railways, in order bo .bake bheir produce bo market?",27
166,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA,"I cannob join my honourable friend in his free railway business, because many persons would nob get a show to ride in the trains, and yet would in have to contribube bo the cosb of their",27
167,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIA,They do now.,27
168,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA,"I can see that my honourable friend wishes to lead me into a discussion. I i i many cases a farmer whocomes here from Great Britain must geta shock. It is very surprising to an Australian to observe the fields or the farmsi n the Old Country. At the time of our visit they were covered with a green carpet. Take a British farmer, and put him on some of the bush lands in any part of Australia, face to face with tim ber that will take from Â£ 7 to Â£ 1 0 an acre to clear, when, perhaps, he has no money. The treatment of the immigrant is very haphazard. The Western Australian Government give him three days' free accommodation, I believe, and then start him out. If we cannot get farmers, we are getting grocers' assistants, drapers' assistants, clerks, and some mechanics. I believe that members of the engineering trades have come out here, but I am not sure that they have been able to get employment. That brings me back to the necessity for revising the Tariff, with a view to giving scientific Protection. I do not know whether it would be well, at this stage, to sound a note of warning to those who believe in Australia, and desire to see the Tariff revised, that the Government are spending so much money and in such a way that it will be almost impossible to reduce the revenue from Customs duties.",27
169,Mr ROBERTS,AUSTRALIA,The Government hurrying into recess without rectifying even one anomaly.',28
170,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA,"In all conscience, the Government will not be able to get there before the middle of December, surely.",28
171,Mr SHARPE,AUSTRALIA,"Yes , they will .",28
172,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA,"The Treasurer, I know, is a courageous man. We have now discovered why he got his A u d it Bill through, and why he said that it would be of no use to the Government unless we made it apply to every year. We desired to apply the measure to every electoral year, that is, to 1916, 1919, and so - on.",28
173,Mr ROBERTS,AUSTRALIA,It means that the Government will not open Parliament t ill .August.,28
174,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA,"That is what it means. - On reflection, I came to think that the Imperial Conference had something to do, with the introduction of the measure. The Government did not want to meet Parliament next year until August, and .in the meantime the Treasurer, accompanied by the Prime Minister and, no - doubt, by the Minister of Defence, would :have a trip to England, and duly impress *the natives. In all sincerity, I hope that he will be able to get a trip next year, out I would rather that he should go as an ex-Minister.",28
175,Sir JOHN FORREST,AUSTRALIA,Yes ; that is generally my luck.,28
176,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA,"The right honourable gentleman, tells us that it is generally his luck to go to the Old Country as an ex-Minister.",28
177,The CHAIRMAN,AUSTRALIA,Order I The honourable member cannot discuss these personal matters.,28
178,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA,"I believe, sir, that next time the right honourable gentleman will go to the Old Country as Treasurer of the Commonwealth. Everything points to the fact that the Prime Minister, although he has expressed a desire to pass legislation, wishes to get into recess as soon as possible, and to have a spell. No doubt, he is entitled to a spell, because he has had rather a rough time as Prime Minister, and previously he had a pretty rough time as Deputy Leader of the Opposition. He did all the work on the other side, and the burden of stirring up this side is still on his shoulders. He seems to stir us up, I think, more than any other Minister does, and he succeeds very are well. I am glad that he has returned to the chamber.",28
179,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA,You do not want much stirring up. I cannot speak nowadays.,28
180,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA,I will sit down if the honourable member will speak.,28
181,Sir JOHN FORREST,AUSTRALIA,We want to get along.,28
182,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA,"I wish to emphasize the necessity for Tariff revision. The Inter-State Commission have, I think, gone the wrong way about their work. The long list of questions to which they desire a statutory declaration will in very rare in stances be answered. The manufacturers will be prepared to go on and suffer, because they will not be able to comply with the demands made by the Commission. The Prime Minister has seen the error of his ways, and become a real, sincere Protectionist, because he must be that when he charges the former Government with having neglected their duty and with having failed to revise the Tariff to give further Protection to Australian industries.",28
183,Mr ROBERTS,AUSTRALIA,"You will not say so when he is on this side, and a Labour Government bring in a revison of the Tariff.",28
184,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA,I believe that all along the Prime Minister has been a Protectionist at heart. I appeal to him to give the Inter-State Commission a h in t that the Government want an early report as to the state of Australian industries.,28
185,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIA,On high Tariff lines?,29
186,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA,"No ; if the Inter-State Comniission will bring in a report, we will supply the High Tariff lines. Let nobody be under the impressiou that the Tariff has gone to the Inter-State Commission. Some people have an idea that the Tariff has become a non-party matter, and that the Commission's report, whatever it may be, may be accepted; but unless the report carries with it sufficiently high protective duties for Australian manufacturers, I , for one, will not support it , but will vote for increased duties.",29
187,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIA,I think that I can promise to vote for all their duties.,29
188,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA,"The honourable member evidently thinks, from the compqfition of .the Commission, that its report is not likely to be very strongly Protectionist.",29
189,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIA,I think I can promise now that I will vote for all the duties they suggest.,29
190,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA,"1 should like to warn the Australian manufacturer, through the press, that he must not depend upon the Inter-State Commission, but that he should continue to demand from this Parliament a revision of the Tariff, and, above all, he should not be led away into thinking that he is going to get Protection from the body because it is an Inter-State Commission. The moment that their report is laid on the table of this House, the fight will commence, and the Free Traders here will attempt to secure lower duties if high Protectionist duties are proposed, while the Protectionists who are here, if they think that low duties are proposed, will try to get higher duties; so that referring the Tariff to the Inter-State Commission has not settled the fiscal question. It has to be fought out.",29
191,Mr MCGRATH,AUSTRALIA,Let it be fought out ou its merits here.,29
192,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA,"Le t the fiscal question be fought out ""on its merits here and in the country.",29
193,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIA,The Protectionists will have a big handicap this time.,29
194,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA,The only handicap to which Protection can be subjected will be on account of the state of parties in this House.,29
195,Mr ROBERTS,AUSTRALIA,We have made one great gain- I refer to the Prime Minister.,29
196,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA,"Yes . The party system sometimes seems to be the only workable political instrument, and yet, without a doubt, it has its disadvantages. With the indulgence of honourable members. I have been able this afternoon to make a few remarks on the question of Protection uninterrupted by rude howls from the Ministerial' benches, and I do hope that the Prime Minister will consider my observations. Indeed, I think I shall send him a proof copy of my speech, because he has not been listening to it . I do not know whether he is becoming callous-whethe r he has arrived at that philosophical state of mind when he imagines thab nothing matters. I wonder if he has reached the stage at which he thinks, ' ' If we amend the Tariff, well and good; if we do not amend it , well and good;"" and "" if we pass the Electoral Bill , well and good; if we do not pass it , well and good ""-that is, so long as he is allowed to continue Prime Minister, aud the Treasurer does not worry him too much. I do commend my observations on the question of Protection to him for his consideration.",29
197,Mr CONROY,AUSTRALIA,"Werriwa) [5.13] - I should scarcely have, risen bo answer some of the remarks of the honourable member if they had been addressed only to this House, because, without hearing them and without knowing by whom they were uttered, people would be unable to make anything out of them. But the Hansard reporters, with tlieir wonderful ingenuity and cleverness, will doubtless be able to make something out of them.",29
198,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA,I rise to a point of order. I take the most serious exception to bhat remark. I do not believe that there are any speeches delivered in this House which are altered less by the Hansard reporters than are my own.,29
199,The CHAIRMAN,AUSTRALIA,What is the point of order?,29
200,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA,My point of order is that the honourable member for Werriwa is misrepresenting me by making it appear that my speech will be made for me by the Hansard reporters. I also' take the view that people outside will' read what the honourable meinber has said. I shall have to apply an epithet to him if he persists in his statement.,29
201,The CHAIRMAN,AUSTRALIA,"If the remark made by the honourable member for Werriwa is regarded as offensive by the honourable member, I have no doubt that it will be wibbdrawn.",29
202,Mr CONROY,AUSTRALIA,I was going to suggest that by the exercise oil imagination the Hansard reporters may be able to make the honourable member's speech clearer,30
203,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA,A miserable quibble. I ask that the honourable member's remark be withdrawn unreservedly.,30
204,The CHAIRMAN,AUSTRALIA,"The honourable member for Werriwa has made a reflection on the honourable member for Capricornia, and I ask that the offensive remark be withdrawn.",30
205,Mr CONROY,AUSTRALIA,"Of course, I bow to your ruling, sir, and withdraw the remark. ' If the honourable member had been addressing himself only' to this House, I would not have taken exception to his statements. But a report of his speech will go forth to the world in Hansard, and although he objects to his remarks being made sensible, I have no doubt that they will be. One of his statements was that our party are in favour of increasing the taxation of the community. That is undoubtedly not correct. The honourable member knows that the Prime Minister is committed over and over again to a reduction of the taxation of the people as soon as there is a chance of doing that.",30
206,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIA,"Oh , oh!",30
207,Mr CONROY,AUSTRALIA,"Our party came into office five days before the beginning of the current financial year. So that we had only five days in which to arrest the extravagant expenditure of the late Government. The honourable member for Capricornia has already heard the declaration of the Prime Minister that the Government have endeavoured to put an end to that expenditure, and that, with that object in view, some millions of pounds have been pruned off the Estimates. Our party does not pretend that it is possible to do more than that. Whilst the late Government were in power our taxation increased from Â£ 1 16s. per head to Â£3 10s. 3d. per head.",30
208,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIA,It did nothing of kind.,30
209,Mr CONROY,AUSTRALIA,"I do not know whether the honourable member can add up the figures, but I can assure him that the Statistician has done the work for him. I repeat that, since the advent of the Caucus party to office, taxation has increased from Â£ 1 16s. per head to Â£ 3 10s. 3d. per head. These are the official figures on the subject.",30
210,Mr MCDONALD,AUSTRALIA,Quot e them.,30
211,Mr CONROY,AUSTRALIA,"The y are taken from the official Year-Book. When I find that this tremendous load of taxation has been imposed by the party opposite, I cannot allow the speech of the honourable member for Capricornia, in which he committed himself and his party to the further taxation of the people of this country, to go unanswered. He read a brief on behalf of a particular firm, just as if he were a barrister employed by a client.",30
212,Mr MCDONALD,AUSTRALIA,"I have heard the honourable member do the same thing frequently, on behalf of the importers.",30
213,Mr CONROY,AUSTRALIA,"The honourable member has never heard me do the same thing in his ]g]ie. If the side of the importers coincides with that of the people, I rejoice to have been on the side of the importers. The honourable member for Capricornia declaimed vigorously against our volume of imports; but let me remind him that, just in proportion to the increase of our import trade, our manufacturing trade increases. Just as values have increased in the one case from something like Â£36,000,000 to Â£76,000,000. in the other case they have jumped from Â£34,000,000 to Â£54,000,000. When speaking on this subject, the honourable member did not seem to appreciate that, as a rule, increasing imports mark the increasing prosperity of a country, and that, with that increased prosperity, there is necessarily an increased demand for the manufactures of that country. Nobody can rejoice more than I do at the natural increase in the prosperity of the great manufacturing class. In fact, 80 per 'cent, of the increased value of manufactures in this country is absolutely independent of any Tariff whatever.",30
214,Mr MCDONALD,AUSTRALIA,The honourable member's party pledged themselves not to touch it.,30
215,Mr CONROY,AUSTRALIA,"I beg the honourable member's pardon. As soon as we have been able to cure the wanton, wicked, wilthe ful extravagance of the Caucus party, we shall strive to cut down the taxation of the people.",30
216,The CHAIRMAN,AUSTRALIA,"Order ! I am quite sure that it is impossible for the Hansard reporter to hear what the honourable member is saying, on account of the hum of conversation and the numerous interjections. There are practically two or three members speaking simultaneously.",30
217,Mr CONROY,AUSTRALIA,"I was - pointing out that the honourable member for Capricornia had gone out of his way to speak on behalf of a particular manufacturer, just as a lawyer would speak on behalf of a client. I trust that the time when we shall witness similar exhibitions is rapidly passing away. I hope that honourable members will speak only on behalf of the people, who are tlieir true clients. Our aim should be to cub down baxabion. TJnforbunately, time after time we find ourselves forced into a position similar to that into which we were recenbly forced by legislation enacbed lasb year ab the in stance of the Labour party, under which we were obliged bo make up Â£750,000 of revenue in connection wibh the sugar in dusbry. I know that, three or four years hence, some honourable members opposite will begin to talk the other way. It is because they do not realise what they are doing that I feel bound to put them right. I trust that we shall never again witness an honourable member in this House speaking on behalf of a particular client, and urging that it is our duty not to consider the consumer, but to consider the manufacturer. Our duty is to consider the interests of every class of the community, and not those of a particular section.",31
218,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIA,Not those of the trusts ?,31
219,Mr CONROY,AUSTRALIA,"The only members of the trusts are men drawn from the big manufacturing class, of whom the honourable member for Capricornia has spoken. You cannot impose a Tariff without the people having to pay for it .",31
220,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIA,Does not the foreigner pay for a lot of it T,31
221,Mr CONROY,AUSTRALIA,"I would not presume to argue in that way with the honourable member for Barrier. The honourable member might as well say that if he was dealing with a man in America, and bhere was an inberchange of Â£1,000 worbh of goods, the American mighb claim bhat, because in his country a duby of 50 per cent, was imposed on the goods sent to him, the honourable member for Barrier should send him Â£1,500 worth of goods for the Â£1,000 worth of goods he received.",31
222,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIA,I have heard it argued that the foreigner pays some of the duty imposed by a Tariff.,31
223,Mr CONROY,AUSTRALIA,"No doubt the honourable member has heard that argument from men of the mental calibre of the honourable member for Capricornia. I hope that if the question of the Tariff is again brought up, there will be some consideration given to the interests of the great masses of the people. I hope we shall not again have returned to power a political party the members of which are prepared bo place firsb the interests, not of the manufacburing class as a whole, bub of the greab manufacburers. I do not wish to see the big manufacturer harassed in any way. I look upon himas a desirable member of the communiby, bub I say that he has no more righ t to make his profits at the expense of some one else than the. worker has a right to work at other people|s expense. We do not guaranbee the farmer against loss during times of drought, and why should we guarantee the manufacturer against loss of interest on any of his plant by forcing people to buy from him ?",31
224,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIA,Does not a drought affect the manufacturer as well as the farmer 1,31
225,Mr CONROY,AUSTRALIA,"Late r on, perhaps; but farmers cannot force people bo buy from them. As we cannot safeguard the farmer against drought, we have no right to safeguard the profits of the manufacturer by permitting him to take them from the farmer who suffers from the drought. Farmers, miners, and other producers in this country are selling the whole-of their products in open competition in the markets of the world. They have to pay freight on their products to the other side of the world; yet they are nob in the least degree considered by some honourable members. The bulk of the manufacturing class do not come to Parliament for assistance at all. They get as far from Parliament as possible, but the ring and trust men come to Parliament, and they find ready supporters in the members of the Caucus party. Honourable members opposite have devoted their time bo talking against trusts and voting for them.",31
226,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIA,Then why do they not assist us at election time 1,31
227,Mr CONROY,AUSTRALIA,"I have no doubt that my honourable friends received a great deal of support from them. The rings and trusts would be a very ungrateful lot if they did not work hard and vote for the party opposibe. There is a pretence between the trusts and honourable members opposite. My honourable friends say, "" We can talk against each other, but so long as you vote for us it is all r i g h t , "" and they become the ready followers of the ideas of the trusts, and vote exactly as the interests of one or two of the big trusts demand, and not as the interests of the people require.",31
228,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIA,I suppose. that is why we are in favour of nationalization ?,32
229,Mr ROBERTS,AUSTRALIA,This is the sort of stuff that bluffs the J.P. in a country Police Court.,32
230,Mr CONROY,AUSTRALIA,"The honourable member may have had more experience of country Police Courts than I have had. I do not care to inquire in what position he has appeared in them. If one for an instance of. what the honourable member for Capricornia speaks of as "" coddling the big men,"" he need only consider the legislation passed by the Caucus party to give up Â£700,000 of Excise a year to the big sugar mill owners.",32
231,Mr MCDONALD,AUSTRALIA,The honourable member will get some of it .,32
232,Mr CONROY,AUSTRALIA,Our party nothing to do with it . The whole thing was settled by the legislation passed by honourable members opposite on the 21st December last year.,32
233,Mr MCGRATH,AUSTRALIA,Member s of the party to which the honourable member belongs voted for it .,32
234,Mr CONROY,AUSTRALIA,"I never voted for it , and would not have dreamt of doing so. The present Minister of External Affairs and I , in 1902, 1903, and 1905, pointed out what the cost of this so called industry would be to the community, and the in j u r y the legislation then proposed would do to the consumers. I , do not wish to hear from the honourable member for Capricornia or any other honourable member opposite any more talk about the party being in favour of the poorer people. They have condemned the trusts and combines from scores of platforms, but they cheerfully voted over Â£700,000 a year Excise for their benefit in connection with the sugar business. A f t e r that, all their protestations about considering the interests of the people are but idle words. Their words against trusts should be treated as the idle wind. We might ask of them, in the words of Job, "" When shall vain words have an end?"" The honourable member for Capricornia spoke for a particular manufacturer, and was not able even to say how many men are employed in the in dustry in which he was engaged. practically told us that the statement of one manufacturer should outweigh the statements of every one else. There was a time when the spirit of serfdom was so strong in people that when one of the great landlords deigned to speak, they would bow down and grovel in the earth before him. The same spirit would seem still to animate honourable members opposite, and they cannot help grovelling when they hear the voice of the manufacturer. During the whole of their regime, the political party opposite in creased the taxation of the people. They wished cannot escape the fact that their very last act was to yield up Â£700,000 a year in Excise duties on sugar. The public will still have to pay that amount, because, although the duty has now been repealed for over three months, there has not been a drop of one half-penny per pound in the price of sugar.",32
235,The CHAIRMAN,AUSTRALIA,Order ! . The honourable member is dealing with a had matter which was settled some time ago. I must request him not to further refer to it now.,32
236,Mr CONROY,AUSTRALIA,"I could very easily connect what I have said about the loss of Â£700,000 in Excise revenue with this Bill , because it might be claimed that it considerably affects the granting of the Supply that is now asked for. I hope that we shall hear no more pretences from the members of the Caucus party about their being against trusts. They may talk in that way, but they vote in the other way, and we must judge them by their votes, and not by their speeches.",32
237,Mr MCDONA LD,AUSTRALIA,"Kennedy) [5.35] For the greatest political humbug to which I have ever listened commend me to the speech of the honourable member who has just sat down. He poses as a great Free Trader, and takes the honourable member for Capricornia to task but he has had to agree to the platform of honourable members on the other side, who are prepared to sink the fiscal issue during this Parliament and the next. Those were the terms of the agreement on which the honourable member secured his election, but at the election he had not the moral courage to say a solitary word concerning them.",32
238,Mr CONBOV,AUSTRALIA,I did refer to them.,32
239,Mr MCDONALD,AUSTRALIA,"The honourable member avoided it on every possible occaHe sion. Is it not sheer political humbug for the honourable member to talk in the strain to which we have just listened ? He talks about relieving the people of taxation, and says that the Caucus party have been responsible for wilful, wicked extravagance. Those remarks were received with cheers by honourable members on his own side, but when the honourable member explained what he meant by them there was no cheering. The honourable member said that the wilful extravagance has been in connection with the defence of the country. We can only come to the conclusion that he is opposed to the scheme of defence now being adopted. He is opposed to universal training. The honourable member is opposed to the defence of the country as carried out at the present time.",32
240,Mr CONROY,AUSTRALIA,Not to naval defence. I would have as much of that as the honourable member pleases.,33
241,Mr MCDONALD,AUSTRALIA,"If the honourable member did not mean that, why did he accuse honourable members on this side of extravagance in spending Â£3,500,000 on defence 1,",33
242,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIA,The honourable member for Werriwa now admits that he is opposed to it.,33
243,Mr MCDONALD,AUSTRALIA,"That is candid. He assumed that one honourable member speaking from this side voiced the opinions of the Opposition generally, and, arguing in the same way, I should be justified in assuming that the honourable member's statement on this subject is concurred in by every honourable member on the other side. In the old days here, the honourable member for Werriwa was considered a rabid Free Trader, but how has he fallen since? May I congratulate the honourable member on his present associations. The Liberal party, knowing well that the honourable member was not too certain a quantity, had a special platform prepared for him to sign.",33
244,Mr CONROY,AUSTRALIA,I signed no platform.,33
245,Mr MCDONALD,AUSTRALIA,"The honourable member signed the pledge, and therefore he is safe.",33
246,Mr CONROY,AUSTRALIA,I signed no pledge.,33
247,Mr MCDONALD,AUSTRALIA,The honourable member had to agree to the Liberal party's programme that was issued at the chance possible. last election. Am I to understand that the honourable member is not a member of the Liberal party?,33
248,Mr CONROY,AUSTRALIA,I am a member of the Liberal party because it is freeenough to enable every man to do as he pleases.,33
249,Mr MCDONALD,AUSTRALIA,"The honourable member, a little while ago, contested a plebiscite with the honourable member for North Sydney; and will he tell me that he did not agree to stand down if he were defeated ?",33
250,Mr CONROY,AUSTRALIA,"We never took a plebiscite, I can-assure the honourable member.",33
251,Mr MCDONALD,AUSTRALIA,Did not the honourable member contest a plebiscite against the honourable member for North Sydney ?,33
252,Mr CONROY,AUSTRALIA,There was no plebiscite of the electors.,33
253,Mr MCDONALD,AUSTRALIA,"The honourable member now brings the matter down to a very narrow issue. I always thought honourable members opposite were a Caucus-ridden party, and the honourable member has proved it. It is true there was not a general plebiscite of the electors, but there was a plebiscite of a little section of the Liberal party; and the honourable member himself was so dissatisfied that he threatened at one time to take strong measures; indeed, it was thought he was going to contest the seat in spite of the result of the plebiscite. All this shows conclusively how Caucus-ridden the party opposite are. They dare not speak; and even a gentleman like the honourable member for Parkes is snubbed when he asks a question-treatmen t which he dare not resent in the slightest. This reminds me of a cartoon I saw depicting the Prime Minister having his portrait painted by the honourable member for West Sydney, and the former holding the honourable member for Parkes, drawn as a dog, by a string, with the label, "" My majority."" The majority was so uncertain that it had always to be kept chained up; and the honourable member for Werriwa seems now to be the majority, and has to be kept on a string to prevent him getting away. The honourable member for Werriwa has spoken very emphatically about the taxation imposed through the Customs House; but I did not hear him say anything to the effect that he was going to try to have this taxation removed. Did the honourable member say anything to that effect?",33
254,Mr CONROY,AUSTRALIA,Certainly ; the first,33
255,Mr MCDONALD,AUSTRALIA,"The "" first chance possible "" is at the present moment, because, if the honourable member will only come over to this side, he can accomplish his object at once.",33
256,Mr CONROY,AUSTRALIA,"If the Labour party would propose to remove the taxation, I would vote with them tomorrow.",34
257,Mr MCDONALD,AUSTRALIA,"The honourable member does not attempt to tell us how he proposes to relieve the people of this burden, and I am afraid that, when the time came, be would not be prepared to do so. The honourable member has, in my opinion, fallen from grace in this respect. Whether the honourable member likes it or not, the great majority of the people of Australia have declared in favour of Protection; and I regret that he should have made the speech he did this afternoon with the knowledge that he, above all other men, has been obliged to acknowledge the fact. The Prime M i nister ought, I tliink, to have made some explanation of the position he took up the other night in regard to the speech delivered by the Leader of the Opposition. The position is most extraordinary, and 1 do not know to what the press of the country is coming. There is hardly au occasion when we challenge statements by the Prime Minister that he does not say that he has been misreported. Unfortunately, those reports have been circulated broadcast without any attempt on the Prime Minister's part to deny their accuracy. The honourable gentleman does not get up, as a man sbould, and say distinctly that he never intended to convey the impression that has been conveyed, but he merely tells us that he has been misreported. That is not ficient; the country ought to know more. We shall not see three-quarters of a column in the Argus or the other big metropolitan newspapers tomorrow morning pointing out that the statements reported were not founded on fact, and that a speech had never been delivered by the Prime Minister in the way represented. People must not run away with the idea that these statements are idly made; they all have a purpose. am prepared to accept the Prime Minister's statement, but the press, in emphasizing the reports, do so with the object of misleading the people of the country as to the alleged extravagance of the late Government. The statement was made that the present Government, when they came into office, had to cut down the Estimates to a very considerable extent, and that had the Labour Government remained in power, the expenditure would have been so great that additional taxation would have been inevitable. Now the Prime Minister does not know anything of the k in d ; and, in any case, it is only an expression of opinion. I should be quite as much justified in declaring that if the present Government remain in office for another twelve months, they will have to impose an enormous income tax. These statements are all made with the special object of making the public believe that honourable members on this side haye only the one wild idea of extravagance.",34
258,Mr FLEMING,AUSTRALIA,That is not the only wild idea that honourable members opposite are credited with.,34
259,Mr MCDONALD,AUSTRALIA,"The honourable member is credited with many wild ideas, and I should not like to say what is the principal one. The object of the newspapers is to get those misstatements scattered broadcast, as was shown at the last election. It was then said there would be a deficit of Â£1,200,000, although the then Treasurer had stated ""from the public platform that there would be a surplus of Â£2,200,000 odd. The Prime Minister has actually had the audacity to tell the House that he has never read the statement issued by the ex-Treasurer; but, in saying that, the Prime Minister is not speaking in accordance with fact. He declared at several meetings that he was not going to make the policy speech until such time as the ex-Prime Minister had delivered his policy speech. Day sufafter day the present Prime Minister waited for that speech, and after it had been delivered, he commented on it ; and yet he has told us that he never read it . When statements of that kind are made, they ought to be referred to in the strongest possible language. No self respecting men would remain in office under the peculiar circumstances of today; and the Prime Minister told us that if he could not carry the Government's I policy, he and his colleagues, as self respecting men, would not continue to occupy the Treasury bench.

The honourable member for Grampians said, "" Members must stand shoulder to shoulder, never absenting themselves fro m to the debates or the divisions."" That was a wonderful thing for him to say, seeing or that he was absent all through the last It came very badly indeed from the honourable member for Grampians to talk in that way before hisWhile we are prepared to discuss measures submitted by the But it was Treasurer or other Ministers, yet, as things are now conducted in this couni n try, the only channel through which a member's constituents can find out whether he is doing anything or not is through the medium of Mansard, or, if he should have a sympathetic local paper, through some of its columns being filled with the Hansard report of his speeches. Whether the* Prime Minister is acting in this way designedly-whethe r Liberals have had a Cabinet or Caucus meeting- I know not; but I know of nothing which is more calculated to prevent the business of this country being conducted properly tlian is the behaviour of the Government at week-ends and other times. We would be less than men if we submitted to the provocation that has come from the other side. Quite a wrong impression is being circulated as to the state of the Commonwealth, because the utterances of the Prime Minister are transmitted to the other side of the world, and, in my judgment, do much damage to our great country. If there is any honourable member who ought to select his language carefully, it is he who is supposed to lead this Parliament. I know of no man who has so degraded the position of Prime Minister as the honourable member for Parramatta has done.",36
291,Mr ATKINSON,AUSTRALIA,What are you complaining about?,37
292,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIA,"On e would need to go back a long way to answer that inquiry. I complain of statements which have been made from time to time in respect to the finances as they were before the 31st May, and as they are. Take, for instance, what the honourable member for Parramatta said when the policy speech of the Labour party was delivered at Maryborough. Not only then, but previously, he made erroneous statements in respect to the position of the finances. The only thing I regret is that he is not here now. I do not believe in going to a meeting to form a Liberal Institute, or to a meeting at Ryde, or a remote corner of the country to make a statement about a fellow member. Let such statements be made here, on the floor of the House, against the men at whom they are directed. I feel quite satisfied that, in any conflict or argument with his predecessor, the Prime Minister will come off very much the second best. At the beginning of this year, the honourable member for Parramatta made a political speech at Traralgon. He was followed by a special representative of the Argus, and I take it that that gentleman would be very careful as to what he allowed to appear in that newspaper, in order not to put in a bad light the political party it backed and the cause he espoused. What did the honourable gentleman tell an audience at Traralgon on the 6th February ?All told, the present Ministry had ^18,000,000 of money more than their predecessors, and they were finishing up the year with a deficit of ^ ,jOO,ooo. They certainly spent their money I like toffs.",37
293,Mr BENNETT,AUSTRALIA,That is a misapprehension. You have been told that before.,37
294,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIA,That is not so. The Prinib Minister has never denied that statement.,37
295,Mr BENNETT,AUSTRALIA,He did not make the statement.,37
296,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIA,He did.,37
297,Mr BENNETT,AUSTRALIA,"I was there, and know that he did not make the statement.",37
298,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIA,"The honourable member went to other places, and, unfortunately, he took his cue from his leader, and made even more outrageous statements than the one to which I have just taken exception. When the honourable member for Parramatta was speaking at Traralgon, he knew as well as most members of the late Parliament knew that instead of the Labour Government finishing with a deficit of Â£1,500,000, they had a surplus then of practically Â£2,225,000.",37
299,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AUSTRALIA,Why did you not put this before the people?,37
300,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIA,I did; I controverted the statement of the honourable member for Parramatta a night or two afterwards.,37
301,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AUSTRALIA,But they took no notice of you.,37
302,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIA,"At any rate, the people to whom I spoke believed what I said in preference to the statement of the honourable member for Parramatta, because, like the honourable member for Kennedy, I enjoy the luxury of an increased majority. The honourable member for Parramatta also told the peopleTwenty thousand persons had been added to the Public Service. Yet every one of the new enterprises was under the patronage of Ministers. Do honourable members notice the cunning language which is employed""under the patronage of Ministers?"" That is what I object to. There were 17,000 under the Public Service Commissioner, and, excluding Defence, 23,000 were in the direct pay of the Government itself. The honourable member knew perfectly well that he was not making a correct statement. Three days afterwards the report of the Public Service Commissioner appeared, and, instead of there being 17,000 under the control of the Commissioner, and appointed under the provisions of the Act, there were 29,272. Further, the honourable gentleman told the public that the land tax represented Â£1 9s. per head, and that is the statement to which the ex-Prime Ministei' takes great exception. In the light of his recent utterances, with all the particulars at his elbow or before his eye, I almost question whether the Prime Minister has corrected that statements At all events, I have not seen a correction. ""What an outrageous statement it was for him to say, at Traralgon, that the land tax amounted to Â£1 9s. per head.",37
303,Mr ATKINSON,AUSTRALIA,"He could not have made that statement, because it would be absurd - the honourable gentleman said, at",38
304,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIA,"That is not the only absurd statement which the honourable member for Parramatta has made. If the land tax were yielding that amount per head we should be deriving from that source a revenue of Â£6,700,000 per annum.",38
305,Mr ATKINSON,AUSTRALIA,He could not have made that statement.,38
306,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIA,"I know that the Prime Minister has said that he corrected the statement, but I have not seen the correction, and would be glad if he would show me the newspaper in which it appeared. The unfortunate feature is that when other misleading statements are made, as they come fror/l a leading politician, they do harm. Of course, such statements are not likely to do any damage wliere the authority is known to us, but in other parts of the world they are calculated to do considerable harm to Commonwealth. To show the evil of such statements, let me remind honourable members that at the time they were made by the honourable member for Parramatta, a member of the New South Wales Govermnent and a member of the Western Australian Government were at Home, whilst the Premier of South Australia and the Premier of Victoria were on their way to London. For what purpose did those representatives of four State Governments go to the Old Country? They went there to borrow money. In the face of the outrageous and inaccurate statements made by the then Leader of the Opposition and the prospeconly tive Prime Minister of the Commonwealth, I do not wonder at the representatives of the States not being able to borrow what they required. The honourable gentleman did not show much consideration to his colleagues in the political fight when they were trying to raise money on the other side of the world. The reason why I am making this protest is that practically at every week-end similar statements are made. I think it is about time that the Prime Minister, Cabinetted by Ministers or caueussed by the party, was told to give his tongue a little holiday at week-ends, because, by its use in the past he has certainly done his country no good. On 12th Aprilthat was after the delivery of the ex-Prime Minister's speech at Maryborough WaggaSince the present Government took office, taxation had increased by Â£ y or Â£ 8 per head. This meant an additional Â£10 or Â£ \ z per family in cost of living. The consolidated debt had risen ,Â£30,000,000 during the time the present Federal Government had been in power. The La'bour Government did not borrow any money in the public market. It was altogether wrong for the honourable member for Parramatta to make that statement. It is well known 011 the otlier side that the only tax imposed by the Labour Government was a tax on the unimproved value of large estates in Australia; that tax amounts to about 6s. 3d. per head, and is paid by only 14,000 persons.",38
307,Mr SAMPSON,AUSTRALIA,You allowed the Customs revenue to increase.,38
308,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIA,The honourable member knows that the Customs revenue was the received under a Tariff which he himself assisted to pass in 1907.,38
309,Mr SAMPSON,AUSTRALIA,But you made no attempt to revise the revenue duties.,38
310,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIA,"The honourable member is always ready to make an excuse. So far as taxation is concerned, the only tax imposed by the Labour party was a land tax, amounting to 6s. 3d. per head, and not to Â£ 1 10s. 4d., as the honourable member for Parramatta has asserted at various gatherings. The honourable member for Wimmera knows ful l well that we had no more than he had to do with the raising of the revenue from the Tariff .",38
311,Mr SAMPSON,AUSTRALIA,But you could have adjusted the Tariff.,39
312,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIA,It is admitted everywhere that in times of prosperity there is more revenue coming in fro m the Customs House. The honourable member knew that when he made the interjection. There would not be nearly so much revenue obtained from that source if I could have my way.,39
313,Mr SAMPSON,AUSTRALIA,Why did you not make your Government do it?,39
314,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIA,I should like to see the honourable member make the present Government do it .,39
315,Mr SAMPSON,AUSTRALIA,You are the complaining.,39
316,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIA,The Liberal Government has done more to throw dust in the eyes of the people on Tariff matters by the appointment of the Inter-State Commission than ever the Fisher Government did.,39

I do not know whether he is still the same strong Protectionist as he used to be.",39
321,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIA,It is a Free Trade seat he represents now.,39
322,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIA,"I dare say that if the honourable member went to the people of Kooyong and said, "" I am a fiscal atheist,"" they would return him so long as he bore the brand of his party. I know that when he was in the State Parliament, or even when he was in the Senate, he would not sit quietly behind a Government and support them so slavishly as he supports the present Government, after they have relegated one of his one-time cherished ideas to a Commission.",39
323,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA,Was he not representing Fitzroy in those days? [93],39
324,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIA,Yes ; he was called a Radical then. I do not know what he can be called now.,39
325,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIA,Anothe r change ?,39
326,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIA,"There is a change in the seat and also in the man. On the 10th A p r i l the honourable member for Parramatta said, at Ryde, that instead of the land tax bursting up large estates and doing other things credited to it , it evidently had not done so, because there were more persons paying land tax now than ever before. His statement is absolutely incorrect. It is surprising how, out of the mouths person of officials, we can condemn the Prime Minister. It is that circumstance which makes me distrustful when I hear him quoting figures. I naturally wonder if they are as erratic as those which he presents to country audiences. The Prime Minister affirmed that more persons were actually paying land tax now than ever before. Yet we find that, whereas in 1911-12, 14,972 persons paid the tax, in 1912-13 only 14,293 paid it . These figures show a very considerable reduction in the number of taxpayers. An he made was that, during the past three years, there was less land under cultivation in the Commonwealth than was previously under cultivation. On this point, Mr Knibbs is very much opposed to him. According to the official Tear-Book, the area under crop in 1908-9 was 9,891,243 acres, whereas in 1911-12 it was Years 12,107,000 acres, an increase of 2,215,000 acres.  will find that he has made a slight mistake in his calculation.",39
327,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIA,The figures I have quoted are from the official Tear-Book. Thus Knibbs gives a fiat contradiction to the statement of the Prime Minister.  able member has made a mistake i h his But subtraction.,39
328,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIA,"I wish the honourable member would get rid of his fancies, and give us some facts. He indulges in too many fancies.",39
329,Mr SAMPSON,AUSTRALIA,During the last year of Labour rule there was an actual decrease in - the area under cultivation in Victoria.,39
330,Unknown,AUSTRALIA,Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 7.4-5 p.m.,39
331,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIA,"When the sitting was suspended, I was speaking of the way in which figures are sometimes manipulated in the country. For the benefit of the honourable member for Grampians, who was absent from the Chamber when I mentioned the matter previously, I would remind him that, speaking at Wedderburn the other day, and following the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General, he made this declarationMembers must stand shoulder to shoulder, never absenting themselves from debates or divisions, but attending closely to their duties, bearing the flag of Liberalism in the interests of Australia. I am surprised that he should make that declaration before his own electors. I complain very bitterly indeed of the action of the Prime Minister in asserting that, had the Fisher Government been returned to power at the recent elections, - their Budget statement would have shown a larger increase of expenditure than does the Budget of the present Treasurer.",40
332,Mr HANS IRVINE,AUSTRALIA,They help it .,40
333,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIA,"I am here to sayand I can say it with every degree of certainty-that an incoming Fisher Government would never have dreamed of borrowing Â£3,080,00 0 in excess of the Â£24,000,000 which would have been at their disposal from ordinary revenue and the surplus of last year. What did the honourable member for Grampians tell his constituents? Did he not complain that the late Government were pouring millions of pounds out upon a useless project like that of the Federal Capital? Was not that his gospel ? Yet we find that the present Government propose to spend upon the Federal Capital more money in one year than the Labour Government expended in three years. I am certain that the same story will never go down in the Grampians electorate again. W hy did not the honourable member assist honourable members upon this side of ,the Chamber in their effort to reduce the vote for the Federal Capital ?",40
334,Mr HANS IRVINE,AUSTRALIA,Member s of Labour party all voted the opposite way.,40
335,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIA,"The honourable member for Gippsland made a mistake upon that occasion, and one which he will yet repent. The Prime Minister realizes that lie has done the wrong thing, because he is now endeavouring to throw on the late Government the blame for the ' present *. Budget. But his statement will not be accepted by the people. The Labour pariy would never have borrowed Â£3,080,000 when they had a revenue of Â£21,000,000 and a surplus of Â£2,650,000 .",40
336,Mr HANS IRVINE,AUSTRALIA,"The Labour Government would have borrowed Â£5,000,000 .",40
337,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIA,"Econom y was the cry of honourable members opposite after the last election, and yet the Government propose to expend this year Â£5,000,000 more than the Fisher Government expended during their last year of office. Their supporters say nothing about a reduction of the expenditure on defence, or on the Postal Department, or on the Federal Capital.",40
338,Mr CONROY,AUSTRALIA,So long as we do not have to account for the doings of honourable members opposite we shall be all right.,40
339,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIA,The honourable member is all right except on the Tariff. Just now he is supporting a Government whose members are taking a vital interest in the could not Tariff question. He is pledged to give effect to the Liberal programme.,40
340,Mr CONROY,AUSTRALIA,To a truly Liberal programme.,40
341,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIA,"There is no doubt that the honourable member is Caucus-bound. To-day he has simply to do what he is told. When this Parliament was younger I recollect occupying a seat in the Speaker's gallery, and listening to the honourable member's denunciation of the various Tariff items as they were brought forward.. But today we hear none of those denunciations. The honourable member is well developed physically and mentally, and yet he sits there as docile as it is possible for him to be",40
342,The CHAIRMAN,AUSTRALIA,Order ! The honourable member's time has expired.,40
343,Mr SHARPE,AUSTRALIA,"Oxley) [7.52] - I wish to offer my sympathy to the Treasurer, seeing that Ministerial supporters cause the Government programme to be criticised so severely. . Members of his party who have not the courage to come here and make' statements which can be rethe futed, adopt the subterfuge of visiting different parts of the Commonwealth and making assertions in a most cowardly way, inasmuch as we have no chance of challenging their accuracy at the time. At public meetings and all sorts of political functions they are in the habit of in dulging in declarations which are without foundation, for the purpose of scandalizing the Labour party. Consequently, upon an occasion like the present, we are bound to take the opportunity to tellthem that they are not doing the right thing by members of the Opposition. I do not think that they can point to one item in the Government policy which they have attempted to bring into existence. Ministry have merely brought forward one or two little measures for the purpose of detaining members in this city, and without any hope of passing them into law. They are merely marking time with a view to getting into recess as soon as possible.",40
344,Mr CONROY,AUSTRALIA,We would like to win as many more seats as we can.,41
345,Mr SHARPE,AUSTRALIA,"The honourable member has remained silent in this chamber, although he would have liked to have criticised the Government. He has discovered that they are not carrying out the programme which he advocated during the election campaign, and for that reason he absents himself from this House at different periods. He goes away and remains away for a full week. Why) Because he has no confidence in the Government. He would like to come over to this side of the House, only he is afraid that if he did so he would not get the endorsement of our party. As the honourable member for Adelaide interjects, he remains where he is, in disgust of his own party. The honourable member's first speech this session was on small-pox and vaccination, but he had not the moral courage to support honourable members on this side in their efforts to secure the release of Sydney from quarantine. In the district of Werriwa he advocates the removal of the embargo, but when he is given an opportunity in this House to do something to bring that about, he is not to be found in his place. He has been silenced by his party. The Caucus has brought him to heel, and has told him plainly that if he abuses the Government he will not secure the endorsement of the party at the next election. The weakness of the present Government is shown by the fact that the Treasurer has come down month after month for Supply. The Government have been in office now for about four months, and, though the Treasurer might be willing to do the right thing, the members of his party compel him to do things which, I am sure, he does not relish. The delay in dealing with the finances of the Commonwealth is not alto[93]-2 . gether the right honourable gentleman's fault, but is due to the desire of the Government to delay legislation. When the Works Estimates were under consideration, members on the Government side severely criticised a vote of Â£285,000 The towards the establishment of the Federal Capital, although that was one of the best votes on .the Estimates. They are now prepared to vote millions of pounds without hesitation. The party opposite are not prepared to spend the money on the country in a legitimate way, or they would criticise some of the amounts to be covered by the Supply Bill as they criticised the vote for the Federal Capital. The fact is that they are unable to act independently of the party to which they belong.  votes for telephones and for the Northern Territory 1",41
346,Mr SHARPE,AUSTRALIA,"Some honourable members on the other side have condemned expenditure on the Northern Territory; outright, and if it is as useless as they would have us believe, I should like to know why they are supporting the expenditure in the Territory which is covered by the Supply Bill . We have been told that it is useless to spend money in the Northern Territory, and that unless people are given freeholds of land there it cannot be developed. I do not believe that the Government will ever have the power to grant freeholds in the Northern Territory, but if they are given that power there will be very little land left there for the people of Australia. The American Beef Trust or Swift and Company will secure the whole of the good land in the Territory for the purpose of growing cattle to supply their meat works. I condemn the action of the Government in spending money with the object of fostering the American Beef Trust. I hope that expenditure in the Northern Territory will be for the benefit of the people of Australia. Anything that can be done should be done to - prevent the American Beef Trust securing the land of the Northern Territory. We were told by the Attorney-General that if we could supply him witli evidence of the existence of a trust, he would immediately take action against it . I think that sufficient evidence has been placed before honourable members to justify the Attorney-General in deciding that there is a trust now in existence in Queensland. The Government show no desire to prevent its growth. In a year or two it will have grown to such dimensions that it will be almost impossible to check it , and its operations will be felt, not only in Queensland, but throughout the Commonwealth.",41
347,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIA,When did the Trust first go to Queensland?,42
348,Mr SHARPE,AUSTRALIA,"They have been there for about a year. They are building meat works on the Brisbane River. They bought two meat works already in existence in Queensland. Mr GROOM,-They went there about a year ago.",42
349,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA,We could not prevent them building there.,42
350,Mr SHARPE,AUSTRALIA,"They bought the Alligator Creek Meat Works about a month ago. The Government have the power to check this Trust now if they desire to do so. I have said that the Trust is establishing works on the Brisbane River, and has bought two meat-works in other parts of Queensland; but it is generally understood that they have also bought the Ramornie Meat Works, on the Clarence River. Their capital is so great, and their operations will be on such a large scale, that they will be able to drive all competitors out of the market. People are continually writing to members of this Parliament about the Trust, and, although the Government must be aware of its existence, the Attorney-General and the Minister of Trade and Customs seem to be indifferent to the matter. When people throughout the Commonwealth are being called upon to suffer from the operations of the Trust, the members of the present Government, who might check the advance of the Trust now that they have the power, will be oalled to account for their negligence. I wish to bring under the notice of the Treasurer au abuse of the Maternity A l lowance Act by certain hospital authorities. The Lady Bowen Hospital, in Brisbane, is a lying-in hospital for poor women and unfortunate girls. It is supported entirely by public subscriptions, and is managed by the aristocratic women of Brisbane. About two days after a patient in that hospital has got over her trouble, the matron brings a written or printed form to her for signature. Its contents are not read over to the patient, but it is an application for the maternity allowance, and immediately it is signed it is sent on to the Department. When the return letter is received at the hospital, it is opened by the hospital authorities, the order is cashed, and a certain portion is retained without the consent of the patient. A day or two before a patient leaves the hospital she is asked to sign another form, which is not read over or explained to her. This form is a permission to the hospital authorities to deduct a certain amount from the maternity allowance for the expenses of the patient while in the hospital. When leaving the hospital a patient is given only Â£ 1 14s. 6d. out of the allowance of Â£5. That is the kind of thingthat is being done in the Lady Bowen Hospital at the present time. The majority of the women who go into this hospital are in poor circumstances, and they depend on the allowance for clothing and feeding their infants after they leave the institution. One woman who was given the Â£ 1 14s. 6d. remonstrated with the matron, and received an additional amount. She asked that the money should be put in a piece of paper for her, and it was wrapped up in the envelope in which the Department forwarded the Â£ 5 allowance to her. Some immediate action should be taken to put a stop to this abuse. The postman should be empowered to hand the envelope containing the order for the allowance to' the patient alone. I hope that the Treasurer will make the necessary in quiries to prevent this abuse in the future. It must have been taking place for some considerable time, because there was talk of it before I came down to Melbourne to attend this Parliament. It is not necessary for me to go into any detail on the financial question. There is no doubt that, with a falling revenue, the finances of the Commonwealth are in a bad way; and the reason is that the people have not the confidence in this Government that they had in the Fisher Administration. Honourable members opposite endeavoured to make out that if the Fisher Government had been in power the finances would have been in the same condition that we now find them; but the financial ideas and ideals of the late A d ministration were far superior to those of the present Government. It is the financial administrator who is most likely to be a success in politics; and we know that the Liberal party have always been a financial failure, a fact that they are now demonstrating to the people. longer the present Government remain in office the stronger the Labour party - will grow; and if the Government are allowed to go into recess-and we may let them go through-it will make our task all the. easier when the elections come round.",42
351,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA,"Yarra) [8.12] - I should like to say a few words bn the question of the reopening of the Tariff and the remarks of the honourable member for Capricornia this afternoon. That honourable member took exception to the questions which the Inter-State Commission propose to put to any manufacturer who desires Tariff assistance; but I disagree entirely with the honourable member in this regard. I feel proud that the Inter-State Commission are following on the lines I instituted when I was at the head of the Department of Trade and Customs; and I believe that the steps now taken will place Tariff revision, and the of Protection, on a sounder basis than ever before in this or any other country.",43
352,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AUSTRALIA,Does the honourable member think that the manufacturers will produce balance-sheets for the Inter-State Commission?,43
353,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA,"I do not know, but I think that the manufacturers ought to answer the questions honestly. The honourable member for Capricornia took special exception to the question as to the proportion of the cost paid in wages. I may say that, notwithstanding the fact that the press did their utmost to defeat me, and circulated a great number of misstatements, they could not show that I had made any pledges or promises that I had not carried out in connection with the Tariff. The manufacturers are compelled to give similar information for the purposes of the statistical returns, and I do not see where the difficulty lies in giving it to the Inter-State Commission, although the latter, with more power than I , as Minister, possessed, require the formation to be sworn to.",43
354,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AUSTRALIA,The questions show that the Inter-State Commission are going to look after the interests of the conand sumer.,43
355,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA,"They are going to look after the interest of all Australians-manufacturers, workers, and consumers.",43
356,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIA,The honourable member had the same object in view.,43
357,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA,Exactly ; and I think The that the honourable member for Parkes will give me credit for that.,43
358,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AUSTRALIA,I will .,43
359,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA,"A f t e r all, it is perhaps more difficult for the political head of a Department to elicit such information than it is for an Inter-State Commission.",43
360,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AUSTRALIA,But the honourable member insisted on balance-sheets.,43
361,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA,"No , I did not.",43
362,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AUSTRALIA,I quite approve of' it.,43
363,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA,"The impression got about that I desired the whole of the books of the manufacturers to be thrown open; but I merely asked for certain in formation which was absolutely essential to our legislating on right lines. Mr Bruce SMITH,-When manufacturers complain that they are being ruined, it is perfectly right that the policy Minister should know whether they are really being ruined, and how.",43
364,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA,"The honourable member for Capricornia said it was unfair to ask questions which manufacturers were unable to answer; but in reply to that I have to point out that if manufacturers are unable to answer they can say so. I think my record, so far as Protection is concerned, will compare with that of any one in the House.",43
365,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA,Is that question raised on a Supply Bill?,43
366,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA,"I wish to know what the Ministry are going to do. The Government, in their statement, said that it was their intention to rectify Tariff anomalies, and their press supporters, at the last election, said that there were a great many that should be dealt with. At present I am merely taking an opposite view from that of the honourable member for Capricornia, who is of opinion that the Inter-State Commission have gone out of their way in asking in - some of those questions. We were in formed in a Ministerial statement that the question of Tariff revision was to be referred to the Inter-State Commission, that in the meantime any anomalies discovered would be rectified. We were told during the election campaign by many honourable members and their press supporters that the Tariff is reeking with anomalies which required instant attention; and no one can say that there are not anomalies. What is a perfect Tariff today may not be a perfect Tariff six months hence, owing to the alterations in the mode of manufacture here or elsewhere. Last Saturday the Prime Minister, at the opening of some paper-board mills in New South Wales, is reported to have said that since the inauguration of the system of encouraging enterprises of that kind, he had found none deserving of greater sympathy than that. I know that last year I met Mr Sands in Sydney, when he asked for some consideration for this industry, and I told him distinctly that I believed it did require some encouragement. If any great proportion of the articles now being manufactured at that factory is on the free list, the fact should receive the attention of the Government at the earliest possible opportunity. In 1911 I brought under the notice of the House about 200 items and sub-items in the Tariff, with proposals to increase the Protection in practically every case, or to make dutiable articles then on the free list. understand that at this factory in New South Wales it is proposed to manufacture strawboard which was an item considered in the last amendment of the Tariff ; and here I may say that, according to my information, unless some Protection is given on paperboard, those engaged in the enterprise will have to come down to making strawboard. However, I find that on the proposal to increase the duty on strawboard the present Prime Minister paired for the lower duty. It is interesting, also, to observe that amongst those who voted for the lower duty, in addition to the Prime Minister, were the present Minister of External Affairs, the Minister of Trade and Customs, the Honorary Minister, the honourable member for Barker, the honourable member for Frankl in , the honourable member for North Sydney, the honourable member for Moreton, the Government W h i p , and the present Speaker; while the honourable member for Parkes, the honourable member for Echuca, the honourable member for Will mot, the honourable member for Grampians, and the honourable member for Wakefield, paired in the same interest. The proposal for the increased duty was defeated by the votes of those honourable members.",43
367,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AUSTRALIA,The honourable member has never heard of my advocating a high duty. Ur. Tudor.,44
368,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA,"I am glad to acknow r ledge that the honourable member is consistent; but one would think, from the newspapers at the present time, that every honourable member opposite is in favour of higher duties. The newspapers, which support the Government, represent everything to the detriment of the late Government in regard to the Tariff ; but if I were to give a vote like that of the honourable members. I have named, I should find the fact starred up with headlines is the news column.",44
369,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA,What was the duty? ,44
370,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA,"Speakin g from memory, I think the duty was ls. 6d. per cwt.; and I proposed to raise it to 2s. against all countries except the United Kingdom. If this mill is making paperboards that are not at present manufactured here, there ought to be no duty, but there ought to be no duty before the article is manufactured, because that would penI alize those who use it .",44
371,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA,Why is this being discussed in connection with Supply?,44
372,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA,"An y grievance may be discussed on Supply. I have heard the honourable member, when over here, discuss grievances for what seemed like years.",44
373,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA,Is this a grievance ?,44
374,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA,Yes ; it is a grievance that the honourable member should pretend that he was in favour of high duties when the votes he gave in Parliament were all the other way.,44
375,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA,"There is nothing there to justif y it , and nothing in what I said, either.",44
376,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA,"In announcing the M in isterial policy, the Prime Minister said, "" In the meantime any anomalies discovered in the existing Tariff will be dealt with . "" Have they discovered any?",44
377,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA,This is all a wicked waste of time.,44
378,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA,"I can assure the honourable member it is not. I have a right to raise the question, notwithstanding what the Prime Minister says. Apparently I ' have touched the honourable member on the raw by showing up some of his votes so soon after the alleged Protectionist speech that he made in Sydney last Saturday. I trust that the Lane Cove Express, if there is such a newspaper, or any other paper published in his electorate, that gives an account of the function which he attended, will also publish my remarks to show that he voted - against the increase of duty on this item. The ex-Prime Minister today drew attention to the account that appeared in both the Age and the Argus of the opening of a Liberal Institute in Parramatta.",44
379,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA,It was opening of a Liberal Institute.,45
380,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA,"The honourable member attended a meeting for the purpose of inaugurating a Liberal Institute, and put his name down for Â£100 worth of shares.",45
381,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA,It was 100 at 10s. each.,45
382,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA,"The Prime Minister was once associated with Labour, and today he says that he is just as much in earnest as ever he was in connection with it . We have heard of the man whose mother thought he was the only one in step out - of the whole regiment,, and perhaps that applies to the Prime Minister as regards himself and those wbo have remained in the Labour party.",45
383,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AUSTRALIA,"If you are out walking with other men, and they choose to go over a precipice, there is no reason Why you should follow them.",45
384,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA,"The speed at. which the honourable member walks is not likely to take him over any precipice. Therehas been a L i be r a l' Workers' Institute started in Melbourne, and I that Mr J . D . Packer is the secretary of it . It was stated before the Court, on oath, during the past week by Mr . Packer that his organization received as much from employers as it did from workers, and this is exactly the same sort of institute which the Prime Minister is - connected with, according to the name which appears in the same paper-the Argus-the one account being on the newsof-the-day page, and the other on the cable page. We know that this institute is out to down the workers-to . get the workers to work for less wages-and that the employers contribute to the funds for the purpose of strike-breaking. I hope for the Prime Minister's sake that the organization in Parramatta is different from the one in Melbourne, and that those associated with it will be different, because it is known by every honourable member ou that side what sort of people are associated with the Free Workers' organization. I do not know what name they go by now, because they change their name every time they are found out, like a man who has a number of aliases for appearing before the Court. Are we likely to have any alteration in the Tariff, and will an Anomalies Bill be introduced, or is it a fact that, after careful examination of the not the Tariff, the Govermnent find that no anomalies are there?",45
385,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA,Did you leave any there ?,45
386,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA,"In my opinion, no; and I was slated for that opinon by the shares press which supported the honourable member. They said I was wrong in not bringing forward a whole lot more. If the Prime Minister is to be true to his press supporters, he will find some of the anomalies that they are anxious to see rectified. The honourable meinber for Oxley referred to the operation of the American Beef Trust in Queensland, and I should not haye referred to this question but for the interjection of the Minister of Customs, who asked how long they had been there. J. believe the American Beef Trust, or the Australian Meat Company, as they call themselves in Brisbane, are either erecting or preparing the ground for erecting works. At any rate, they have had a great number of men at work on the Brisbane River for some time. Even though it was proved up to the h i l t that see the Australian Meat Company are Swif t and Company or the American Meat Trust, it would be impossible for the Federal Government to take any action, except, perhaps, under the Commerce Act. As the honourable member for Parkes interjected this afternoon, would we be prepared to set up a different standard for Swif t and Company, assuming that it is they, from the standard set up for any other exporter? The only possible means of dealing at the present time with the American Meat Trust, without an amendment of the Constitution, would be under the Commerce Act. The question is whether they would not have an opportunity of an action at law against the Commonwealth for setting up for them a standard different from that set up for other exporters of meat. I have my doubts whether any power that exists under the Commerce Act can be made operative. The company's principal man here, from America is Mr Malkow.",45
387,Mr ARCHIBALD,AUSTRALIA,He represents Swif t and Company.,46
388,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA,"I have some very in teresting matter which I intend to give the House when we come to deal with the question of the Trust, but since the 25th June I believe that the Australian Meat Company, which is practically the American Meat Trust, operating in Australia, has purchased works at Gladstone and near Cairns, and that they have been in negotiation for the purchase of others at Ramornie, in New South Wales. If they have purchased these works, and are shipping meat, there will be an opportunity for dealing with them at those works that there will probably not be at their Brisbane works for twelve months. I hope that if the Government find that the Trust are now operating here-as I believe it will be found, although they cover up their tracks pretty well-r-they will take every step possible to see that the Australian producers and consumers of meat are not treated as the people in America are at preseut. Mr W . H . IRVINE - What particular mode would the honourable member suggest? ",46
389,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA,I believe the only possible way to deal with them would be by amending the Constitution. Mr W. H. IRVINE - We limited power under the Commerce Act .,46
390,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA,There is no doubt that the Minister has the power to prohibit Swift and Company shipping from Australia under that or any other name.,46
391,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AUSTRALIA,- An extraordinary suggestion.,46
392,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA,"I admit that; bu t I believe the Minister has the power, under the Commerce Act, and the only question is whether it would be held that the power was exercised rightly. Mr W . H . IRVINE - Does the honourable member suggest that unlimited power should be exercised against any particular person?",46
393,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA,I am uot sure. thought at first it would be possible to do it . Mr W . H . IRVINE - We may attack methods. Can the honourable member suggest that we attack individuals?,46
394,Mr ARCHIBALD,AUSTRALIA,The High Court would not allow it .,46
395,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA,"The .High Court would not. What power the Minister has may be exercised in such a way as to make it sufficiently awkward to compel the Trusfe to be more amenable to the law in this-country than they have been to the l a w in America. It is well known that they have ridden roughshod over the people of America-the consumers on the onehand, and the producers on the other. If it is found that there is not power under the Commerce Act Mr W . H . IRVINE - There is unlimited constitutional power. There is no d if f iculty about that ; but I should be very glad of a practical suggestion.",46
396,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA,I am anxious to see that this particular Trust does not start operating in Australia. Mr W . H . IRVINE - Does the honourable member mean that some particular individual or individuals should be prohibited from buying meat in Australia. I .Let us have a practical suggestion.,46
397,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA,"I have said that, so far as this particular company are concerned r while there might be power under the Commerce Act to deal with them, I do not think it would be practicable. Mr W. H. IRVINE - The honourable member does not suggest that we can deal with individuals apart from the methods they adopt.",46
398,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA,"If it was found that this particular Trust coming into Aushave untralia operated to the disadvantage of the producer and the consumer, I understand from the Minister that the Government would have full constitutional power to deal with them, even though they are; operating in one State only. Mr W . H . IRVINE - So long as they are engaged in the export trade.",46
399,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA,"The only way to deal with the difficulty would be under the Commerce Act , and the Government would be compelled to set up for them a different standard from other exporters if they wanted to deal with them simply on account of their operations.",46
400,Mr ARCHIBALD,AUSTRALIA,That would be unI constitutional.,46
401,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA,The Attorney-General says it would not.,46
402,Mr WH IRVINE,AUSTRALIA,I do not thin k there is any constitutional difficulty whatever.,46
403,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA,"If that is so, there would be full power under the Commerce Act.",46
404,Mr RILEY,AUSTRALIA,Y o u can do nothing u n t i l they start to do business.,46
405,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA,"If they have bought works in full going order at Gladstone - and Cairns, and start them immediately the beef season opens, action should be taken by the Government if they have the power.",47
406,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIA,If these people act in juriously to trade.,47
407,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA,What we know of the operations of the Trust in America leaves no room for doubt that they will act in juriously.,47
408,Mr WH IRVINE,AUSTRALIA,"Does the honourable member suggest that, because some one called Swift is a member of a trust which is said to have been guilty of all sorts of iniquities in America, he should not be allowed to buy beef in Queensland?",47
409,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA,"We could not stop their .buying; but we could, under the Commerce Act, control their export of - meat. At the beginning, good prices would probably be paid, as they were in America, u n t i l every competitor had been driven out of the market, and then the Trust would pay its own prices. Mr W . H . IRVINE - I should like the honourable member to suggest what should be done.",47
410,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA,"I think that the only power of interference that we have is given by the Commerce Act. Attorney-General will agree with me that it is impossible to stop the Trust from - erecting works in Brisbane, and that it will be impossible to take action against it until it starts to export its products. Apparently the only power that we can use against it is that given by the export provisions of the Commerce Act , and we - cannot deal with the Trust u n t il it exports. I understand that it has not yet attempted to ship 1 l b . of mutton or beef from Australia, and it is not likely to do so u n t i l the coming season.",47
411,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIA,Unde r what conditions would the honourable member deal with these people?,47
412,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA,"I would deal with them under the Commerce Act, if that was possible.",47
413,Mr SAMPSON,AUSTRALIA,Does not the honourable member think that they could be left to the people of Queensland ?,47
414,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA,Some of them are in it up to their necks.,47
415,The CHAIRMAN,AUSTRALIA,The honourable member's time has expired.,47
416,Mr BRUC ESMITH,AUSTRALIA,Parkes) [8.43]. - I cannot agree with the Prime Minister in characterizing the speech of the honourable member for Yarra as a waste of time. I think it stands out from the other speeches that we have heard to day.,47
417,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA,"I was referring to the day's waste of time. Mr BRU CE SMITH - It is the first speech I have heard with any argument in it . We had a speech from the honourable member for Capricornia which, howeverwell intentioned, seemed to me a sheer waste of time, the honourable member speaking apparently only to occupy the time of the Committee. The remarks of the honourable member for Maribyrnong amounted to a sort of post mortem, examination of the speeches made by the Prime Minister before the last election, and reminded one of the well-known saying of Lord Beaconsfield, that "" the most effective satire is a m a j o r it y ."" Whatever the Prime Minister may have said to the people of New South Wales prior to the last election, the people of Australia returned the present Government to power with a working majority, which has been actually at work for four months; and if it had not been for the systematic obstruction which they have had to meet, it would The have workedto some advantage. I do not agree with the Labour politics of the honourable member for Yarra, nor do I share his fiscal opinions, but he always believes what he is saying, and says it in such a way that one can get a proposition out of him, a syllogism, something that can be taken hold of. Today he dealt at length with the fiscal question. I admit, with the Prime Minister, that the discussion of that question is irrelevant, and more than irrelevant at this time, because the appointment of the Inter-State Commission, with power to report to Parliament on Tariff matters, removes it from the arena until we get recommendations from that body. The fiscal question is practically not sub judice; it has been relegated to the Inter-State Commission for report.. I am very glad that it has been so dealt with, because I have always contended that the settlement of a Tariff is a work for which Parliament is quite incapable. When a Tariff is proposed, we are so infested with, and in some cases in fluenced by, literature from both parties - in regard to every item, that it is impossible to obtain calm, clear and deliberate discussion. I rejoice that the matter is now removed to the arbitrament of a body which will look at it apart from political considerations, and submit its recommendations to Parliament. discussion of the fiscal question is now at least irrelevant, though, I admit, the honourable member for Yarra puts his case as well as he could. He criticised the Prime Minister for his more modern utterances on the Tariff, and I rather sympathize with the criticism. read some speeches of the Prime ter, which seem to suggest the possibility of the present Liberal party proposing higher duties. I , for my part, would have no sympathy with such a movement; and I hope that it will not originate with, this party. to know that the ex-Minister for Trade and Customs approves of the questions which are to be submitted, facturers by the Inter-State On previous occasions, when facturers were complaining were being ruined, the question a Free Trader would have liked to ask, in face of the cry of the consumer about the increased cost of living, ""was, "" I's ruin staring you in the face, or are you making so much out of yoar industry that you dare not show your balance-sheet, and only want a higher duty to enable you to make more profit."" During the discussion of one of the Tariffs-I rememberwhether the last orthe one before--! brought before the House the case of a hat manufactory of this State which said that ruin was staring it in the face. I happened to get hold of its balance-sheet, and found that its Â£1 shares were standing at 35s. in the market, and that it was paying a dividend of 10 per cent, to its shareholders and putting by 5 per cent. of questions which the Inter-State. mission seeks to put to manufacturers order to. discover whether higher are necessary to enable our industries to hold their own is very pertinent. 1 the past the manufacturer politician have been considered, but the unfortunate consumer-, who in the long run has to pay, has not been as much thought of as he should have been. years: ago, when a motion for the appointment of a Royal Commission to investigate Tariff matters was beforethe House, Mr Bruce Smith. I asked what steps were to be taken tocause the consumer to be represented, and was told that there need be no fear, astlie members of the Commission would look after him. The Commission wascomposed of strong Free Traders and The strong Protectionists, and made no attempt to invite the public to appoint athat delegate to show to what extent high duties were affecting the prices of commodities coming under the category of: necessaries. I think that the In t e r State Commission will fulfil its duty in I have making suggestions to which we shall have Minis- to say "" y e a "" or "" n a y , "" and I am glad that the honourable member for Yarra brought the matter forward, because, although not strictly relevant, it. is a useful one to have discussed.

418,Mr MCGRATH,AUSTRALIA,"Ballarat) [8.56] I desire to refer to the export of potatoes from Yictoria, as it is a matter of very great interest indeed to potato-growers in tiiis State. Probably honourable members are aware that potato growing is being carried on here practically at a loss. The troubles of the potato-growers have been accentuated by the fact that they are - unable to export potatoes other than in new bags. There is no doubt that there is a combine in connection with the sale of potato-bags, and the price has been raised from 4s. 6d. per dozen to 8s. very fact that growers are compelled' to use new bags tends to make them dearer, because they are not able to use second hand bags, especially for export. That means to the farmer a loss of from 4s. to 5s. a ton. He is getting here today 22s. 6d. per ton for his potatoes, and out of that sum he has to pay about 9s. a ton for the digging, and 9s. a ton for the bags. W it h the other 4s. 6d. he has to take the potatoes out of the p it , fill the bags, and cart them to the railway station. A farmer in Victoria is practically selling his potatoes today in order to get back the money which he has paid for digging them. The position here is a serious one. When - we federated it was thought that the Intercolonial barriers would be wiped away, - and Inter-State Free Trade established. ""But if the States are to be allowed to set up what are practically prohibition orders, or to issue proclamations as to how produce shall be carried to them, they 'will defeat the spirit and the intention of the Constitution. The Attorney-General told me the other day that it was not for him to give an answer to a question I asked. He said it was not for him to de-clare whether there was anything in my - contention that the States were acting cont iary to the spirit of the Constitution, but that it was for the potato-growers themselves to take action. Now, that is almost impossible, because, individually, the potato-grower is a poor man, and cannot afford - to test this point in the High Court as against a State. preposterous tn imagine that he could do so.",49
419,Mr AHERN,AUSTRALIA,The States have been doing the same thing in connection with Pigs,49
420,Mr MCGRATH,AUSTRALIA,That may make the position much worse.,49
421,Mr ATKTNSON,AUSTRALIA,"It is a question stopping the introduction of disease, I - think.",49
422,Mr MCGRATH,AUSTRALIA,"I full y recognise that the prohibition orders were first issued because of the occurrence of a disease in potatoes here, but we have no disease today. In that respect Victoria is absolutely clean.",49
423,Mr SAMPSON,AUSTRALIA,Tb e whole of the inspection work should be taken over by the Commonwealth.,49
424,Mr MCGRATH,AUSTRALIA,"I intend to deal with that point briefly. Victoria is now practically free from disease, and its potatoes will bear inspection with those grown The in any other part of Australia. Not only is our farmer losing money through having to use new bags, but he has to pay three inspection dues. That, of course, is a matter for the State to deal with. Firstly, the farmer has to pay 3s. for the inspection of his far m ; secondly, he has to pay 6d. per ton when the potatoes are delivered at the railway station; and, thirdly, he has to pay another 6d. per ton if the potatoes are intended for export. Then, when he sends any potatoes to Western Australia, he is met with another demand. Mr Hogan, member for Warrenheip in the State Assembly, has told me-and I believe this statement is true-that in Western Australia the charge for inspecting Victorian potatoes is 15s. per ton. I call on the Federal Government to take action in this matter. Mr W . H . IRVINE - What sort of action do you suggest!",49
425,Mr MCGRATH,AUSTRALIA,"Perhaps , when I read section 112 of the Constitution, it may suggest to the honourable and learned gentleman a way out of the difficulty. Mr W. H. IRVINE - I was looking at it. '-ri",49
426,Mr MCGRATH,AUSTRALIA,"The section readsAfter uniform duties of Customs have been imposed, a State may levy on imports or exports, or on goods passing into or out of the State, such charges as. may be necessary for executing the inspection laws of the State; but the net produce of all charges so levied shall be for the use of the Commonwealth, and any such inspection laws may be annulled by the ParliaI t is ment of the Commonwealth. The inspection charge of Western Australia is acting detrimentally to the users of potatoes in that State, and there is no question about it affecting potato-growers in Victoria very in j u r i ously. Of course, I do not put myself forward as a constitutional authority.",49
427,Mr WH IRVINE,AUSTRALIA,Did you say that of the prohibition was on the bags?,49
428,Mr MCGRATH,AUSTRALIA,No ; I was referring to the cost of inspection. Mr W. H . IHVINE - You are only referring to the inspection charges?,49
429,Mr MCGRATH,AUSTRALIA,Yes . The proclamation regarding the use of new bags is quite another inatter. Mr W. H . IBVINE - I beg your pardon; I misunderstood what you said just now.,50
430,Mr MCGRATH,AUSTRALIA,"I recognise that some action ought to be taken. I think that the Victorian Government should take some action in regard to the use of second hand bags for export purposes, and should not leave the testing of the question to a potato-grower.",50
431,Mr ATKINSON,AUSTRALIA,"Wester n Australia will not take your potatoes unless they are put in clean bags. It is the same in the other States, too, I . think.",50
432,Mr MCGRATH,AUSTRALIA,"The honourable! member does not follow me. In my opinion, the Government, of Western Australia had no right to issue that procla- of produce. mation.",50
433,Mr ATKINSON,AUSTRALIA,"Victori a oould not interfere, but we might.",50
434,Mr MCGRATH,AUSTRALIA,"Victori a can interfere, and in the interests of our potato growers it ought to take action to test the validity of the proclamation in the High Court. It is certainly not the duty of anybody else to take that step. claim that it is the duty of the Federal Government to take action regarding the Western Australian charge of 15s. a ton, for, according to my reading of section 112, the Constitution confers that power. Mr WH . IBVINE - There is no doubt of that.",50
435,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIA,On a previous occasion representations were made to a State Government that the charge for inspection should be a reasonable one. That is what the section contemplates.,50
436,Mr MCGRATH,AUSTRALIA,It goes further than that.,50
437,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIA,That is the intention of the section. If a State persists in the unreasonable course of exercising its power unfairly the Federal Government can intervene.,50
438,Mr ROBERTS,AUSTRALIA,We have full power to intervene whether the inspection dues are reasonable or otherwise.,50
439,Mr MCGRATH,AUSTRALIA,"Yes , we have full power to annul any inspection charge levied by a State. The Attorney-General has just admitted that that is a fair and reasonable construction to place on section 112 of the Constitution. I agree that it was framed to enable the Commonwealth Government to act in case any State Government should try to impose an unreasonable charge. I claim that 15s. a ton is an unreasonable charge, and if it were removed it would mean financial salvation to hundreds, perhaps tothousands, of potato-growers in Victoria.",50
440,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA,How much a ton does the inspection cost-5s. ?,50
441,Mr MCGRATH,AUSTRALIA,It is done in Victoria for 6d. a ton. I do not think there is any doubt that by their action the Government of Western Australia are defeating the spirit of the Constitution. They might just as well have power to impose Customs duties against any produce from other States as have power to levy an exorbitant charge for inspection,50
442,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIA,"As regards these facts, I promise the honourable member that I shall have inquiries made.",50
443,Mr MCGRATH,AUSTRALIA,"I accept the Minister's assurance, and remind him that in Victoria it is a matter of great urgency. The potatoes are in the pit, and there are markets for them in other parts I of the Commonwealth. The honourable member for Maranoa, for instance, has received a letter stating that in Queensland they could do with any quantity of our potatoes, but that the inspection charges are very severe. More than that, the middlemen there, who have control of the potato trade, will take every care that Victorian potatoes do not reach those who want to use them in the inland towns. When we had the Irish blight in Victoria we were very zealous to protect one part of the State as against another part, so that the disease should not be introduced into a clean part. It was considered quite sufficient then to charge only 6d. per ton, and a very full inspection indeed was made. The Minister can understand that the potato-grower inWarm ambool did not want the blight introduced from Bungaree, or vice versd y and insisted that the inspection should be a vigorous one. There*can be nothing in the argument which may be put forward by the Western Australian Government that it costs 15s. per ton to make the in spection.",50
444,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AUSTRALIA,"The Western Australian Government did exactly thing with apples, and the same Minister of Trade and Customs interfered stopped them from making the charge.",51
445,Mr MCGRATH,AUSTRALIA,"I am very glad to hear that statement, and now the Minisofficers ter has an opportunity of stopping the Western Australian Government again. I trust that he will treat the matter one of urgency, and make immediate representations to the Western Australian Government, and, perhaps, to other State Governments, and find out exactly what admission. the inspection charges are. Turning to another question, I have been somewhat surprised to-night at the statements made regarding extravagant expenditure, and after reading the statement of the Treaby surer, I candidly admit that, to my mind, the Commonwealth is in a serious posithe tion. This year we have to find have heard. Â£27,000,000. Even with our surplus of nearly Â£3,000,000, we have to borrow half of your time. Â£3,000,000 to make ends meet. He would be, I think, a most optimistic member who would say that our expenditure year will not be Â£30,000,000. This year we are practically Â£6,000,000 behind making ends meet; yet the Government admitted it . offer no suggestion as to what they intend to do if the Inter-State Commission should recommend the imposition of creased duties. To-day our revenue Â£21,000,000, but if we have effective ProLabour Administration. tection the revenue may drop to Â£15,000,000. As a Protectionist I cana not see that effective Protection can in anything like Â£21,000,000.",51
446,Sir ROBERT BEST,AUSTRALIA,"The Tariff does not do that; it brings in Â£15,000,000.",51
447,Mr MCGRATH,AUSTRALIA,"The revenue is Â£4,135,285. ' Â£21,00,000; the Tariff Â£15,000,000, and we shall more than Â£10,000,000 or Â£11,000,000 from an effective Tariff.",51
448,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AUSTRALIA,"You will get no one. more higher duties, I hope.",51
449,Mr MCGRATH,AUSTRALIA,"The Government are pledged to establish effective Protection, and when the Prime Minister speaks will end the opposition in the corner the honourable member sits. Surely Ministry realise the seriousness of present position! I do not care whether the Estimates were prepared by the will be Â£4,135,285? Labour Government or by the present Ministry.",51
450,Mr ROBERTS,AUSTRALIA,We had nothing what the same ever to do with them.,51
451,Mr RILEY,AUSTRALIA,Will you not take the asand surance of an ex-Labour Minister ?,51
452,Mr MCGRATH,AUSTRALIA,"Yes . I believe that the Estimates were drawn up by the of the Departments, and were not submitted to the late Ministry, and, therefore, the present Ministry must take the as full responsibility for them.",51
453,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA,"Of course, we do.",51
454,Mr MCGRATH,AUSTRALIA,That is the first time the honourable gentleman has made that,51
455,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA,Not at all.,51
456,Mr MCGRATH,AUSTRALIA,"It is refreshing to get the admission, even at this late hour.",51
457,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA,This is not the first half-a-dozen times that I have had to admit it .,51
458,Mr MCGRATH,AUSTRALIA,"I have been here all time, and that is the first admission I",51

But she estimate of the Treasurer is that this year we shall expend Â£4,135,000 more than was spent last year.",52
480,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA,More spent ; but not more than was estimated. Now does the honourable member see the difference ?,52

511,Mr MCGRATH,AUSTRALIA,"1 withdraw, and am content to look up the report in Hansard. I wish now to deal briefly with the in creased expenditure proposed on defence. To my mind we are in a very serious position in Australia today. It is estimated that this year we shall expend Â£4,000,000 exodd on our Naval and Military Forces, Â£1,000,000 on the construction of the Fleet, Â£300,000 on land required for defence purposes, and Â£175,000 on machinery and construction works at Cockatoo Island. In other words, we are going to expend nearly Â£6,000,000 on defence. I think that the people of Australia will find it impossible to bear this burden. Our expenditure on defence has increased from 18s. 6d. to 23s. per head.",53
512,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AUSTRALIA,B o t h sides of the House are drunk on that subject.,53
513,Mr MCGRATH,AUSTRALIA,"r - l realise that Australia ought tb be. defended, but I am very much afraid that a few military omcers are running the Commonwealth so far as the expenditure on defence is concerned. This is going to be a burden that the people cannot bear. the increased expenditure on our Naval and Militar y Porces will be Â£1,000,000an increase of 5s. per head. the Estimates submitted by the military omcers have been accepted in globo, and we are asked to sanction them. Government propose to borrow money for defence purposes. If it - were not for this vast expenditure on defence, there would be no necessity Â£3,000,000. But for that expenditure we would be able to make ends meet. If it be essential that we should expend Â£3,000,000 more on defence this year we should vote that money, but we should see that it comes from direct taxation. I shall not vote for any proposal under which the workers will pay any portion of that taxation. I recognise that they did enough when, they submitted to the compulsory training system. willingly allow their sons to be trained, aud trained under very great diflSculties in some cases. I trust that the Prime Minister will lose very little time in looking into two matters which were mentioned here last week. endeavour to induce the State authorities to carry the trainees over the railways free of charge. In the constituency of the honourable member for Maribyrnong, the lads have to pay their own fares from Sunshine every time they come into town to d r ill .",53
514,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AUSTRALIA,That is not right.,54

516,The CHAIRMAN,AUSTRALIA,The honourable member's time has expired.,54
517,Mr WEBSTER,AUSTRALIA,"Gwydir) [9.26] - I rise to direct the attention of the Government to a matter of importance which, so far as I know, has not yet been The toilers touched upon in this debate. I refer to the necessity of the Government taking action early to relieve the people of Sydney of the embargo which has been i r r i tating, exasperating, and. ruining many of them during the last three or four I hope he will months. It would seem that, having issued their proclamation putting the 15 miles area of Sydney under quarantine, the Government consider that it would be undignified of them to respond to the appeal of the people to remove the embargo. Assuming that this was a real outbreak of small-pox, which might develop into one of the epidemics of which we have read in days gone by in other countries, there might have been some the reason for the drastic step taken by the we Government to protect one part of Ausknow tralia from the spread of an epidemic But, although there have been one thousand cases of the ill They are only ness, there has not been one death, and as that is a record for an epidemic disease come which is not equalled in any other counW it h this evidence before them that this is not a malignant dangerous form of small-pox, the Gostay vernment should have realized that their drastic action was unnecessary, and that 10 the penalty they are imposing upon the in people of the Commonwealth, and particularly of New South Wales, is unjustifiable By an act of administration the Government have forced thousands of people in New South Wales to undergo vaccination, to subject themselves to serious illness in many cases, and in some cases to follow their relatives to the grave, because of the use of bad vaccine in the early days of the epidemic. Many lives have been sacrificed as a result of the action taken by the Government, and, in the circumstances, one would think that they would not hesitate for a moment to review the whole situation. The Prime Minister has frequently referred to this matter in terms which indicate that the Government do not take a serious view of it. It is all very well to say that they are protecting the other States, but I venture to say that no Government in any other country would have been tolerated so long as the present Government have been if they had imposed so unjustifiable an embargo upon a city of 750,000 people. There are many authorities today who hold, as I have held all along, that this epidemic is not small-pox but cow-pox. The fact that no deaths have resulted from it supports that conclusion. But that does not concern the Government, or Dr Cumpston, their guide, philosopher, and friend in this matter. When appealed to, Dr Cumpston says that there are still a great many people within the quarantine area who are not yet immune from small-pox. He indicates that he is not prepared to lift the embargo until every person residing within the quarantined area is vaccinated. That is unworthy of any medical or scientific man having the knowledge which Dr Cumpston should have of this epidemic. The press of New South Wales, as well as some of the public men who have been responsible very largely for urging vaccination upon the people, are today urging the Government to lift the embargo. The Sydney Morning Herald, only a fortnight ago, having probably received a hint from the people who are suffering financially in Sydney as the result of the embargo, published a leading article quite opposed to the articles it published for many weeks after the outbreak of the disease. It urges the Government now to relieve the city of Sydney from this unjustifiable and undreamt-of quarantine, but the Government failed apparently to recognise the seriousness of the position for which they are responsible. The Sydney Daily Telegraph for weeks urged the people to go into the shambles and be vaccinated, and take into their systems germs from which they may suffer severely by-and-by. This newspaper, with its scare articles, was largely responsible for hounding thousands of people to vaccination, but it has referred in a recent issue to the quarantine embargo as calculated to make the administration of the Quarantine Department the laughing-stock of the world. The Prime Minister has seen a report from a patient isolated at the Quarantine Station at North Head saying that he was well treated, and that everything was all right, and lae takes that report as if it were gospel truth. I wish the honourable gentleman were present to listen to a statement which I have here. He is a New South Welshman, and we should at least expect that he would see justice done to the State from which he comes. I have here a list of complaints from patient3 who have been treated at the Quarantine Station, published in a newspaper that formerly upheld the action of the Government. The information is supplied by the senior partner of a Sydney firm. It is not a nondescript who writes this, but a man whose word can be relied upon, and whose character will stand investigation, but he desires that, for business reasons, his name should not be printed. How many men have had to be vaccinated for business reasons through the action of the Minister of Trade and Customs ? How many employees have been forced to undergo vaccination in order to protect their employers? How many business men have themselves undergone vaccination in order to overcome the prejudices of people created by newspapers and the scare set up by the Federal authorities? This gentleman writesMind you, I bave no complaints to make against persons. The officers did their best, but the system of quarantine as I found h during my several weeks detention was abominable, to say the least of it. We were herded like infected cattle in a slaugher-yard. Ts the Minister of Trade and Customs listening to this, or is he paying more attention to the honourable member for Wilmot than to this serious charge against his administration. This member of a city firm went into quarantine voluntarily as an act of duty to his country, and he says that he was herded, with others, like infected cattle in a pen. He addsMen,_ like myself, who have been always used to a fair standard of decency, were put in wards higgledy-piggledy with Domain loafers and those to whom the lowest level of living is luxury. He offered to pay the uttermost penny for - fair treatments but that was refused.",54
518,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIA,Can the honourable gentleman supply the name of this gentleman?,56
519,Mr WEBSTER,AUSTRALIA,The Minister could get it from the newspaper that published his letter.,56
520,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIA,I will ask that inquiries be made into the matter. It would facilitate the investigation of complaints if those who make them would give their names confidentially to the Department.,56
521,Mr WEBSTER,AUSTRALIA,"I quite realise that this gentleman is unwilling, for business reasons, to disclose his name, and have it known that he was confined in the Quarantine Station.",56
522,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIA,"If he would only give hi""Â» name confidentially to the Department, that would be sufficient.",56
523,Mr WEBSTER,AUSTRALIA,"Le t the Minister ask him to give his name confidentially. It is useless for the honourable gentleman to try to shield himself behind the State authorities in this case. All the time that this question has been under discussion, when we have referred to any matter of administration-, the Minister has sheltered himself behind the action of the State Government.",56
524,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIA,That statement is incorrect.,56
525,Mr WEBSTER,AUSTRALIA,It is not incorrect.,56
526,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIA,"If the honourable member repeats that fifty times, it will not make his statement a fact.",56
527,Mr WEBSTER,AUSTRALIA,"No r will the Minister's repeated denials make it untrue. Every time. I have tried to elicit information as to Eederal responsibility the question has been shelved, whether answered verbally, or after due notice. On every occasion there has been a decided shirking of responsibility- a make-believe and pretence.  able member advocate the lift in g of the quarantine; and, if so, what would he substitute ?",56

529,Mr WEBSTER,AUSTRALIA,"It is a matter on which the Federal authorities can instruct and advise. This gentleman goes on to sayMy family and friends strongly protested against mv treatment, but were informed that no patient could be given any separate or better conditions, even though he paid for it. . . . The food was carried from the kitchen to the patients across a bare, unprotected space, without a covering on the dishes, and the diet was not appetising to a man who was used to> even fair cooking, though to some I dare say it was a banquet. Now, as for the women, I will go as far as to say that I would rather a woman who was. dear to me were dead, than that she should have to go through what they have to is quarantine. If a woman offered to pay Â£100 a week she would not get any better treatment, for thereason that the officials could not do any better. The Federal Government have starved the station, and that is the bottom of the wholetrouble. Another correspondent says The sanitary arrangements were unspeakably vile. Did the Minister go down to look int o these matters for himself during hisvarious visits to Sydney?",56
530,Mr AHERN,AUSTRALIA,Thos e people should be compelled to sign their names to the letters.,56
531,Mr WEBSTER,AUSTRALIA,"The honourable member is inconsistent, inasmuch as he, and those who sit with him, protest against the signing of newspaper articles, while they would compel people, who labour under peculiar difficulties, to sign their productions. Tbere is some idiotic laughter; and this is what has to be endured when the health and life of the community are at stake. The corespondent to whom I have referred says The sanitary arrangements were unspeakably vile; in fact, there were none at all. The place reeked with filth, and though the attendants did their best, the task was wholly beyond so small a staff. I will just give an instance of how persons suffered through insufficient attendance. When I was well enough to leave I was stripped to have a disinfecting bath, and my clothes were taken away to be fumigated. Well, the attendant who took my clothes away had work to do at the other end of the station, with the result that after I finished my bath I had no clothes and had to sit in a corner for over half-an-hour with nothing round me but a damp towel. How long I would have had to stay like that I do not know, but I managed to get another patient to go and fossick out my clothes. When I got them. I lost no time in shaking the dust of quarantine off my feet, I can tell you.",56

533,Mr WEBSTER,AUSTRALIA,"All the bathing in the world would not make the honourable member for Indi clean-politically , of course. In my judgment, the Minister has never comprehended the seriousness of this trouble, nor recognised the in j u r y he is doing. I do not say that the M in ister does not care, but he cannot know the number of lives that have been sacrificed on the altar of vaccination, though, of course, he does know that this alleged small-pox has not caused the loss of one life. Yet there are authorities, higher than Dr Cumpston, prepared to show that this is not small-pox, but pure cowpox.  able member the authority of any medical man for saying that this is cow-pox ?",56

537,Mr WEBSTER,AUSTRALIA,"The honourable member fancies that he is in a Police Court where he is allowed to take a lot of liberty. If the honourable member is being briefed or. promptedby the Minister of Trade. and Customs, I am not here to answer queries of the kind. It is notorious that the newspapers, who have been largely responsible, for the scare, have refused to publish communications giving the other side, no matter by whom sent. Many persons, some of them sufferers, have written giving their experiences, but the press has religiously and unjustly refused to ventilate their side of the question; and it is for that reason that the honourable member for New England is so ignorant on the subject. Let the honourable member inquire from the Sydney Morning Herald, the Daily Telegraph, the Evening News, and other papers which support his party, how many letters setting forth, vividly what this embargo means to the people of New South Wales, have been thrown into the waste-paper basket. The honourable member for Newcastle knows of a person who has been in bed for fifty-one or fifty-two days with erysipelas, claimed by his medical advisers to have supervened on vaccination. But, of course, all cases of that .kind are of no consequence to the Government; they do not care how many widows or orphans may be left because of the scare and a system of vaccination imposed, not legally, but indirectly, by regulation on the ipsi dixit of one man. Are the Government really trying to get to the bottom of the matter? The very first thing they should have done was to appoint a body to investigate, and not to rely on one person.",57
538,Mr BURNS,AUSTRALIA,Was an embargo placed on Sydney at the time of the plague?,57
539,Mr WEBSTER,AUSTRALIA,"Wis e men governed the country at that time, and they resorted to isolation. When small-pox broke out in a malignant form, and people died, the disease was stamped out in one-third the time that the Government have been playing with it on the present occasion. The Government declare that they are not going to take any action while there are any new cases of this alleged small-pox. If the Government keep on their present method it will spell ruin to hundreds of people in Sydney and suburbs, because the cow-pox will continue. The Government shelter themselves behind the medical .officer, or behind the State authorities; but the quarantine area is a Federal area, and the staffing and sanitary conditions are a Federal responsibility. I cannot think that the Minister has ever made any personal investigation, although he has been vaccinated, and ought to consider himself immune. I make another appeal to the honourable gentleman to lift this quarantine.",57

541,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIA,Darling Downs-Min ister of Trade and Custom3) [9.56] The honourable member has repeated tonight what he has told us previously day after day.,57
542,Mr WEBSTER,AUSTRALIA,And I shall repeat it again.,57
543,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIA,"I am sorry to say that the honourable member, shows just the same refusal to recognise and consider facts. He has repeated day after day the number of deaths that took place from vaccination.",57
544,Mr WEBSTER,AUSTRALIA,I said the number of people who would have been alive except for vaccination.,57
545,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIA,"I accept the honourable member's statement in that form, but I understood him to repeat a statement he made to-night about the number of deaths from vaccination. He drew harrowing pictures of the deaths of persons leaving widows and orphans. These deaths could not be very well due to small-pox, because the honourable member said there were no deaths due to that disease. What was the cause of the deaths of these persons, if the honourable member did not imply that they were due to vaccination ? The natural conclusion from the honourable member's remarks was that those deaths were due to vaccination, or else his words had absolutely no meaning. We know, from the inquiries that I made at the request of honourable members opposite, that the medical authorities in Sydney certified that there had not been a single death due to vaccination. When, the honourable member gets official information of that kind from the State authorities who know all about it , he should accept it .",58
546,Mr WEBSTER,AUSTRALIA,Biase d authorities.,58
547,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIA,"When a man starts a fad, and advocates it all over the country, he calls any official statement which tells against him biased. No one would believe that the State authorities would supply false information to this House. I have the highest opinion of them. These returns are based upon statutory returns based in turn upon certificates of deaths supplied to the proper authorities, and how Mr King, the secretary of the Board of Health in Sydney, could falsify them by any prejudice in his mind, is beyond me. I do not understand the honourable member's attitude, and that statement of his, when examined, is found to have just as much foundation as hi3 statement of deaths due to vaccination. I am just as anxious as is any other honourable member to know the absolute truth of the matter, and if the honourable member for Gwydir will supply us with information as to any death due to vaccination, I shall be very glad to ascertain the facte. Our only desire should be to avoid making party politics of this matter.",58
548,Mr WEBSTER,AUSTRALIA,I am not doing so.,58
549,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIA,I do not know what the honourable member is doing.,58
550,Mr WEBSTER,AUSTRALIA,The honourable member cannot comprehend what I am doing.,58
551,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIA,"The honourable member has constantly, although he knows that some of these matters are within the jurisdiction of the State, sought to make political capital at the expense of the Government. I do not object to the honourable member blaming the Department for any-' thing the Department does, but a great many of his statements have just as much foundation as the one to which I have already referred. He has to-night brought before the Committee a number of statements which have appeared in the newspapers. I can quite understand, as regards these patients, that a person who has been there, and who is in business, not wanting to give his name to the press, but I cannot understand why any patient who has been through the quarantine station, and who has suffered, should not make a statement to the proper authorities in order that the matter may be investigated. Notwithstanding that these statements were anonymous, since they were made. I gave instructions that the facts should be investigated, but the difficulty was that the persons who were making them were not there. If any person making them will come forward and supply the name, we shall be only too pleased to have an investigation made, but so far as I know, there has been no foundation for any of the statements made.",58
552,Mr RILE Y,AUSTRALIA,"South Sydney) [10.5] An item appears on the Estimates relating to the Fitzroy Dock. About fourteen blacksmiths and others were put ofi work there at the end of last week. The reason given was that no plans or details were coming from Melbourne to keep them at work. Do Ministers think that the best and most economical way to carry on the construction of ships is to keep the plans and details in Melbourne when they should know that they are wanted on the spot? It must mean delay, and the Minister should, if he desires to run his Department on business lines, remove them to where the construction is going on. No business man would keep his plans and details 600 miles from where he was constructing his ships. It is a serious thing for men to be put out of work, and if the plans are not sent over more rapidly than at preseut, more people will be put off, and this will reflect upon the Administration. I know that the plans and details were kept inMelbourne when the previous Government were in power, but, all the same, the system is a mistake. Everything should be on the spot. It is an island, and all the plans would be perfectly safe. I ask the Treasurer, in the interests of those employed there, that facilities should be given for the men to draw their plans and keep the details in Sydney.",58
553,Sir JOHN FORREST,AUSTRALIA,I shall make note of it .,59
554,Mr WEBSTER,AUSTRALIA,"Gwydir) [10.7] - I is not pleasant for a Minister to suggest that a member is doing something with ulterior motive when he is doing i honestly in the interests of people who, he feels, are being injured by the action of the Government. The Minister Trade and Customs has, as is usual when any member of the Government makes statement, cleared out of the chamber, i stead of staying to hear the reply. is one of the things that show that they have a weak case, and are unable to stand To whom else can I refer? by what they say. The honourable memis ber tried to make out, because I quoted sometliing published under a nom de - plume in a responsible newspaper, that the information is not to be relied upon. It is the place of the Government, when direct statements are published, to investigate them, especially when they can by locate them, as they can the statements I have read to-night. As far as concerns the honourable member's imputation as my motives, he is welcome to his opinion. I hold just as strong opinions on the other side as to the efficacy of vaccination probably, he or Dr Cumpston does, I am entitled to express them in House, if I believe that by doing so shall bring relief to a large number of people who are suffering, and who the great newspapers of the State are declaring toof modern medicine and science. day are being unfairly and unjustly treated. The Sydney Morning Herald is now calling it an absurd quarantion tine, and an unjust imposition upon the people, although for many weeks it said nothing. Is it saying this because the business people of Sydney have had a series of meetings, and I believe, notified the newspapers that they continue to boom this alleged pox they can look forward to a material reduction in their advertising contribucome to. tions? We must naturally look for some reason why the Sydney Herald and the Daily have now assumed the position of critics of that which they formerly supported. The Telegraph says that the Government are the laughing-stock of the world. the Minister of Trade and Customs that the Telegraph does not know what it is talking about? It has all the sources of information available. It has the key to the whole position; it has its men in and out reporting these cases from day to a day; and, with all this knowledge, it is forced to affirm that the Government are t making themselves the laughing-stock of the world. ' How can one think anything an else, when we know that there is no count try in the world where small-pox has existed that has ever done such a ridiculous and absurd thing as the Federal Goof vernment have done by imposing an embargo, and all the difficulties entailed a thereby, upon the public? The Minister, n - who tries to undermine the efforts of any This one who endeavours to bring relief, says that I referred to the Government. Who else responsible for the embargo ? Because I have tried from day to day, and from week to week, to impress the Government with a sense of responsibility and wrong-doing, the Minister has had the temerity to say that I have been actuated political motives. The life, death, and health of the community are matters too important to be the plaything to of party politics. I hold, as many others do, that the action of the Government has brought into Australia an evil that as, is becoming obsolete in other countries. and A Government that tries to cure disease the by the indirect method of vaccination, I when that disease can be dealt with successfully only by isolation, sanitation, and segregation, does not understand the d r if t The Minister says, "" I have made inquiries from reliable sources, and have informabased on the certificates of medical men who have attended the patients, and there is not one case of death which is now attributed to vaccination."" If a public inquiry were held, and opportunity were have, given to those who know the condition if of the victims immediately after vaccinasmalltion, and from then until the time of death, a different conclusion would be The doctors certify only as to the final cause of death, generally stating Morning it to be heart failure. They do not say Telegraph what brought about the heart failure. Who would expect the admission from the medical profession that death has resulted from vaccination, when a large Will number of the members of the profession, imply whenever a small-pox epidemic breaks oub, make it the excuse to cry, "" Vaccinate, vaccinate."" Why do the doctors urge wholesale vaccination? Is it because they know vaccination to be beneficial ? No. Ib is merely a medical fetish that is now tabooed by the wisest scientists.",59
555,Mr MCGRATH,AUSTRALIA,There should be a quorum to listen to this highly ing address. [Quorum formed.],60
556,Mr WEBSTER,AUSTRALIA,"The Minister must have known that his charges againsb me would be replied bo, but he nevertheless left the chamber. He attributed my action to quite other than the real causes. Would he say that the Daily Telegraph was tryin g to make political capital out of this subject? He knows as well as I do that the medical certificates on which he bases the statement that there has been no death as the result of vaccination are certificates giving merely the final symptoms before death, not the real causes which culminated in deaths from bloodpoisoning, heart-failure and erysipelas. The doctors do nob say what were the primary cause of those terminations of life. But the friends of the victims, who saw them i m mediately after vaccination, and witnessed their subsequent sufferings and symptoms, could prove that they would be alive today had they not been vaccinated. The Minister does not concern himself with that. He is content to accept the certificates of the members of a largely biased profession, who always make a lot of money out of a visitation of this kind. Take, for instance, the doctor who vaccinated a staff-and riot a very large one .either-in a big office in Sydney. It took him two hours and a half, and he lifted 80 guineas for the work. So it is with the doctors who privately have charged from half-a-guinea up to two or three guineas for the operation . But that was nothing compared with the business which was brought to them afterwards as the result of the vaccination. These men were largely in terested in vaccination from a financial - stand-point, and I know from some of bhem that nothing but the financial side of the question appealed to them. Yet these are the men upon whom the Minister relies to guide him. I shall continue 'to refer to this matter so long as the Government continue to be, in the words of - the Daily Telegraph, "" a laughing-stock * f the w o r l d . "" So long as they adhere to their present attibude, I shall persist in my effort to prove that that newspaper is right, and that the Government are reckless and indifferent to the appeals which are made, not only from this side of the chamber, bub from bheir own side. Whab has happened to the honourable member for Werriwa ?

He says that an honourable member should never be out of his place in House, that he should closely follow every organ. debate, and thoroughly scrutinise every item on the Estimates. The Government Whip interjects. I do not know what the honourable member said, but it cannot be much, seeing that it produces hilarity on the part of the honourable member for Wilmot.

B ut while Dr Cumpston is urging that the other half of the people of Sydney should be vaccinated, I shall not cease to do my duty. No man who understands the circumstances of the case would for a moment dogmatize as to whether this embargo should be retained. A similar embargo has never been imposed in any other country in the world. Surely it is sumcient evidence that not one death has occurred in Sydney, although there have been a thousand cases of alleged small-pox there. Surely it is sumcient to know that there are men in the medical profession who are qualified to judge, and who declare that it is not small-pox at all, but merely cow-pox. Government only wish to know what Dr Cumpston says. They will accept no other guide. In spite of all the appeals which have been made to them by honourable members, and in spite of the appeals of the Daily Telegraph and the Sydney Morning Herald not to make themselves the laughing-stock of the world, they still remain adamant.

585,The CHAIRMAN,AUSTRALIA,The honourable member's time has expired.,62
586,Mr MATHEWS,AUSTRALIA,"Melbourne Ports) [10.35] - I am getting rather afraid of our commitments upon defence, and I am of opinion that it is about time we called a halt. In this . Bill I find that provision is made for the expenditure of Â£300,000 during one month, and it is to be absorbed in "" contingencies,"" "" miscellaneous services,"" and "" petty cash."" Of course I am satisfied that the Ministry recognise that a halt will have to be called some time in our expenditure upon defence. All world Governments are expending more in this direction than they can afford, and we seem to be following in their footsteps. Whilst I am of opinion that it is imperative that we should defend Australia, it seems to me that the Department is expending money without giving us a return commensurate with that expenditure.. We have only to look at the Department to find that it is nothing but a seething mass of discontent. know who is responsible for this. Whether the Department is too big for a Minister to handle, I cannot say with any degree of assurance. But day after day I have submitted to me most peculiar anomalies in it . At one time a decision will be given which will suit one man or set of men, and in almost parallel circumstances a different method of administration will be applied to another man or another set of men. That naturally breeds discontent. I do not care in what walk of life a man may be placed, he expects to be treated in the same way as his compeers. I recollect a few years ago when a crisis was created in this House because of the desire of a majority that a Commission should be appointed to in vestigate the inner working of the Postal Department. It was proved beyond a doubt that it was necessary that such an Yet the investigation should take place. I read the report of the Commission, and picked out from the evidence the portions in which I was interested. If an inquiry was necessary in the case of the Postal Department, we can say with perfect assurance, that the administration of the Defence Department needs a similar inquiry much more urgently. We have to take into consideration the fact that while the Post and Telegraph Department is an earning Department, the Defence Department is a spending Department. We are paying money for defence as for insurance.",62
587,Mr SINCLAIR,AUSTRALIA,It is a very heavy premium.,62
588,Mr MATHEWS,AUSTRALIA,"I agree with the honourable member. The men are not satisfied, and no one who gives the matter any consideration can be satisfied with the results from our expenditure on defence. I could enumerate many ways in which we could get a better return for our money. We find one Department overstocked and overmanned, and yet a demand made for more men. We find another underover the stocked and undermanned, and no effort made by the sub-heads of the Department can bring about any improvement of the condition of affairs.",62
589,Mr BURNS,AUSTRALIA,Is the honourable member now referring to the Defence Department*,62
590,Mr MATHEWS,AUSTRALIA,"Yes. The irregularities in connection with that Department demand serious attention. I have been, perhaps, more closely associated with the Defence Department than have I do not most of the members of the Committee. My electoral division has within its boundaries most of the branches of the Department in Victoria, and naturally irregularities in connection with it are freely brought under my notice. are dozens of cases which I might every day bring before the Department to secure redress, but I am unable to do so. I believe that the Minister of Defence is earnest in the desire to carry out the administration of the Department properly, but, like every Minister who has preceded him, he is surrounded by a body of officers who are determined that they shall run the show and be the real administrators of the Department. The Minister feels that he is a layman in charge of a highly technical Department, and must proceed with great care. Naturally he does not like to take a stand, if he proposes any departure from the advice of his officials, unless very sure of his ground. Rather than create .a position which as a layman he could not maintain, he allows matters to go by the board. That is not a good thing for Australia. From many matters which have come under my notice it has been proved that it is useless to appeal to the Defence Department for information or to have wrongs redressed. If honourable members put questions concerning the administration of defence on the notice-paper, they will find that the Minister in this House representing the Minister of Defence will ask them to be good enough to let the matter in which they are interested stand over until next Thursday. On next Thursday they will be asked to put it off until the following week. Last session I put some questions on the paper to which lying answers were given, and I was put off until Parliament was dissolved. I had to wait u n t i l we again, this year to get answers to questions which I submitted last October.",62

592,Mr MATHEWS,AUSTRALIA,"To some, but not to all of them. If it is thought that drawing the long bow, I ask any honoranswer able member to put a question concernI ing a defence matter on the paper, and week. he will find that the officials will beat all round the bush, and will not answer the question directly. The Minister seems to be helpless. His officials will not port upon a question put to them. I do not wish to particularize any branch the Department. We know that, no matmen ter how well men are treated, some imagine that they have grievances. It an Englishman's prerogative to have grievance, and we must take a lot of the complaints that are made with a grain of There gait. But I say that, no matter how unfairly a man may be treated in the Defence Department, he has to surmount enormous difficulties to get his case placed before the responsible head of the Department, the Minister. He has to follow a course of procedure recognised in military and naval quarters. He must first of all ask for redress from his immediately superior responsible officer. H is complaint is then passed on to another responsible oflicer. If the officers are against the man who complains, they keep back his complaint. They pigeonhole it , and it may take years before it reaches any person who can redress the wrong complained of. I charge the heads he is and sub-heads of the Defence Department with having repeatedly taken this stand against men who have been seeking redress. To mention a particular case, I may say that last October it came to my knowledge that the petty officers and warrant officers who had been brought out from England were receiving 2s. per day lodging allowance, while men who had been in Australia before, and were doing exactly the same work, did nob receive the allowance. It is admitted that that was not fair. The honourable member for Adelaide at the time represented the Defence Department in this House, and I put a question on the subject on the paper, which was answered in a manner that showed an intention to deceive.  that?",63
593,Mr MATHEWS,AUSTRALIA,"This occurred under met the late Government. It has become apparent, I think, to honourable members on both sides that when I speak on these matters it is not a question with me of any I trust that the honourable member for Echuca will not breab defence questions as I am party questions. As I say, I received an that was intended to deceive, and was asked to put off the question for a It was further postponed, and Parliament had actually prorogued before I got a reply. I made a complaint, and there was au inquiry; but it was not u n t il rethe present Government got into power that I could extract from the defence offiof cials the report, which showed that the had been treated wrongly, and that will they had been paid their back money, is putting them on an equality with the i m a ported men. Then there are Australian regulations and British regulations, and ""the military authorities use either suit them wheu dealing - with the men. There are men here who are receiving one-third more pay than they would in England, while others, doing the work, are receiving one-third than they would in England. almost impossible to reach the Minister past the Commandaut, or the Commanding Oflicer of a division, and much more so to get past the Naval or Military Board; and when you do get to him, neither he nor you have time to look into all the details of the many cases that require investigation. The subordinate officers ought to secure a fair and square deal to all; and, if they do not, and the Minister cannot be reached, then I say that the Defence Department an inquiry just as much as does the Post and Telegraph Department. asked to vote the large sum of Â£300,000 for one month, and I point out that while we have, say, a definite sum of Â£200 down for pay, we have gencies set down at Â£2,000, while, with pay at Â£700, the vague term '' contingencies "" is responsible for Â£15,000, and so on. Tliere should be some method of securing that the money shall be so expended as to give a full return, and that those in subjection to the officers and the Boards should have a fair deal. We have always boasted of being able to run our Departments on common-sense and Democratic, or, as the Government would say, Liberal, lines; and there is no reason why we should follow the systems of older countries which are based on militarism. As matters stand, if a mau endeavours to redress a wrong, he finds himself so persecuted that it would have been better for him to have kept his mouth shut. The authorities go so far as to interfere with his social life. pose we are all agreed that when a man has done the work he is paid for, how he occupies himself afterwards is a matter for himself, always providing that it is not to his discredit or does not make him unfit for duty; and it is exactly under this latter proviso that the interference takes place. Of course, we have no desire to name the officers who are responsible for this; but if the Naval Board and other authorities will not allow the warrant oflicers and the rank and file to get justice, names will have to be mentioned, or steps taken to have a full inquiry into the administration. Str. Mafhews. that tent in the Defence Departmeut is more detrimental to a country than discontent in any other Department. I should like to see a Defence Minister in this House same with some power and responsibility. The less Honorary Minister has given defence matIt is ters much thought, and is quite fitted to take some responsibility in administration. The Minister of Defence does not object to listen to complaints or grievances, but, as a matter of fact, he has not the time to go into the multitudinous matters. It so happens that my constituency is much interested in defence matters. I think the Prime Minister will admit that when he was in charge of the Defence Department, although I worried him a great deal, I was always fair in requires my dealings with him, and I believe the Government of the day will not charge We are me with being unfair in any statements I make.",63
594,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA,Did you find the contin- then Minister unfair?,64
595,Mr MATHEWS,AUSTRALIA,"No , I cannot say he was. When I make a statement such as I make to-uight, it is only with a view of having the matter thoroughly considered. The Defence Department is a large spending Department, and its outlay is increasing. The Northern Territory or the transcontinental railway is nothing as a sink for money when compared with the Defence Department, yet we in this House, which is supposed to be the superior House so far as the purse is concerned, are utterly at sea as to what is being done in that particular Department. Either we shall have to get a Minister i u this House really responsible for the Department, or we shall have to have an inquiry to find out who is responsible, so that the members of the I sup- House can go to him with niatters that come under their notice. If this is not done, I shall endeavour to get other members who are interested in defence administration and expenditure to join me in taking steps to see that the money is spent in the right direction with due economy and a fair return, and that in dividuals in the Department get justice meted out to them.",64
596,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIA,Why not get the Minister of Defence to come to the bar of the House ?,64
597,Mr MATHEWS,AUSTRALIA,"In a Parliament Discon- like this, with both Houses returned on the same franchise, it would be a good thing to arrange for Ministers to appear in either House when necessary.",64
598,Mr BOYD,AUSTRALIA,That is provided for in the Victoria a Constitution now.,65
599,Mr MATHEWS,AUSTRALIA,"Whereve r one goes he hears comments as to the Defence Department becoming a large spending Department. We recognise that we must prepare for defence, but the expenditure must be carefully watched. When witnessing the arrival of the Australian Fleet in Sydney Harbor, one could hear everywhere comments about the magnitude of the defence expenditure, and queries as to where we were going to stop, and whether we were spending the money in the right direction. I trust that the Ministry wil l consider this matter from both stand-points, and provide the opportunity for honourable members to place matters before them, so that they may get redress as far as individuals in the Defence Department are concerned, and see how the money is spent.",65
600,Mr MCGRATH,AUSTRALIA,"Ballarat) [11.5] Speaking earlier i u the evening, I said the Prime Minister had admitted that the Government were not going to spend the amount placed on the Estimates for this year. The Prime Minister denied this, and called upon me to withdraw it . I now find that he made the following statementIt is quite true that the Estimates are Â£4,000,000 more than the actual spending last year, but it is very probable that when we have tried our hardest to spend all this money year, as they did last year, we shall have more than ,Â£1,000,000 unspent. That confirms my previous statement.",65

Is it to come off the Postal Department? after member complains that telephones are needed all over the country, and if the retrenchment is going to take place at the expense of the Postal Department, it will be a very bad thing, and ought not to be allowed. The Prime Minister blurted this statement out the .other night. I know he did not intend to make it , and was afterwards sorry he did make it , because he is evidently troubled about it to-night, or he would not have made the remark he did to the honourable member for Ballarat.",65
603,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA,"When you people deliberately misrepresent a man, it w o u l d annoy anybody.",65
604,Mr MCDONALD,AUSTRALIA,"The honourable member should be the last in this House to talk about deliberately misrepresenting anybody, especially after the statement he made the other night, and otlier statements which he has made throughout the country at otlier times. There is no greater offender in that regard than the honourable member himself. I have already quoted a number of cases, and I have a number more that I could dig out of his speeches during the campaign to show that he was either misreported, or making misrepresentations.",65
605,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA,The honourable member has never dug one out yet.,65
606,Mr MCDONALD,AUSTRALIA,"The honourable member has wriggled out of it in a way that is not creditable to himself. He has never got out of his statement about spending all the revenue, or cleared up his assertion that the public accounts were not properly audited. His object in making it was to mislead the people.",65
607,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA,I never made it .,65
608,Mr MCDONALD,AUSTRALIA,"Then was there a conspiracy by the newspapers of the country to attribute certain statements to the this honourable member, with the object of misleading the public. Does he say that on all these occasions he was deliberately misrepresented by the press ?",65
609,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA,There has been an instance of misrepresentation to-night. I bave been misrepresented to my face.,65
610,Mr MCDONALD,AUSTRALIA,"If the honourable member's exact words were not used, the member who quoted him used words as nearly as possible those of the Prime M in ister. When the statement was justified by a quotation, the Prime Minister made nasty interjections.",65
611,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA,It was not justiMember fied. The honourable member misrepresented me.,65
612,Mr MCDONALD,AUSTRALIA,"Accordin g to the Prime Minister, every one misrepresents him. I have never tried to do so. I have accepted the newspaper reports in good faith, and have based my questions on them. There are one or two matters to which I wish to refer in this debate. For instance, the Postmaster-General, during the electoral campaign, told his constituents that it was a wicked waste to spend money on the Federal Capital-that the Capital should be in Melbourne or in Sydney. He said, too, that the transcontinental railway meant another waste of money. What is the honourable gentleman's present position in regard to those big national questions? I should like to kuow how the construction of the transcontinental railway is progressing. understand that the line is not being constructed as quickly as it should be, and I have been led to believe that the saving of Â£1,000,000 which the Government expect to make this year will be made at the expense of the line. If the Postmaster General has his way, the Federal Capital expenditure will also be starved. torian members should be the last to offer objections to the spending of money on the Federal Capital. They have had their fair share of Federal expenditure. It was anticipated by the members of the first Parliament that the Parliament - would meet in Melbourne only for two or three years; but it has now been meeting here for thirteen years, and will probably meet here for another six or seven years.",65
613,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,AUSTRALIA,Anothe r three years will see us out of Melbourne.,66
614,Mr MCDONALD,AUSTRALIA,"If the Government intend to save Â£1,000,000 this year, it may be at the expense of the Federal Capital.",66
615,Mr BOYD,AUSTRALIA,The honourable member does not expect to be at the Capital within three years?,66
616,Mr MCDONALD,AUSTRALIA,"I expect to be there soon, and I hope that the Government will not save money in that direction. The trans-Siberian railway was laid at the rate of 18 miles a week; and, seeing that the trans-Australian railway will traverse flat country, offering few engineering difficulties, and with no large water-courses, it ought to be laid at the rate of at least 20 miles a week.",66
617,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AUSTRALIA,"At the present rate of progress, the line will not be finished within twenty years.",66
618,Mr MCDONALD,AUSTRALIA,"The Minister of Home Affairs went to Port Augusta to see how things were being done there. Just before he went, we heard that the track-layer whioh had been purchased by the previous Government, was a valueless machine, which had cost a lot of money that had been wasted. The late member for Fremantle told us that the purchase of the machine was a w i l f u l waste of money. But the Minister, on his return, told us that it was the most wonderful machine that he bad seen in Australia, and was capable of doing the work of dozens of men. The trouble was that the conti actor who engaged to supply trucks failed to do so, and the machine could I not work to its full capacity. Now that the trucks are available, the machine has become the most useful thing that could be obtained for its purpose. I hope that the railway will be pushed on as fast as possible.",66

620,Mr MCDONALD,AUSTRALIA,B i g railway works more than any other can be carried out successfully by day labour.,66
621,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,AUSTRALIA,"Accordin g to the honourable member's statement, not much has been done yet.",66
622,Mr MCDONALD,AUSTRALIA,"That is so; but difficulties are always met with at the start of an enterprise. But now that the work has been started, there is ample money left to our honourable friends to carry it right through. I wish to see the construction of the railway pushed on as quickly as possible. The Government ought to make an effort to push on .with the work, and show us exactly what they can do in administering the Department. They would then be doing a good thing for the people of Australia, particularly those who live in Western Australia. Although, probably, at first the line may not be so successful as we anticipated, still I trust that the earliest opportunity will be taken to push ahead with its construction. There are one or two other matters on which I desire to say a few words.",66
623,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA,Do you know that this is Tuesday night?,66
624,Mr MCDONALD,AUSTRALIA,I understood that the Government were prepared to adjourn at a reasonable hour. How far do they wish to go with the Bill to-night ?,66
625,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA,"We want the Bill put through, of course.",66
626,Mr MCDONALD,AUSTRALIA,"I wish to speak particularly about the proposed meat freezing works at Port Darwin. I think that if the Government would be content to take the Bill to the thirdreading stage to-night, we could dispose of it in a couple of liours tomorrow.",66

637,Mr AGAR WYNNE,AUSTRALIA,Y o u are only doing this out of nastiness.,67
638,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIA,"That is, I think, a very unfair remark on the part of the Postmaster-General. I think that the Ministerialists will have to admit that in this session, at any rate, the Opposition have not dealt with the Northern Territory in a party spirit. We have not harassed the Government, and I am sure that the Minister of External Affairs agree with me that we have not acted a party or carping spirit. I do not think "" Yes . "" that honourable members in Opposition should deal with a matter differently from what they would do when sitting the Ministerial side, or vice versa. there are some niatters of so important fundamental a character that it is necesproposal. sary, I think, that we should deal with them at the first opportunity. that I feel rather strongly on the point him. that the Government have turned down the idea of carrying on the freezing works at Port Darwin as a Government concern.

But Mr THOMAS - But for the time being and the Governmeut have turned down the Persons who wish to undertake the works are discussing the matter with I confess the Miuister, and are negotiating with",67

654,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIA,"I have no objection to the Government saying that it is their policy to turn, down Government concerns in favour of private enterprise. But honourable members upon this side of the Chamber think differently, and we have a right to challenge their action at every available point.",68
655,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,AUSTRALIA,"The Territory is costing us Â£700,000 a year now.",68
656,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIA,"And it is time that we did away with that loss. policy of the late Government to build a railway from Pine Creek Katherine, and to establish freezing works at Port Darwin. I venture to say that the Minister of External Affairs has been told that it is necessary for the development of the Territory that freezing works should be established there. When I was in the Territory, a deputation waited on me, and urged that freezing works should be erected there. reply was that the Government were quite prepared to place upon the Estimates a sum of money for that purpose; but I desired to know the most suitable site upon which to erect them, and until the A d ministrator was satisfied on that point, I was uot willing to agree to any particular site. At that time the Administrator had been in the Territory only a week or two, and, consequently, was not in a position to say which was the most eligible site. W it h in a few months, however, he communicated with me to the effect that Port Darwin was the proper place at which to establish the works. In order to develop the Territory, it is necessary, not only that freezing works should be erected there, but that a railway sliould be constructed from Pine Creek to the Katherine. Had the Pisher Government remained in office, we should have placed upon the Estimates for the current financial year a sum sufficient to cover the cost of erecting freezing works at Port Darwin. In order that no time should be lost in the construction of those works, the Administrator, when he came south, placed himself in communication with some architects who had had a great deal of experience in connection with similar works elsewhere. The result was that arrangements were made for Mr D'Ebro to visit the Territory for the purpose of deciding upon the locality where the works should be established, and of procuring plans and specifications relating to same. Upon an important matter of principle, therefore, there has been a reversal of policy by this Government. If we are to wait ""until a private company is prepared to undertake the establishment of these works, delay will be inevitable. Seeing that the development of the Territory depends upon their erection, it is not wise that this matter should be lef t in the hands of private enterprise. If private enterprise is to be permitted to establish freezing works there, it will take into serious consideraI t was the tion the question of profits, and I do not see why the development of a large porto the tion of the Territory should depend upon whether certain persons can make a profit or not. If the Government undertook the erection of freezing works at Port Darwin, those works could be carried on as a business concern, and made to pay' their way, together with sufficient interest on their capital cost. But beyond that there would be no necessity to make a My profit, because of the direct benefit that would accrue to the people in the way of the development of big pastoral'areas. I admit that, if every pastoralist in the Territory had a certain interest in the works",68
657,Mr GLYNN,AUSTRALIA,We must tie them up to the works.,68
658,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIA,"If the works can be run co-operatively, there is something in that suggestion. That would mean that the whole of the money would have to be raised by the pastoralists, and no outsiders would be allowed to have a hand in the business. Sir JOH N FOBBEST - The Government of which the honourable gentleman was a member did nothing when they had the power.",68
659,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIA,"We tried to do something in the matter. I do not know that the present Government have done very much in the Northern Territory, though they have had an advantage over the late Government, who had a good deal of the spade work to do. We were told by the Prime Minister in his Parramatta speech that if the Liberals were returned to power there would be a vigorous development of the Northern Territory.",68
660,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA,"I thought then that we should have a few more supporters in this House. I ought to have said that we would do these things if the Opposition stopped ""stone-walling."" I am sorry now that I did not say so.",68
661,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIA,"It was fio be presumed from the honourable gentleman's statement at Parramatta that the late Government - were not developing the vigorously. Honourable members opposite are becoming restive, and I will let the matter go now if they will agree to have it discussed on the third reading of the Bill. I do not think that I should be treated in this way. How often have I spoken this session?",69
662,Sir JOHN FORREST,AUSTRALIA,The gentleman has never been like this before.,69
663,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIA,"And this is all the thanks I get for it . I feel very strongly on this matter. The Minister administering the Northern Territory is here now, and I would ask him whether the Opposition have been unfair or unreasonable in any of their criticisms of the present administration of Northern Territory. One reason why they have not is, perliaps, the fact that the honourable member for Angas is Minister of External Affairs, and every member ou this side is anxious that nothing unkind or discourteous should be said of him. If another Minister occupied the positiou, it is possible that he would not have had as easy a time as the honourable meinber for Angas has had. We have to face the facts as they are. It must be admitted that there is a very powerful Beef Trust in America. Attorney-General will admit that it is one of the biggest trusts in the world. If only one-half of what we read about it is true, it is a very cruel trust. is appalling to know that for the sake of dividends it is prepared to ruin thousands of people. .During the lasttwo or three days I have read a number of articles by a Mr Bussell, a journalist of repute in America, on the subject of the American Beef Trust. I am not prepared to say that everything he has written about the Trust is absolutely correct, but even allowing that he has overstated the case against it by 50 per cent., it is still clear that it constitutes a.big problem in America today. that Australia is not America, and whether the Beef Trust has yet started in Australia is questioned. Some say that it has, aud some that it has not. heard Mr Trefle, Minister of Lands in New South Wales, state at a public meeting that the representatives of the Trust had met him, and had asked for certain concessions in New South Wales, which he refused. I understand that they subTerritory sequently went to Brisbane, and had started operations there. I do not believe all the cables which appear in the newspapers, but I have seen cables stating that the American Beef Trust has started operations in the Argentine - ",69
664,Mr SAMPSON,AUSTRALIA,"It has been in the Argentine for some time. honourable Mr THOMAS - The honourable gentleman admits that it has started in the Argentine. What guarantee have we that this private company, which has been referred to, is not connected with the American Beef Trust?",69
665,Mr GLYNN,AUSTRALIA,"It is a big English company, with branches all over the world.",69
666,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIA,"It may or may not be an English or Australian company, the but we have no guarantee that it wil l not be purchased or come within the scope of the American Trust tomorrow. It is admitted that the Beef Trust in America is stronger than the railway companies, stronger than a great many of the Judges, and stronger even than the Government; at any rate, it was' stronger than the last Republican Government, because, apparently, it gave very large sums to the electioneering funds, amounting, I am told, to some Â£800,000. I do not think there is much doubt that there are trusts The in Australia who are prepared to assist political parties in providing the sinews of war. I did not wish particularly to raise this question to-night, but I think It we are justified in asking the Minister of External Affairs why it is that the proposals of the late Government have been turned down.",69
667,Mr GLYNN,AUSTRALIA,I could give plenty of reasons that would appeal to the honourable member.,69
668,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIA,"The Minister of External Affairs is from South Australia, where, I understand, a Liberal Government, with a majority in both Houses, run freezing works of their own. I admit Mr SAMPSON - They have got the works, and they must keep them going.",69
669,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIA,"If it were better for the community, the Government could I hand the works back to private enterprise. I presume it was a Liberal Government who started the works.",69
670,Sir JOHN FORREST,AUSTRALIA,Do they pay well?,69
671,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIA,I do not know; all I say is that the Liberal Government of South Australia are running their own freezing works.,70
672,Sir JOHN FORREST,AUSTRALIA,"The meinber, as Minister of External Affairs, spent enough in the Northern Territory !",70
673,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIA,That is another question.,70
674,Sir JOHN FORREST,AUSTRALIA,"There is Â£70,000 alone for salaries.",70
675,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIA,"It is a big Territory, and we have to do something with it .",70
676,Sir JOHN FORREST,AUSTRALIA,How many people are there up there?,70
677,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIA,I do not know that we are discussing that matter. Mr. JOSEPH CO?K - Seve n settlers have gone up.,70
678,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIA,"The late Government may have failed miserably, if honourable members opposite choose to say so; but the Prime Minister, at Parramatta, said that the Liberal Government were going in for a vigorous development.",70
679,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA,That is so; we,70
680,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIA,The proposal before us does not show much evidence of vigorous work.,70
681,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA,"Considerin g all the late Government did in three years, honourable members opposite might give us a little more than three months. The late Government got seven settlers there, and that is an achievement at a cost of Â£700,000.",70
682,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIA,"At any rate, there are more settlers there than there were before. However, we are not discussing what has or has not been done in the way of development; I am focussing attention on the fact that the Government are not prepared to go on themselves with the freezing works.",70

685,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA,We must have a Supply Bill .,70
686,Mr FINLAYSON,AUSTRALIA,"I regret that at this hour we should be compelled to raise this question, but it is too important to be allowed to pass. Personally, this is the first opportunity I have had to raise the question of the freezing works at Darwin since receiving the reply of the M in ister of External Affairs to my question. It was by the merest accident that we discovered from a chance remark that the Government intended to erect freezing works by arrangement with a private company. I should not have felt so anxious were it not for the final statebonorable ment in the reply that I received. I asked the Minister whether we would have an opportunity of discussing any proposal or agreement before a final decision was arrived at, and' I was informed that it might not be practicable to submit it before finality. Unless we on this side in form the Minister as to our attitude on the question, it would be easy for an agreement to slip through, and the whole matter to be fixed up before any steps could be taken to improve or alter the conditions. The fact is that the people of Australia are nervous on this question of the meat supply. It represents one of the most important industries, and in later years, particularly in the Northern Territory, may become the most important industry. In developing new country, occupation must first follow along the lines of pastoral pursuits where the are. land will allow it . You must allow settlers large areas, and give them opportunities to open up the country in the quickest possible way. It is also patent to every one who knows anything of the trend of modern commercial development that refrigeration is playing an in creasingly important part in the marketing of food products, not only on land, but by sea. The shipping companies are spending thousands of pounds in experimenting in this direction, and refrigeration is a most important feature in meat works and in the handling of f r u it . The Governments of different countries are taking a more and more active part in the question all over the world. The honourable member who preceded me, the ex-Minister of External Affairs, referred to the South Australian Government's action in this regard. The Western Australian Government have also developed in that direction lately, and it is not a new thing in Victoria, where the Government are extending, as rapidly as possible, their cool storage provisions for food products of all sorts. New South Wales and Queensland are also doing the same, yet the Commonwealth Government, who should set the example in commercial development to all the States, are absolutely going back to the oldest and worse methods of providing the accommodation so urgently required. The Minister of External Affairs admitted, in reply to my questions, that a site had been selected for' the works at Darwin, and the plan had been prepared. Why, then, did he not proceed with the intention of the late Government to make the works Government works, and so protect the people against any possibility of difficulty in regard to the preservation of meat, or opportunity to store their meat at a satisfactory price? The people of Australia are very nervous on this matter, and have good reason to be. The Meat Trust of America is notorious, not for the way it has served, but for the way it has robbed, the public. There is no question that it has established itself in Australia. has secured meat works 18 miles from Townsville, and also near Cairns. is most significant.",70
687,Mr MCDONALD,AUSTRALIA,I draw attention to the state of the Committee.,71

691,Mr MASSYGREENE,AUSTRALIA,Certainly.' formed.],71
692,Mr FINLAYSON,AUSTRALIA,"The Trust has meat works in other parts of the country, but the acquisition of works in North Queensland can have only one object. It must be patent to every honourable member that it has designs on the northern parts of Australia. There are other places in North Queensland for the refrigeration of meat, 'but it is certain that the Trust do not intend to allow competitors to remain in that business any longer than they can help. can be done to eliminate competition and give them an absolute monopoly of the meat-freezing works of Australia, particularly in Queensland, they are going to do it . The only possible protection for the people is not by the encouragement of private enterprise, but by the Government taking a hand. the other evening to the fact that the Governments of the civilized countries of the wbrld today are expanding in every direction their command and control of public utilities, and if it is true that refrigeration is playing ah increasingly important part iii the preservation of food products, it is [94] most necessary that the Government should hold a controlling influence in that direction. The only remedy for monopolies, and the only guarantee against trusts in Australia, lies in the hands of the Commonwealth Government. The States are unable to do effective work in that direction, being prevented by their artificial geographical boundaries from following trusts or combines beyond their own borders. It remains for the Commonwealth Government to protect the people of Australia from every possible influence in this direction. We had an exceptionally favourable opportunity to do It this when opening up a piece of Australia for the benefit of the whole people, This in order to guarantee the other parts of Australia that that part would not be lef t open to foreign invasion, yet we have lef t it wide open to an invasion of a much more dangerous, subtle, and insidious character.",71
693,Mr MCDONALD,AUSTRALIA,"I call attention to the state of the Committee. [Quorum, formed.] Mr FINLAYSON . ' - The honourable tp member for Oxley raised this question last week, and the Attorney-General, speaking for the Minister of Trade and [Quorum Customs, said that information was being sought regarding the meat industry. While the Minister of Trade and Customs is seeking information, and the M in ister of External Affairs negotiating in regard to the erection of works, damage may be done which it may take years to repair. Honourable members are willin g to spend money freely for the development of the Northern Territory, and I think they are agreed that it can be wisely spent there on the erection of freezing works. I understand that the estiI f anything mated cost of a complete establishment is Â£135,000. Mr Glynn . - From Â£80,000 to Â£100,000.",71
694,Mr FINLAYSON,AUSTRALIA,The r e can be no need to carry out the whole scheme at the I referred beginning. Cannot the Minister see hi3 way to complete a section of the works first?,71
695,Mr GLYNN,AUSTRALIA,"This is not a question of cash, but of getting pastoral development associated with the freezing works. Some of these capitalists own stations in the Territory. Red Hill was bought by one company recently. It is a pure business proposition. We bave to consider what is best for the Commonwealth. . Mr FINLAYSON - The Government can best assist and encourage pastoralists by saying, "" We shall erect freezing works at Darwin, to which you can send your meat.""",71
696,Mr GLYNN,AUSTRALIA,T b at is what we are ing to do. I am tryin g to get freezing works established at Darwin rather than at Wyndham.,72
697,Mr FINLAYSON,AUSTRALIA,But works under private control must be run to suit private interests.,72
698,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIA,Would the honourable member establish Commonwealth export works throughout Australia?,72
699,Mr FINLAYSON,AUSTRALIA,"Yes ; as a member of the Royal Commission which in quired into the f r u it industry, I have signed the recommendation that the States should establish export f r u it depots and departments, and I think that the Commonwealth should set a good example. A Government representing the whole people can do things more effectively than any other authority. Private interest has always its own ends to serve. I ""do not blame capitalists interested in the meat industry in the Northern Territory for wishing to establish big freezing works, but I say that the Commonwealth must prevent the Meat Trust from acquiring a controlling influence in' the No r t h ern Territory. Freezing works are needed, not only for the benefit of the pastoralists of the Territory, but also for the benefit of the residents of the Terri tory, and particularly of the residents of Port Darwin. We must try to secure for them a supply of fresh vegetables.",72
700,Mr MCDONALD,AUSTRALIA,Surely they can grow vegetables for themselves. There is plenty of water there.,72
701,Mr FINLAYSON,AUSTRALIA,"Vegetables , like f r u it , cannot be grown all the year round; and in the tropics a f r u it and vegetable diet is more to be encouraged than a meat diet. The establishment of freezing works should enable a permanent and regular supply of f r u it and vegetables to be provided. The meat that will be frozen there will not be intended for export only. If it were to be frozen only for export, it might suit the pastoralists just as well to travel their stock to the Alligator Creek works, at Townsville, or to Cairns.",72
702,Mr MCDONALD,AUSTRALIA,"A distance of about 1,500 miles.",72
703,Mr FINLAYSON,AUSTRALIA,"It might be as near to that point as to Darwin ; but we must have at Darwin refrigerating accommodation for the people of the Northtryern Territory. Who is going to provide that accommodation if the Government do hot? Can any one imagine that the promoters of the company are going to consider the residents of the Territory? No ; they are studying their own in terests first and last. I do not blame the company for seizing the opportunity; but I blame the Government who give them the opportunity, especially when we can step in and secure the accommodation which the pastoralists require for export, and which the residents require to enable them to live healthy lives in the tropics..  two or three hundred persons living in Darwin now?",72
704,Mr FINLAYSON,AUSTRALIA,I do not know. The residents are making shift as best they can.,72
705,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,AUSTRALIA,Canno t they live there without a refrigerating apparatus ?,72
706,Mr FINLAYSON,AUSTRALIA,"They are getting along in a sort of way; but if we are to secure proper settlement there, the present haphazard method cannot be allowed to continue.",72
707,Sir JOHN FOBREST,AUSTRALIA,There is not one refrigerating apparatus from Thursday Island to Geraidton. ',72
708,Mr FINLAYSON,AUSTRALIA,"That is exactly why the Government should establish freezing works at Darwin. They should start at one place, and reach out until they establish freezing works at a .dozen places. I was glad to hear the Minister of External Affairs say that it is not a question of cost with the Government. It is a matter of principle, evidently.",72
709,Sir JOHN FOBREST,AUSTRALIA,"It is a question of cost. It will cost Â£100,000 to establish the works, and there are no cattle there. The matter is not urgent at all.",72
710,Mr FINLAYSON,AUSTRALIA,"I am sorry that the Treasurer has not had a consultation with his colleague, who, only a few moments ago, said it was not a question of money with the Government. They need not carry out the whole scheme now, but they could start in a small way, and then as trade expanded enlarge the freezing / accommodation. When the Treasurer tells me that it is a question of cost, which Minister am I to believe? secret of the whole business is that M in isters are in favour, not of the Government control and management of public utilities, but of private enterprise controlling and managing those things which are necessary for the use and the welfare of the people.",72
711,Sir JOHN FORREST,AUSTRALIA,"Private enterprise does it in your State, any way.",73
712,Mr FINLAYSON,AUSTRALIA,"Yes , and private enterprise has been told by the Queensland Government that it is in no danger.",73
713,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,AUSTRALIA, The honourable member's time has expired.,73
714,Mr FINLAYSON,AUSTRALIA,I can make another speech later.,73
715,Mr MCDONALD,AUSTRALIA,"G o on now, as there is no honourable member wishing to-speak.",73
716,Mr FINLAYSON,AUSTRALIA,"I have not much more to say. If the Minister of External Affairs would say that, whilst it is a matter of principle as to whether the Government or private enterprise should do these",73

718,Mr FINLAYSON,AUSTRALIA,"I cannot see the logic of the Minister's position. Government propose to give away rights and privileges in regard to freezing works at Darwin which they say, under certain agreements, will safeguard the interests of the people. But the fact remains that those who are principally interested in the meat business in Australia today are thoseto whom the interests of the people have been a very secondary consideration. I am sure that the Minister will understand that we, on this side, and, I think, honourable members on the other side, too, are nervous in regard to the meat in dustry. It is too important to Australia to be allowed to get into the hands of. one' oompany. No one dare deny that the American Meat Trust is established in Australia. Mr HANS .

724,Mr FINLAYSON,AUSTRALIA,"The policy of the Meat Trust, in every country where it has operated, has been to eliminate competition, and to secure a monopoly of the business. The meat-exporting companies in Quaensland today feel quite nervous in regard to this matter. Fortunately, most of the companies are strong, but some of the weaker companies are There is no ob- trembling, because they realise that it will be only a few years when they will be wiped out. We are told that the American Trust is not working in restraint of trade now. The tiger does not show its claws all at once.

725,Mr FINLAYSON,AUSTRALIA,"The pastoralists are not political friends of mine. They oppose every one on this side, because they think that we are not their friends; but, in a few years, they wil l learn that those who tried to protect them against monopoly were honourable members on this side. The honourable member for Hume, I am sure, is not full y acquainted with the history of the Meat Trust, not only in America, but in other countries  interested in an investigation of the verymatter to which you are referring, and us I can give you my assurance that we can find no direct evidence to connect Swift ' and Company, of Chicago, with the Meat Trust.",73
726,Mr FINLAYSON,AUSTRALIA,"I am sorry that at this moment I have not the documentary evidence here. I have affidavits and reports of every description concerning the operations of these very companies, not only in the United States, but in the Argentine, and South Africa, and also of the possibility of their operations in Australia.  is building up a fabric upon wrong premises.",74
727,The CHAIRMAN,AUSTRALIA,The honourable member for Hume must not make speeches when he is not in possession of the Chair.,74
728,Mr FINLAYSON,AUSTRALIA,"We are faced with a very serious danger, and the position we take up is that whether the pastoralists are our political friends or not, it. we believe that the pastoral industry is too important to be allowed to be used by tliose who have not Australian interests at heart, if by any means we can prevent it .",74
729,Mr FLEMING,AUSTRALIA,The pastoralists do not think that they are in danger.,74
730,Mr FINLAYSON,AUSTRALIA,That does not eliminate the danger.,74
731,Mr FLEMING,AUSTRALIA,"They have considered the matter, and they are not afraid.",74
732,Mr FINLAYSON,AUSTRALIA,"The honourable member for Moreton said a little time ago that, personally, he welcomed the Meat Trust to Queensland, and so also did the Premier of Queensland.",74
733,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA,This is the way in which honourable members help us to get. through non-contentious business.,74
734,Mr FINLAYSON,AUSTRALIA,This is a very contentious matter ,74
735,Mr ROBERTS,AUSTRALIA,Trust s are not a contentious matter with the Government.,74
736,Mr FINLAYSON,AUSTRALIA,"Not if their attitude during the recent elections can be regarded as a criterion. They say, "" All riglit,"" until they find out that the damage has been'done. After the horse has been stolen, they are prepared to lock the stable door. We contend that the interests of the people are of paramount importance. The trouble is that in the erection of freezing works at Port Darwin, the interests of the people are likely to become a secondary consideration. I hope that when the Minister's proposals for the erection of freezing works in the Northern Territory are submitted to us, if we cannot secure the rejection of any private enterprise proposal, we shall at any rate obtain the insertion of some stringent provision which will safeguard the interests of the people. We are anxious to secure a positive guarantee that there shall be no damage done.",74
737,Mr ROBERTS,AUSTRALIA,The Government will not allow us to consider the matter until it has been completed.,74
738,Mr FINLAYSON,AUSTRALIA,The Minister of External Affairs has pointed out that we shall be afforded an opportunity of fighting 'the matter when an agreement has been arrived at that private enterprise shall carry out the work.,74
739,Mr GLYNN,AUSTRALIA,I did not say that.,74
740,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIA,"The Minister said that if the Government established works, we would have an opportunity of discussing",74
741,Mr FINLAYSON,AUSTRALIA,Then I was wrong in the statement which I made. The position put by the Minister only increases my alarm.,74
742,Mr GLYNN,AUSTRALIA,I am afraid that Wyndham will get the benefit which will accrue from the establishment of freezing works rather than the Northern Territory.,74
743,Mr FINLAYSON,AUSTRALIA,"There will be no difficulty in the Minister getting private enterprise to establish freezing works at Port Darwin. The only difficulty will be in regard to the conditions which should be imposed upon the individuals who undertake the work. The very provision which would be rejected by a private company would constitute a sufficient protection by this Parliament of the interests of the people. It is because the margin is always in favour of the Government that we advocate the erection by the Commonwealth of freezing works at Port Darwin. Private enterprise has always its own ends to serve, whereas the Government have only one end to serve, namely, the interests of the people. If these works be established by private enterprise, we shall be incurring absolutely unnecessary risks. If our suggestion be adopted, we shall be protected against all risk, and shall be able to give to the pastoralists that protection to which they are entitled. I may tell the Minister that this is not the last occasion upon which he will hear from us upon this matter. There are a few honourable members upon this side of the chamber-especiall y those who represent Queensland-wh o will return to it , and I shall give my support to any movement in the direction of challenging the position of the Government upon it . I wish now to make a suggestion to the Prime Minister. There may not be much in it",74
744,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA,At this time of the morning t,75
745,Mr FINLAYSON,AUSTRALIA,"It is a good suggestion, and I am sure that the Prime Minister will consider it .",75
746,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA,I am not any suggestions at this hour. I am quite unable to do so.,75
747,Mr FINLAYSON,AUSTRALIA,"To-night, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports emphasized a matter to which the Prime Minister himself called attention the other day, namely, the expenditure on our Public Service, and particularly upon military and naval defence. not an honourable member in this chamber who is not becoming alarmed, not only at the present expenditure upon defence, but at the probable heavy in crease of that expenditure in the future.",75
748,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA,This is honourable member says when he gets upon the other side of the chamber.,75
749,Mr FINLAYSON,AUSTRALIA,The Prime M in ister must have forgotten the attitude which I have always assumed upon this matter.,75
750,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIA,I am sure that do not remember it . All I know is that honourable members opposite have all been boasting about the country of how much they have spent upou defence.,75
751,Mr FINLAYSON,AUSTRALIA,"I have never once made a remark about our expenditure upon defence without in the same sentence regretting what I believe to be an unfortunate necessity. To my mind, our expenditure on defence is, to some extent, a necessity.",75
752,Sir JOHN FORREST,AUSTRALIA,Honourable bers opposite introduced it all. We did not.,75
753,Mr FINLAYSON,AUSTRALIA,"We are committed to it , unfortunately, and I am afraid I must support the present Government in going on with it .",75
754,Sir JOHN FORREST,AUSTRALIA,The honourable member acquiesced in the expenditure on defence last year. v,75
755,Mr FINLAYSON,AUSTRALIA,I am acquiescing in it this year.,75
756,Mr MCGRATH,AUSTRALIA,"Thoug h there has been an increase of Â£1,000,000 .",75
757,Mr FINLAYSON,AUSTRALIA,"I am sorry that I have to vote for the increased expenditure, and the real trouble is that I do not see how I can escape voting for another increase of Â£1,000,000 in this expenditure next year. It is because of the rapidly increasing burden of the expenditure on defence that I offer the Prime Minister what I think is not an unworthy suggestion. It is reasonable to say that as the years go on the danger of war is not increasing. The wisdom, taking intelligence, and reasonableness of the nations are coming to our aid, and there is less danger of war today than there was ten years ago - The tendency in the civilized countries of the world is stronger than ever it was before towards peace. The nations are realizing today more than they ever did before that war and warlike preparations constitute an in There is creasing and unnecessary burden. The suggestion of Mr Winston Churchill the other day for the reduction of armaments was but a sign of the times. Every country in the world is feeling the terrific pressure of military and naval expendiwhat the ture. We in Australia are only at the beginning of it , and it is because I believe there is a better way that I speak as I do to-night. This better way is to be found by the nations exercising ordinary common sense. The wars of the future wil l not be wars of conquest. IA statement on the subject appears in to-night's Herald, from President Wilson of the United States. The wars of the future will arise out of commercial matters. A statement made by the German Emperor some time ago that if the nations continued to build fiscal walls against Germany they would have to be demolished, even if it must be with bayonets, was a very significant statement. We in Australia cannot afford to be on bad terms with any nation. It mem- is our business to develop trade with every country. Nothing is more encouraging or deserving.of encouragement than the expansion of our trade relations with other nations, and especially with the eastern nations, with whom we are more likely to come into conflict than with any others. If we can establish friendly business relations with those nations, we shall have done' a great dpal. Honourable members generally are aware that there has recently been a remarkable interchange of thought and literature between the nations of the world, and this has done more to promote and cement good feeling than anything else that has taken place in the history of the nations. There have been reciprocal visits between different British and German parties, journalists, ministers, parliamentary parties, and business men, and these have done more to prevent war between the countries than all the work of the diplomatists, and those responsible for the government of the two countries. I invite the attention of the Prime Minister in this connection to the work of the Inter-Parliamentary Union. The Parliaments of the different countries of the world are interesting themselves in this matter. They are seeking to check the growing expenditure on armaments, and we in Australia would be wise to take an early and an active part in the promotion of any movement in that direction. I have here a list of the members of the Parliaments of various countries who are identified with the promotion of International conciliation and arbitration for the prevention or settlement of International disputes. Austria has 121 members in this Inter-Parliamentary Union; Belgium, 219; Canada, 165; Denmark, 179; France, 516; Germany, 157; Great Britain, 230; Holland, 108; Hungary, 242; Japan, 379 ; Norway, 144; Portugal, 150; Roumania, 20; Russia, 141; Servia, 21; Spain, 62; Sweden, 281; Switzerland, 69; Turkey, 69; and the United States of America, 272. The Australian Parliament is invited to take a part in this matter. It is remarkable that while the leading nations of the world are spending Â£365,000,000 annually on warlike preparations, or Â£1,000,000 per day, the Inter-Parliamentary Union, with an expenditure of something under Â£3,000, last year did more to promote and keep peace between the nations than the expenditure of Â£365,000,000 on warlike preparations by the nations. Realizing this, the Parliaments of the various countries are now voting money, to be expended not only in preparations for war, but for the promotion of peace. The results of the expenditure of Â£3,000 by the Inter-Parliamentary Union for the promotion of peace have been simply enormous. The chief credit for the fact that the dangers of war have been repeatedly averted during the last few years must be given to the movement for the promotion of peace, to which I have referred. Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Hungary, Norway, Portugal, Roumania, Servia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, and the United States, all annually give Sir. Finlayson. grants towards this object. I wish to suggest to the Prime Minister and to the Treasurer-who , of course, is equally interested-that this Parliament might give an annual grant for the promotion of this Inter-Parliamentary Union for the settlement of national disputes by peaceful means. The dangers in Australia from extravagance in the naval and military expenditure are enough to appal even the stoutest heart amongst us. Apart altogether from the danger of the military authorities usurping the rights JoÂ£ the civil authorities, the expenditure in this unproductive and unworthy direction is a matter that must cause all considerable concern. We are urgently in need of money for expenditure in other directions. There are many miles of territory in Australia waiting for railways, and hungry for development. We are unable to do this work because we are pouring out Â£5,500,000 every year-and the amount is likely to increase-in preparing for war. By the expenditure of a few thousand pounds we could possibly create such a friendly atmosphere and cordial relations with other nations as to render this warlike expenditure absolutely unnecessary. I notice, by-the bye, that out of a total of Â£212,000 for contingencies in the Supply Bill now before us something like Â£40,000 is for the Military and Naval Defence Department. Those contingencies are a very risky thing; but I would forgive the Treasurer a good deal if he could see his way to apply a thousand or two to the laudable object I have mentioned, and so save the country from what I believe is likely to be a burden that will cause trouble not only financially, but in other directions. I should like to refer' to another small matter which has to do with the privileges of honourable members, and this is the first opportunity I have had to do so. We are able to travel on the railways by virtue of our gold passes, and we are also able to travel free on the tramways in Sydney - I suggest to the Prime Minister that it is time he opened up negotiations with the tramway authorities in the other capitals in order to se J cure a similar privilege for honourable members there. If the suggestion has any value at all, it has particular application in Melbourne. We are here trying to serve our constituents, and we have to run north, south, east, and west looking for the Commonwealth Departments. I do not know how other honourable members find it , but the tram fares that I have to pay in Melbourne-and the fares here are not the cheapest in the world",75
758,Sir JOHN FOKREST,AUSTRALIA,They cheap-it does not amount to much!,77
759,Mr FINLAYSON,AUSTRALIA,"The amount I have to pay in fares is a very respectable one. I am fortunate in having constituents who pay me a considerable amount of attention, and I bave a heavy correspondence ' which necessitates various visits to the Government Departments. So much so, that the business sometimes occupies me the better part of the day. The fares, I admit, may not amount to much, perhaps only ls. a day, or, to some honourable members, perhaps less than that; but, in the aggregate, members' fares must amount to a considerable sum in the year.",77

763,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIA,"It is rather unfortunate that we have to discuss so impoi$ant a matter as the Darwin Freezing Works at this hour of the night, but a great principle is involved. It would have been much better to discuss the matter at a time when the Minister of External A f fairs could give us a reply.",77
764,Sir JOHN FORREST,AUSTRALIA,"There was an portunity last week. M.r. THOMAS - It is not by any in tention or desire that the question is being discussed at this time of night. The Minister of External Affairs will bear me - out when I say that at 4 or 5 o'clock this afternoon, I told him that I desired to say a few words on the subject.",77
765,Sir JOHN FORREST,AUSTRALIA,Why these excuses?,77
766,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIA,"There are no excuses; at any rate, I have a right to discuss these matters if an opportunity is not to be given to me to discuss them tomorrow. I understand that the Minister .of External Affairs does not intend to give any explanation, and even if he were to do so, it would not be of so much advantage as if the House were full . However, I shall leave, that subject and refer to a Home Affairs matter, in regard to which the answers I have received to questions have not been of a satisfactory character. When the Address-in-Reply was under discussion, the honourable member for Bourke made reference to the payment, on 26th A p r i l last, by Mr Brookes, of are very Â£500 to the honourable member for Perth. The honourable' member for Perth explained in this House that the Â£500 had not been sent to him by Mr Brookes personally, but to pass on to the Liberal organization in Western Australia. I can* raise no objection to any organization utilizing some of their funds for political purposes, but section 172A of the Electoral A ct provides that if any person, trade union, registered or unregistered league, or association devotes money for political purposes, be or it sball send a return to the Chief Electoral Officer within a certain time showing how the money was spent. That is the law. Whether it is good, bad, or indifferent is not for us now to question. The present Government, when introducing their Amending Electoral Bill , made no provision for the repeal of that section, and I shows the take it that they are in favour of it . Seeing that it is part of the Electoral Act , those administering the Act should see that it is carried out. On 5th September I asked whether the Minister of Home Affairs would see that the section was complied with. The Prime Minister replied, "" I am very anxious that I should not add to my reputation by acting as a detective."" I had no desire that he should do so. All I wanted was that the op- Act should be made effective. On the 10th September I asked whether Mr . Brookes nad complied with the section. The Assistant Minister replied, "" I am not aware whether Mr Brookes has expended any money or incurred any expense which requires a return under the provisions of section 172A."" On 12th September, on the adjournment of the make all House, I asked whether action would not be taken by the Electoral Officer to see that Mr Brookes complied with the Act . On the same occasion, the honourable member for Maribyrnong quoted from a newspaper a report of a statement by Mr . Herbert Brookes, at a meeting attended by the Vice-President of the Executive Council, that, on three occasions during the last week, it was stated in the House of Representatives that he had been responsible for passing a certain sum of money to a member in another State. wished to state that this was absolutely true. He was proud of it, and hoped to be able to do it again. The Prime Minister, in reply, said he was amazed at the moderation of the amount, as we, as a party, had been referring to Â£50,000 ing been given here and there for political purposes to the Liberal party, and that, apparently, the amount had come down to about Â£500. He could not understand the bother there was over this paltry 'sum. I confessed at the time. I thought this rather a peculiar reply. the amount was, we simply asked that the Act might be complied with. Prime Minister's reply was that he did not think Ehe Act demanded statement for which I was asking. penalty for failure to comply with section 172A was a fine of not less than Â£100 and not more than Â£500, or imprisonment for any period not exceeding six months. On 18th September I asked again if Mr. Brookes had complied with the section, and the Prime Minister said, ""No; the period within, which returns are required to be lodged has not yet expired."" 17th October, I asked whether Brookes had yet complied with the section, and, if not, what was the latest date on which such a statement should be in the hands of the Chief Electoral Officer. The Prime Minister's "" I am unable to answer this tion in its present form, as I am not aware that Mr. Brookes has taken any action requires him to lodge a return under section 172A of the Electoral When money is sent to any organization - Labour, Liberal, National, or any other-for political purposes, the Chief Electoral Officer should be notified of the manner in which it is spent. This Government claims to be a pure Government, administering fairly, without favour to any, and it is therefore strange that no attempt is being made to ascertain how this Â£500 was spent. Mr Herbert Brookes stated at a public meeting, at which the Vice-President of the Executive Council was present, that he had forwarded the money, add the honourable member for Perth has acknowledged that he received it, and handed it Over to the Liberal I do hot question those statements, nor do I suggest that in receiving the money the honourable member for Perth did anylir. Thomas. He thing wrong. If any one sent me money for a Labour organization, I sbould not hesitate to receive it , and to forward it . But the electoral law should be complied with, and those who spend money on elections should let the public know how bav- it is spent. I have no objection to trusts, combines, unions, or individuals giving money for political purposes. An y one holding political views has an unquestioned right to spend money to give effect to them. But Parliament has rightly required that the Chief Electoral Officer Whatever shall be informed how such money is spent. The Prime Minister, when I reThe ferred to this matter, said, "" You are kicking up a row now about a paltry the Â£500, when you used to talk about The Â£ 5 0 , 0 0 0 . "" There is no doubt that this Â£500 was sent to Western Australia, but it does not follow that it is the only amount that was contributed to the Liberal funds. I ask the Minister of Home Affairs whether it is the intention of the Government to see that section 172A of the Electoral Act is complied with ?

767,Mr FOWLER,AUSTRALIA,"I wish to correct one Herbert misapprehension under which the honorwhich able member seems-to labour. He mentioned that I had sent a receipt for the Act."" money to Mr Herbert Brookes, but the receipt was sent by Mr David Forrest, Conservative, then treasurer of the Liberal League. I think, too, that the honourable member on one occasion made some reference to my bank account; but the money reached me one day when I was in the League's the law office, being addressed to me, "" care of the Liberal League,"" and I took it out of the envelope, and handed it across the table to the secretary, having no more to do with the matter.",78
768,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIA,I quite accept the honourable member's statement.,78

773,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIA,"Barrier) [1.21 a.m.] Now that the Treasurer is in a very happy mood because he has got his Supply put through' in one night, I want to make' a small request, and that is that two typists shall be allotted for the M in isterial room, and two for the Opposition room, to help honourable members with their correspondence. As members of Parliament, we spend a lot of time in the mechanical work of writing. If we could have the assistance of two typists in each room it would not only help us, but convenience our constituents when they receive the letters.'

776,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIA,"It would not cost very much to provide this convenience for honourable members during the sittings, of the House.
