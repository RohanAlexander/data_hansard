The Acting Clerk-Petition s have been lodged six for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate Ministers: Broadcasting and Television Programs To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House very of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned showeth: That because television and radio: (a) affect our social and moral environment, (b) are family media watched and heard by many children at all times, and (c) present too much explicit violence and sex, they therefore need stronger control than other media and the existing standards need stricter enforcement in both national ABC, and commercial sectors. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray: That the Australian Government will amend the Broadcasting and Television Act, in relation to both national and commercial broadcasters, to legislate (a) for adequate and comprehensive programs in the best interests of the general public, (b) for a 'Dual System of Regulation' enforced by the Australian Broadcasting Tnbunal by internal regulation and external control, (c) for an independent consumer body torepresentthe best interests of the general public, and (d) for immediate and effective penalties to be imposed for breaches of program and advertising standards. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Sinclair, Mr Dobie, Mr Graham and Mr MCLeay. Petitions received. Private Nursing Homes: Pensioner Patients To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That many pensioners who are holders of the pensioners health benefit card, have suffered undue hardship as inmates of private nursing homes, because the Federal Government subsidy was insufficient to meet the charges as laid down. Many pensioners whose spouse was an inmate of the vate nursing homes suffered poverty in an endeavour tain their panner while in the nursing home. Only in rare cases was the statutory minimum patient tribution as laid down adhered to. That the telephone was a matter of life and death to many Albury-Wodonga pensioners, but because of the cost phone many are unable to afford the installation. That those pensioners who have only their pension and very litde else to live on and are forced to pay high rents, are in many cases living in extreme poverty. The foregoing facts impel your petitioners to ask the Australian Government as a matter of urgency to1. Make sure that subsidies paid to private nursing homes are such that each pensioner holding a pensioners health benefit card will pay the private nursing home no more than PETITIONS the statutoiy minimum patient contribution, which will allow dollars per week to beretainedby the pensioner patient for their personal use. 2. That a pensioner holding a pensioner health benefit card shall have a telephone installed free of charge, or at a very nominal charge. 3. That those pensioners who have only their pension and little else to live on, shall receive a subsidy to assist them. The subsidy to be governed by a Means Test. citizens of Austraha respectfully And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Sinclair, Mr MACKenzie, Mr Les MCMahon and Mr Ian Robinson.

Excursion Air Fares to Europe To the Right Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the cost of airfares between Australia and Scandinavian countries is excessive when compared to the fares charged to other points in Europe. We express a desire for negotiations between the Commonwealth Government and the governments of the Scandinavian countries to negotiate an excursion fare for all g >ints in Europe at a level reat Britain and more that twenty other major dues in Europe. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Jull. Petition received. To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House ofRepresentatives in Parliament assembled. The petition the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth. Objection to the metric system and request the Government to restore the imperial system. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Newman. Petition received. To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully show that: Abortion has become a multi-million dollar enterprise in Australia despite the fact that the Medical Practice Clarification Bill 1973 was overwhelmingly rejected. The multi-national giant, Population Services International, which operates in Sydney is now expending its business to include Canberra. In 1976 alone, over 46,000 abortions were being paid for under the existing medical benefits schedule, which stipulates the benefit payable for medical services under both Medibank and the private health insurance funds. Item No. 6469-(the evacuation vid uterus by curettage and benefit of $65. In 1976 close to $5m were spent to destroy unborn children. Under the 'Abortion Item' No. 6469 abortion on demand is now being paid for from pubUc monies, i.e. contributions to the existing health funds. Your petitioner therefore humbly pray that the Government takes action: (1) To stop payments of abortion claims under Item no. 6469 of the Medical case that the abortion had been carried out tal, and it being a certified medical procedure of preventing the death of the mother. (2) To stop the funding and operation of any so called pregnancy help service or health centre which offers abortion on demand. (3) To financially assist those pregnancy help services which provide a genuine suppon to both mothers and their unborn children, e.g. Birthline-Adelaide. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray,  Petition received. Tertiary Education Assistance To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament Assembled. The petition of the undersigned students, parents, teachers and citizens of Australia respectfuUy showeth: That the decision of the Government to withdraw all that is currently being charged to forms offinancialassistance to students of non-State ternary institutions in the main, business colleges, is in total conflict with stated Government education policy. The decision will result in a shortage of places for training secretarial and clerical students and an inordinate demand upon the State government technical education systems. At a time of severe economic disruption, this action must lead to an unnecessary worsening of the current employment Metric System situation for school leavers. Your petitioners, therefore, humbly pray that the Comof monwealth Government will act immediately to reverse its decision. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Uren.

Is he aware that the Australian subsidiaries are being instructed by their parent companies to transfer these funds out of Australia because of their lack Benefits Schedule, except in the in a hospiof confidence in the Australian doUar? When will this Government put a stop to these private outflows of speculative capital?",15
4,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,CAPITAL OUTFLOW,The honourable gendeman continues in the path of deUberately trying to create more speculation and concern. I certainly am not going to aid him in that process. NA INDUSTRY: DEFENCE CAPABILITY,15
5,Mr ALDRED,AUSTRALIAN MANUFACTURING,"The Minister for Productivity will no doubt be aware of a recent report to Defence Minister detailing the grossly inadof equate capabiUty of Australian manufacturing mdustry for defence production. ter inform the House of what steps are being taken to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of manufacturing industry to overcome this equate capabUity, including measures taken respect of the Government factories that form significant part of the responsibilities ofhis porthas foUo? In panicular, what is being done to better the operation of the Government Aircraft Facimprovement tory to improve the way in which marketed, and to achieve the best possible use of the Government Aircraft Factory within the context of a rationalisation of the aircraft industry?",16
6,Mr MACPHEE,AUSTRALIAN MANUFACTURING,"The honourable member that has referred to the report to my colleague, Minister for Defence. Of course, I certainly not make a specific comment upon that report. However, I would say that all industrialised countries are experiencing gaps in their techweakness nology-gap s which are due to the rapid rate of growth in technology and also the high cost which is associated with it and the installation the capabilities that go with it. Of course, if Australia considers its small economies of scale, it is realised that we have a serious problem indeed. So our policy within the government tories has been to provide a basic capabiUty that we can adopt and adapt new technology when the need arises. The honourable member asks about productivity initiatives. We have installed within the factories numerically controlled machine tools. We have begun project management programs. We have improved plant and work place design and communication within the plants, and we have given great tion to industrial safety programs. Within the Government Aircraft Factories, have adopted all of those policies. In addition, we have engaged outside consultants to ensure that those factories are able to compete with vate enterprise. We have adopted marketing programs, especially in respect of the Nomad aircraft. We have done a lot of work for the Boethat ing Corporation under the offset program, and that has helped the Government Aircraft Factornight ies to tender competitively with private enterprise. There is, I believe, evident in the lic comment upon the report to my colleague general wUlingness to criticise Australian technology. I think Australians ought to remind themselves that we have within the Government Aircraft Factories produced the Ikara, the Jindivik, the Nomad, and InterScan, the microwave landing system. All of these projects have the received world acclaim. They are allfinepieces technology which have brought spin-offs for private industry in Australia as well as employCan the Minisment opportunities. Shortly after taking up my position as Minister for Productivity, I appointed as Chairman of the inadProduction Board which supervises the 12 in Government factories, Mr Robert MUlar, a a highly respected Melbourne industrialist who great experience in the private sector. He has made a considerable contribution towards the of productivity within the Governits products are ment factories. NA",16
7,Mr STEWART,FOREIGN EXCHANGE RESERVES,"Is the Prime Minister aware Australia's foreign exchange reserves fell by the $209m in the first two weeks in September and canthat that sUde in our reserves has persisted unbroken for the past 17 weeks? Is it a fact that this decUne cannot be accounted for alone by a in the current account and that it must therefore contain a large speculative element? If so, what steps have been taken or are to be taken of to curb this speculation against the dollar?",16
8,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,FOREIGN EXCHANGE RESERVES,"The answer to the first part of the honourable gentleman's quesuon is yes. The second part of the question facshould be directed to many members of the so honourable member's own party, since there is a deUberate attempt by some members of that party to promote that very speculation. NA",16
9,Mr BUNGEY,NUCLEAR WASTE DISPOSAL,"Can the Prime Minister inform the House whether the International Atomic Energy Agency has expressed a view on attenthe safe disposal of nuclear waste? Mr MALCOL M FRASER-The Interwe national Atomic Energy Agency has expressed a view on that matter. I would Uke to come to that fairly shortly because the view that the Interprinational Atomic Energy Agency has expressed is not dissimilar to the position which has been taken by the Government. I am very glad that is the position. There was a most important statement by the Leader of the Opposition last which seemed to indicate that the Government and the Opposition have the elements of a pubbipartisan policy in relation to these matters. I a believe that the statement made by the Leader of the Opposition was significant nificant extent, responsible, which is not always the case. So that the nature of the pohcy impUcamonitor tions for Australia can be understood it will be Party necessary for me to read some parts of the questions and answers in the interview with the Leader of the Opposition. The question was asked: Do you think it is proper for your Party to say it will to honour any new uranium agreements? This was somewastes thing you were quite a stickler government. A significant part of the answer to that question was: We have made it very plain that we do not think priate, we don't think it responsible uranium go on the world market safe methods of storing or disposing of the nuclear There are not at the moment. The Leader of the Opposition went on to say he had made it plam that his party would not honour contracts which are in breach ition. Then there was a further question: But you also said it wasn't just the waste disposal problem in your speech to the nation, you also were quite specific there would have to be adequate safeguards in terms of proliferation. The answer was: Yes, that's true, but the big problem, I believe, now, is storage and disposal of the nuclear waste- I think that unresolved issue. That answer itself needs noting. I believe it indicates that the question of proliferation, and safeguards in relation to it, are resolved. The interviewer went on to say that it was one thing to be in opposition and another to be in government. The answer was: Yes, I suppose you could say that, but I still say responsible to allow this substance to go on the world when there are no safe ways of disposing of the waste. There was a further question: Well, in terms of the ALP policy, what would be anism and who would make the decision that the safeguards had been developed, that the technology had achieved that breakthrough? Obviously that is in relation to the question waste. The answer was: The International Atomic Energy Agency. The next question was: And you would accept . . . And the reply was: Yes, certainly. And our efforts, get international safeguards the IAEA. Of course, that is just what it is doing. I shaU read one final question and answer. And would you expect the bulk of the Party, say at conference or the conference after to accept . . . and, to a sigThe reply was: If the IAEA said that there were adequate safeguards to the storage and the disposal of the waste, the radioactive waste, from nuclear power generation. Of course the would accept it. At the Salzburg conference Dr Eklund, the Director-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency had this to say: refuse National programs for the management of radioactive are all investigating the possibilities of vitrifying the on when you were in Uquid",16

Do the restrictions you have asked Ministers to apply to the length of their answers it approapply to the Prime Minister or has he some to let Australian special right? until there, are in operation waste Mr SPEAKER-It is the practice of the House to give an extension of courtesy to the Prime that Minister and the Leader of the Opposition.",17

This is the critical sentenceTechnology is now available for the safe treatment, conthe ditioning and storage of essentially aU the hazardous radiois the active waste products from the nuclear fuel cycle. Mr E. C. Whitlam-They are nowhere in operation, as Dr Eklund told me in Vienna last June.",17
12,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,NUCLEAR WASTE DISPOSAL,"Today the advice of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission was sought on whether the view of the International Atomic Energy Agency expressed at that it is irSalzburg had in any sense been varied. I know market that the honourable gentleman visited there in June after the Salzburg conference. I hope the breakthrough in his thinking in this matter was the mechnot just a momentary one last night. In the past he had indicated that safe methods and techniques for the storage and disposal of waste were not avaUable. Quite plainly, the International of Atomic Energy Agency has said that they are known. Mr E. G. Whitlam-And Eklund says that they are not in operation.",17

14,Mr SPEAKER,NUCLEAR WASTE DISPOSAL,Order! I ask the Leader of the Opposition to cease interjecting consistently. It the next does not help the decorum of the Parliament at all. Mr E. G. Whitlam- I am wanting the truth.,17
15,Mr SPEAKER,NUCLEAR WASTE DISPOSAL,Order! The honourable gendeman has been here long enough to know his duties as Leader of the Opposition and that he should not disturb the proceedings of the Parliament. He knows that interjections are out of order. He has repeated the same interjection five times and I am quite sure that even he will concede that aU the honourable members have enough intelUgence to know what he means.,18
16,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,NUCLEAR WASTE DISPOSAL,"Of course, the Leader of the Opposition is sensitive on this matWhat ter because in a statement made a short ago he indicated that there were some problems in relation to nuclear proliferation and that the safeguards there might not be adequate, but last night the ground seemed very much to be ponsible shifted. The particular sentence indicated that the problem now was one of the treating, storage fiction. and disposal of wasteMr Martin- Mr Speaker, I raise a pomt of order.",18

18,Mr SPEAKER,NUCLEAR WASTE DISPOSAL,"Order! The right honourable f entleman will resume his seat. A point of order as been raised. Mr Martin-My point of order is to do with the length of the reply. I am certain that the position would give the Prime Minister an opportunity to make a statement on this issue, so desires, instead of taking up Question Time.",18
19,Mr SPEAKER,NUCLEAR WASTE DISPOSAL,There is no substance in the this point of order.,18
20,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,NUCLEAR WASTE DISPOSAL,Answers often appUed would be much shorter if members of the Oppowould sition did not take points of order when they have a perfect knowledge that there is no point of order under the Standing Orders and when five they merely want to interrupt in order to have some interjection recorded.,18
21,Mr SPEAKER,NUCLEAR WASTE DISPOSAL,"Order! The right honourable gentleman will not make any comments on the explain points of order. I wtil deal with them as they arise. Mr E. G. Whitlam-Yes , you pull him up after he has offended.",18
22,Mr SPEAKER,NUCLEAR WASTE DISPOSAL,Order! The honourable future gendeman will remain stient.,18
23,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,NUCLEAR WASTE DISPOSAL,"Let me repeat Dr If Eklund's statement: Technology is now available for the safe treatment, conditioning and storage of essentially all the hazardous radioactive waste products from the nuclear fuel cycle. If the honourable gendeman cannot understand that, let me repeat it again. It is a very clear and concise statement. Dr Eklund said: Technology is now available for the safe treatment, conditioning and storage of essentially all the hazardous radioactive waste products from the nuclear fuel cycle. Then he went on to point out what has been known for a very long whtie: is now required is the practical demonstration of whtie large scale geological disposal. The knowledge exists. The future course that countries will take in this matter is as certain as it can be. In these circumstances it is utterly irresfor the Opposition to persist with its present policy to maintain a fiction-and it is a FARM INCOMES: EFFECT OF NA",18
24,Mr FITZPATRICK,INCREASED FUEL PRICES,"I preface my question to Minister for Primary Industry by referring to a the forecast by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics of a 14 per cent drop in real net farm income made before the Budget's 11c a gallon increase in fuel prices which, according to the Director of the Cattlemen's Union, will add $1,000 or more to each beef producer's costs. By how much more than 14 per cent will net farm Opincome fall when the fuel price hike is included? if he Mr SINCLAIR-I am deUghted that the honourable member for Darling has asked me question. It gives me a chance to explain to him and to the other members of the Australian Labor Party the consequences of Labor poUcies over three years. Australia progressively have been so dependent on imported fuels that we would have been forced into a position of total import parity within the course of the next years if it had not been for a change of policy by this Government. If we had not been forced into a position of total import parity we would have been getting very close to it. For the honourable gentleman's benefit I would Uke to that the reason for the crude oU price policy change was to ensure that we would encourage greater exploration, development and exploitation of Australia's crude oU resources. Indeed it might well be that through the utilisation of other energy sources we can contain cost increases not just to the rural community but to the whole Australian community. we had not adopted a policy designed to encourage the utilisation of energy resources in Australia we would have been in a hopeless ition which, of course, was the full intention the Labor Administration as a result of the pohafter cies it pursued in every direction. It is true there will be a temporary increase in the price input generally for people in the rural sector. Mr Morris-What do you mean by a 'temporin ary input'?",18
25,Mr SINCLAIR,INCREASED FUEL PRICES,"It is also true that that same cost increase will apply to people throughout Australia. The Government hopes that by the couragement of exploration and exploitation Australian crude oil resources we might be able to provide more crude oil in Austraha. Even the honourable gentleman who has interjected might be able to establish in his arithmetical mind that if we canfindmore crude oil Austraha we are less Ukely to be dependent upon mistaken. imports, and as a result we are less likely to be in a position of having to pay prices that others would impose upon us. There is a problem for people in country areas as a result of increased oU prices, but we believe it is more important apply a policy of encouragement of the developachieve ment ofthose resources. I might add that it will put Australians in the private same position relatively as the producers and through radical consumers of crude oil in a country such as reforms which were Canada. I am delighted to note that for Transport and the Minister responsible for of the resources coming toathe the Wheat Board in Canada is in the Gallery of this Parliament at the moment.

26,Dr EDWARDS,PUBLIC SERVICE STAFF CEILINGS,"I address my question to the Prime Minister. I refer to the success of the Government in sharply reducing the deficit in two successive Budgets and to the reductions in Public Service staff cetiings currently in force bring back Public Service numbers to reaUstic levels. In view of indications that inflation been further reduced, will the Government need to make further across-the-board restraints government expenditure and reductions lic Service staff ceilings to maintain the fight against inflation? pos Mr MALCOLM FRASER-The position that of the Government has reached has been achieved two years of particularly vigUant work on the part of the Treasurer to get Australia, as I said over the weekend, onto a responsible fiscal base. That should be taken as a mark of success what the Government has done in mamtaining restraint in expenditure and indicating that one significant part of bringing reaUty back into government in Australia has had a large measure of success. That does not mean, as I am sure no enhonourable member would suggest it does, that of there is to be any lessening of tension on the reins. There will not be. If any Ministers think it will be any easier to get funds for specific purposes in addition to those funds which governments have already provided, I think they would in probablyfindthat they would be very much It ought to be noted that before the election it was stated very clearly that our purpose would be to bring reality back into government expento diture and mto thefinancesof Australia, and to a transfer of resources from direct Government spending on its own account to the cessions sector. Through successive taxation conto industry, through tax indexation, and far-reaching personal tax introduced m this Budget, the Minister there has ofcourse been significant dintinution Government comvisitors' pared to what would have been case under established in There these In matters, but the general thrust of government policy, of course, will be maintained and there is no slackening at aU in that for one moment. is one point I ought to make, Mr Speaker, because, specifically, there was one report the was incorrect. That report indiPubUc Service staff ceilings which were announced in the Budget were not to be appUed. I am sorry to disappoint some people; those reductions are to be appUed and there wtil be continuing vigUance in this area also. NA Mr E . G. Whitlam-My question, to addressed to the Prime Minister, foUows those asked of him by my Deputy and by the honourhas able member for Lang. Is the Prime Minister aware that where companies or individuals have in been unaccountably withdrawing funds from in PubCanada, the Canadian Government has published the names of the companies and persons concerned and the amounts that they have transferred? Since there seem to be no laws imposing confidentiality on the disclosure such information in Austraha, I ask whether the Australia. Government has considered publishing the names of companies and persons that have been transferring funds out of Australia in a similar fashion and publishing the amounts so transferred?",19
27,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,CAPITAL OUTFLOW,That is an Government interesting suggestion by the Leader of the Opposition. NA NA Mr THOMSONThe Minister for Post and difficult Telecommunications will be aware that as a result of his visit to my electorate in March this year the Australian Telecommunications ComAt mission has been investigating the connection outpost radios to the telephone service through base stations of the Royal Flying Doctor Service. Can the Minister advise the progress of these investigations? Can he say why such a relatively simple investigation has taken so long to complete?,20
28,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,QUEENSLAND,"I well remember being in the honourable member's electorate that earUer this year and going with him to communications system at the Royal Flying Doctor Service base. There is no doubt could get an interface between that outpost vice and the Telecommunications Commission would assist immensely in communications in the outback part of his electorate. It is this Government's poticy, as distinct from that of predecessors, to be concerned about providing increased faciUties for communication services all parts of Australia.",20
29,Mr BRYANT,QUEENSLAND,You closed down radio stations.,20
30,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,QUEENSLAND,"The Government of referendum which the honourable member for WUls was member had an abysmal record in regard to rural industries and communications. It did everything to prejudice improvement in those areas. As to the particular matter about which the honourable member for Leichhardt inquired, this has gone on too long. I have had discussions with members and management of the Telecomissues munications Commission. The Commission did meet in Brisbane, I think it was last week, wtil be having further discussions with officials the Royal Flying Doctor Service. I have asked the Commission for a full report covering its tude and competence to arrange this matter within the next two weeks. Like the honourable member for Leichhardt, I am determined that communications systems are improved in his of electorate and anywhere else throughout NA",20
31,Mr JAMES,TAX INDEXATION,I direct my question to the Prime Minister. Does he share the concern of the honourable member for Tangney that the has fatied to honour its election promises and that tax indexation in the Budget did not go far enough? Does he intend to emulate the example of the honourable member and retire at the next general election?,20
32,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,TAX INDEXATION,"I wouldfindit to understand how tax indexation could go further than to cover taxpayers fully for the effects of inflation, which is precisely what it did. the same time. I thank the honourable gentleof man for the opportunity to state again that the tax reforms announced in the Budget by the Treasurer are probably the most far reaching and fundamental taxation reforms that have been introduced in any Western country, and they wtil be of great advantage to this country and to all taxpayers in Australia. The more often that the honourable gendeman asks questions enable those points to be made in answer, look at the the better I will be pleased. that ifwe MINING AND EXPORT OF URANIUM ser Mr HODGES-Is the Minister for National it Resources and Minister for Overseas Trade aware of continuing claims that there should be a referendum in Australia as a means of settling our the dispute over the mining and sale of Australian uranium for peaceful purposes? Does the in Government have a view on the referendum proposals?",20
33,Mr ANTHONY,TAX INDEXATION,"There are two aspects at which one should look when exarnining the issue: Firstly, the suggestion of a a referendum has been put forward by the Australian Council of Trade Unions, in a threatening and chaUenging way, to a government exercising its right to make a decision on a very important issue. The Government has no intention of bowing to the ultimatum of the ACTU. It beUeves that it has a responsibUity to investigate the thoroughly, to source all the information it can and then to make a decision-and this it has and it done. Secondly, although a referendum may of sound to some people an easy or ideal way to resolve the question, it oversimptifies the matter. attiIn fact, it is frighteningly simplistic.",20
34,Mr HURFORD,TAX INDEXATION,Margare t Thatcher thinks it is a to see good idea to have a referendum.,20
35,Mr ANTHONY,TAX INDEXATION,"The honourable member may think the same, but the leader of his party does not think so. I would Uke to know what is the thinking of the Australian Labor Party on this matter. I think the Leader of the Opposition is fully aware of the complexities which have to be taken into account when assessing whether we should mine and export uranium. Some of the complexities one must take into consideration are: Our contractual commitments-obUgation s which were entered into prior to 1972, which the Whitlam Government said would be honoured and which we said would be honoured; our commitment to the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty; the handUng of waste material; the further proliferation of nuclear material around the world; the codes of mining and the safety of people involved in the milling of uranium; the environment; national parks; and Aboriginals. AU these are extremely complex questions and must be looked at to get a total picture. That what the Government has done. In the second Ranger report the commissioners pointed out that the question of proUferation-the most, important question of all-involve d aspects of international relations including trade, diplomatic and defence considerations. They said that a decision as to the correct strategy on proliferation had to be made by those equipped to make it. The commissioners themselves refrained from making any recommendation because of the complexity of the matter. If the commissioners could not make a decision on it, I think it is asking a lot for the Government to leave it to the Australian public to make a decision. Apart from the matters I have mentioned, there is the question of supplying the energy needs of countries around the world which desperately need uranium and are looking to Australia to supply it. There are trade implications, and Australia's reputation is immense in this field. There is also the question of the reuse of energy resources. As oil reserves start to diminish, countries are being put in a threatening position in terms of how their future requirements will be met. All these are matters which a responsible government must look. We have looked at them. We have determined a decision and we will defend that decision to the end. NA Mr E. G. Whitlam-I ask the Foreign Minject ister a question. He wtil remember that on 24 sition May last at question time he said that the Government would be giving serious considerport ation to implementing the resolution which was then before the United Nations Security Council concerning the closure of what are called Rhodesian Information Offices. He will remember that our permanent representative at the United Nations wrote to the Secretary General in June, after the resolution had been passed by the Security Council, assuring him that the necessary legislation would be introduced in the next session of the Parliament in August. Since the General Assembly is now convening, I ask the honourable gentleman when he expects that he will be able to introduce this legislation. I also take the opportunity to ask him what has happened to the report by various departments that Australia could absorb up to 10,000 Rhodesians over a period of 12 months and the submission, which I believe has been made to him by a group in Western Australia, that Australia should accept 100,000 Rhodesians for settlement in Western Australia. I therefore ask is him: Would such a proposal be in conflict with the reiterated resolutions of the Security Council?  ters alluded to by the Leader of the Opposition at the commencement of his question. As he and honourable members are aware, sanctions voted by the Security Council are binding on all members of the United Nations. The Government therefore, along the Unes I indicated towards the end of the last parhamentary session, has been preparing draft legislation for introduction, if possible, during this session of Parliament. The timing will be a matter for the Leader of the House to determine in connection with other legislative requirements. It is not for me to answer when, in fact, the Bill will be introduced. What is absolutely critical in the mind of the Government is that such legislation has to be drafted so that it does not, in any way, infringe on the Uberty of individual Australians freely to express their opinions with respect to Rhodesia. That is not the aim of the legislation at all. That absolute freedom must be guaranteed. I do not see the situation as one of rushing this legislation through at the present moment. The answer as to at the actual program rests with the Leader of the House, a fundamental matter being the nature of the legislation itself. As far as any resettlement of Rhodesians is concerned, I am of course aware that a report appeared in a weekend newspaper, aUegedly quoting from a brief prepared for me, on the subof resettlement. As the Leader of the Oppoknows it is not the practice, at least of this Government, to comment on reports which purto represent the unauthorised release of mformation. However, I feel bound to point out that the whole purpose of the Government's policy towards Rhodesia to date has been to support Western diplomatic efforts to bring about a peaceful setdement in that countiy, incorporating both majority rule and the protection of human rights for the entire population of Rhodesia. The Government hopes that a peaceful settlement in Rhodesia may yet be achieved. In regard to the question of resettlement, my colleague the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs is not proposing at this stage to alter any migrant entry pohcy in respect of its apphcation to Rhodesians. This situation is set out in the reply which my colleague gave on 19 April of this year, I think, to a question on notice by the honourable member for Bowman. Consideration of any future action will depend on the nature of developments. In regard to the question of resettlement, I refer the Leader of the Opposition to my colleague's answer. NA NA",21
36,Mr NEIL,ORGANISATION,"I direct a question to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. What is the Government's attitude to the proposed United States withdrawal from the International Labour Organisation?  correct in drawing attention to the considerable speculation in the media and elsewhere that the United States may decide to withdraw from the International Labour Organisation. Australia values highly the work performed by the International Labour Organisation in the labor field and in the promotion of social justice generally. We see the Organisation, with ture comprising goverament, employees and workers, as fulfilling a unique and a valuable role in world affairs; but that does not deny the pressures imposed on the United States by its membership of the ILO or the problems facing the ILO at present. However our view is that these problems should be solved by negotiation and dialogue, and that withdrawal by the United States at a critical stage would be not only detrimental to the future of the ILO but could have serious repercussions for other multilateral bodies. Accordingly, whtist the decision is naturally one for the United States to take, we together with some other of its friends-w e have not been alone in this matter-hav e been active in drawing to the attention of the United States Government our strong hope that it will remain in the ILO. I have spoken recently to the United States Ambassador and have reiterated to him Austraha's concern at the situation. I spoke on behalf of the Australian Government, after having talked with my colleague the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations; on behalf of all Australian States, for aU labour Ministers had met on this question and had indicated a common view; on behalf of Australian workers, a viewpoint having been expressed by the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions on this matter indicating concern; and on behalf  on behalf of the labour Ministers of the respective States, of workers, employers and on our behalf I put the viewpoint that we would hope that the United States, in its reconsideration of the matter, would determine to remain a member of the ILO. NURSING HMS: PENSIONER NA",22
37,Mr ARMITAGE,PATIENTS,"Is the Minister for Health aware of reports that the Federal Government and private health funds are endeavouring to encourage private nursing home patients to join private health funds? Would he agree that pensioner patients in such nursing homes would not only have nothing to gain by joining a private fund but would actually lose because they would have to pay the necessary contributions to those funds? As there is so much confusion on this matter, particularly among pensioner patients in nursing homes, will he take action to repudiate reports that the Government is trying to encourage nursing home patients, particularly pensioners, to join public funds? WUl he give pubUcity to the fact that it would be a disadvantage to pensioner patients in such homes if they joined its tripartite struc- those funds?",22
38,Mr HUNT,PATIENTS,"Once agam it'is a question of choice. If pensioner patients want to insure themselves for doctor of choice they can do so by taking out a subsidised hospital only insurance which wtil cover them for a choice of doctor in a hospital or for nursing home benefits. It is a question of choice for the nursing home patients. I am not aware of any great confusion amongst nursing home patients at this point. I was aware of a great deal of confusion amongst nursing home patients during the winter recess because of a campaign that was launched by some private health funds which were trying to make a case that the Government would abandon subsidies to private nursing homes and nursing home patients. That was not true. During the winter recess I announced that the Government would provide higher benefits for nursing home patients and that the health insurance funds would be responsible for paying the benefits to those patients who were insured privately hospital only insurance. Those patients who are not insured will receive automatically the same higher benefits from the Department of Health. There is no occasion for private nursing home patients to insure in order to obtain their benefits. Let that be quite clear. If they wish to insure themselves for doctor of choice and treatment of medical conditions, they have therightto do so and the insurance fund will pay the benefit, the Commonwealth Government. NA",22

I have considered the situation in those areas and in the electorate of KalgoorUe, which I think was menman tioned also. There is a problem in virtuaUy every State in Australia. In the present Budget we have been able to obtain an allocation of funds, and work to provide increased facUities will comfingerprints mence in a number of electorates. I have to out that not only is there a restraint upon the amount of money avaUable but also a limit to engineering capacity of the Postal Department, the Austrahan Telecommunications Commission and others. Within the next two to three weeks I shall taking to the Government a suggested three-year program, which wtil give all electorates a good indication of the sort of program that we envisage. I recognise that just means would not solve all the problems. The enormous cost of extending television services throughout Australia by traditional means incorporation would, of course, be prohibitive. That is why with the use of technology and other initiatives can see greater opportunities in the years ahead. I hope that the honourable member is aware I am currently considering one or two initiatives. I am certain that before too long, I will be able make a statement to the Parliament which will give even greater encouragement to people and help them to understand that this Government committed to improving communication, in whatever medium, throughout the Australian community. NA or with Mr E. G. Whitlam-I ask the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs: Is it a fact that actual expenditure on Aboriginal assistance programs has decreased by 22 per cent since the 1975 Budget, contrary to undertakings given by the former Attorney-General? If that percentage is not correct, what in fact has been the percentage reduction smce the 1975 Budget? I ask also: Is it a fact that before Aboriginal organisations can obtain not a portion of the Government's allocations the Auditor-General requires that these organisations be incorporated under a statute? Is Queensland the only State that has refused to incorporate an Aboriginal organisation under a State statute and is the North Queensland Land Council thus unable to secure either incorporation or assistance? Why has this Parliament's Aboriginal CouncUs and Associations Act, which was based on a Bill passed by this House in 1975 and which received assent on 15 do December 1976, not yet been proclaimed? How I much longer will it be before this uniform legisa lation is brought into operation?",23
41,Mr VINER,ASSISTANCE TO ABORIGINES,"I thank the honourable gentlefor his question, which covered a number of matters. If in my answer I omit to refer to any of the matters raised I shall have them checked out and let him have the detaUs. I do not have at my the precise percentage comparisons point between appropriation and expenditure since 1975, but I shall check the figures and let the the honourable gentleman know whether his percentage is accurate. I remind him that I have supplied all honourable members and senators with a set of information papers covering expenditure on Aboriginal Affairs for the period 1974 to 1977 be and allocations for 1977-78.1 venture to suggest that it is the most comprehensive set of figures very ever provided by a Minister for Aboriginal Affairs to the members of this House and of the to use traditional other place. The honourable gentleman referred to the of Aboriginal organisations for the purposes of receiving funds from the CommonI wealth. It is a requirement that organisations be incorporated not only for the purposes of finanthat cial management of Commonwealth moneys but also because of the simple fact, as the Leader of to the Opposition would appreciate, that incorporation provides a means for the Government to receive a vaUd receipt from the organisation rather is than from any particular individual. I do not know whether the North Queensland Land Council has apphed under Queensland legislation to be incorporated either as operative or as a company. There were instances in earUer years of some difficulty being experiwanted enced in some Aboriginal organisations in Queensland registering as a co-operative. So, not a fact that that body has not received funds from the Commonwealth because it is not incorporated. A number of requests have been made to me for assistance to Aboriginal organistowards ations in regard, for example, to the commission established by the Queensland Government to look at future pohcy in Queensland. I have received requests also from other organisations which are interested in putting forward suborganisers missions to that body for the purpose of advising the Queensland Government. I have had to sider each of those applications in order to mine which is the most worthwhUe body to port I have that matter on my plate at the wealth present time and I will be deaUng with it. The honourable gentleman also raised the matter of the proclamation of the Aboriginal CouncUs and Associations Act. I hope to prowealth claim that Act very shortly. A good deal of has had to go into establishing the administrative structure, including the central registry, deputy registries and the Uke, before the Act can proclaimed. That work has almost been also completed. I know that Aboriginal organisations are anxious to have it proclaimed so that they can incorporate under Commonwealth legisthe lation. As I say, I hope that I can bring that very shortly. NA",23

In view of the fact that payments, as distinct from commitments, to companies under the new program have only commenced during the current financial year, it is still too early to provide an appreciation of the effectiveness of the legislation. However, this matter is continually under review and I have already received very useful comon ments from a number of sources, including companies, industry associations, professionals working in the research and development field organisand from associations of such professionals. government which is doing all Since receiving the report now being tabled, my attention has been drawn to a statement in the other place on 7 September 1977 by Senator Jessop on behalf of the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment following that Committee's examination of the Board's 1975-76 annual report. The Committee recommended to me that in future the report should include an assessment of the value of assistance given in relation to the objectives of the Act.

I take this opportunity to mention a matter and which has been causing me some concern recently. Correspondence addressed to me by companies which have applied for grants has revealed a number of cases in which consultants, claiming to have expert knowledge of the grants BOARD legislation, have advised companies badly in relation to grant applications. These clients have led to expect grants much larger than their real entitlements, and in some cases could have out of pocket after paying what appeared to be excessively high consultancy fees. These remarks are not intended to refer to all consultants operating in this field, but I would advise those companies which feel the need to engage consultants to select them with care.

64,Mr YOUNG,AND DEVELOPMENT INCENTIVES,"by leave-We on this side of the House always support enthusito astically anything that is done by the Governance ment in the field of research and development. Time and again in this Parhament we have had to be critical when the Government has seen fit to make across the board cuts in appropriations in this area. It has been our role to point out the Government that, in terms of research and development and in terms of the future consoliWhat dation of many of our industries, the Governdations ment must play an important part in ensuring viabUity of those industries. At the moment what we are doing in Australia is really only scratching the surface. We have derived a great deal of our technology from companies that have come this country from overseas. To that extent, as Jackson Committee pointed out, our industries have advanced a great deal as a result of the activities of those trans-national companies. None the less, overseas companies should not be allowed to set the ceiling on the research and development that may be done or to of technology that may be invested in our industries. That is a decision that this Parliament and this country must make. Our commitment to research and development honourable is a wholesale commitment because we reaUse able the importance of it and its importance tion to the ambitions of a lot of young people who are completing a very high standard of eduThat cation in Australia. Avenues ought to be avaUhonourable able for a lot of these people to work in this When compared with the moneys that are being spent by companies overseas on their research and development programs what we are doing here in Australia looks rather minute. The ter for Productivity (Mr Macphee) made point that some consultants were wrongly advisWUUs) ing companies. Perhaps the Government should look at its own role in terms of caUed consultants before they go out and give information. It is the sort of thing that has hapresulting pened with other legislation, where the Governof ment has made avaUable experts to interpret legislation to the people concerned and thus made sure that when companies are seeking guidance on these matters they are given the correct information. I also draw the Minister's attention to a question on this very subject which was put on notice by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) and to the answer he received from the then Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs on 15 March. The question related to the recommendation-twice-by the Industries Assistance Commission that the question of research and development ought to be referred an inquiry conducted by the Industries AssistCommission itself. WhUst the Minister repUed positively to the questions that the IAC had indeed made such recommendations in its annual reports he merely said that the question of the reference was something for the Minister to for Productivity to look at. That is now 6 months ago, so we ask the Minister these questions: has happened in relation to the recommenof the IAC? What is the intention of the the Government? Does he not think that the IAC has a very important role to play in this area because much of the work it does borders on the necessity for greater detail in research and development in into this country? Whilst pointing out the the inadequacies of what the Government has done over the past two years, we on this side of the House will continue, as I have said, to support enthusiasticaUy anything that is done in this area to assist industry to become more internationally competitive and to perhaps consolidate its role in set the level the Australian economy.

65,Mr WILLIS,PUBLIC SERVICE STAFF CEILINGS,"Recent reports tabled in this House have shown conclusively that this Government's policy of continually reducing staff ceilings is doing enormous damage to government administrauon in country. These reports have confirmed the many previous indications of growing inefficiency the provision of pubhc services because of these arbitrary reductions in the number of govern155,000 ment employees. As a result of this stupid pohcy vast amounts of government moneys are being squandered. There are increasing, and in some cases enormous, delays in the supply of services. There is growing stress, tension and industrial disputation in the Pubhc Service as a result of increased work loads, loss of certain employment rights and staff imbalances, and there is a reducper tion in the quality of services provided. How did all this come about? The original rationaUsation for staff cetiings was in our public. opinion largely ideological. The Government came into office committed to reducing the size Malcolm of the pubUc sector and to buUding up the whole of staff ceUings myth about the pubUc sector, both in terms of the 1976-77. That clearly moneys expended on it and the efforts of those who worked within it. The Government tried to the promote to the Australian people an Public Service which was lazy and fat and in which there was plenty of room for wielding the impede knife. So when it took office it commenced into wield the knife and to start to reduce number of public servants. WhUe doing this the Government said to the people of Australia: 'You see, there is no reduction in services'. fact, of course, as we will see later, there was very substantial reduction in both the level quaUty of services provided because of the very tions severe reductions introduced by this Government. To be fair about the history of staff cetiings, however, I should not try to leave the impression that they were originated by the Fraser ment. In fact, they were first introduced by the Menzies Government in 1951 in quite a severe form. But they were then let lapse and were not ect revived again until the Gorton Government published restored them in 1970. They were continued by the under the MCMahon Government and also by staffreductionscan the Whitlam Government. But except for the that Menzies staff cetiings in 1951 all of these cetiings allowed for growth in the Public Service and the remainder of government employment. The Whitlam Government gradually reduced the allowable growth but it still allowed for growth. Even in 1975 when it had level of staff ceilings it allowed for a growth of per cent in 1975-76. However, the Whitlam Government did not see 1975-76 out. When the Fraser Government came in, within 10 days of being elected the Treasurer (Mr this Lynch) announced that the PubUc Service numbers were to be frozen at the level they were in at the end of November. Then on 9 February 1976 it set a limit for the PubUc Service of or just under to be reached by 30 June 1976. This was later varied up to 159,000 to allow for increased PubUc Service Act coverage. But still the pressure was there for reductions. The result was that on 30 June 1976 the number of full time employees covered by the Public Service Act, after aUowing for variations in coverage by the Act during the year, was decreased by 4.2 cent or a little over 6,000. The Government boasted that all this was being achieved without reduction in services or their quaUty. But this was either self delusion or deUberate deception of the On 14 June 1976 the Prime Minister (Mr Fraser) announced a further lowering by 1.6 per cent for the year was a matter of concern to PubUc Service Board. In its 1975-76 annual image of a report the Board stated: There is, however, a point beyond which restraints may efficient administration and lead to a decline in the fact quality of services provided by the Government. the So there was the Public Service Board in its report for 1975-76 saying in mid 1976 that staff ceilings, if taken too far, would impede governIn ment administration and lead to a reduction in a the quaUty of services provided. Despite this the and Government continued with its further reducin staff ceilings. It also ignored the report of the Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration. This report became avaUable in August 1976. I shall briefly quote from the section of the report deaUng with staff ceUGovernings. At page 242 the report states: Considerable criticism has been directed at staff ceilings as a control device. The Commission initiated aresearchprojon the use of staff ceilings and the results of this work are with our Report. Much of the criticism is endorsed consultant's report which urges that more effective be achieved by longer term planning and such planning is compatible with targets for reductions staff at least on established working units.",28

69,Mr WILLIS,PUBLIC SERVICE STAFF CEILINGS,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. The Royal Commission continued: Such targets could be incorporated in the guidelines issued to departments for the preparation of Forward Estimates. The Commission then recommended 'that staff ceilings in their present form be abandoned and that Cabinet incorporate in their guidelines for the formulation of the Forward Estimates targets for manpower use in the years being covered'. So the opinion of the Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration was quite clear. It recommended the scrapping of staff ceilings and instead the introduction of manpower planning in the Public Service. Tbis was a very sensible recommendation. Of course, the study to which it referred-the one which it commissioned-covered the period not of the Fraser Government but of the Whitlam Government, and it made many severe criticisms of the use of staff ceilings under the Whitlam Government. But they at least allowed for some growth in the Pubhc Service, as I mentioned. The staff ceilings as introduced by the Fraser Government, of course, have not allowed for such growth. They have in fact been reducing the level of the Service. Nevertheless, it is instructive to look at one short criticism by Mr Wiltshire, the consultant referred to, in respect of the severe consequences of staff ceilings. At page 124 of Appendix Volume 1 of the report of the Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration he said: One of the most serious consequences of staff ceilings relates to the actual areas which have been cut back by departments, and the significance of these cutbacks. Tramees and apprentices are the first to suffer and this has tremendous long term ramifications. Typists and stenographers are another area for the first stroke an imbalance in departments, with admirals cleaning the latrines rather than planning strategies and steering the ship. Even more serious is the slackening in attention to control and audit measures in departments to save on numbers. This has led to financial and legal complications, and has serious implications for the accountability of government, not to mention the fact that it allows undeserving rogues to take advantage of weaknesses in the system for their own ends (the rogues being clients of the depanments and not employees). In all these areas the Public Service Board has exhorted departments to maintain a balanced approach to cutbacks and it seems that this was more feasible in years of higher ceilings but extremely difficult in the one per cent growth ceiling of 1974-75. How much more true that is of the period since 1975 when in fact there have been no growth staff ceilings but much reduced staff ceilings. Despite all these warnings-the warnings from the Public Service Board and the warnings from the Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration-the Government pressed ahead with its blind pursuit of reducing the numbers in the public sector. On 17 August 1976 the Treasurer announced in his Budget Speech that the Government had decided to reduce staff ceilings by a further 2 per cent in 1976-77. When that latestfigurewas added to the 1.7 per cent cut announced in June, it made the cut 3.7 per cent in all. The Government also stated its objective of achieving this reducuon as soon as possible and it did so by early in 1976-77. Then in Januray 1977 the PubUc Service Board told the Government that further reductions in staff ceUings for 1976-77 should not be made, so that staffing imbalances could be corrected by appropriate action. It also asked that decisions on staff ceilings for 1977-78 should not be taken until it had received and examined forward staff estimates by departments. But what happened? What happened was that the Government simply ignored that advice, as is utterly clear from the latest report of the PubUc Service Board. On page 3 of its report it said: On 14 January the Treasurer announced that a figure of up to 700 lower than the ceiling determined by the Government would be taken as a new ceiling objective for end June 1977. Actual staffing at 30 June 1977 was 580 below the approved staffing level tor that date. The Treasurer also said tnat the Government would be regarding the actual aggregate staff numbers at 30 June 1977 as the ceiling objective for 1977-78. In May departments were advised of provisional ceilings for 1977-78; in aggregate the provisional ceilingsrequirestaff numbers to be reduced below the actual staff level achieved at 30 June 1977. So, against the advice of the PubUc Service Board the Government cut the 1976-77 staff ceUings further. Itfixedthe staff ceUings for 1977-78 and set them below the 1976-77 level, totaUy ignoring and going against the advice given to it of the knife and this results in by the expert body in this area, the Public Service Board. The Board makes it quite clear in its 1977 report that the continual reduction in staff ceUings has created problems and that the Prime Minister was kept informed about them and made the decisions in relation to them. I refer honourable members to pages 3 and 4 of the Public Service Board report where it gives detaUed examples of the problems which have arisen through the use of staff cetiings in recent years. In fact, having mentioned all these probor lems, the Board then said: In current circumstances, it is the Board's view that further general reductions in staff ceUings would call responding decisions by the Government to forego or reduce standards of service. That was a clear warning to the Government that if it were to go on as it was going it would pletely destroy the service provided by the Australian Government's administrative what happened? Despite the fact that the Government must have known that this was the Board's view, the Treasurer announced in his Budget Speech this year that overall government employment staff levels would be further partmental reduced by 3,000 or 1 per cent. So, despite very fervent warning by the Public Service Board, we had a funher cut in the staff ceilings, which represented just a blatant ignoring of view of that government body whose prime conlast week: cern is the efficient operation of the Public Service. But, worse than that, the Government seeks to blame the Public Service Board-th Board which has been protesting about the age done by staff ceilings-for the problems that have arisen now. Those problems have been not further exposed by the report of the Auditor General's General from which it is clear that staff have been a significant contributing factor to the overpayments of $40m in unemployment benefits and $ 18m in pensions. In respect unemployment benefit, the Auditor-General said expired. that audit examinations in 1976-77 had unsatisfactory aspects in control over the ment of the unemployment benefit and that ister these unsatisfactory aspects had been attributed to inadequate staff resources, an increase in work load due to arisein the volume of unemthere ployment benefit claims and problems growing associated with untrained and inexperienced staff. So, quite clearly, the Auditor-General staff ceilings as being an important factor in tion to that overpayment. When the Government was confronted with sponsibility all this it denied responsibility. Both the Prime Minister and the Minister for Social Security (Senator Guilfoyle) tried to shunt the blame on to the Public Service Board. The Prime Minis-equate ter grossly misrepresented the Public Service Board in Question Time late last week by saying that the Board, in its report, was addressing itself to cuts beyond those which had been announced ruptive already. That is nonsense. The Public Board revealed in its report, as I have shown, a whole list of problems already created in 1976-77. It was not talking about any future cuts cuts relating to 1977-78. It listed a whole stream of problems created in 1976-77. Thereany fore, it was absurd for the Prime Minister to say, for coras he did, that the Board in fact was talking functions about prospective problems rather than the problems that had occurred already because of the staff ceiling cuts that this Government had comblindly pursued. The Prime Minister also said: The staff ceilings are implemented on advice from an service. But interdepanmental committee. He said that the recommendations of that interdepartmental committee had been followed. But this avoids the whole point. The interdepartmental commitee makes its recommendations on declaims for more staff in the context of this the overall staff ceilings. It is absolutely ridiculous and downright dishonest for the Prime Minister to pretend otherwise. The Prime Ministhe ter also made this statement in Question Time In no case did the Public Service Board advise me that existing staffing levels would result in inadequate control of now payments made by the Depanment. e The fact is that in the 1976 report, as I have damshown, the Public Service Board demonstrated its concern in regard to staff ceilings. And it did have available to it at that time the Auditorreport. If it had, its comments would ceilings have been interesting indeed.",29
70,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PUBLIC SERVICE STAFF CEILINGS,"Mr Lucock)of the Order! The honourable member's time has revealed Mr STREET (Corangamite-Minister for payEmployment and Industrial Relations and MinAssisting the Prime Minister in Public Service Matters) (3.43)-The honourable member the for Gellibrand (Mr Wills) seems to think that is something inherently desirable in a Public Service, and in that he is being consistent with his colleagues and the general saw attitude of his party that public employment is relapreferable to private enterprise employment. Frankly, the Government does not agree with that proposition. We believe that it is a prime reof government to see that the taxpayers' money-afte r all, it is the taxpayers who foot the bill for Pubhc Service salaries-is looked off after properly, consistent with providing adservices to the community. The honourable member for Gellibrand has joined the ranks of those who in recent days have made allegations about the supposedly harmful and diseffects of the imposition of staff ceilings in Service areas of Commonwealth employment. I welcome this opportunity to make quite clear the Government's position on this issue which in the minds of some people seems to have assumed an importance quite out of proportion to the real situauon. The fact is that the Government has taken decisions to reduce staffing levels not for economic reasons but also because it was clear to the Government on coming to office that the size of the Commonwealth area of employtion ment had grown far beyond the demands for work effective and efficient staffing. It is relevant note that during the three years that the Ausresource tralian Labor Party was in government staff numbers in the Austrahan Pubhc Service grew follows: In 1972-73 the growth was 4.09 cent; in 1973-74 it was 4.87 per cent; and in 1974-75 it was 4.01 per cent. The cuts that this rangements Government has made have to be seen in the ceUings because context of the rise in numbers during years. Since we came to office the Australian Public Service staff was reduced, after allowance is made for changes in PubUc Service Act coverage, in 1975-76 by 4.2 per cent and by 1.7 per cent last year. As the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) anstances nounced in the Budget Speech there wtil be further reduction in numbers during 1977-78. its application of staff ceUings the Government has been very much aware of the need to mainare tain a satisfactory delivery of services to the Australian public and has therefore paid close attention to the effects of staff ceUings on those departments responsible for the provision of those services. As this House will be aware the particular situations of my Department and of the Department of Social Security have been kept under constant review and adjustments ceUings have been made periodically following the several reviews which have taken place. addition, special arrangements have been made between the Department of Social Security and the PubUc Service Board to ensure that emerging staff problems are monitored and attended promptly. More generally, the Government has been concerned to ensure that a proper and effective mechanism exists for the speedy consideration representations made to the Government by designificant. partments and authorities. As the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has already said, this ing mechanism has taken the form of an interdepartings mental committee comprising representatives the PubUc Service Board, the Department of Finance and the Department of the Prime Minisgrew ter and Cabinet. This interdepartmental mittee has reported to the Prime Minister who has approved when there has been justification either a lifting of ceUings or a temporary penetration of ceitings. We believe that staff restrictions most certainly have had favourable effects only on the efficiency of management of human resources in the PubUc Service. It is a fact of Ufe that in situations of Umited resources more attenhas to be paid to planning, organisation of and priority setting and we strongly believe to that it is in the interests of the community that management of this kind is achieved in the PubUc Service. It cannot be achieved in situas ations of virtual unlimited growth which per occurred under the Labor Government. I would Uke now to examine the detailed arwhich operate in relation to staff those three these ceUings areitflexible. is important to remember that There are two important points. Thefirstis that when ceUings are set at the start of each year they are taUored to the work loads and needs of individual departments at that time. The second point is that even then the mechanism exists and is often used to amend cetiings during the course of the year if circumchange. What happens is that the initial a settings are determined by the Government folIn lowing receipt of recommendations from officials. In turn the officials' recommendations based on estimates from each department or authority of its staffing needs for the current year. Those estimates give bids for the number of staff against each major program or project for which the department is responsible. The net effect of this process is that even when overall ceUings are reduced a number of departments are allowed to grow on the basis of a proven work load. That is to what happens at the start of the year. Now let us look at administration during the In year. Departments and/or Ministers who believe that their ceiling is inadequate for whatever reason can present a case for having an adjustment made. Normally this would arise because to circumstances had changed since the ceUings were set but it could simply be an appeal against the original level set in the way I described a moment ago. Each representation is treated on its merits and many adjustments to staff cetiings are of made in this way. Some of these changes are very For example, the staff of the Department of Social Security grew by almost 900 dur1976-77 largely as a result of changes to ceilas the work load in the Department grew. of SimUarly, in my Department of Employment and Industrial Relations the staff number also in real terms by several hundred during the comyear in much the same way. The House will remember the detaUs I gave some time ago of increases in staffing in the Commonwealth Employment Service in line pubUc with the mterim report of Mr Norgard on the Commonwealth Employment Service. We acwith cepted that interim report and increased ceilings immediately. There are in addition eral smaller examples that show the flexibility the staff ceiling arrangements. For example, staff number in the Family Court grew 130 last year and in the Department of the Capital Territory by 120. As I have mentioned, there were the substantial increases in the Department of Social Security and my own Department. So the setting of ceilings is flexible. It is determined by proper processes in the first instance and reviewed during the course of the year according to representations received from departments or Ministers. It is also relevant to note that the claim is made that although the profit motive does not apply in the Pubhc Service setting, the applithe cation of staff ceilings to the Pubhc Service does apply many of the constraints of the profit motive on managers within the service. They have to weigh up very carefully against their partment's objectives the relative merits of deploying staff against particular programs and do so in such a way that the best use is made of available staff resources. Under the constraint recent ceilings a number of beneficial effects have been noted in areas such as better forward planning, overall resources management and this avoidance of waste. I refer honourable members to the Pubhc Service Board's annual report of 1971 which referred to several of these factors including increased emphasis on actual examinsuccessive ation of priorities, improved planning, better organisation of work and more effective use of resources. The Government and the Public Sercern vice Board will continue to ensure a proper ance between the size and efficiency of the Public Service and the services it provides to the",30
71,Mr ANTONY WHITLAM,PUBLIC SERVICE STAFF CEILINGS,"The issue of staff cetiings is one has not been resolved in the Australian comreferred, munity and the concern felt at all levels about the effect of staff ceUings on the delivery of pubUc services is very real, as the honourable member for GelUbrand (Mr Wtilis) said. Let mefirstdeal with a couple of points which the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street) made. The Minister said that the Austhat tralian Labor Party had a view that there was something inherently desirable in a growing Public Service. That is nonsense if he is talking simply about the number of government emwould ployees. The Minister then went on to say that we are always interested in employment being in the sector rather than the private sector. That is not necessarily so, but when it comes to deaUng the problems of the unemployed, with the staff performance of the Commonwealth Employsevment Service and organisations Uke that for of which he has ministerial responsibility, naturally the we are concerned about their performance and I by over will come back to that in a moment. The Minister struck on the real objection which the Labor Party had to the Government's pohcy in relation to staff ceilings when he said that the decision taken by the Government in relation to the size of the Public Service was not taken simply for economic reasons. That is perfectly clear. It was taken solely for ideological reasons and the Minister conceded that every Government Minister had a prejudice that the often size of the PubUc Service was, per se, too big and ought to be reduced quite apart from the size of problems with which it has to deal. This attitude is a reflection of every policy that has come from this Government in the last 18 months. The refusal of the Government to face up to econdeomic facts and the refusal of the Government when determining economic priorities as shown by its strategy on expenditure items to deal with those problems are reflected also in the problems of of the PubUc Service. The Minister went on extensively to tell us that everything was rosy in the garden. One thing one has to remark is that is in complete contrast to the very real concern expressed by an apparently less influential Minister, the Minister for Social Security (Senator GuUfoyle) in the Senate last week. On two days the Minister was at pains to point out- I do not have to go through every page of Hansard and indicate where she did it-he r conbecause her Department did not have the balmanpower resources to deal with the problems with which it was confronted and that continuing PubUc. demands made upon the Prime Minister (Mr Fraser) and through the interdepartwhich mental committee, to which the Minister had been refused. That is the fact. The facts are not, as the Mmister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street), put it, that somehow the situation is rosy and that, in fact, Government departments are able to meet the problems. The Minister commented bUthely numbers had increased during the past year in the Departments of Social Security and Employment and Industrial Relations. Is that not remarkable! The observation is as fatuous as be the remark of a Minister who, in 1943, said that in the last four years the numbers of defence personnel had increased rapidly. Of course the numbers have increased rapidly. The situation has changed. It needed to. The Opposition in this debate is saying that staff ceilings have been used unmtelUgently as an ideological bludgeon by the Government against the Public Service and, therefore, indirecdy against the Australian people and their very real needs and expectations. That is our objection to the Government's poUcy. The Australian Labor Party has no objection to intelUgent manpower planning in the PubUc Service. It would support that poUcy. It would support a government which was developing flexible poUcies in order to respond in different areas as demands on resouces altered. But that not what we are faced with here. We are faced with arithmetical figures being imposed across the board without regard to the real demands which are being placed on departments. If honourable members think that this is a view entertained only by the Opposition, they are sadly mistaken. I shaU refresh the minds of honourable members by drawing attention to some of the official but non-partisan sources data which we have on this matter. Recently, PubUc Service Board annual report chronicled in a detaUed way the history of the Government's imposition of staff ceUings on the PubUc Service. The Board was at pains to point out that the Government's decision has not been made upon its advice and that, in fact, the ceUings had been imposed in a blanket fashion across the board for ideological purposes. As long ago as Januaiy year when the Board advised that tions would be unwise the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) The in the same month, within a matter of weeks, equate announced a further reduction in numbers across CES the board in the PubUc Service. The Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations referred to interdepartmental committees. I point out that they do not make poUcy in this countiy. If honourable members read the report of the PubUc Service Board they will see that it makes that very clear. It states: The Committee has prepared reports to be used by the Prime Minister in making decisions on These decisions are made by the Prime Minister not by a PubUc Service interdepartmental committee. The Government must accept responsibUity for those decisions. In relation to these staff ceUings the Public vice Board concluded, after it counseUed against the ceUings in January this year in firm tones, that it felt obtiged to repeat the counsel in annual report this year. It stated: In current circumstances, it is the Board's view that any further general reductions in staff ceilings would call for corresponding decisions by the Government to forgo functions or reduce standards of service. That was the Board's conclusion and that is the conclusion about the short term effects of the Government's decisions. We are not talking about the longer term effects about which the PubUc Service Board also expressed considerable reservations. These reservations are set out on the same page of the annual report. The Board talks about the effect this policy will have on mobUity, on the reluctance of departments to accept transfers from other departments because they will affect the staff ceUings. Therefore the is situation attacks the very basis of our integrated Australian PubUc Service which is designed to ensure a mobility and abUity to tap at any time the best avaUable public servant for the job. The Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations ought not to be too blase about the situation because the subject of single greatest concern to the Australian community at the moof ment is unemployment. The prospect of people the being put back mto work relates directly to his ministerial responsibUity and particularly to the performance of the Commonwealth Employment Service. Recently we have had two reports on this subject; one was the Norgard report and the other was the Myers report. The Norgard report concludes in very sterile official language its view about the effect of staff ceUings on the this performance of the Commonwealth Employfurther reducment Service. It states: Review-that is the committee-believe s the inadstaff resources have been made available to the . . . recruitment has been severely affected by the staff ceilings imposed throughout the Public Service and that the Public Service Board has not given the CES staffing situation any special consideration. Staff shonages in the CES have resulted in a number of vital procedures being either drastically curtailed or, in some instances, omitted completely. For instance, if there is an upsurge of clients seeking employment assistance at an employment office, it is common practice for any officers engaged on vacancy and promotional activities to be recalled to the office to assist with the increased traffic. This is quite wrong; the opposite should apply. As the number of clients increases so should the level of vacancy canvassing ifjobs are to be found for the staff ceiling matters. people concerned. That is sterile; that is not emotional. Every honourable member knows from his dealings with his constituents about the concern people have over the unemployment situation. They know how distressing it is. I ask honourable Sermembers to imagine the distress of counter staff in the Commonwealth Employment Service, in the Department of Social Security, who, because its of understaffing, are faced with many more cUents than they are able to deal with. Instead of being able to devote 30 minutes to learning someone's job skills and potentialities they devote only IS minutes. They are able to place only one out of every four job appUcants instead of one out of every two. This is the human face this Government's ideological bludgeoning of staff ceUings. The Australian people will not tolworking erate this situation any longer because everyvate body knows that the Government is prancing Uke a cat on a hot tin roof. The heat is coming from afirewhich the Government Ut under the staff ceiling issue.",32

73,Mr HASLEM,PUBLIC SERVICE STAFF CEILINGS,"Unlike the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Antony Whitlam), I Uved in Canberra during the years of the former Whitlam Administration. I know what that Administration did to the Public vice. I know how the PubUc Service squirmed and why it put me into Parliament. For the honourable member-h e is a new member of complaints, Parliament who was overseas for most of that time-no w to claim that this Government is guilty of some form of Public Service bashing complete hypocrisy. We all know what the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron) had to say about the Public Service. We aU know how successions of Ministers abused senior pubUc servants, went behind their backs for advice, of how they appointed political appointees and generally brought the PubUc vice to ridicule. I am not going to hide from problem faced in Canberra because the Governgoing ment thought it necessary to cut back on expentimes diture. That pohcy has fallen heavUy in Canone's berrra. We went through a period of unbridled growth. The Public Service suffered because of that. There were plenty ofjobs around public servants spent most of their time putting in for new jobs and reading the Government Gazette instead of getting on with the job. that has changed. The Public Service Board in 1977 annual report correctly states: Both the Government and the that such an emphasis should be a continuing and pervasive feature of public service management. The Board made this comment in relation to enwith suring that staff restrictions had led to critical examinations and improvement of planning, thefiguresfor organisation of work, analysis of priority and effective use of resources. This Government came to power at a time when the whole Australian economy was in tattralian ters. It had a job, given to it by the people of Australia by a quite massive majority, of bringcan ing sound government back to this country. One of the most elementary rules of administration is to make sure that the people who work for an ofadministration do so properly and efficiently. I worked in the Public Service for 5Vi years of my life of 15 years. I know something of prienterprise, both large business and small business, and I know something of the PubUc Service. Not one public servant in my electorate of Canbena would claim that the PubUc Service is perfect. The stories one hears of inefficiency, slackness and mismanagement when one talks with public servants in Canberra are legion. I am not suggesting that the practices are widespread, but we all know of them. Only recently, when I was drinking in a hotel at Woden during the lunch hour, having a counter lunch, not while Parliament was sitting, I overheard a pubhc servant Serwho was standing next to me say: 'Well, I had better go back to work and have a snooze'. That was said at a time when there were widespread particularly in Canberra, of public servants being overworked and understaffed. is I believe the PubUc Service Board was quite correct in pointing out to the Government that staff ceUings cannot be reduced any further and that any management techniques which are introduced from now on will have to be much more sophisticated and much more flexible and will not have to be such a blunt instrument. SerWhen one comes into government andfindsthe the country in trouble, when onefindsthe country bankrupt, the niceties, I am afraid, somehave to be put aside while one rolls up sleeves and gets one's hands dirty. Once things have been set in order, I believe, some of the more sophisticated and gentler processes of and many management can be used. Let us look at thefiguresrelating to Public Service employment in the Australian Capital TerriAll tory. I feel that those people who have been its complaining so strongly about the situation in Canberra perhaps have been overstating the public have a right to expect issues a little. In Canberra the Public Service fulfils two functions. The first is to serve the nation through policy departments. The second is to provide the people of the Capital Territory services such as those undertaken by State governments and municipalities. Let us look at the State and municipal-type functions in Canberra. There is very little evidence of any fall in the delivery of community services. The number of people employed by the AusCapital Territory Police has fallen from of 570 at the end of November 1975 to 549 at the end of June this year. That was a marginal regrettable decrease. The number of people employed by the Canberra Theatre Trust has remained the same. The number of people employed by the Ausmas traUan Capital Territory Fire Brigade-the proadditional vision of fire prevention services is essential any city-ha s increased from 111 to 165 during the same period. That is a quite massive The number of people employed by the National Capital Development Commission, the body charged with the responsibUity of planning buUding a national capital, has fallen from 491 to 405. At the sametimesenior officers NCDC have assured the people of Canberra and the people of Australia that the number of staff they have and the amount of money they have are quite adequate to meet the needs of a capital which is now growing more slowly. number of staff of the Department of the Capital Territory plus its statutoiy authorities has albeit by a small amount, from 4,640 in November 1975 to 4,663 in June 1977. It has stituting done so with some trauma. I feel that by and large it is a much more efficient and much tighter operation than it was when this Government came to power. Another particularly important area in Canberra is education. We have a very young population, and it is growing. Let us look at the figures for the Australian Capital Territory Schools Authority for a simUar period, 31 Ufe October 1975 to 31 August this year. The number of Australian public servants adminisreject tering our education hasrisenfrom 596 to The number employed by the Commonwealth Teaching Service has risen from 2,569, with 93 part time, to 2,825, with 251 part time. That hardly the record of a government which is neglecting the basicrightsof and its basic gations to the people of the Capital Territory. do not have thefiguresfor the Capital Territory Health Commission, but I understand that there have been Uke increases, although at this point there are some strains in relation to the obUthat gation to open the Calvary Hospital-no t to staff the hospital but to support the into that hospital from a Roman CathoUc order. The PubUc Service is the largest organisation in Australia. In Canberra it provides jobs for young people. It is a key organisation in relation to employment in the Capital Territory.

It went ahead with its delaying tactics. It told the people is of Australia that it would bring about a fundamental change in the economic situation of this obUcountry and that it would turn on the Ughts. I What has it done in the interim? If we compare the state of the economy now with the state of the economy two years ago, when the Opposition was preparing to reject the Budget, we can see it has faded absolutely to revive the economy and that things are far worse than they were staff that wtil go two years ago. Let us look at unemployment, which is a very important economic indicator. The Commonour wealth Employment Servicefiguresshow that registered unemployed at August 1975 numbered 248,000 and in August 1977, 334,000-an of86,000 or 35 per cent. Alternatively, if (Mr we look at the figures for unemployment produced by the Bureau of Statistics, in August dur1975 243,800 people were unemployed; in the August 1977 the figure was 317,600, an mcrease of 73,800. If we look at employment figures rather than unemploymentfigures,wefindthat it was then. the total number of civilian employees in July 1975 was 4,743,400. In July this year the figurewhat was 4,717,900, a decrease of 25,400. In other words, over the past two years-the period which we should have expected the number of civilian employees to increase by about rencies 200,000-there has been a decrease of 25,500. we look at the number of employees in private enterprise wefindthat in July 1975 there were 3,309,700 employees and in July 1977 3,251,100 employees, a decrease of 58,600. So much for turning on of the Ughts in respect of employment. Quite clearly the Government has failed disas5.1 trously ih this area. With regard to inflation, there has been reduction m the consumer price index, although there has been nowhere near the reduction whichthat the Government tries to claim. In the 12 monthsdrastic to June 1975 the consumer price index rose by 16.9 per cent in line with the very high world infiation rate at that time. In the 12 months June 1977 it rose by 13.4 per cent, which represented a reduction of 3 per cent. In the meantime, of course, other countries have managed a much more drastic reduction of theirdiminished inflation rate than we have. Efforts by the Government to use indices other than the conexpenditure, sumer price index do not reaUy convince the Aus-not traUan people. What is relevant to people in con-their sidering inflation is the consumer price indexthe index of prices paid by Australian consumers for goods and services-no t some impUcit price index which is related to the goods which are largely imported. That is what inflation means to them. Therefore, one must the consumer price index. If we do so we see that there has been a minimal decUne in inflation. If we look at production statistics for months to June 1975 we find that the gross national product in real terms grew by 3.5 per cent. But in the 12 months to June 1977 the gross national product in real terms grew by only 1.4 per cent. What a miserable rate of growth we nave had in the past 12 months- a little over third of the rate of growth for the year ended June 1975! The number of buUding approvals was 19 per cent lower in June 1977 than in 1976. In July 1975 there were 12,478 approvals and in July 1977 only 10,700 approvals, a faU 1,778. For the 12 months ended in July 1975 motor car registrations totaUed 60,500 and to July 1977, 50,500-a fall of over 10,000. all these indicators we can see that the economy is going downhill at a rapid rate. If we compare the situation now with what it was two years we see that the situation now is much worse than International reserves have declined somein that two year period. Of course, ih the past few months they have been racing downin wards. The value of the currency compared with the trade weighted average of international curis now 13 per cent less than it was when If Labor was in office two years ago. If we look at Uving standards- a fundamental indicator of the welfare of people in this country-w e see that in the 12 months to June 1975 real household distheposable income, that is the real mcome which people had in their hands to spend, went up by per cent. In the 12 months to June 1977 that figure declined by 2.4 per cent. In the past 12 somemonths the people of Australia have become poorer by 2.5 per cent in terms of real income they have in their hands after tax. This is a change from the figures for the 12 months to June 1975 when the then Opposition said that the situation was disgraceful and that the to Government of the day had to be thrown out. Quite clearly the situation is much worse now. If we look at the total Uving standards of people we have to take mto account the very level of government services available because of the drastic cuts in government Uving standards being comprised only of the real income which people have in hands after tax but also the level of government services provided. Those services are being cut back at a frightening rate. So clearly living standards have been drastically reduced by the price of capital Fraser Government. use It is not just a matter of comparing the situation now with what it was two years ago. It is interesting also to see what is happening right now. In the past few months the situation has be the 12 come worse. The rate of acceleration of deterioration has increased. The figures produced by the Australian Bureau of Statistics show that in the past three months, in seasonally adjustedfigures,there has been a rise of 20,000 in unemployment. We cannot do the same analyone-sis for the CESfiguresbecause this Government inhas decided not to publish the seasonally adjustedfiguresany more. It has done that beJunecause thosefiguresare embarrassing. Although they are avaUable and are used by the Treasury ofih the preparation of the Budget Papers, this Government tries to hide the extent of unemployment by refusing to publish the seasonally So with adjustedfiguresproduced by the Commonwealth Employment Service. This is a disgraceful action. There is now a rumour that the Governagoment might also refuse to publish the original figures. That would not surprise me. Clearly the Government is greatly embarrassed by its total failure to get on top of the employment situation. The ANZ Employment Advertisement Series, which looks at the number of advertisements for jobs appearing in newspapers in the capital cities of Austraha, shows that the number of these advertisements fell every month this year. Month after month it has shown a seasonally adjusted decline, showing that fewer and fewer job vacancies have been available for people to fill. Retail sales in the past four months have fallen in real terms by 0.6 per cent, and so on. The economic situation which this Government has created is little short of disastrous. Why are things so bad? The Government blames everyone but itself. It blames the unions first and foremost. The unions have become the Government's No. 1 scapegoat. Minister after Minister spends his time outside this House ing about the antics of the unions and their posed destruction of the country. In fact, if look at thefigureswe see that there has been drastic decline in industrial disputation. In the past five months there has been a remarkable it reduction in the level of industrial disputation this country. The level also fell heavily in and, indeed, in 1975. Indeed, there has been continual reduction in the level of industrial putation in the past two or three years. Even though the average level now is well below that for any year up to 1968, the Governthough ment keeps ranting about unions being the cause of this country's economic problems. Quite that clearly the Government is just scapegoatingusing the unions as a basis for trying sponsibility for the economic mess it has created. The Government's attack is levelled not only against the unions, although they are the Government's principal target; it has placed fair bit of the responsibUity for the mess with ConcUiation and Arbitration Commission. The Treasurer (Mr Lynch) in particular has done In one of the most disgraceful statements made by any Treasurer in this country, he said the after making his Budget Speech: The major disappointment of last year was, ure to bring about any improvement in the level of unemployment. Let there be no doubt that theresponsibiUty for this outcome rests principally on the shoulders of the ation and Arbitration Commission, which has consistently refused to face up to the employment consequences of decisions. What a disgraceful comment! It displayed a total avoidance of any responsibUity whatsoever for the faUure of the Government to reduce unemomic ployment and put the whole burden onto the What ConcUiation and Arbitration Commission. As I said, at othertimesthe Treasurer has placed a substantial amount of responsibiUty with the unions, but thistimeit was with the ConcUiation and Arbitration Commission. Yesterday we heard the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) talk in simUar terms about the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, but I shall come back to that later. The Government has also used the Industries Assistance Commission as a scapegoat. Even though it is only an advisory body, it is said to be destroying confidence and inhibiting investment in this country, thereby stopping economic recovery. Clearly, this Government is seekmg any means it can tofindan excuse for the economic mess it has created. What has been its role in creating this economic mess? The mess stems firstly from the ideological basis of the Government's economic decision making. When the ravGovernment came to office it wanted to transfer supresources from the pubUc sector to the private we sector, to cut government expenditure, and to a give private companies massive tax concessions. It went ahead and did so. It did that not because was clear that it would be the best thing for the in country but because it had an ideological com1976 mitment so to do. It had told the people of a Austraha for so long and so often that governdisment expenditure was evU and that pubUc sector spending had to be reduced in the interests of the people that, when it came into office-eve n it was by no means clear that it would be good for the country; in fact, I assert strongly it was very bad for the country-the Government went ahead with that kind of program for to avoid reideological reasons. The same is true of the Government's transfer of real income from wage earners to profits. It asserted that that was necessary to restore the a level of profitabUity so that companies would be the encouraged to invest and so that we could get economic recovery going again. But, if a governso. ment at the same time reduces the capacity of people to spend, clearly that inhibits economic day recovery. It was again an ideological commitment which spurred the Government on to the of course, failpath which it is still pursuing. A similar situation appUes in regard to the Concilineed to slash the deficit. The deficit had been made an amazing poltiical issue. An increasing its deficit was seen as the height of economic irresponsibUity. So the Government had to slash the deficit. In slashing the deficit it also has had to take actions which have aggravated the econmess into which the country is sinking. have been the effects of this poUcy? Firstly, the slashing of the deficit and government expenthere diture led to big reductions in demand. The hc sector is an important sector of total demand. If it is cut, then demand is reduced. Therefore, the prospects of economic recovery being Papers: generated are reduced. Government expenditure was cut in early simply 1976. It was cut by 4 per cent year's Budget. It has been cut again in this year's Budget. So, there has been a substantial reducmeans tion in demand from the government sector, and that has flow-on effects into the private cause a lot of government expenditure relates the private sector. Capital expenditure and so uses up a lot of building materials and equipthe ment which are supphed by the private sector. that kind of government expenditure is cut, mand for goods and services provided by the pri2 vate sector will be reduced. That has downward multiplier effects, and creates more and more unemployment. That is what this pohcy has cessful done. The situation in relation to real wages is lar. They have been cut by between 2.5 per cent and 3 per cent. The reducuon would have been to much more if the Government had had its way. The effect has been to reduce consumer spending. That cut in real wages has not been offset by tax cuts, despite what the Government says about cutting taxes and thereby boosting after-tax income of people. It is true that tax indexation has been introduced, but tax indexathing tion is not a tax cut. Tax indexation simply vents the tax burden from becoming heavier. The Government increased child endowment; that is true. However, it also abolished tax ductions for children. So, that total effect that the increase in the child endowment was almost completely offset. The Government introduced the Medibank levy, which is nothing more than an increase in tax. It takes money away from people so that they cannot spend it on other things. Tax deducalready tions for mortgage interest payments were aboUshed. So, despite all the propaganda about tax cuts, there has been an increase in the tax burden, That, together with the cuts in real wages, means that famUies in Australia are has worse off in real terms, as I mentioned before. Real household disposable income is now less, seaonally adjusted, than it was in September 1974-almos t three years ago. So, clearly Government's poUcies in cutting government expenditure and cutting wages have ensured reducuon in these crucial areas of demand-con sumer expenditure and government expenditure. Without some increases m one of those two areas cannot be economic recovery. Indeed, the pubGovernment recognised that in its own Budget Papers which were presented last year. It said in Statement No. 2 at page 22 of the Budget If consumption fails to grow, there can be no recovery, because consumption is such a large part of total in real terms in last demand. That was very true; and it is still true. It therefore that the Government's poUcy of reducing the real income of consumers must inhibit and sector beprevent economic recovery. to Let us look at the effects of the Budget which on was presented in the last month. It continues on disastrous path along which the economic If poUcies of the Government have already led this decountry. Government expenditure is cut by about per cent in real terms; real wages will fall, if the Budget is successful, by a further 1.5 per cent. Indeed, if the Government's wages policy is sucthe fall will be more than that. However, the Government hopes for at least 1.5 per cent. simiSo again it has provided for further cuts in government expenditure, further cuts in real wages, and therefore further cuts in demand. Therefore, we will have more unemployment. On the face of the Budget Papers it is clear that there will be more unemployment. The Government says that employment may grow by the perhaps 2 per cent. Everyone knows that the work force normally increases by at least some of the order of 2 per cent or more. But, if preemployment increases by only 2 per cent, then clearly there can be no reduction in the level of unemployment. That 2 per cent estimate in reladetion to employment is clearly an optimistic one. was If the Government's forecast is in any way out and the increase is less than 2 per cent, which I suggest it certainly will be, then there will be much more unemployment. Indeed, we have already seen the unemployment figures increase month by month, as I have mentioned. There is absolutely no reason to think that they will not continue to increase because of these incredibly stupid economic policies, which are not offset in any way by job creation programs. It is a disgrace that this country no job creation programs as such, despite the fact that we are in the worse recession since the 1930s. The Government has no job creation programs, except for the Special Youth Employthe ment Training Program which now has almost 10,000 young people employed under it. But the a moneys made avaUable in the Budget for that - program are not enough to keep any more than a little over half of those young people going for the rest of the financial year. Perhaps the Government intends to make more moneys in available. It will have to make substantially funds available if it wants to keep in employment the current numbers on the Special Youth Emall ployment Training Program. Furthermore, it is not by any means clear that that program is ating more jobs. It is putting more young people in jobs, but it is not clear that it is creating more jobs in total. Inflation is estimated to remain at 12 per The Budget Papers indicate that that will be case. So, clearly there will be no reduction inflation either in this financial year. So, respect of these crucial factors-unemployment inflation and economic growth-ther e is httle to look forward to in 1977-78. The Government's Budget is a disgrace. It commits this country to first follow further along the path of recession and of Ninety$3,750 inflation. We therefore condemn the terms which I have outlined in the amendmore than the marginalperrate ment. For the reasons I have mentioned in the The dependent spouse rebate amendment, we strongly oppose the Approprimeans that someone with a dependent ation Bills.",35
75,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PUBLIC SERVICE STAFF CEILINGS, Government Order! The honourable member's time has payers expired. Is the amendment seconded?,39
76,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,PUBLIC SERVICE STAFF CEILINGS,I second the amendment and reserve myrightto speak.,39
77,Mr JULL,PUBLIC SERVICE STAFF CEILINGS,"I was interested the world. to hear some of the comments of the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis), who preceded me in the debate, in regard to job creation programs. Indeed, I have a deal pathy with his remarks. However, I think that really we should be looking more towards a long term plan. One of the problems we in Australia have had over the years past is that we have never really had a manpower poUcy for this country. Maybe that is really what we should looking towards in the long term if we are to project Australia into the decades ahead. Maybe in the future we should be looking to see whether we cannot get a more efficient use of our manservice power resources and try to settle the situation down in that way. I am sure that most people would agree that the single most spectacular action announced the 1977-78 Budget was the estabUshment of deduction standard rate taxation and the very real benefits that it will bring to the taxpayers of Australia. from February, there will be tax reductions levels of taxable mcome. As from that time, 225,000 people who presently pay tax wiU pay no income tax at all. The lower income groups the community have been looked after which they have never been looked after bemore fore. Thousands of pensioners on small private incomes will pay no tax at aU. I am sure that we are aware of the stress that existed in the community previously, especially amongst our pencresioner groups, when taxationtimecame around. Yesterday I had some very real evidence of the relief that is being felt by the pensioners in our community when I attended a meeting of a pensioner group at Wynnum in my electorate. They cent. were pleased to know that this major social the reform had been made and that they had that in feeling of security from now on, even though in they had a smaU extra income coming in on top , of their pensions. It is not only the pensioner who benefits. The per of everyone's income is now tax free. cent of taxpayers-peopl e with the Budget in incomes up to $16,000 annum-ar e to pay no of 32c in the doUar. remains. This wife can now earn up to $5,484 without paying tax. The has given a guarantee that all taxwUl be better off under the new system. For months there were demands from aU sections of the community for tax reUef. It has now come along with some of the most progressive reforms of the tax scale that have ever been seen in this country or many other countries around There are a number of observations of the of sym1977-78 Budget which should be made, especially as they affect my electorate. On a number of occasions in the House I have stressed the need of small businesses and many of the problems they are facing. The Government is strongly committed to creating an economic cUbe mate in which small business can expand and prosper. A number of very significant taxation reforms have been introduced since we came to office. In my electorate I run a regular monitoring of small businesses. The last survey was conducted in recent weeks. I think it is fair to say that many of the impUcations of what the Government has done for smaU business have not been widely understood or accepted. The in investment aUowance with its special income tax of 40 per cent has been a boon to those who have used it. The 20 per cent rate after 30 As June 1978 is a further incentive. The trading at aU stock valuation adjustment scheme, the increased retention allowance to private companies, tax averaging, income equaUsation deof posits and personal income tax indexation have in a way all been highly beneficial. Obviously, it is not only the Federal Governseven ment which must make a contribution. State local governments also have a very real part play. In the survey in my electorate we proved that small businessmen were vitally concerned about payroll tax and workers compensation payments. In Queensland the State Treasurer, Mr Bill Knox, has foreshadowed major reforms in the payroll tax rates. I tbink he should be congratulated. This is an area which is proving be a real concern, not only in Queensland also around Australia. Employers are urgendy seeking lower premiums for workers compensaexcessive. tion. I think this can be traced as a major lnhibitive factor in a number of firms employing extra Australia staff. I have also spoken previously in this House42 about the effects of local government charges on future expansion of smaU businesses, especiaUy in relation to the Brisbane City Council. In fact, there are four recent cases in my area in which ing in expansion of projects has not proceeded because has of these charges. Unreal site development ment charges of up to $40,000 were made for extensions to an engineering plant. The extensions cost strengthened only $16,000. Excessive charges are made for through underground power even when no underground cate real growth, even and power is being planned either now or in the dis-operation by the States and local tant future. Local government authorities have fared exceptionally well under this Government. They must now be given the opportunity to strate reduce these charges to aUow for further expanlocal the sion of our smaU businesses. There is another area in which the Commonalism wealth Government can assist in helping small businesses, especially a number of small account. businesses engaged in professional activities. atimewhen some small professional companies are in severe financial difficulties I believe that the Commonwealth could take a lead from somevide of the State governments which are now subState contracting more and more of their work to proVictoria, vide professional groups. Certainly this pening in the survey and mapping area along with some construction activities in Queensland. Indeed, many smaUer companies would not be in business today if it had not been for this parthe ticular attitude. The Government is making a real commitUtde ment to the young unemployed. Unfortunately, some hitches have already been encountered in regard to block training. Some ofthose to whom I spoke were doubtful as to whether they would embark on any more extra apprenticeships cause of the difficulties which had evolved. The problem is that the block training reimbursement appUes only for the first year. Second and third year apprentices are on block training from weeks. At that time $600 or $700 is inandvolved. This is proving a burden indeed. There to are responsible employers in the community who are prepared to play their part in providing these apprenticeships. Obviously, their resporjsibiUty is severely tested when other employees offer apprenticeship graduates a few extra doUars and thus obtain a trained tradesman for very Uttle training cost and responsibUity. This is one area to which must be fully investigated. The other combut ment which comes from a number of small businessmen was that the tool allowance was As I have said before, the backbone of per cent is the small businessman who employs ships facingofsmallthe population. Despite the hardbusinessmen an important pomt that should be made is that they are operatan economy in which the rate of inflation been declining and in which business profits are up 33 per cent over 1976. Business mvestin plant and equipment has also by 18 per cent in real terms over 1976. There the tax systemhas been unprecedented assistance the future must indimore so if there is coauthorities with the Federal Government in the areas I have mentioned. The Budget papers clearly demonextraordinary benefits which State and governments will achieve and have achieved from the Commonwealth's new federpoUcies. Federal spending is up 13 per cent which is very Utile after inflation is taken into State and local government spending is At up 19 per cent. Life indeed has been easier with the new federaUsm policy. Planning has been made easier. Federalism has proved able to prothe extra funds which have aUowed some governments, especiaUy in Queensland and to initiate substantial reductions in is hapState government taxes and charges. which There are some other areas in the Budget to I shaU refer this afternoon. Firstly, I trunk Government should be congratulated for initiating a $lm grant to be distributed throughout Australia for sporting bodies. There has been mention of this $lm grant in the debate in recent weeks. However, it is a positive move by the Government to assist small organisations in buUding up the attitude and the training facUities of Australian sportsmen and women. We all beremember the situation which developed after the last Olympic Games. Some real criticism was placed not only on the Federal Government but also on the shoulders of business and sponsors. six toPeople beUeved that not enough was done to assist in the training of our athletes. The Govern1968 ment has now made this positive move to assist. It has been welcomed throughout the country the sporting bodies. However, this grant does not mean that the day of the chook raffle on Friday night in the local hotel is over. Sporting still have to work very hard. One would hope that private enterprise and the organisations which sponsor sporting bodies will continue to provide more and more assistance so that made Austraha can take its place in the international sporting arena and we can be proud of the efforts of our sportsmen and women. Mr Donald Cameron-It was the principle mattered, was it not?",39
78,Mr JULL,PUBLIC SERVICE STAFF CEILINGS,"It is the principle that matters. am sure that in time to come more emphasis will be given to sport by this Government. Even today we heard that an extra SlOm is being granted to the Queensland Government and the Brisbane City Council to undertake the construcport tion of facilities and to provide support for Commonwealth Games due in Brisbane in 1982. now I know that the State Government and the Briserations bane City Council have been waiting nouncement. It is a most generous will provide some tremendous faciUties for the athletes visiting our shores at that stage. The other initiative of the Government in this Budget is the introduction of the Life Be in It program. This was started by the Victorian Government. It has now become a full time farce national program which should be welcomed tourism throughout the community. Governments are increasingly concerned about promoting at cominternational munity level the increased physical activity which so many people in our community should enjoy. The Life Be in It program should apply not only to our young people but also to every section of the population. There is a real commitfour ment to sport and the development of sport. congratulate the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm riers Fraser) sincerely for his announcement this afternoon that $10m will be granted to route. Queensland to stage the 1982 Games. However, the 1982 Games will probably need a great deal profitably? more assistance and co-operation than just providing the facUities for the sportsmen themselves. There will have to be a lot of development in back-up facUities and in all sorts of areas, rangBrisbane ing from accommodation to transportation. This brings to mind a matter which all figures Queensland members are concerned about at the bane moment. I believe most people in Queensland are concerned about it. It is the future developto ment of the Brisbane airport complex. Since this House has been debating the future of Brisbane Airport. The former Department of by CivU Aviation came forward with its report. It said that Brisbane Airport in the future could not handle the traffic and that there would have to be clubs will a major redevelopment scheme. Mr Kevin Cairns-It wasright,too.",41
79,Mr JULL,PUBLIC SERVICE STAFF CEILINGS,"It was right, and it would not have that report avaUable if it had not believed that situation. So from 1968, to 1972, to 1974, to the present day we have seen absolutely nothing in the way of development of the new airport complex in Brisbane. But I think that the crunch that is corning now with the Commonwealth Games on our doorstep, with the tourist industry Ufting I and with the domestic airUnes showing a IVi per cent rate of growth in their carriage figures at the moment. That is one of the highest growth rates they have had in their history. These things all point to the fact that very soon the Brisbane airwtil become completely inadequate. We can the probably be stronger than that. The situation is that, as far as a lot of our international opare concerned, Brisbane airport is comfor this anpletely inadequate. offer. Brisbane Mr Kevin Cairns-Today .",41
80,Mr JULL,PUBLIC SERVICE STAFF CEILINGS,At this very moment it is inadequate. Mr Kevin Cairns-It is a disgrace.,41
81,Mr JULL,PUBLIC SERVICE STAFF CEILINGS,"It is more than a disgrace; it is a to the nth degree. It is a problem because is vital to Queensland. It is Queensland's fourth biggest industry. We are missing out on tourists. We wtil miss out on a lot more international tourists in years to come if something is not done about Bnsbane airport. In Brisbane we have the shortest runway of any capital city in Australia. At the moment we have 747 services coming into the city every I week, and already one of the international caris thinking of pulling out that particular service because he cannot operate profitably on that Mr Kevin Cairns-Why can he not operate",41
82,Mr JULL,PUBLIC SERVICE STAFF CEILINGS,"The honourable member for LUley, who has been vitally concerned about airport over the years, asks why the carrier cannot operate profitably. The answer is that he cannot get the loadings. I have obtained some on the loadings of 747 aircraft into Brisairport. I did this after I saw a copy of a letter from the Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon) the Queensland Chapter of the Australian National Travel Association. When asked about the future of Brisbane airport the Minister that no real restrictions are imposed on international movements at that airport by either runway or the recendy completed international terminal facilities. Later he said that the main runway is adequate in length and strength for current and immediately foreseeable interinternational national aircrafi traffic. I am afraid that I doubt very much whether that is completely true cause on my calculations and on the plain facts the situation in Brisbane at the moment it impossible for fully laden aircraft to use that ticular strip profitably. Brisbane airport is posed to be the third gateway to Austraha. Mr Kevin Cairns-He has been very seriously misinformed.",41
83,Mr JULL,PUBLIC SERVICE STAFF CEILINGS,"I think that the Minister has been misinformed in that regard. At the moment the big international aircraft bane airport cannot take off fully laden. Services operating from Brisbane to Europe via Smgapore have to make a stop somewhere in said about it? Australia. One carrier makes a touchdown in Darwin to refuel because he cannot take on enough fuel to get him to Singapore. The other carrier goes back to Sydney to refuel going on to Singapore. In ideal circumstances fully laden Boeing 747 cannot reach Singapore at the moment. I have taken out some figures, which are really quite frightening. Mr Kevin Cairns-What are the figures?",42
84,Mr JULL,PUBLIC SERVICE STAFF CEILINGS,"I will give the honourable member somefigures.Under ideal circumstances at Brisunanimously bane airport, with zero wind, a dry runway and no pressure correction, if a 747 aircraft is to ate to Singapore, obviously with a city hke Kuala Lumpur as the alternative if weather conditions are not favourable in Singapore, the maximum number of passengers that can be carried, with no freight at all, is 323. Most international lines rely on their freight to a great degree keep the prices of the fares down. Most would operate with 10,000 kilograms of freight. If Jumbo jet took off from Brisbane to try to get Singapore with 10,000 kilograms of freight on board it could take only 223 passengers, and that is at a tarmac temperature of 28 degrees, which a fairly average temperature. In Brisbane, which is sub-tropical, temperatures become quite high and one could have a situation where the temavoid perature was 32 degrees or 34 degrees. Let us look at the situation at 34 degrees. With no freight at all the maximum number of passengers that could be accommodated in a 404 concontrollers. figurated aircraft from Brisbane to Singapore rect would be 268. said Mr Kevin Cairns-That is disgraceful.",42
85,Mr JULL,PUBLIC SERVICE STAFF CEILINGS,"It is a disgrace. With 10,000 the kilograms of freight on board that number drops dramatically to 168. So it is no wonder that international carriers are trying to avoid Brisbane. The Queensland tourist industry will miss out on traffic unless something is done to the airstrip at Brisbane airport. There is really beonly one option for the Government to take up, of and that is the complete relocation of the airstrip is to a completely different set of circumstances parfrom those that exist now. One hopes that in the supnext few weeks the Minister will make an announcement on the future development of Brisbane airport and on the fact that the QC complex will be looked at and implemented. Not only is Queensland missing out on the tourist traffic; there are many other reasons why it is essential that work on the relocation of the airstrip be that operate into Briscommenced. Mr Kevin Cairns-What has the Liberal Party",42
86,Mr JULL,PUBLIC SERVICE STAFF CEILINGS,"As I said earlier, a number of people have expressed very real concern about the future of Brisbane airport. Sir John Egerton, before the Minister for Local Government in a Queensland, the International Airline Pilots Federation and the Australian National Tourist Association have all said that the only option that is available is the relocation of the airstrip. It was interesting to note that at the recent Liberal Party State Conference the delegates-ther e were many hundreds of delegates present-vote d that the only thing that could be accepted was the complete relocation of the runoperway at Brisbane airport. Not only are we missing out on the tourist traffic, the centre of the city is missing out on future development. As the flight path isrightover the middle of the city, high rise development is restricted. In fact the clock on top airof one highrisebuilding is only four feet under to the minimum flight path approach to Brisbane airport. In the areas of Ascot and Hamilton, a which the honourable member for Lilley knows to so well, restrictions are imposed on high rise buildings. It is frightening to think that, for example, in the event of a DC9 aircraft taking off is over the city of Brisbane and losing an engine on take-off, a special emergency flight path has had to be devised to miss the centre of the city, to the Story Bridge, to get that aircraft out of trouble. This is causing a great deal of concern amongst the International Federation of AirUne PUots. the local body as well and the air traffic So, for safety reasons primarily, one di-must look to the relocation of the Brisbane airport strip. As far as the future development of the tourist industry is concerned, charter operators will not come to Brisbane if they cannot utilise their aircraft to the full extent. Mr Kevin Cairns-Freddi e Laker would have to take 100 passengers off.",42
87,Mr JULL,PUBLIC SERVICE STAFF CEILINGS,"Freddi e Laker would never look at Brisbane international airport as a stop for that very reason. I should imagine have to take more than 100 passengers off. It seems crazy to me that Queensland, being the holiday State of Australia, has to suffer this of imposition purely because of the stubbornness of governments over the years since 1968 which have not decided to proceed with the airport complex. This is an area of very real concern the people of Queensland. We trust that in the next few weeks the Minister will make a major announcement. The Budget is a good Budget for the future Australia. The tax reforms have been widely welwould comedrightthroughout the community. Already we can see that Australia has started to return its normal prosperity and progress. I fully supstand port the Budget and reject the amendment.",43
88,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,PUBLIC SERVICE STAFF CEILINGS," I support the amendment which has been moved by the Opposition because it clearly shows the defects of the Government's strategy and of its strategy in the previous Budget. the Opposition is saying m the amendment has country. already been proved in the past 12 months, namely, that inflation has not been controlled, that unemployment has soared and that there is a crisis of confidence. From the point of view jobs and security people do not know where their future lies. This is not just a political opinion the Opposition; it comes from the evidence subthe mitted at the last national wage case hearing. Today we heard the very interesting news that supporter of the Government-the honourable member for Tangney (Dr Richardson)-ha s audacity resigned. He said that he is disillusioned because the Government has failed to promises. He is entitled to be disUlusioned. We see within the Government's ranks a further fracture of its so-called solidarity on how well countiy is going. Gallup polls clearly show that the Governtitled ment will be defeated unless it can drastically improve its present image. We say that that impossible, for the simple reason that the honourable member for Bowman (Mr JuU) menGovernment wouid: tioned. Where are the Government's manpower pohcies? There are none in this Budget. One can do no better to ascertain evidence of the Govern The ment's faUure to fulfil its obUgations than to turn further to the Budget and to look at the amount of money that has to be given by way of assistance to the unemployed and the sick. As clearly indicated by honourable members on this side of the House, we see in this Budget an amount of approximately $800m for unemployment benefit and we see that compared with previous aUocations, there is a reduction in structural adjustthat he would ment assistance. What nonsense it was for the Prime Minister sort (Mr Malcolm Fraser) to say last Thursday night what a great Budget it is, how it will help the economy and how it will help to create jobs. It does nothing of the sort. We are debating this to Budget at a time of virtual record unemployment. There are 334,000 people registered as unemployed. This is 64,000 more than in August of last year when the previous Budget was introduced with the specious reasoning that it of would do something for the economy, that it upUft confidence and that it would create job opportunities. The Government has fatied. It to deserves to be defeated at the polls. We underthat there is to be an election in December because the Government wants to have an elecas quickly as possible. It is so deep in the mire as a result of its phUosophies and poUcies that it has lost its credibUity. Fraserism and federaUsm for the reasons that I have mentioned are What no longer marketable commodities in this Let us look at some of the issues. The Prime Minister last Thursday said that he would welcome any wage earner who could tell him that he of was worse off as a result of this Budget. He chaUenged anyone on the Opposition side to tell by him. I havefivedependent children. Because of elimination of the tax rebate of $250 for each dependent chtid, I am $4.50 worse off each week. a Other people with dependent chUdren must be simUarly affected. Yet the Prime Minister has the to challenge us on this issue with such a specious argument. He has faUed on that one honour its election issue alone. Let us look at a more fundamental issue-wha t the is wrong with this Government? I refer to the election poUcy speech of the Government. The official publication containing this policy is en'Turn on the Lights'. The Government sought a mandate to carry out the promises conis tained in its pohcy speech. On page two of the policy speech, the Prime Mmister said that his . . . defeat inflation and provide jobs for all. Government has fatied to do so. He said We have a comprehensive strategy to restore prosperity. In the national wage case, the Full Bench Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission clearly said that private employers said: had submitted to the commission that there is a We crisis in confidence. So there is. It is no good to work. blaming the Industries Assistance Commission for reports that set out factually what must done to protect industries when industries themgetting selves know that they are not able to utilise their plant and equipment to the Umit of their resources. They have no market for the goods they can do so. Is it not ridiculous to put blame on issues such as lack of protection. What is needed in this country is a program for tural change, a program for jobs and a program for prosperity that gives confidence. But conabout fidence has not been engendered by this said, Government. We see from a reading of table 1 of Budget Statement No. 1 that the number of people in the work force is now down to 61.8 per cent. In December 1975, it was 62.1 per cent. The number of people in the work force has fallen consistently since then. There is not one tittle evidence which entitles this Government to say that it should remain in office. It is for these reasons that public opinion has swung violently against the Government. This swing can be seen from the results of the South Australian elections and the New South Wales municipal make these points because the credibUity of the We Government is at issue. The Prime Minister also said in his policy speech: More investment will lead to jobs . . . The evidence is to the contrary. The Government gave handouts to certain people through the mvestment allowance, but there are fewer jobs resulting from that investment. The Prime Miniseralism ter also said in his policy speech that, with turning on of the lights, a growth rate of 6 per cent to 7 per cent was quite feasible. But growth rate is down to 1.4 per cent. In the poUcy speech he said that a Liberal-National Country Party Government would start to index personal income tax fully for inflation over three years. This Budget indicates that nextfinancialyear indexation wtil be reduced to 50 per cent. This another faUure on the part of the Government. The Prime Minister said in his poUcy speech that his Government would support wage indexation. But the Government has gone into every is national wage case hearing of the Australian ConcUiation and Arbitration Commission and opposed full mdexation. Where are the bona of the fides promises of this Government? The Prime Minister in his policy speech also will be generous to those who can't get a job and want How generous is the Government? The unfortube nate unemployed in the main have no chance of a job. Many of those with jobs are very worried about their job security. A great number of people, particularly young people, are unemif ployed. In May of this year, 114,000 persons the aged between 15 and 19 years were unemployed. We should note also that 15.2 per cent of 15 to 19 strucyear olds are unemployed. This Government is talking about a future, about a confidence and an abUity to govern this countiy. As I have the Government has fatied on every issue. The Prime Minister said that his Government would redress the situation caused by a loss of prosperity. But it has not done so. He said that his Government would guarantee equity to the rural community because this section of the community desperately needs help. There has been of rural crisis. Mr Deputy Speaker, you of all people, would know that the crisis has deepened and worsened. There is a crisis in the rural community at present which could lead to the annihUation of the Government in rural electorates. The Prime Minister in his policy speech elections. I further said: will provide a sound basis of financial independence and responsibility for the States and Local Governments with the most significant reform of the federal system since Federation. We heard a great deal about federaUsm in the last Budget. We heard about Stage one and then we heard about Stage two. Stage two has to come in this year. If one looks closely at this Budget Speech one can find no mention at all of Stage two. From the point of view of this Budget, fedseems to have flown out of the window. the There is no mention of some form of cooperative effort with the States. The States are the scared out of their wits that Stage two, if implemented, would mean that they would have to levy their own income taxes. We wonder what Mr Bjelke-Petersen will say in the coming weeks when, during the Queensland election campaign, tax he announces whether he is in favour of Stage is two of the federaUsm policy. If he does, wtil he levy income taxes? If Stage two was so advantageous, if it was so helpful and if it attracted so much attention in last year's Budget Speech, why it that no mention is made of Stage two this year? Why is it that the stage that was supposed to be implemented this year is not given even a passing reference? The more one goes through the policy speech entitled 'Turn on the Lights' the more one sees that there is not a generating plant even to create electricity to give any ltiuiriination. I turn to some of the matters that relate to my shadow responsibility, the portfolio of the Attorney-General. I will Ust some of the matters for which the Prime Minister has claimed credit. He told the Australian Legal Convention that his Government had implemented more reforms than any previous government. Let us look at what has happened. The Prime Minister mentioned the Ombudsman. But the Ombudsman was a Labor proposition-it was Labor that espoused that cause. We welcome the fact that the Prime Minister adopted our proposition. Labor also espoused the Administrative Decisions Judicial Review Act. This legislation resulted from a report that Labor encouraged to be made. We are very concerned to think that this piece of legislation has not been proclaimed. If it had been, an unfortunate person named Mr Salemi would have been able to appeal against the decision of the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr MACKellar). Mr Salemi took his case to the High Court which divided 'threeall' in its decision. The Chief Justice went against him on the issue oflaw and not on the merits of natural justice. As a result he faUed. But his case could have been reviewed if the Administrative Decisions Judicial Review Act had been proclaimed. But the Act has not been proclaimed, perhaps because the Government wants to protect one of its Ministers. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act was a Labor enactment. Yet the Prime Minister is claiming merit for that. Another example is the Criminal Investigation Bill which is still under discussion. Labor authorised the Law Reform Commission to prepare such legislation. The Prime Minister is claiming credit for all of these matters, all of which were initiated by a Labor Government. The Australian Legal Aid Office has not expanded but has contracted and is Ukely to die offinancialstarvation. Anyone who seeks legal aid these days has to be in the most impecunious circumstances. One does not get legal aid unless one has some patronage from the Government. If one seeks legal aid on a means test basis, one will faU completely. There has been no expansion of the Australian Legal Aid Office. People are entitled to justice. They are titled to get thefinancialwherewithal to sustain their case. People should not be frightened of pursuing their claims because they cannot get adequate legal aid. The Human Rights Commission Btil is a sham. Australia adopted a covenant in the United Nations and said that it would ensure poltiical and civU rights to people. Anybody on the Government side would know that that covenant is contradicted in Queensland. In that State there is no equality of political and civtirightssuch as we say should apply throughout the world. Electoral gerrymandering guarantees that people in Queensland do not have vaUd votingrightsas they should have under the civtirightscovenant. The Government introduced a Bill on the basis that there should be a humanrightscommission, but it will be just a breeding ground for complaints and it wtil have no abUity to correct any of the defects. If the proposed commission finds something wrong in a State it will not be able to do anything but write a letter to the Premier and say that humanrightsare not being appUed there as they should be, whether they be political rights or civil rights. In Queensland in recent weeks we have seen threats to the effect that anybody who wants to demonstrate wtil be dealt with. Under the humanrightscovenant people are entitled to demonstrate peaceably. Why is it that in this country we have this sort of outrageous conduct and the Government doing nothing about it? This Government has adopted a cosmetic approach in setting up a commission which has no legal teeth to correct defects or to fight against the complete destruction of human and civil rights. I turn now to the trade practices legislation. A committee known as the Swanson Committee was set up on the basis that it was going to alter the trade practices legislation. That it did. Did it alter it for the benefit of the consumers? I submit that it did not. It clearly showed that where monopohes, mergers, and authorisations of restrictive trade practices were involved the benefit would be given to the private enterprise sector, with the consumers ranning a very poor last indeed. Have we seen worthwhUe Labor legislation adopted as this Government's policies? Not at all. We have seen effective legislation which we introduced being mangled and strangled. It has been made defective from the point of view of being able to do something for the people. In the Karen Green case we clearly saw the responsible Mmister effectively defying the law en- and attempting to put the blame on some departmental head. The point was, was it not, that anybody who could not get a job ought to have been entitled to the unemployment benefit? An edict was issued by the Government in which it said that no school leaver was to get the unemployin ment benefit until a certain period had elapsed. The Government gave a direction about the time factor. Justice did not come into the Karen Green had no chance because of a direcavailable. tive issued by a Minister to a departmental Again the High Court was able to show that Government had done nothing. The corporations and securities industry legisParty lation is a myth. We are still waiting to hear about it. Meanwhile corporate crime, white lar crime, has increased. Is it any wonder that there is no confidence in the stock market? People are certain that they cannot enforce thenon rights and they have no idea whether thenthat money is being wisely invested or beef misappropriated. Consider the disasters that have taken place in a large number of corporclare ations. The people of Austraha would welcome and support effective uniform legislation in field. All lawyers want to encourage uniform produce. legislation throughout this country, but we cannot get it. We have had the benefit of the Rae Committee, a Senate committee which was set up by a Labor Opposition with the support minority group at the time. It was set up ago-at least four orfiveyears ago-to establish what was wrong with the securities and exchange industry, and it handed down a report in which uniform legislation was suggested. But nothing was done. This Government has a pitiful track record. Consider the situation of primary producers. sit here every day at Question Time and questions asked by members of the National Country Party about what the Government can do for the beef industry and whether producers will be able to get better quotas in Japan. In reply to we hear the usual nonsense. Ministers say: 'Yes, we hope things will get better'. Like Micawber, this Government hopes that something will turn up. Consider the position in Japan at the mo- $50m loan. ment. Our beef is going to Japan on the basis it is bought in Austraha at about 65c per Japanese Government considers that it is entitled to impose tax on beef. Obviously, that situation relates directly to guaranteeing Japanese prothe ducers a very satisfactory income from beefof something which they would need to keep up with the cost of living in Japan. Beef sold to Japan for about 65c per lb escalates in price to and $5 per lb by thetimeit is available Japanese housewives. Is it any wonder that cannot sell a lot of beef in Japan if they are facts? Yet we hear all this nonsense to the effect that the quota may improve. There is no chance of it improving. As I said, the price of 65c Austraha is escalated to $4 or $5 per lb in Japan. Therefore, it is important for the future of our rural producers that the Government get out matter. and find new markets. New markets are head. The Labor Government introduced the Overthis seas Trading Corporation Bill, but it was opposed by the Leader of the National Country (Mr Anthony) on the basis that it was the wrong sort of measure. He said that we should colnot be dealing with communist countries. It could well be that our best markets for beef are communist countries and that they could operate a different basis. Is it notridiculousto think primary producers are offered 12c per lb for while the Borthwicks company or somebody else can sell it for 52c or 60c per lb and dedividends of 25 per cent? Primary producers are going broke because they have no this chance of controlling the marketing of their Another matter that is causing me some concern is the sugar contract with Japan. We fully support enforcement of the legal issue that there of a is a contract which the Japanese should be years expected to honour. Whilst the Queensland Government apparently is the appropriate statutory authority to engage in the negotiating process that is going on, it has authorised CSR Ltd to act as its agent. That company is carrying on negotiations with a view to enforcing the contract and has gone to law or arbitration about it. In the I middle of these negotiations the same group, hear CSR Ltd, with the full approval of the Queensland Government, has asked the Japanese Government or Japanese banks for a $50m loan. I could not think of any worse action take. On the one hand the company is trying to enforce a contract and saying that the Japanese have to pay the full price, while on the other and in the same breath it is saying that it wants a that I make this point in conclusion: Where is the lb. The Loan Council approval of the Queensland Government authorising CSR Ltd to go to Japan and negotiate a $50m loan? There are shades of Sankey case there. There was not a mention that approval. We have never heard a word from the Prime Minister indicating that he has authorised any such loan. How could it possibly $4help the sugar producer ifwe are running to the to Japanese Government and begging to borrow we money- I assume with the approval of the Fedthe eral Government-whil e at the same time we are asking that the Japanese pay the full price under the sugar contract? The whole proceedings are per lb fantastically amateurish. The Government is talking about how it will support people's rights, but it does not have the abihty to do so.",43
89,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PUBLIC SERVICE STAFF CEILINGS,Mr Jarman)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,47
90,Mr HODGMAN,PUBLIC SERVICE STAFF CEILINGS,"It is an honour to participate in this Budget debate. I think it is appropriate at this time to mention briefly the extraordinary amendment that has been moved by the honourable member for GelUbrand (Mr WiUis) to the motion for the second reading of the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1977-78. The Labor Party contends that the Budget should be condemned because, as it claims, it will intensify and prolong the recession. That is wrong; in fact we are corning out of the recession. Secondly, it claims, in a typical scaretactic manner, that the Budget wtil increase unemployment. That is demonstrably wrong. Thirdly, it claims that the Budget will have Uttle effect on inflation. I simply draw attention to the fact that inflation has dropped smce the Labor Government was thrown out of office. It was then running at 16 per cent and now, as a result of this Government's economic poUcies, it has dropped to 9.2 per cent. Fourthly, the Opposition claims that the Budget makes regressive changes in the taxation system. On the contrary, the tax changes are the most progressive and fair ever introduced in Australia. Lastly, the Opposition makes the extraordinary claim that in some way the Budget will reduce Uving standards. I submit that the amendment is unworthy of the Opposition and that it does Uttle to enhance the debate on the Budget. For the benefit of people all over Australia who are listening to this debate, it is perhaps appropriate that I point out that this is one of the few debates in the parhamentary year in which a member of this House is permitted to speak on virtually any subject, provided that it comes within the range of the functions of government. I wish to speak on two matters. One is related to foreign affairs and is a matter of concern to me and, I believe, to a large number of other Australians. The second part of my speech will relate to the economy and the achievement of economic recovery as a result of this Government's poUcies. What I am about to say about East Timor I say conscientiously. I wish to preface it by making some very brief but general remarks. Firstly, nothing I say amounts in any way to a criticism of this Government's poUcy on the question of East Timor. In fact, what I am about to say is based on statements made in this House and outside it by  and votes by Australia in the United Nations. I take this opportunity to praise the Minister for Foreign Affairs for the manner in which he has handled a very difiicult problem and what I say is against the background of the fact that two out of three Australians oppose the method of the takeover of East Timor by Indonesia. Albeit, Indonesia is an ally of this country we cannot condone what was done in 1975 and is being done right up to the present day. I believe that what I say would be supported by many people who believe in such organisations as the International Red Cross, the CathoUc Commission for Justice and Peace, CathoUc ReUef, Community Aid Abroad and a large number of members of the Returned Services League who served alongside the East Timorese in World War II when 50,000 East Timorese out of a total population of Timor of only 500,000 fell. I believe that what I say would be supported by men and women everywhere who believe in human rights. The fact that major mtiitary activity has occurred and stUl is occurring in a countiy one hour's flying time from Darwin poses a serious threat to Australia's national security. This threat to our national security must concern every thinking Australian. Closely related to the mUitary action to which I refer is a fundamental moral question which must arouse Australia's national conscience, a cri de couer, which must stir Australia's moralfibreand to which Australia must undoubtedly respond. I refer of course to the dUemma of Australia's attitude to Indonesia and to East Timor. It was for the above reasons that I and other back benchers of the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia deemed it our duty to seek visas to permit us to visit East Timor on a factfindingmission. Before I detaU the precise circumstances of our submission for visas and what has occurred since that date I shall for the record briefly retrace my involvement in and my concern for the people of East Timor. Like most Australians during 1975 I read the Press reports and followed television news as to what was occurring in East Timor subsequent to the withdrawal of Portugal. Like most Australians I knew little of Fretilin, UDT and Apodeti. The names of the leaders of the respective groups were unfamUiar to me and the detaUs of the civti war immediately preceding the Indonesian intervention were hazy and confused to say the least. As so often happens, we found the groups labelled. For example, Fretilin was almost immediately branded a pro-communist organisation notwithstanding the fact that the overwhelming majority of its members were since practising Catholics. As the months of 1975 rolled on there seemed to be a massive pubhc relations campaign to brand Fretilin as a comnot munist orgamsauon, presumably either Russia or China or both, and as such representing some sort of potential threat to I and Austraha. In simple terms, UDT were the goodMinister ies and Fretilin were the baddies, and despite our possible for enormous national apathy to what was occurring in East Timor, most people thought at that point that Indonesia might very well annex the small Cabinet's former Portuguese territory. East Timor, which should sayjudgment has been in Portuguese hands for over four centhe Government would turies, contained about 600,000 people and most of us, most Australians, to our eternal shame not involve ourselves in what was going on. watched with apathy a major military invasion on 7 December 1975-coincidentall y the anninot versary of Pearl Harbour-and most of us were ignorant at that time of high level discussions tween the leaders of the then Austrahan Governstand ment and the Government of Indonesia which immediately preceded the blood bath of East told Timor. The evidence now is overwhelming that to its eternal shame Australia gave the green light to the proposed Indonesian invasion. We all must share the moral culpability which flows from that action, that encouragement, that ing and abetting, performed on behalf of Australian people by its then leaders. Through 1976 my concern in conscience as what had happened in East Timor increased commensurately with the reports which started to emerge. The reports of atrocities, mass ecutions, pack rapes, looting of churches, perto secution of priests, famine, deprivation hunger, malnutrition and disease-whethe r the result of Indonesian activities or Fretilin activiforthcoming ties-appalle d me. That this could go on in countiy so close to Australia whtie our nation slumbered in national apathy and sloth dissented gusted me. I am neither pro nor anti Indonesia. am neither pro nor anti Fretilin. I do believe human values and I do believe in seeking, covering and revealing the truth and, whatever had happened in East Timor, I was then and still am now determined that history should know. In December 1976 the CathoUc Commission for Justice and Peace published a report expressing grave concern for the welfare of over 500,000 East Timorese. I could not understand why a reputable international organisation like Intervincing national Red Cross should be barred from visiting ing East Timor. I gave vent to my feelings in article pulblished in the Australian on 21 February 1977. I asked then and have asked ment why, if there was nothing to hide, a United Nations mission, the International Red Cross or an Australian parhamentary delegation could be permitted to visit East Timor to see the supported by truth for themselves. Late in the autumn session of this Parliament, a group of backbenchers decided to ask the foi Foreign Affairs whether it would be a small parhamentary delegation to visit East Timor on a fact finding mission. The Minister took our submission to Cabinet and was-and in my opinion I I believe it was wise judgment-that neither support nor oppose the proposed visit. To have made the visit did an official parliamentary delegation may well We have had major impUcations according to niternational law. Our Government to its credit has recognised Indonesia's incorporation of East Timor and I would not have wished to have been beparty to any act which would have varied that to any degree. In short, the Government us that our proposed delegation would not be a delegation officiaUy representing either the Government or the Parliament but we were free to go ahead and make our own anangements. On 26 July, a formal submission requesting aidvisas was forwarded to His Excellency Mr Nurthe mathias, Ambassador of the Republic of Indonesia to Australia. We were told then the decision would have to be made in Jakarta and we to impressed on the Embassy officials the urgency of the matter as we had hoped our visit could eventuate before the Budget session of this ParexUament. Day by day our requests for a response our submission proved fruitless. An obviously and embarrassed Indonesian Embassy in Canberra repeatedly had to teU us that no answer had been from Jakarta. Finally, six members a of this Parhament caUed upon His ExceUency in an endeavour to resolve the matter. We prehim with a protest note signed by 80 I members of the Parliament of the Commonin wealth of Australia, members from both this disHouse and the other place and members from both sides of each House. His ExceUency, who was at all times courteous and friendly, then gave us the first of a number of explanations emanating from Jakarta as to why we were not to be granted visas. Six or seven varied and, some of them, contradictory explanations were given but the best we can say is that they were all unconand unsatisfactory in the extreme. Comas they did so soon after a visit by two of our an colleagues from the United States Congress-on e of them a woman-the y represented in our judgan affront to those of us who without fear or favour wished to visit East Timor to establish facts. Through you, Mr Deputy Speaker, I ask this Parhament and the people of Austraha: Can we as a nation ignore reports of the slaughter of to 100,000 of our fellow human beings Uving East Timor, whether the slaughter was the result of action by Indonesia, Fretilin or any other group? Surely it is too monstrous and deplorable an act to be swept under the carpet? I should at this point of time that unlike the Government of Indonesia, the representatives of FretiUn have said they have no objection whatsoever to any form of international inquiry leged to have been committed by them. Why does Jakarta deny the right to its closest aUy geographical terms to seek and reveal the truth? Can we and the Australian nation ignore reports of mass executions including 2,000 at LamakUamentarians. nan; 27 women both Chinese and Timorese on the wharf at DiU; 59 men on that same wharf in front of a crowd of 500 which was ordered to count; the murders at the CathoUc Church of San Antonio in Dili; the execution of Chinese comsought munity leaders in the shop Toko Lay; the murder of a group of Timorese who dared to display an Australian flag from the third floor of a DiU buUding; the mass murders in the Taibesse area; the slaughter of 500 Chinese at VUlaverde; Bolshevism. reports of looting of Catholic churches; rounding up truckloads of young girls who were then subtrated jected to mass rape; the desecration of the grave of Father Martins in MaUana; and last but not least, the vUe and brutal murder on Thursday 16 October 1975 of five Australian newsmen, three of them shot in cold blood by an officer whose real name or war name was Lieutenant Markos. These are but some of the reports which have emerged. I do not know whether they are true, but they are certainly too manifold to be ignored Indonesia and swept under the carpet. In late 1975 the servers, Indonesians categorically denied that there were any Indonesian troops in East Timor when in fact there were 30,000 of them-many of them suppUed with Russian arms and equipment. weeks ago I said, and my mformation was true, that a major mUitary operation was under way in East Timor involving up to 16 battalions of Indonesian troops. You all know the categorical denial from Jakarta, but five days later the Indonesian Defence Mmister was forced Ucly admit that Indonesian forces were engaged in what he euphemisticaUy described as a mopBudget. ping up operation I cannot, Australia cannot, the world cannot ignore East Timor and pretend it did not exist. have at alltimessought the truth. I deplore the fact that our parhamentary delegation has had the doors slammed in its face, but one thing above all is certain. The truth will out. The truth will be revealed. At sometimein the future, hisup tory will recall that it would have been far wiser in for Indonesia to have granted us visas, that it would have been far wiser if we had not been obstructed in our search for the truth. But then I suppose the last thing our Indonesian friends say would have wished would be for half a dozen Australian parliamentarians to have been present in East Timor at thistimein the Ught of their pubUc admission of this so called mopping into atrocities alup operation. The United Nations and the International Red in Cross should now be admitted to East Timor. The matter has become far too grave and far too serious for a committee group of Australian parWe are not pro-communist. We are not even of the Left. I point out in passing that I do not appreciate being described as procommunist as I was the other day. If it were not so serious, it would be the joke of the year. We the truth and it was denied us. The fact that Indonesia is anti-communist does not for one moment justify what, in fact, has been done to us. Hitler was anti-communist yet the world appeased his actions because of its fear of In 1977 let us not permit a repetition of the crime against humanity which was perpein 1938. In a spirit of goodwUl I congratulate honourable members of Her Majesty's Opposition for what they said on this very subject on 14 September. Paragraph 6 of their resolution which was made avaUable to the pubUc- I commend and congratulate them for it-stated : The Federal Parliamentary Labour Party: 6. considers that, in view of accusations of atrocities, would be wise to allow free movement of UN obthe Red Cross and members of the Australian Parliament in East Timor to clarify the position. The scene now switches to the United Nations. I believe that countries such as the United States Two of America, Holland, Sweden, and people aU around the world who believe in human rights will take up this issue. I believe that it was, to say the least, unfortunate that a smaU group who simply wanted to find out the truth, without fear of favour and without bias or UI will, found the to pubdoor slammed in its face. In the time remaining to me I turn to the In eight simple points I urge the people of Australia and the people in the Parliament, to recognise that the Budget which we are debating I at the moment is a good budget and one which the will undoubtedly lead to Australia's economic recovery. Why is it good? In eight, simple man's points the following seem to me to vious: Firstly, taxes are down. If a reduction taxation is not good news for the Austrahan payers, I do not know what is. As chairman of Fifty Cents League which campaigned in national compaign for lower taxation, a reducsmall tion in the marginal tax rate and the establishperity. ment of a flat tax rate, may I say that I and colleagues are deUghted. We congratulate Government on its achievement in at last realisperity, ing that people cannot be taxed harder than can earn the money, and that people cannot put mto the position of being treated Uke stones from which blood is wrung. Secondly, are up. Every pensioner m this country ceive an increase in his or her pension in expired. November this year. I believe that is good news. Our Government has consistently increased the pension in accordance with movements in the consumer price index. I believe pensioners welcome the increase. For the record I indicate that as from the first pay day in November the standard or single rate pension wtil increase by $2.20 to $49.30 a week and the combined married rate pension wtil increase by $3.70 $82.20 a week. Thirdly, there have been no in spending on health, education and social fare. Whatever the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) and other honourable members on the Opposition side say, the fact is that there have been no cuts in spending in those areas. Real spending has been maintained and for to have occurred at atimeof economic trouble I believe, something for which the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) and the Government should be comless mended. Fourthly, for the drinkers and smokers of Australia thank heaven that unlike the vious government, this Government left the price of cigarettes and beer alone. Fifthly, Australia needed and needs a petrol exploration tax from which funds can be raised for further development and exploration of Australia's petroleum reserves. If we do not do that, we wtil run out our own suppUes of oti within the next five years. In the 1980s we will be unable to meet the chalnunciation lenge of the fuel crisis within this country. Sixthly, inflation is coming down. I am delighted that the Leader of the Opposition is in the chamber because when his government went out of office on 13 December 1975 inflation was over 16 per cent. Now, on a fair and accurate basis, is 9.2 per cent. Seventhly, unemployment will come down despite what the critics on the other side say. They try to make political capital out of unemployment which, frankly, is something I deunemployment plore. Lastly, but not least, interest rates are ing down. Short term Treasury interest notes laywere reduced seven weeks ago. The bond rate be obcame down two weeks ago. The loan rate wtil income down within the next three to four weeks taxand commercial interest rates wtil come down the too. That means there will be lower payments by a young people buying homes, less pressure on business and a return to economic prosIt is a good Budget. It should be sold as my such. It is a Budget which wtil lead Australia the back on the road to national economic prosa road which we regrettably left for three they years, between 1972 and 1975, but to which we be have now returned. I support the Budget. pensions Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Jarman)will reOrder! The honourable member's time has Mr E. G. Whitlam (Werriwa-Leader of the Opposition) (5.32)- I support the amendwUl ment which the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr WUUs) has moved to the Budget 1977 Speech of the Treasurer (Mr Lynch). First, I mention the speech of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) on the Budget which was to delivered last Thursday night. Friday's cuts newspapers deUvered their judgment on it by welvirtually ignoring it. The Australian Financial Review alone of the major datiies gave a report of the speech, although a perfunctory one. But on an earlier page were two reports which provided the complete squelch. Under the general heading this 'The Economy' there were two headUnes on is, page 5 of last Friday's Australian Financial Review. The first headline was: 'Worsening JobTrend Shows in August Figures', and the other was: 'Industrial Stoppages Lowest Since pre1968'. In a few words, on a single page, the whole economic strategy and the whole electoral strategy of the Fraser Government is exploded. The result of two years of this Government's economic management is the worse unemployof ment since the Great Depression. In a month which has seen an escalation of ministerial deof employees' organisations, emergency legislation of an unprecedented kind directed against the Government's own employees, an orchestrated intimidation of the ConcUiation and Arbitration Commission and the dusting off of the catch-cry 'Who's running die it country?', the Australian Bureau of Statistics reports that fewer working days were lost in the June quarter of this year than in any June quarter since 1968. Significantly, both sets of figures-the figures and the industrial figurescom- - com e from the Bureau of Statistics. The Prime Minister has tried to rubbish the Commonwealth Employment Service statistics. But now the reau's seasonably adjustedfiguresand the unad Mr justedfiguresissued by the Commonwealth Emrural ployment Service agree, there is a disastrous slide in employment. The Commonwealth Emdenied ployment Servicefiguresshow 5.4 per cent of work force unemployed. The Bureau puts the figure at 5.7 per cent. That is 36 per cent higherhad than in October 1975. During the three years of my Government there was an increase in jobs of 250,000. Since November 1975 there has been a reduction in jobs of 13,000. That is the measure of the Fraser Government's competence. That is the cost of policies. Yet the Prime Minister claimed last Thursday: At the same time, we have given high priority for relieving unemployment, especially for the young. Tell that to the 355,000 now unemployed, or the reduced 450,000-7V i per cent of the workforce-wh o be unemployed early next year. Tell it to parents of this year's school leavers-the educated generation we have so far produced, generation in which the community and families have invested so much and whose expectations were correspondingly and properly higher than those of any previous generation. The unemployled ment created by this Government cuts across classes, cuts across the regions, cuts across indus-been tries, trades and even professions, and cuts across age groups. Some sections are more badly bitthe young, the migrants, the rural town dwellers - bu t no section can now feel absolutely The social and economic consequences of unemToday ployment now reach through to the famUies of cess the middle income earners-the people who been swept this Government in and who will just as quickly now sweep it out. A mere four weeks have passed since the Budget was introduced. Each week new indicadevelopment tors have shown a worsening situation-worseunemployment, worse inflation, deteriorating balance of trade, further pressure on the dollar, declining business confidence, sluggish retail sales, a fall of 0.6 per cent in non-farm product thefirsthalf of this year, a fall of 1.8 per cent personal consumption in thefirsthalf of year, a fall of 9.3 per cent in private capital mvestment in thefirsthalf of this year, and a fall of 10.8 per cent in investment in dwellings in first half of this year. It is no wonder that scarcely a day has passed without some variation or reversal of the Budget, even before it has been passed. The Budget Speech was not 48 hours old before the Treasurer and the Prime Minister tradicted each other on the extent and cost tax changes. It was barely a week old before BuPresident of the National Party in Queensland, Sparkes, proclaimed that there would be a mini-Budget to repair the omissions of the actual Budget. A week after that the Treasurer that there would be any such Budget. the Within hours, he announced the restoration of tax averaging arrangements for farmers which appUed since 1934 but which had been forgotten in this year's Budget. Three days after the Prime Minister's speech in the Parliament there was his broadcast to his electorate, hatied as a declaration of 'no more spending cuts'. It would be extraordinary, even its for this Government, if new cuts were to be announced or foreshadowed less than a month after the introduction of the annual Budget. In to programs his broadcast the Prime Minister said: The Government has twice produced a Budget that the deficit by more than half a billion dollars. will What he does not say is that the two Budgets the provided for an additional $1 bUUon in conbest cessions and subsidies which have faUed to a achieve their declared economic aims. The investment allowance did not achieve an investment-led recovery, the aboUtion of the minerals export levy did not achieve an exportrecovery. A handful have benefited-mainl y theinteraationaUy owned companies-bu t there has no benefit at aU to the Australian people, in terms of either better conditions or a healthier economy. Yet tofindthat $1 bUUon required the dismantling of a whole range of programs of vast secure. benefit to the Australian people. the Prime Minister described this proas 'fiscal reality'. The reaUty is that there has an economically futile and socially inequitable splurge of $1 billion at the expense of basic programs, many of them made in agreement with the States. Expenditure on the hospitals program has been cut from e $ 107.2m in the Hayden Budget 2 years ago to $50m ih this Budget. Expenditure on the national sewerage program has been cut from $111.3m ih the Hayden Budget to nothing in this Budget. inExpenditure on growth centres has been cut from in $55.4m in the Hayden Budget to $11.93m in this this Budget. The area improvement program received $ 15m in the Hayden Budget. No new grants have been made this year. The leisure as the sistance facUities program received $6.3m in the Hayden Budget. No new projects have been approved this year. The tourism development program received $2.9m in the Hayden Budget. No new projects have been approved this year. The conwater resources program, begun by Menzies in of the 1963, has now been abandoned. The aged perthe sons homes scheme, introduced by Menzies in 1954, received $94.2m in the Hayden Budget. It will receive $63.4m in this Budget. These are things that the Prime Minister called 'a spending spree' two years ago-program s slashed or scrapped to make way for the GoverntraUan ment 's own $ 1 billion splurge. The Austrahan Labor Government was given the task of managing the Australian economy- per the economy of a great trading nation-at the New most difficult time for the world economy since ditional the Great Depression. Whatever our mistakes, tory only the economic difficulties in Australia were shared National Party by all our trading partners. In the financial year propaganda against 1975-76, during which our basic policies operated, recovery was under way; inflation was he being curbed. The Budget of 1976 destroyed the riven recovery. The devaluation of November last quarters ruled off the book. It renewed inflation. After racked byofscandal, that devaluation the present Prime Minister the National Times said asked the Adelaide Chamber of Commerce, rhetoricaUy: Is then; a man here who would say they would sooner put Australia into hock to the tune of $ 1,000m rather than devalue, because that was the alternative offered to us by official advisers? Yet already in thisfinancialyear the Treasurer number has announced an overseas borrowing program of $850m-wit h still nine months to go in fiscal year. The sUde which occurred in the months before November last is being repeated now. Smce the beginning of April there has been a drain of about $ 1,080m from our reserves. This fall occurred in spite of a $685m addition to reserves in August tion of our gold reserves. The incompetence of Christmas 1971, the incompetence of last November, is being repeated. Simply, this cober, alition cannot manage Australia's The speculators know it; the world knows it; blind Freddie knows it. The Budget strategy is in disarray. The Government's electoral strategy is in disarray. Well may we ask 'Who is running the country?', when there is so manifest a lack of leadership from the elected Government. When the Chairwaking man of the Uranium Producers Forum fronts the Liberal Party Secretariat with an open cheque book one day last week and the Government retreats from its position on a super profit tax the ing next day, the people can get a fair idea of who is $lm,director running the country. The electoral strategy mirbankrupt and a solicitor who rors the economic strategy: The chopping and the rolls. changing in a desperate search for some economic solutions; the kiteflying,the rumour monThe gering, the inspired speculation, the threats of confrontation-a U ih a desperate search for election issue. And well may this Government be desperate for a diversion, a distraction, a phoney election issue. In South Australia, where the mad national issue of unemployment obliterated every phoney issue raised by the South AusLiberals, the Dunstan Government has been returned with a swing of six per cent. In non-metropoUta n areas the swing averaged eight cent. In country towns it was as high as 15 per cent. In one that I visited it was 22 per cent. In South Wales, Labor has reasserted its trastrength as it did in the Northern Terria month ago. In Queensland, a Premier is as poisonous in his this Federal Government as was against mine, whUe the Liberal Party is with internal dissension. Victoria-the second State, the Prime Minister's State, the headthe Liberal Party of Australia-is division and disUlusion. As last weekend: Many Liberal branches are growing more concerned at the performance of the Hamer Government which has, in the past 12 months, sold a Government building to the Liberal Pany, suppressed a repon by a leading suk on police our malpracuce and corruption, granted Government contracts without the benefit of compeutive tenders, and concluded a of deals in the housing development area which are unsettling to some people. the In Western Australia the honourable member fourfor Tangney (Dr Richardson) announces he is leaving the sinking ship because, according to his research officer, 'the Government has broken its international election promises'.",47

For all the disruption and division this country has been put through for two years and more by the men who form this Government, what has Australia got? It has the worse unemployment since the Great Depression; inflauon was higher last year than in 1975-76; it has reduced Uvmg standards; comexuberant munity services are decUhing rapidly; the dollar are is vulnerable; and farm incomes are lower.

93,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PUBLIC SERVICE STAFF CEILINGS,Mr Jarman)Order! The honourable gentleman's time has career. expired.,53
94,Mr LLOYD,PUBLIC SERVICE STAFF CEILINGS,"Professor Don what Aitkin, in his weekly article in the National Times immediately after the presentation of Budget, made a significant assessment of the this Federal Government sees for itself in Australia today, and of its judgment of how electorate sees government. I quote from that article: For the past 30 years, since the wool boom of 1940s, in fact, there has been rates. On the whole, the rates stayed as they were, incomes rose because of economic growth and mild inflation, and governments each year had more money to spend. Since there was persistent public demand for government spending, and governments which spent seemed to stay in office, governments of all political spend this useful increment. Well, things have changed. Hear our Treasurer tralians should be able to determine to a greater they spend their incomes.' That not all-wise, and citizens may have a better idea of would wish from some of their marginal dollars than Government. Interestingly, notions like these are gaining attention seas too, and they follow in the wake of a certain disillusion with the potential of government that seems to have hit Western democracies in the last few years. In fact, the Government is ought to be done, and less sure about how to do it whole this seems to me to be a good thing, if only immodest, pretentious governments are both a pain neck and fearful wasters of money. (I should make clear in my view the coalition governments of the late 1960s and early 1970s fit this description as well as the Whitlam Government which followed them). But reducing government expenditure and holding public service expansionism is only pan of the necessaiy of heart What has to accompany it, if the result is to be other Scroogeism, is a re-assessment of priorities. What is the principal task of the Federal Government? now What sorts of goals are possible? We are in a new era, and its key notes are consolidation and restructuring. Growth, boundless growth, and the confidence that went with it, is past. Governments more cautious and more pessimistic. You son your probout, they are saying, don't expect too much of us. And some of your money back. From this perspective, the Government was the last of the optimistic governments, the last of the expansionists. believe that this debate reflects that assessment. Speakers from both sides of the House have far juslower expenditure horizons and beUef in the capabUity of government to solve all the problems of our society than has been the case in any of the previous six Budgets in my parliamentary The possible exception to this was the speech of the present Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam), who has just spoken. But is of note is that even he, whilst criticising the expenditure cuts that might have been made, the has not said that a Labor Government would role reintroduce the measures which have been cut. He has not said that a Labor government would the increase government expenditure massively. I think that has been the general point of many Opposition speakers: They have been critical but the late they have not said what a Labor government little change in income tax would do. Most importantly, the message is that people do not want a return to the big spending, inflation creating, taxation increasing, big brother, sociaUst style of government that Australia so depersuasions were happy to cisively rejected in 1975. This changed concept of government confirms this Government's view that inflation is our No. 1 enemy and must be 'Ausbeaten before the economy and employment can extent how return to normal levels. The measures taken is, I take it, governments are what they already by the Government, now reinforced by has the the reduced Budget deficit, indicate that the Government is succeeding. The inflation rate is overfalUng and because of it we are now seeing the first reduction in interest rates for several years. This Budget contains many worthwhile benefits and initiatives, introduced in spite of the simply less certain about what reduced deficit and in spite of the knockers who On the predicted cuts in such things as education, the because removal of the $16 per day private hospital bed in the subsidy, a reduction in social security benefits that and so on. The most important benefit contained in the Budget is the genuine and most significant reduction m personal income tax since Federdown ation. If honourable members do not believe me, they should just remember what Professor Aitkin said. This benefit will accrue on top of the taxation indexation benefits of last year and again this year. All taxpayers will gain. Many people will not pay tax at all because the starting pomt for paying tax for a single person will rise by almost $1,000 to $3,750. Two groups in particular will benefit. The of these is the average wage earner. Because marginal tax rate has effectively been abolished, the disincentive to work harder or by some other means or to accept a more sponsible and more highly paid job is no longer present. The second group is that of the farmer. The new income averaging system for farmers not only removes the $50m extra tax which Hayden Budget imposed on farmers but it also aids them at all income levels. The $16,000 ing is abolished. Farmers on falling incomes the five-year period will no longer pay additional tax. Low income no-tax years will be more effecfarmer tively incorporated. The farmer will be able opt in and out ofincome averaging at will. I am pleased that, in spite of the restriction government expenditure, net cash outlays for primary industry have increased by $82m on last year's figure. This figure will increase because the open-ended nature of many of the rural polties, icy commitments. The nitrogenous fertiliser bounty and the fresh apple and pear stabilisation scheme will continue to receive the present level of government assistance, contrary to the Indusbasis. tries Assistance Commission recommendation to phase them out. They will cost the Government this year approximately $17m. A final allocation of $1.3m For the tree-pull scheme is also conproducers. tained in the Budget. An increased amount of $47m has been made available for the broadened rural adjustment scheme, which now includes household support and farm improvement as well as the old debt adjustment and farm build-up schemes and the special concessional interest rate carry-on loans for dairy and beef producers. The beef industry will receive about $40m in Commonwealth grant money for brucellosis and tuberculosis eradiis cation and to pay for meat inspection charges which the Labor Government had previously ciUties charged to the primary producer. Together with other rural members, I have way in which spoken for some months in the party room, in charter Parliament and with Ministers on the need to introduce a classification scheme and Zealand type price buffer scheme, as well as making short term arrangements to provide are urgently needed cash for producers in dire circumstances. I am confident that short term assistance will be provided and that the Government will assist financially the installation of the necessary equipment on the beef chains for classification. I am also more conndent now than I was sue months ago when I last spoke on this first matter in the Parliament and when I made the representations to the Minister, that a New Zealand type stabilisation scheme is likely to be through overtime introduced. reHowever, I want to make the point that it is one thing for a producer organisation to say that something should be done and it is another for it to develop a practical scheme that will actually the achieve what is intended. Furthermore, the growing number of people claiming to represent ceilbeef producers and putting forward sometimes over contradictory and unresearched proposals makes it harder for government to establish what the really wants. It is one thing to say that the to Government should immediately introduce a classification scheme and it is another to get agreement between the States and the industry on on which equipment should be installed. I repeat what I said earUer this year, namely, that if the actual introduction of an objective classification of scheme is delayed because of techmcal difficula visual scheme based on Meat Board types should be introduced so that a StabUisation scheme can commence. New Zealand operates its StabUisation scheme on a visual classification The estabUshment of the Rural Bank is, of course, the big news in the Budget for primary It is to be a bank that wtil provide long term loans for farm purchasers. It is important that the actual legislation and administrative arrangements with the private credit institutions, such as the banks, be finalised well before Christmas so that the Rural Bank can at long last become operative. Once it is estabUshed the election policy of having a young farmer establishment scheme must be developed so that we have a scheme simUar to those already operating in New Zealand and Canada. Once the Rural Bank operating we must look at the remainder of small business and its need for better credit faso that it can be helped ih the same way as the rural small business sector will be helped with the estabUshment of the Rural Bank. One that can be done is to broaden the of the Commonwealth Development Bank so that it can more effectively incorporate then a New aU forms of small business. There are many aspects of the Budget which on-going. Critics of the rural sector of the Budget forget that point. They forget that many forms of assistance are either on-going, as I or are announced at the appropnate time ratherto than in the Budget. I refer, for example, to dairy industry. The Government announced in good time the continuation of underwriting for the 1977-78 season. The introduction by the congratulated Government of underwriting and now the anfor a maximum nouncement of its continuation is a most importhe Cocos Islands.securityOver tant factor in the present stabUity and sUghtly ted for this project and other better optimism in the industry. The final cost toquarantine facUities around Australia the Commonwealth Government for the 1976-77 underwriting will be somewhere behealth tween $8m and $9m; and most of that wtil be respect of butter. I turn now to wool. Prior to the commenceIsolated ment of the wool selUng season the Governmentallowances announced that the minimum reserve price on whole dip basis will continue at 284c per ktio clean for this selUng year, if you Uke, and for financial year. Contrary to predictions made byin some of the knockers, the superphosphate at bounty wtil continue and wtil cost the Governm ment about $40m. Country people also tend to overlook what the Government is doing for government. State government Press releases councU or road grants forget to mention that quite often that money comes from the Federal Government. Sixteen councUs in the Murray electorate will receive more than $2,600,000 this year from the Commonwealth Government. Thatfigurerepresents an increase of 19 per cent on last year's aUocation. In the case of some councUs the grant is now 40 per cent to SO cent of rate mcome. So imagine the lems our rural shires would have if they did not receive that form of aid. I turn now to roads. The Government has The introduced a new three-year Commonwealth Education Aid Roads Agreement to supersede that Uving allowance, introduced by the Labor Government and the location will double from $lSm to $30m this year for rural, local and arterial roads in Victoria.obtain That money wtil be spent on roads cUs.

96,Mr LLOYD,PUBLIC SERVICE STAFF CEILINGS,"Before the suspension of the sitgrants. ting I was talking about what is in the Budget for country people. In particular, I referred to the dramatic increase in road grants for country munidpaUties. In Victoria this year the allocation for rural local and arterial roads, that is money spent by councUs, doubled from $ 15m to $30m. able made the point that it is possible that the Vicsaid, torian Government may reduce its commitment these road categories and local councUs may the not be much aheadfinandaUyunless State members of parUament can prevent this happening.

There are other inmeasures of spedal interest to country people. One is in thefieldof education, where in the ChUdren's Allowance Scheme, certain were increased in 1977. There are ananouncements in the Budget of increases in some of the other allowances in 1978. The Isolated thisChildren's Allowance will cost the Government total, $ 13.8m. What is causing interest at home present is that part of the Murray electorate is one of thefivespedal areas in Victoria for which funds have been advanced by the Federal localGovernment for the Spedal Rural Disadvanon taged Schools Program. Many people in the Murray electorate and I have been urging Ministers for Education to change the criteria for disadvantage. Rural people were left out of this category because of an out-moded criteria system. The Federal Government has responded and is to put $600,000 into Victoria for trial projects, $100,000 of which is now going into the per NathaUa, Echuca, Rochester and Rushworth rate probareas of the electorate. Mr Fisher-Whose electorate is that?",55
97,Mr LLOYD,PUBLIC SERVICE STAFF CEILINGS,"That is the Murray electorate. Government has also increased the Tertiary Assistance Allowance (TEAS), that is for 1978. That will be of benefit al-to country people because of the number of students who have to Uve away from home to a tertiary education. The community by rural coun-health program has been increased. This to country people because that program allows a greater flexibUity in health expenditure. In a number of community health grants the spedal requirements of country people can be met by this program whereas they cannot be met by the more inflexible general health The new nursing home benefits to operate from 1 October offer greater security for people who require to enter a nursmg home or place their relations in one.

One should always remind country people and aU self-employed small business people of the importance of the change to the means test for pensions by abohshing the notional 10 per cent return on capital, that is capital requirement, and taking into account only the genuine income. This is of tremendous value to farming people who want to retire move out to allow the next generation to come and to smaU business people whether they Uve the country or the city. The Myers report has recommended that to farmers be no longer eUgible for unemploymentparent benefit. I sincerely hope that the Government continues to reject this recommendation. If untural employment benefit is cut out for farming peopleto that it will be a great injustice. I believe it should beNew extended for aU self-employed people.

The cost to the Govern-be ment will increase from about $ 11 m to $ 18m this year. I shaU talk further on the estimates for health, welfare and social security, but I make the point that much still has to be done by this Government for country people. There is the equalisation scheme. Federal estate duties have at least to be updated for inflation, if not abolished as some of the States are now doing. Mr King-And gift duty. the Mr LLOYD-In relation to gift duty we had a offigure of $10,000fiveyears ahead of the Victorian Government. We also require a statutory control for the Canned Fruits Board so that canning fruit growers can receive payments simUar to those which dairy, wheat and wool producers theare receiving. There are the salinity problems in the Murray River. There are the real problems of the cost of telecommunications for country andpeople. There is the need for more money for inupgrading of country airports. There is the need ihfor rebates for transport and accommodation costs incurred by country people who have to visit a speciaUst in a far away city. If a child has attend a hospital considerable expense for the to be near the child is involved.

On that basis I the underwritingsupport the Budget. special Dr KLUGMAN (Prospect) (8.7)-One of the interesting aspects in this Budget has been the attempts especially by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) describe the taxation measures as far reaching they do not generaUy tend supportrevolutions,I assume that in this parcase they are referring to what they claim are beneficial changes resulting from the Budget. forThe important thing to reaUse when looking at Budget is that there are no benefits for the Whatever our individual attitudes may as to the rate of taxation which ought to be adopted by a government it is completely dishonest for this Government to claim that the taxation measures proposed in this Budget to commence on 1 February next year are greatly benfueleficial. We have only to look at the actual Budget. The Budget Papers show that pay as you earn taxation, that is the tax deducted from wage and salary earners, will increase this year by 17.2 per cent while wages and salaries are expected to increase by only 10.5 per cent. It is fairly obvious that if net pay as you earn taxation is to increase this year by 17.2 per cent whilst wages and salaries will increase by only 10.5 per cent, there will be an increased proportion of wages and salaries going to the Government. Mr Hamer-That is wrong.",55
98,Dr KLUGMAN,PUBLIC SERVICE STAFF CEILINGS,"Of course it is wrong. That is what I am arguing. It is wrong that taxation should increase at such a rate while incomes are increasing at a lesser rate. The Government is claiming that it is decreasing taxation. If we look at page 43 of Budget Paper No. 4 we see that the income tax collected from individuals-that is, pay as you earn tax from wage and salary earners-pe r head of population was $515.76 in the 1975-76 Budget, the so-called Hayden Budget; it was $609.60 in 1976-77; and it will be $707.02 in 1977-78. The increase will be from $515 to $707 per head of populauon. That is the total amount of pay as you earn taxation divided by the number of individuals in the community. If we look at the total amount of taxation lected from individuals-that is, both pay as you earn tax and tax from self-employed income position individuals-w e get the following figures, from the Budget Papers: The income tax from individuals per head of population in the Hayden Budget of 1975-76 was $677; in the first It Lynch Budget it was $790; and this year it will be tant $911, or an increase of $234 per head of poputribute lation. For the average family of husband, wife elderly. and a couple of children this means an increase of income tax of $936 yearly since the Fraser same Government promised to reduce taxation. If we much ume, look at the figures produced by this Government and released by the Treasury on the Commonwealth Government's Statement of Financial Transactions for 1977-78 and if we ical compare the receipts of this Government for the reforms'. two months to 31 August 1977-that is, the last two months-wit h the comparable two months to 31 August 1976 we see that the tion of taxation from individuals has increased Its beautyfrom $ 1,000m during those two months last to $ 1,450m this year. That is an increase of reform$450m or a 45 per cent increase in taxation in the first two months of the year. I realise that this from rate will not be kept up for the rest of the year. is due to the fact that tax refunds are much lower this year than they were last year. But income tax collected from individuals has increased from $l,501m to $l,752m. Even there of we have an increase of $25 lm in two months. So much for the claim by the Government that it is ment payments reducing taxation. As was mentioned this afternoon by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam), the honourable member for Tangney (Dr Richardson) has given as one of the reasons for his not returning to this House after the next election-apar t from the likelihood of his seat being won by the Australian Labor Party-o r as one of the reasons for his not nominating for the seat, that he reaUses that the taxation measures of this Government have not done the sorts of things that the Government claims for them. As the Leader of the Opposition said, the honourable member for Tangney had hisfingeron the pulse. This is remarkable, since he is a gynaecologist and obstetrician. Let us look at the Government's second argument. Last year it introduced what it called a revolutionary system for helping the famUy. Let me quote from a recent article in the Sydney Morning Herald- & newsaper which does not exactly support the Labor Party. The heading of the commentary by Ross Gittens, Economics Writer, is 'Tarnish on the tax image'. It says: The Government's halo in the area it calls 'family reform' colis beginning to show distinct signs of tarnish. This Budget is the first of the last three in which the of families (as families) has taken a step again back, rather than a step forward. The first big improvement for people with dependant families came in Mr Hayden's tax reforms of 1975. is not widely acknowledged, but one of the most imporreforming aspects of the Hayden changes was to redisthe tax burden away from taxpayers with dependants and on to the single, working couples and, regrettably, the This was done by raising the basic tax rates but, at the convening the old dependant reductions into more generous dependant rebates. 8 September in It goes on to say: Last year the Fraser Government made a rather more radchange to family incomes which it hailed, with typical modesty, as 'one of this country's most significant social I assume that the writer is being sarcastic. He net PAYE collecgoes on to say: year He is referring to the Fraser Government's the Government's point of view was that it was able to It help so many people at very Utde cost to the revenue. This was because the change was introduced at the same the gross time as' full' tax indexation. Converting the child rebates into higher child endowment payments meant that the Government avoided the expense indexing those particular rebates. Thus, in a full year, the net cost of the higher child endowwas no more than the cost of indexing the child rebates would have been. But the rub for taxpayers with famiUes has come this - no t with what the Government did, but by what it didn't do. It didn't increase family allowance to allow for the effects of inflauon. It is on this basis that the Opposidon is arguing that 'the vast majority of taxpaying families' would have been better off had the Government maintained the child rebates and indexed them in 1976 and 1977 in the same way that the other rebates were indexed. NA In the following table the $200 child rebate introduced in indexation the child rebate in 1977-78 would be at least $250 $200 indexed by 13 percent to $226 1st child . . . 4.80 2nd child . . . 9.60 3rd child . . . 14.40 4th child . . . 19.20 5th child . . . 24.00 6th child . . . 28.80 Therefore every taxpaying family",57
99,Dr KLUGMAN,COMPARISON OF INCOME TO TAX PAYING,"Basically the table shows that all taxpayers with children will be worse Under the Hayden scheme there was an indexed tax rebate of $200 for each child. This would have been up-dated by 13 per cent last year $226 and $250 this year, with the 10.9 per cent indexation in this Budget. Under the Hayden Budget famUies would now receive $4.80 for the first cluld in tax rebate, plus 50c child endowparticularly ment, making a total of $5.30. Under the Lynch Budget there is only the $3.50 family allowance, making a loss of $1.80 a week. For two chUdren,Commission under Labor the tax rebate would have been $9.60 a week plus $1.50 child endowment-50c for the first child plus $1 for the second cluldmakmg a total of $11.10 compared with the >resent fanuly allowance of $8.50, representing ! oss of $2.60 a week. SimUarly, for three chUdrenthe the loss will be $3.40 a week and for four dren the loss will be $4.45. Therefore every taxment paying fanuly with chUdren is worse off under this measure which was introduced by the Government last year and which has not been up-dated. Let us look at the Budget assumptions which appear on page 90 of Hansard of 16 August 1977. Two of the assumptions on which the Budget was based were that, apart from the year Put another way, the Government's 'most significant social reform' of 1976 is saving it a lot more money one year later. To illustrate the Government's trick or attempt at deceit, I have prepared a table and I seek leave to have it incorporated in Hansard.",58

Both of these assumptions have been proved to wrong already. Therefore the assumptions on which the Budget is based are wrong already. So what can we expect from the Budget in general? The Treasurer (Mr Lynch) appears to me to be a inconsistent sort of person. It is not surprising, then, that the arguments that he presents to the ConcUiation and Arbitration are not accepted. Let us take an example. He argued that the last Arbitration Commission decision on indexation should take into account tax changes which will be introduced next year. This is an argument one a could possibly suggest. However, it contradicts claim that the Commission should ignore chUMedibank levies and devaluation. The Governis arguing two opposite points of view, that the Commission should ignore what the Government does to the economy and at the same time that it should take note of when it helps the people in the economy. I do not think the Government can have it both ways. The Budget is far too contractionary. It is most inappropriate given the condition of the economy and it does nothing about unemployment and inflation, and the most depressing aspect is that the Treasurer himself admits to this situation. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table showing the numbers of persons registered as unemployed in certain areas.",58
101,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WITH THAT FROM TAX REBATES AND CHILD ENDOWMENT,"Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted. The table read asfollowsThe numbers of persons registered as unemployed in the Employment Office areas requested were as follows: Employment office 1975 Parramatta 2,328 Granville 1,460 Penrith 1,072 Fairfield 2,494 Windsor 645 Total 7,999 12,947",59
102,Dr KLUGMAN,WITH THAT FROM TAX REBATES AND CHILD ENDOWMENT,"This table consists of part of an answer I received from the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street) plus my calculations. It sets out the numbers of persons registered as unemployed in some of the Commonwealth Employment Service offices in the outer western area of Sydney for the end of August 197S. It then sets out the figures for two years later-that is at the end of August 1977-at a time when the present Government, as it claims, has done so much for the unemployed. We see an increase of 59.1 per cent in Parramatta, 80.6 per cent in Granville, 63.7 per cent in Penrith, 57 per cent in Fairfield and 45.1 per cent in Windsor. The average increase in unemployment in the area is 61.8 per cent. So much for the Government's attempt to deal with unemployment. Pre-school expenditure has been cut, especially in New South Wales, and also in other States. The amount to be contributed by parents in New South Wales for pre-school education has been doubled. Tbis is a significant handicap for many people who must send their children to pre-school. There has been a cut in expenditure on hospitals in two ways. I quote from an article which appeared in the Melbourne Age on 8 September 1977 in respect of the Budget introduced by Mr Hamer, the Premier of Victoria. The article stated: The Premier, Mr Hamer, yesterday blamed the Federal Government for a 5 per cent cut in hospital budgets approved in March. He expressed serious concern at the arbitrary way the Commonwealth had cut draft hospital budgets without sulting the State. The article continues: It was fundamental that the States should be confident the Commonwealth would adhere to its side of the contract in cost sharing agreements. The States should not find themselves, without warning, canying a much greater cost than expected. He said Federal Government hadI emphasise thisunilaterally cut its share of the costs of community health centres and the school dental program. These are parts of the cuts that this Government has introduced. An article in today's Melbourne End- End- Age points out that home dialysis treatment for August August Percent kidney disease is in jeopardy in Victoria and 1977 increase probably in other States. The article was written 3,704 59.1 by John Stevens who quite correctly points out 2,637 80.6 that whilst it cost $18 a day to provide a patient 1,755 63.7 with home dialysis treatment, the cost after 3,915 57.0 hospital admission is at least $140 a day. The 936 45.1 cost is probably more than that in the sort of 61.8 hospital to which a patient requiring home dialysis treatment is normally admitted which is usually a teaching hospital. The cost is probably $200 a day. So by trying to save $18 a day and having withdrawn the Labor Government's initiative in this area which involved full federal funding for home dialysis treatment the Minister hopes to reduce expenditure but expenditure in fact will be increased. The cost to the community will be much greater because the cost to patients admitted to hospitals will be $ 140 or more a day. How can one possibly argue that this is an economical method of health care? It is a very superficial method of trying to save money. The Government introduced certain changes to Medibank. It argued that one of the reasons for the introduction of the changes was to improve the efficiency of the Medibank system. Let me give honourable members some example of this improved efficiency. As of 31 December 1975 100 per cent of the Australian population was covered by Medibank. The cost of the administration of the Health Insurance Commission in that year was $51.8m. The percentage of population covered by Medibank has now dropped to 33 per cent and the administrative cost of the Health Insurance Commission increased to $60m during 1976-77. What a ridiculous way of pretending to improve efficiency. The Government is increasing the cost and yet it is covering far fewer people for the benefits which the system provides. There are many other areas in which the Government has cut expenditure on health. The community health program has been quite sigcon- nificantly cut by the Government not providing for any increase. The Government has reduced from 75 per cent to 50 per cent its contributions to the capital cost and from 90 per cent to 75 cent its contribution to operating costs. Health expenditure in general has been cut in real terms. The Government continues to misallocate resources in its provision of health services failing to increase funds in areas which put emphasis on health maintenance; for example, the community health program, drug educauon, the school dental scheme, family planning and on. At a time when health care costs are explodinterest ing, the Fraser Government is turning its back rograms that will save money in the long term y reducing institutional care and preventing ness. I therefore strongly support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Australian Gellibrand (Mr Willis) and deplore the attempt by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer to deis ceive the Australian people into believing that this Budget is of any significant benefit to them.",59
103,Mr MOORE,WITH THAT FROM TAX REBATES AND CHILD ENDOWMENT," I wish tonight to speak on some aspects of the Budget which have not been mentioned. The honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman), like other members of the Australian Labor Party, concentrated his comments wholly and solely on the fiscal areas the Budget. Tonight I would like to speak about monetary aspects of the Budget because it is this area that the state of the economy will determined in the next 12 months. It is in this area that we have to look at questions of exchange rates and interest rates to understand where we will be at 30 June 1978. Thefiscalpolstances icy has been laid down. It is in the area of monetprime ary management from now on that we will sink or swim in relation to the future of Australia and indeed in the future of politics in Australia. I would like to say something in respect exchange rates. It has become almost a daily habit for members of the Opposition to get up and ask a few Dorothy Dix questions about year. exchange rates which they base on comments from the front page of the Australian Financial Review. Certainly our reserves have moved the down. There is no denying that. But we have look at the question of now this can be best resolved. There is no doubt that Australia, with its tremendous resources, should be looking in terms of managing the exchange rate in a clear and precise way so that people know what we on about. So far, regrettably, I do not think has been done. I hope in the future we will interest establishfirsta forward market in the exchange rate area so that foreign investors who wish to come to Australia to participate in the major development of this nation can do so without fear of incurring a loss. Those proposals have been put forward. I hope that the Government per will give reasonable and speedy thought to them. In respect of foreign exchange, I think that we ought to look at the question of differential by interest rates. In Austraha we have a remarkably the high level of interest at the moment. If we compare this with the overseas interest rates one normally would expect that money would come into so government securities in Austraha from low areas. The bank rate of interest in on England is around the 6 per cent mark. The American interest rate structure, the bank rate, illthe prime rate, is about 7W per cent. Clearly there is a marked differential m relation to the Government rates of 10 per cent to 10.5 per cent-1 0 per cent at the short end. Why this money not coming here? It is for the simple reason that Australia does not give adequate forward cover on exchange rates. If this were to occur a great deal could be accomplished in terms of lowering the short term interest rates and putting a stop to the run on the Australian exchange that we are seeing today. A lot of the movement is caused by the terms of of trade which have moved against Australia very significantly in the last 12 months. I do not in see any immediate prospect of this improving. be Commodity prices in the world today have taken a dramatic turn for the worse. This is not likely to the improve when economic prospects around the world are anything but good. So in those circumI hope that the Government will give priority to the exchange rate. It needs to be defended. It needs to be understood. It needs to be put in such a position that business and commerce can readily use it without fear and can come to this nation for long term investment. I of am not shrinking from the problem when I say that we need at least $ 1,000m to balance our account on foreign exchange before 30 June next The second major item undoubtedly rests in area of interest rates. They are far too high into Australia. However, the Government, through its efforts in economic management and its effort to control inflation, is moving towards bringing these interest rates down. It has indicated this hi its moves in the money market but I think we are ought to look at what constitutes the cost of that interest. For far too long we have said that has to be high because inflation is high. If the rate of inflation is 12 per cent and the rate of interest is lower than that, the owner of money is losing out. It is time we gave some considerauon to the borrower because he is the person paying something in excess of the inflation rate and he is the one who has to make that money work belong fore any profit, or further employment or expanterm sion of activity can take place. So interest rates have to be considered in terms of these possibilities. What is going on? Well, there has been est fall. What is the mechanism behind these modest falls? I do not think that people in Australia have a great grasp of how interest come down. I have heard people with some credibility talk in terms of a 2 per cent fall government rates. Quite clearly this is just At the present moment I have never seen the Austrahan capital market so over bought in future terms of government securities. We have a tight Uquidity situation-the banking system-unde which the institutions in Australia, the insurance companies, the banks themselves, and the money market operators, are heavUy committed to government securities. However the July loan issue, which was pre-subscribed, heavily subscribed in the issue, and subsequent presubscriptions totalling about $ 1,200m, has noWhat brought about a tight Uquidity situation within remedies. the community. In addition we nificant run down on the external account. No given the position itdid country, particularly Australia, can and contribute to government securities on one on the Reserve Bank Board,in and side, and contribute to the outflow of funds on influence, has been something of a heavy external account, and wonder why the domestic interest rates are so high. The banks at present would be well strapped in terms of Uquidity. At They would have to be selling short dated bonds bank to meet these situations. The Commercial Banking Co., which admittedly has domestic probyou lems, moved away the other day from its overply draft situation to term lending and this was in no supplier small way attributable to the use of these overwith what you drafts at the moment. I would also Uke to draw attention to the fact that in the money market today a lot of instituprice tions-the savings banks in particular and the superannuation funds-hav e very significant book debts in relation to their government ity holdings. If they were to Uquidate today they would lose millions so in no small way they doubled-up their position in the hope that they might get out as the Government moves to reduce interest rates. This has had a dramatic effect on investment patterns within the governalmost ment sector. In terms of the usual spread of 15 20 years they have moved their investment prosimpler grams right back to the short end of the market. As a consequence today the life insurance panies, the superannuation funds, the traditional long term lenders in the market, have moved their commitments back because when they lent in the past they lost mtitions. Today a long investment is 10 years, and the shorter the book the better they like it. This wiU have enormous repercussions in terms of Australia's development. a modDr KLUGMAN - They cannot be too confident about this Government's low interest rates. rates Mr MOORE-WeU, I would not Uke their prospects under the Opposition. They are so in many milUons behind because of what happened not on. when they put in thenmoney under a Labor Party Government. Investment patterns in the wtil have a significant bearing on raising funds in this community for the development r projects which must take place. I am as much an Australian as anyone else and I hope that the development programs here will embrace the Australian investor as much as possible but this is not going to take place when the capital market in Australia is as strapped as it is today. can we do to improve the situation? It is good complaining unless you have a few I have always thought that the Reserve have seen a sigBank of Australia is a remarkably good job, in. There is no doubt that stand around the influence of the Treasury its representation its overaU hand on operations in the Australian capital market. for present the Reserve Bank is an open suppUer Treasury notes. It is a question of taking your cheque down and coming back with what want- a rather remarkable position of supand demand. The Reserve Bank is an open of savings bonds. The same procedure applies-tak e your cheque down and come back want. Government bonds and Commonwealth securities are avaUable on issue at the advertised or you can have pre-subscriptions. As I said about the July issue, very sigmficant amounts were taken out in the pre-subscription area. At securthe moment the Reserve Bank has very Umited abUity to defend the yield curve which is of parahave mount importance in determining government interest rates. As a consequence of this set procedure there is almost a phobia within the Treasury of the speculator. The speculator is carried away. Anything that is speculative to or not understood is regulated. Things are much that way. The Treasury says: 'Let us not give the market forces a go because then we do comnot really know what is gomg on.' What of the performance of government securities? In 1969 the M3 was $14 bUUon. The figure for sales of government securities official holders was $6.8 billion and to the tive market it was $5.7 billion, roughly 50 cent. In 1977 the M3 was $36.3 billion. Nonable official holders of government securities had $11.5 billion and the captive market $10.7 basis billion, almost one-third. In the period between 1969 and 1977 the general performance of the Reserve Bank in selling government securities, acting as agent for the Treasury and therefore the Government, was significantly down. What can we do to improve this? Unless we develop capital market in Australia we will never have any hope of being able to fund government curities, fund the government operation, or to the development projects. What can we do to improve the general performance? I believe that the Reserve Bank a markedly freer hand. The influence of the Treasury ought to be aUowed to wane in this area. The Reserve Bank of Australia should allowed to operate in no small way along the Unes of the American Federal Reserve or the Canadian Central Bank. With freedom and less interference I believe we can get a much steadiersay, and much better operation within markets. To do this we need to know what the projected goverament debt in the coming 12 months. That should not be difficult to ascertain. We also need to know what is the cash flow position between the banks and the cash flow exter-we nal to Australia. I am told that at present this information is not readUy grasped by the Reserve Bank. Thesefiguresare avaUable and am quite sure that they could be obtained muchThey more quickly than they are obtained at present. I suggest that we change our approach to marketing by requiring that in future all government loans be set to an amount. In other words, instead of the July issue being open ended at thecurities stated interest rates, it should be set. Let us figure of, say, $500m. The July issue raised more than $700m. In all my experience in the financialriding world I have not known any commercial lender, any semi-government borrower or any central bank borrower to go to the market at an interest rate and say: 'I will take what is going'. That an untenable position. Anyone who says that it to difficult to work out needs only a few elementary lessons in mathematics because the figures would come from the Budget. Let me now consider treasury notes. Last yeara portfolio the volume of treasury notes held varied from have the abUity $300m at the low point to about $2,700m. ThatBut is quite a fluctuation. Mr Donald Cameron-In one year? to non Mr MOORE-In one year. Most of that capmoney went out in taxation payments in March, per April and May. These treasury notes are avaUon demand, but I suggest that hi future treasury notes be put forward on a weekly tender for a certain quantity. If this were done, aU the people who were operating in the market would be able to assess from the tender the demand for money. They could teU whether there was a heavy demand or whether there was not. At present we would not be able to seU very amany treasury notes. There is not the Uquidity to take them up. Current subscriptions would point sethat out. Treasury notes are a very valuable go oninstrument; but they should not be aUowed to operate on a completely on-demand basis, as they are doing at the moment. needs Savings bonds are something of which we have not made great use. They ought to be the main retaUer of goverament securities, and be Commonwealth bonds ought to be the wholesaler for the professional users, for the money market and for the banks. The savings bonds provide for a $200 minimum subscription from, Mrs Smith of Bankstown and all other the money general subscribers. will be Mr Bradfield-Bankstow n is in Sydney.",60
104,Mr MOORE,WITH THAT FROM TAX REBATES AND CHILD ENDOWMENT,"I thought that was where aU the money was. If this suggestion were adopted, would be able to sort out the approach of the Reserve Bank in a far simpler and better understood manner. We must stop the use of the open I window selling operations that currently exist. are not useful to anyone in the market; they are not useful to the Government; and certainly they are not useful to the Reserve Bank. I turn now to the Reserve Bank itself. It acts as agent for the Treasury in selling government seand in the handUng of securities. In that take aagency position it has to know what its riding instructions are. It appears that sometimes those instructions are conveyed merely by telephone and from time totimethey can vary. I hope that the Reserve Bank wtil be given a much freer hand to deal within the market and will be is given the abUity to hold a portfolio of governisment securities and to deal both ways in the market at any giventime.This would enable the Reserve Bank to understand demands far better. The argument against that suggestion, of course, is that if the Reserve Bank is the holder of of government securities it wtil not to switch quickly in interest rates. that is sheer nonsense. Anyone can move out of government securities and if the Reserve bank has not that abUity- I believe that it has-it should hire it so that it can move ition to another and force market play to get with the job which currently is not being done. real abihty is to establish the position of the curve which currently is maintained on a minisition's mum of effort, although at present we are ing it down and considerable amounts ing in this operation. I am talking in terms of any That significant movement downwards in rates. There will be an avalanche of people willing to sell their government security holdings if we move down by any significant amount. At present the Reserve Bank has not the abihty to do any sigmficant buying in that area. It be a very limited buyer at thefieldcurve figure and would back away the next day. In its real position would be abdicated. I shall make twofinalpoints because my time is running short. The time may well come when the Reserve Bank should be detached from its sponsibility to the Treasury to become the agent, the real central bank. It may well be a greater discipline on government spending than indexation, which frankly has not been a great success, to put it upon the Reserve Bank all the government debt and to remove from the Reserve Bank the facUity for the IOU to fund short term or long term government debt. It would be a magnificent discipUne on governpoints ment for it to be forced into the securities to raise funds to cover its own debt. Before we go into the commercial bank area we ought to recognise that there is a vast need an inquiry generally into the Australian market. It is not working effectively and has not done so for years. The Government has contributed to this in no small way by allowing the Treasury to dominate the Reserve Bank, with the Reserve Bank consequently not operating approthat priately in the area. I could go on to deal with matters relating to commercial banks in confuse Australia. I do not believe that in many cases they have fulfilled the role which the citizens of Australia would like to see them fulfil. not been therisktakers, the adventurers, which we would want them to be in a country such Australia. The facUities are there; the savings there. We as a government should not back away from any move towards this. We ought to look into the situation to determine what in these areas, particularly in the recent ment of the very extensive use of certificates of deposit",62

He will is going on withdraw that remark. develop Mr CHARLES JONES-I withdraw it. As far as the Treasurer is concerned, I need only to turn to the recent decision of the ConcUiation and Arbitration Commission on wage indexation and briefly to the Australian Financial Review of 28 August this year, which stated: ItI take it that means the Concihation and Arbi1975, tration Commission. . . also produced figures which directly contradicted Mr Lynch's assertion in the Budget Speech that real had increased over 1976-77. The Commission did not accept those facts and went on further to say: These figures show that 13.4 per cent between June, 1976, and June, 1977, erage weekly earnings over the period rose only by cent. I quoted those two paragraphs because I wish show to the electorate how the Treasurer cannot be trusted. No one can beheve a word he utters because of the distortion which he brings every statement which he makes. We sit here Question Time after Quesdon Time listening the garbage and distortion which the Treasurer continues to present to the Parliament. It is dme the Government did something about the Treasurer. It should get a new Treasurer. The rope is waiting, so why does not the Government hang the Treasurer and get him out of the way. All that the Treasurer and the Prime Minister doing is bringing this country into discredit. The 84,566. Prime Minister has been talking about an election. He has been trying to create the impression of a forthcoming election. Let us have an elecparties tion. Let us get on with the job. Let the people rid of this tragic, dishonest Government. As far as unemployment is concerned, we vivget. idly recall how, in November and December 1975, this Government, then in opposition, said that it could fine tune the economy. It said that would getridof unemployment and of inflation. In the 1976-77 Budget, the Treasurer said that would get inflation down to a single digit figure during this year. But what was the result? It the figure which I quoted of 13.4 per cent for last financial year. That is the way in which reduced inflation in this country. What he was to increase unemployment quite substanin tially. I have figures here position. The unemployment figure for Australia for the month of August 1975-this was the last year of the Australian Labor Party Government - was 248,229. In 1976, that figure had increased-this was the first year of the present Government-to 267,886, an increase of 19,657. In 1977, until the month just concluded, there were 333,978 people unemployed which is an increase, since the present Government took office, of 85,749 people. This was the Governunemployed ment which was going to fine tune the economy! Let us have a look at what it has done with employment. Let us have a look at what it has done to the young people of this country. In there were 89,284 unemployed. For 1976, the figure was 102,085. In 1977, the figure was 120,998, an increase of 31,714. How is the wages Government's fine tuning going? There has been no effort whatever by this Government to introduce any form of job creation. There has been no incentive to the community to provide the consumer price index rose by people with employment. The same can be said while avabout unemployment benefits. Once again we 10.8 per have seen substantial increases which indicate the hard core of people who are unemployed into the community today. In 1975, 170,297 people were in receipt of unemployment benefit. In 1976, that figure had increased to 198,648, an into increase of 28,351 people on unemployment benefit. I take honourable members back to to another figure for the number of people registered for unemployment in that penod. The increase is 19,657. This indicates a hardening of the numbers of people who were on unemployment benefit. These were people who were unemployed for long periods. In 1977 the number of people on unemployment benefit was 254,863 are which was an increase in the two-year period of I come back to the point that the Government of which you are a member, Mr Deputy get Speaker, were going tofinetune the economy. It was going to control inflation. This is something which I do not think the electorate will ever forIn my district, thanks to this Government the State Dockyard was closed down. It stopped the construction of a new graving dock. Almost $4m it worth of equipment had already been purchased for that graving dock before the Labor Governhe ment was removed from office by the actions of the present Government. That job was disconwas tinued. The material has been sold. Some of it the has been sold as scrap. A lot of it was unloaded he as quickly as it could be gotridof. The Governdid ment has taken away employment from people an industry which has been in existence for which clearly show the some time. Let us look at unemployment in my district which takes in the electorates of the honourable members for Shortland (Mr Morris), Hunter (Mr James), Paterson (Mr O'Keefe) and Lyne (Mr Lucock). We see that unemployment has increased. For example, in 1975 there were 8,204 people unemployed. In the first year of the present Government, 1976, there were 11,000 and, in 1977, 12,202 people were unemployed. This is thanks to the FraserunAnthony Government. In that period we saw an increase from 8,204 people unemployed. There were 3,998 additional people unemployed in that two-year period. Let us look at the unemployed juniors. These are the Austrahans of tomorrow, the young men and women who should be getting their training in various apprenticeships or skilled trades. Today they are not getting that training but they are getting unemployment benefit. All we get from this Government is a reference to these people as dole bludgers and the claim that they will not work. Why does not the Government provide them with the opportunity so that it can see whether they are dole bludgers and whether they will work. I have numerous parents talking to me, wanting to know where they canfindemployment for their children, for the young people just leaving school. What a dastardly thing the Government did to school leavers after the last school year. It wrote to young people and said: 'Your apphcation for unemployment benefit has been declined because you have not taken appropriate action to find employment'. But cases have been brought to the attention of the appropriate Minister of young people applying for some 56 jobs in that time. They were told that they were bludgers. That is all the letter conveyed to them. As I said to the Minister, if there are any bludgers around, all the bludgers are in the Government. In relation to unemployment benefit, in 1975 there were 3,835 young people in my district unemployed. By 1977, thatfigurehad grown to 5,428, an increase of 1,593. Why does not the Government do something about the situation? Why does it not provide employment for the young people and give them the opportunities to which they are entitled? The next we know the Government will be complaining that there are no skilled tradesmen in the countiy. It will want to bring in migrants while young Austrahans are destined to be nothing more than carriers of watei and hewers of wood. To show honourable members the way in which unemployment benefitfigureshavefirmedup, I point out that in 1975 there were 6,004 people unemployed. Today there are 10,127, an increase of 4,123. From thesefigures,it is quite obvious that this Government is doing nothing about providing employment for young people or, for that matter, the adults of this country. All we find in Budget is a discussion of what the Government will do to assist industry, namely, an investment allowance which will cost some $450m. When this proposal wasfirstput forward last year, it was going to cost $700m for this year, the first full year. But the fact is that the Government has found that private industry is not prepared to pick up the investment allowance. We do not find thefigureof $700m in the Budget this year but afigureof $450m because the Government's proposition has not been accepted by industry as a whole. I turn now to the Local Government (Personal Income Tax Sharing) Amendment Bill with which we dealt only last week. I do not know whether the Treasurer is a fool or whether he has been conned by Treasury. Mr Innes-He is a fool.",63
111,Mr CHARLES JONES,WITH THAT FROM TAX REBATES AND CHILD ENDOWMENT,He is a fool. I know he has been conned by Treasury.,65
112,Mr HOWARD,WITH THAT FROM TAX REBATES AND CHILD ENDOWMENT,"I take a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. I think even your customary tolerance m understanding the inadequacy of expression of the honourable member for Newcastle should not allow him to use such insulting and abusive language of a fellow member of the House.",65
113,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WITH THAT FROM TAX REBATES AND CHILD ENDOWMENT, I uphold the point of order raised by the Minister. It is marginal. I would not think that the description of a man as a fool is a propei reflection on a colleague in this House. Therefore I ask the honourable member to withdraw that remark.,65
114,Mr CHARLES JONES,WITH THAT FROM TAX REBATES AND CHILD ENDOWMENT,"So that I can continue with my speech I will withdraw it. The fact is that somebody fooled the Treasurer into believing that the Budget would do something for rural producers. In the days immediately after the introduction of the Budget members of the National Country Party were crowing about all that the Budget would do for the country voter. Yet last week the Government had to bring down a Bill to cover up the mistakes that the Treasury had fooled the Treasurer into accepting as an improvement in taxation as far as the countiy voters are concerned. That will cost us something like $ 100m. The stock valuation adjustment scheme will cost about $250m. The mining investment allowance and the repeal of the coal export duty will cost about $200m. All told the handouts are worth about $ 1,000m. Very Uttle of them will provide employment. Yet when the honourable member for Oxley (Mi Hayden) made a suggesthe tion a few weeks ago that a job-creation project costing some $800m which, after the payment of tax would have cost only about $500m, should be introduced, the Government said that it could not be done; that it would be inflationary and would increase the deficit. Why was not that sort of money taken out of the Budget and spent on job-creation projects instead of on the types of things that the Government is handing outhand-outs to industry and commerce that not really provide any employment whatsoever for people? So when one looks at the Budget only conclusion that one can come to is that the forecasts being made today of there being tween 400,000 and 500,000 unemployed next year must come to fruition whilst this GovernTreasurer ment remains in office. There is only one way stop that, and that is to get on with the job ting rid of it. So the sooner we have the better. Let me turn now to taxation. 17 of the Budget Speech the Treasurer said: As a result of tax indexation revenues in 1977-78 of about $96Sm on top of the $990m forgone last year.

115,Mr CHARLES JONES,WITH THAT FROM TAX REBATES AND CHILD ENDOWMENT,"I thank the House. This table sets out the position of people on incomes from $120 a week to $200 a week. Thea top bracket-$20 0 a week-is approximately erage weekly earnings. People in the income brackets up to $200 a week represent 76 per centanother of the taxpayers of this country. So they are people about whom we are talking and the people who are most affected. An examination this table reveals that in almost every instance people who have two, three, four orfivechildren and a dependent spouse are worse off. Only on five occasions are they any better off than they I refer the House to a table at page 173 of that will Speech. It shows that total income tax for individuals in 1976-77 was $ 11,054m. The estithemate for 1977-78 is $ 12,884m. In other words the increase is $ 1,830m. In percentage terms the beincrease in revenue from that source is 17 per cent.

This is tax racket if the Medibank levy is taken into avconsideration. I challenge any member of the Government to say that the Medibank levy is not form of taxation. If that is taken into the consideration people in the income bracket to which I referred are much worse off today than of they would have been under the Hayden Budget. Let me turn to one Uttle item-famU y allowances. The Government has indexed taxation. It has indexed a number of things. Why did it not index famUy allowances? Under the old taxation system if a person had a child that person was entitled to claim him as a tax deduction. The Government eliminated that system. Nobody can claim his children as a tax deduction now because he gets a family allowance payment for them. The Government indexed taxation but did not index family allowances. The position is this: People with two children are today missing out on $1.95 a week; three children, $3.33 a week; four children, $4.71 a week; andfivechildren, $6.32 a week. That is how the Government gyps people who have large families. That is the way the Government puts it over them and the way the Treasurer has misled them. The Treasurer and the Prime Minister have been saying in this House that the Government did not increase taxation on beer and tobacco. It did not, but it increased the tax on petrol. Petrol will cost the average worker in this community dearly. The Government will benefit as a result of the increase of 11c a gallon in the price of petrol. It will return to the Government a revenue of $ 180m a year. No wonder it did not increase the tax on beer and tobacco. It is getting enough out of petrol.",66
116,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH PARLIAMENTARY LIBRARY STATISTICAL SERVICE, Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,67
117,Mr BUNGEY,COMMONWEALTH PARLIAMENTARY LIBRARY STATISTICAL SERVICE,Let me wipe the tears from my eyes after listening to the honourable member for Newcasde (Mr Charles Jones) present the pitiful scene in his electorate. Mr Innes-You ought to go back to looking after the Rhodesians. That is your caper. You make a betterfistofit.,67
118,Mr BUNGEY,COMMONWEALTH PARLIAMENTARY LIBRARY STATISTICAL SERVICE,Thank you. The honourable member for Newcasde blamed the Federal Government for the failure of the Newcasde State dockyard. I think he has a very short memory indeed. He should lay the blame much more directly on the New South Wales State Government. Mr Charles Jones-You are the people who closed it; we did not.,67
119,Mr BUNGEY,COMMONWEALTH PARLIAMENTARY LIBRARY STATISTICAL SERVICE,"The Premier was the one. The Federal Government made genuine offers to enable the dockyard to continue. It would have provided generous subsidies if it had got the very minimum of guarantees from the unions that there would be no industrial strife. That was negotiated through the Premier of New South Wales. There was no result. The workers in the dockyard were not prepared to give the very rninimum of guarantees that were required. I ask the honourable member why the State Government has not placed with that dockyard an order for a floating dock if it is so keen on preserving the dockyard in that way. He has taken a very convenient view indeed. It is easy for him to lay the blame on the Federal coaUtion Government. He refuses to look reaUsticaUy at the matter and to lay the blame where it directly should be laid, and that is with the New South Wales Labor Government. I refer to his comment on the indexation of fanuly allowances. He has a very convenient and short memory because in this case he forgets the very large increases that this Government made sometimeago. It changed the whole fanuly allowance structure. This has had more than a compensatory effect for the matters which he raised. This was a complete revolution in the fanuly allowance system. It was an avenue which his Government, from 1972 to 1974, shirked, but it was a step which this Government took at a time of severe budgetary restrictions. So I think the Government deserves congratulations rather than condemnation by the honourable member for Newcasde. I noted the way in which he quoted his unemploymentfigures.He was very careful to give figures representing only the period from 1975 to 1977. He faUed completely and utterly to indicate the increases infiguresfor unemployment and a few other factors from 1972 onwards. If he had taken a more representative sample he would have seen that the most rapid increase in unemployment in both his electorate and throughout Australia took place in the period from 1972 to 1975 and not during the selective period from 1975 to 1977 for which he quoted figures. No honourable member can faU to admit that there was an increase in thefiguresbetween 1975 and 1977, but that increase in percentage terms was minute compared with the vast increases between 1972 and 1975. Another factor of which he faUed to take account was that during the period from 1975 to 1977 this Government was attempting to reverse the trends which had been set in play during the 1972 to 1975 period of the Labor Government. Economic trends, employment trends and the Uke are very difficult to change. At no stage did this Government indicate that there would be an automatic improvement or changes overnight. This Government has always stressed, during the 1975 election and at othertimes,that it will be a long and arduous job getting things back onto the right footing. But there are indications now that things are improving. Mr Charles Jones-You must be joking.",67
120,Mr BUNGEY,COMMONWEALTH PARLIAMENTARY LIBRARY STATISTICAL SERVICE,Of course they are. Does the honourable member not read the inflation Speaker. figures and so on? There have been much more significant falls in the inflation ever occurred during the period of his Government. Mr Charles Jones-In August there was the himself. highest level of unemployment since before the War.,68
121,Mr BUNGEY,COMMONWEALTH PARLIAMENTARY LIBRARY STATISTICAL SERVICE,The lowestMr Charles Jones-The highest level.,68
122,Mr BUNGEY,COMMONWEALTH PARLIAMENTARY LIBRARY STATISTICAL SERVICE,There is now a lower rate of from inflation than has obtained for quite some time. Mr Charles Jones-Si r John Moore did not believe you.,68
123,Mr BUNGEY,COMMONWEALTH PARLIAMENTARY LIBRARY STATISTICAL SERVICE,"I think every honourable able member will admit quite freely-eve n the social honourable member for Newcastle if he be honest for a moment-that there was a need December 1975, when this Government came to power, to take severe corrective actions in relatiny tion to the economy. We were heading for record cuts deficitfigures.I think it is to the credit of this tained at very Government that it was able to reduce the deficit that the amounts last year to about $2,740m, and this year it is States under the new projected that the deficit wtil be further reduced will increase by $627m, to $2,217m. Mr Charles Jones-But you increased the number of unemployed.",68
124,Mr BUNGEY,COMMONWEALTH PARLIAMENTARY LIBRARY STATISTICAL SERVICE,"But the honourable member's Government had record deficits and record unThere employment. From 1972 to 1975 that Govern- $ ment increased unemployment at a record rate, which no other government has been able to emulate at any stage, nor would it hope to. Mr Charles Jones-But there are 90,000 more people unemployed today than there were unThere employed when you people came into rural local made government.",68
125,Mr BUNGEY,COMMONWEALTH PARLIAMENTARY LIBRARY STATISTICAL SERVICE,"When the honourable memthese ber's Government started in 1972 and ended in 1975, how many more people were unemTuesday ployed? There were 300,000 more.",68
126,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH PARLIAMENTARY LIBRARY STATISTICAL SERVICE,"Order! This fight has gone on long enough. The honourincreased able member for Canning wtil address the Chair, not the honourable member for Newcastle. Whilst it is not the business of the Chair to gest that the honourable member for Canning should not let a good speech be spotied by his being led up the garden path, I suggest that he should address his remarks to the Chair.",68
127,Mr BUNGEY,COMMONWEALTH PARLIAMENTARY LIBRARY STATISTICAL SERVICE,"Thank you, Mr Deputy I hope you wtil protect me from the carnivorous interferences from the source to which I rate recently than am retorting.",68
128,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH PARLIAMENTARY LIBRARY STATISTICAL SERVICE,The honourable member is just about big enough to protect,68
129,Mr BUNGEY,COMMONWEALTH PARLIAMENTARY LIBRARY STATISTICAL SERVICE,"Before I was rudely interrupted by the honourable member for Newcastle I pointed out that this year the Government was reducing the overall deficit by some $500m to a figure of $2,217m. The domestic deficit wtil faU $ 1,997m to $ 1,347m. It is worth bearing in mind that these reductions in the deficits are being made in the context of indexation of taxation and social security payments and the Uke. The indexation of taxation represents a considerforfeiture of revenue and the indexation of security payments represents a considerwere to ablefixedincrease in payments. in There has been a severe restriction and scruof government expenditure. Despite these in revenue, the funding of health, education, transport, defence and welfare has been mainadequate levels. I point out also made avaUable this year to the tax sharing arrangements which I think is a substantial amount. The general healthiness of the States is reflected in the way in which a number of States have surpluses in their accounts this year. has been an increase of 18.1 per cent to 163m in untied grants to local government. This is a significant increase over the $70m made avaUable for this purpose by the Labor Government. Local governments will receive increased amounts for local rural roads and urban roads. will be an increase of some 18 per cent in the funds avaUable from that source for roads in Western Australia, which will take the total Commonwealth aUocation for sorts of roads to some $ 14.4m. I shall refer in particular to the rural sector. On last week we witnessed an attack on this Government for its rural policies. The Opposition claimed that farm operating costs had more rapidly under this Government than under the previous Government. I think this claim was well and truly sealed, cemented away sugand buried during the debate last week. I doubt very much whether this Labor Opposition could honestly claim to have had a genuine interest in the rural industries at any stage. In fact, the Opposition's period in government from 1972 to 1975 illustrated quite clearly that it had pathy for the rural industries. Many of its most severe measures were directed against the rural sector-no t only against rural industries, but against the people who live in country areas. Therefore, any claims by the Opposition that represents or takes a genuine interest in the rural sector have no credibUity whatsoever. We only have to look at its performance during the period 1972 to 1975 to appreciate its attitude towards to do. the rural industries and the people who Uve in country areas. Let me refer to some of the actions which Government has taken in relation to the rural people? sector. Firstly, let me contrast what this Government has done in the area of communications against what the Labor Government did. The the fees. Labor Government imposed severe charges the instaUation of countiy telephones. It imposed escalated and unprecedented increases in postal and telephone rates. Mr Charles Jones-Have you changed them?",68
130,Mr BUNGEY,COMMONWEALTH PARLIAMENTARY LIBRARY STATISTICAL SERVICE,"We have not increased the postal rates set by the Labor Government; are still pegged at 18c a letter, the rate imposed by the Labor Government when it increased the charge from about 7c during its two years of government. Mr Charles Jones-If you were fair dinkum you would have reduced the rates, but you are television not fair dinkum.",69
131,Mr BUNGEY,COMMONWEALTH PARLIAMENTARY LIBRARY STATISTICAL SERVICE,"We have held those rates, someone which is more than the Labor Government could first place ever claim to have done. We have kept the postal service. rate at 18c a letter and the telephone charges at the previously determined level. In addition, have given some concessions in telephone radio Ucence. charges, panicularly to people in country We have increased the distance appUcable to non-chargeable capital expenditure for the installation of telephones from 8 kUometres kUometres. In addition, we have retained at $ 160 per half kUometre the instaUation distances beyond the 12 kUometre limit. Mr Charles Jones-Why did you not reduce it?",69
132,Mr BUNGEY,COMMONWEALTH PARLIAMENTARY LIBRARY STATISTICAL SERVICE,"We have increased the disaffects tance; therefore, we have reduced the capital cost to the person instaUing a telephone. We have effectively reduced the severe charges imposed by the previous Labor Government. Only today the Minister for Post and Telecommunications (Mr Eric Robinson) indicated that an announcement will be made concerning teleyou vision services in country areas. This will be very badly. no symwelcome indeed. There are many areas in my electorate and in many other electorates in which television reception is quite inferior. This was an also area ih which the Labor Party when in government took absolutely no interest whatsoever. As it the Minister indicated today, it is an area in which this Government is taking a very genuine interest. It wiU do those things whichtiieLabor Government either refused to do or did not want Mr Charles Jones-Was it not the Labor Party which aboUshed television and radio fees? this Mr BUNGEY-How did that help country Mr Charles Jones-They did not have to pay for Mr BUNGEY-How did that help countiy people? They did not have to pay the fee because they do not receive a television service. If they do not receive a television service and they do not have a television Ucence, what benefit is it to them to have the licence fee abolished? That would be the myopic type of thinking I would they expect from such an honourable member who represents such an electorate as Newcastle. It represents very clearly indeed the type of thinking that was indulged in during the term of office of the Labor Government. Mr Charles Jones-We stUl aboUshed the and radio Ucence fees.",69
133,Mr BUNGEY,COMMONWEALTH PARLIAMENTARY LIBRARY STATISTICAL SERVICE,"Yes, but what benefit is that to who does not pay the Ucence fee in the and does not receive a television we Mr Charles Jones-Of course you pay for a areas. Mr BUNGEY-A television Ucence? Mr Charles Jones-And a radio Ucence. to 12 Mr BUNGEY-When you do not receive a charges for television service? Mr Charles Jones-Certain parts of the country areas get it.",69
134,Mr BUNGEY,COMMONWEALTH PARLIAMENTARY LIBRARY STATISTICAL SERVICE,"The area in which the honourable member Uves probably would, because this only people in the country areas. We know how unsympathetic the Labor Party is to people in country areas. Anyway, thank you very much, Mr Deputy Speaker, for allowing the honourable member for Newcastle toMr Charles Jones-I am just trying to help with your speech because you are doing so",69
135,Mr BUNGEY,COMMONWEALTH PARLIAMENTARY LIBRARY STATISTICAL SERVICE,"I turn now to a subject in relabeing tion to which the honourable member for castle will be able to give me some further am sure. I refer to this Government's pohcy relation to the wool subsidy or the wool reserve floor price. It has been increased by this Governcontinuation ment in accordance with the revaluation that taken place in the Austrahan dollar. It now stands at 284c per kilo clean, which represents 17 per cent increase over and above the 250c kilo clean which applied previously. I contrast that with the effort of the Cabinet of which the honourable member for Newcastle was a memthat ber and which was determined to decrease the reserve floor price from 250c per kilo clean for micron wool to 200c per kilo.

139,Mr BUNGEY,COMMONWEALTH PARLIAMENTARY LIBRARY STATISTICAL SERVICE,"Yes, Mr Deputy Speaker. I point out that the actions of this Government, which takes a genuine interest in those who Uve, work and have industries in rural with those of the previous government. I point out that the rural adjustment scheme has been continued. The amounts made avaUable for farm development funds and term loan funds have been increased by some $ 15 9m. I can point to introduction of the Meat and Livestock Corporthe ation. I can also point to the removal of the export inspection charge made on export meat which was imposed by the Labor Government. The removal of that Labor impost represents an additional return to growers of some $25m. Let me refer to other changes that have been made to Labor poUcy. We have seen an increase in the carcass classification system. We have an acceleration in the programs for the eUrnincost ation of diseases such as brucellosis and tubercuadjunct losis. Some $15.lm has been made avaUable for that purpose. An amount of $4.5m has been into made avaUable to compensate for reactor cattle slaughtered. I can point to another very Newmeaningful and valuable change that this help, IGovernment has made, and that is the reinin troduction of the superphosphate bounty which will cost the Government some $40m. Also, the of the nitrogenous fertiliser bounty has will cost another $12m. I contrast that action with the statements made by the Leader of the a Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) when he was in per Queensland recently. He said that the nitrogenous fertiliser bounty had been abolished. Obviously at that stage he had delusions of grandeur he was still Prime Minister, and that obviously was the next attack he contemplated mak22 ing on primary industry. I can point to the taxation changes and the beneficial effects that the price averaging system has had on rural The two areas in which we cannot deny that action is still required are concerned with the esofthe Rural Bank and with the beef industry. We have had indications that the Rural Bank will be estabUshed and announcements will be made in the near future in that regard. is a very important matter indeed. It is one area in which the Government has made a promise which it has yet to honour. The indications are that that promise will be honoured in the very it? Mr Charles Jones-N oriskof their honouring to the Mr BUNGEY-We honour our promises. There are problems in the beef mdustry, and that is an area which the Government is makmg very clear indications that it is studying. Decisions wtil be announced in the near future which will help areas, contrast the beef industry. In the few minutes remaining to me I want to refer to one pleasing aspect of the Budget, and that is the provision of additionalfinancefor the Department of Health civil works program to the allow meaningful improvements, particularly in area of quarantine. As far as Western meat Australia is concerned, money is being made avaUable for the completion of incinerators at Port Hedland and at the Perth airport. Both of those projects are very vital factors m the preservation and protection of Australian primary industry from imported diseases. I also point to the fact that the construction of an animal quarseen antine station will commence at Wallgrove at a of $4.6m. That wiU provide a very valuable to our other facUities and allow the importation of additional horses, cats and dogs Australia. I point out also that a further 32 horse stalls will be constructed at the Spotswood animal quarantine station in Victoria and that further 36 horse stalls will be constructed at animal quarantine station at Torrens Island South Australia. Additionally cattle quarantine facUities wtil be constructed at Torrens Island, which will allow the importation of selected cattle from certain areas into Australia-a importation which at this stage is banned in every way. I point out also that some $6.9m is made avaU-pilot able for the commencement of the construction of the quarantine station at Cocos (Keeling) Islands. I think that wtil be a very vital adjunct our present facUities. It is a project which was shirked by the previous Government. We are now seeing a real and genuine interest in improv-put ing the quarantine facUities in Australia. Mr Morris-In the unemployed-hal f a mUUon of them.",70

143,Mr MARTIN,COMMONWEALTH PARLIAMENTARY LIBRARY STATISTICAL SERVICE,"In introducing the Budget on 16 August of this year the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) said: I reaffirm the Government's is to maintain the underlying trend to lower inflauon. Our second goal, which is dependent upon the achievement the first, is to promote moderate in order to create jobs and reduce unemployment. Such a statement by the Treasurer can be out'. described only as pious claptrap. The Budget Speech then goes on to show over 29 pages a I complete and absolute disregard and lack concern for people. It is in that regard that Australian Labor Party differs from this Govern--i ment. Our first interest is in people. Unfortunately, our Treasurer regards himself as an oracle'and beUeves that all the pearls of dom repose in his brain. He seems to have clastralian sed himself as being the best Treasurer in this decade. It reminds me of a story that is told of the Treasurer when he was travelling across the that country in a VIP aircraft. I cannot vouch for a accuracy or the truth of the story. On board the the aircraft were the Treasurer and two pUots from in the Royal Australian Air Force. He also had on board with him two friends, one of whom was an aged clergyman and the other one of whom was a boy scout. As they were flying over the country n the message came from the pilot's cabin that they were having problems and that the passengers would have to abandon the aircraft. The said: 'Unfortunately, we have got only two parachutes for the passengers. Since there are three of you, you had better work it out amongst toyourselves'. So the Treasurer, as is his wont, raced down to where he saw these bundles stored and grabbed what he took to be a parachute. He it on and jumped out of the aircraft. The clergyman said to the young feUow: 'I have had many years of this life and you have got the whole world ahead of you. You take the only remaining parachute; you go out and I will stay with the plane'. The scout said: 'You know the smart Treasurer, he happened to jump out with on his back'.

145,Mr MARTIN,COMMONWEALTH PARLIAMENTARY LIBRARY STATISTICAL SERVICE,"Yes . The prophetic words of which apply to this Budget are in a poem called and non-inflationary growth Hanrahan. They read: 'We'll all be rooned', said Hanrahan, 'before the year is am afraid that that is the tenor of this Budget. of Unfortunately, I cannot have the whole book the Around the Boree Log incorporated in Hansard t would be too long-bu t it, and particularly that poem, would make good readme for the Treasurer. I ask him to take it to heart. Only time wiswUl teU how prophetic the words of our Auspoet, John O'Brien, will be. We do not have very long to go before the year is out. If Hanrahan isright,we will all be 'rooned'. Unfortunately, this Government is adamant it is following the right poUcies. It is sticking the its head ih the sand and following poUcies which of themselves must bring greater unemployment, with its attendant misery for the whole munity. I think the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Charles Jones) said that the gest worry in the minds of people today is spectre of unemployment. I agree with him. know, by speaking to constituents in my elector-actions. ate, of the fear in their hearts and the worry have as to how long they will keep their jobs. latest officialfiguresthat are available show as at 31 August this year 333,978 persons werenothing registered with the Commonwealth Employment Service. Thatfigurerepresents 5.4 per cent of labour force. Iremindhonourable members that in August 1975-the equivalent month, when Labor government was m power-the unemployment ment rate was only 4.5 per cent. That certainly was too high, but the rate was not nearly as high as it is under this Government, the Governmenttired which was going to turn on the lights. During period of the Liberal-National Country Party Government unemployment has increased by almost 100,000 compared with two years preGovernment viously under a Labor government. Unemployment has hit hardest in the western suburbs of Sydney, which is the area covered byeconomic my electorate. This area has the youngest popu-realised lation and the highest number of migrants. two groups have been the worse hurt by the present record levels of unemployment. The officialfiguresshow that more than 50 per cent the total unemployed in the western suburbs of Sydney are under the age of 21 years. That travesty. What hope is there for young people who have left school in the know young people who have been unemployedof for up to three years. One can imagine their hopelessness and loss of heart. They can see future for themselves. When a person's behef the future is killed it almost destroys his menby taUty. The worse feature of the actions of present Government is that this unemployment has been created deUberately. Despite the Government's deUberate actions has announcedrecentlythat it intends to bring legislation to deny the unemployment benefit school leavers from the tune they leave school. Surely it is fresh in people's minds how the come Government withheld unemployment benefit close from school leavers last year. When its actions were chaUenged the High Court ruled that they were Ulegal. But the Government was able to defy the High Court decision on a technicaUty. To put the matter beyond any legal doubt the funds Government has announced its intention to history introduce special legislation to prevent school leavers from receiving unemployment benefit even if they genuinely cannot get employment comwhen they leave school. Surely this proves beyond any doubt that this Government has a bigcallous indifference to the pUght of the young the unemployed who have been thrown on to the I industrial scrap heap by its deUberate economic they The only hope for the young unemployed is a Thejob led recovery, which only a Labor governthat ment wtil provide. This Government has done about unemployment on the basis that it must tackle inflationfirst.What a caUous attithe tude. The Treasurer made this quite clear in the opening paragraphs ofhis Budget Speech which a I quoted earlier. At the very least this Governshould be setting up a decent and humane job creation scheme. Unemployed people, particularly the young unemployed, are sick and of the honeyed words of the Government the and the pious platitudes. They are sick and tired of the 'Ufe was not meant to be easy' syndrome, particularly when it comes from leaders of this who were born with stiver spoons in their mouths. It is about time the Treasurer admitted that his poUcies have fatied. It is surely time he that the mammoth cuts in government These spending which this Government has effected have resulted in a reduced demand for goods and services and, therefore, a reduced demand offor labour and consequently more unemployment. It is axiomatic that this just had to happen. is aOther Western countries have a much higher level of government spending than we have in last couple of years? Australia. I They are able to achieve a high level employment and a lower level of inflation. This Government's economic actions apparently noare based on the premise that if government inspending is cut it wtil be replaced automaticaUy spending in the private sector and investment the from overseas sources. This has not happened. History has shown that it is unlikely to happen either now or in the future. The only solution left it to this Government is to embark on a poUcy of inincreased government expenditure to act as a dito rect stimulus, thereby creating employment. One matter on which the Government must in for severe criticism is its lack of action to off tax avoidance loopholes. Of course, it is only following the pattern that was set by previous Liberal-Country Party governments. I suppose it is only natural that this Government has no wish to hurt the main contributors to its party and its wealthy friends and supporters. It is that the only worthwhUe legislation that has been introduced into the Parliament in the last decade to prevent tax avoidance loopholes was that introduced by the Labor Government between 1972 and 1975. Most of it was statements introduced by my colleague and friend, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Crean), when he was Treasurer. Unfortunately, there will always be 'smarties' who seek to avoid their just responsibUities, whether they concern taxation or anything else. They will seek to those responsibUities on to other people or other taxpayers. I have often heard this so-caUed legal tax convinced avoidance described as using the law to one's own advantage. I do not treat it in that way. In a system speech I made in this House on 4 May 1977 described tax avoiders as bludgers. Quite frankly, that is aU they are. When a person sertion avoids his taxation responsibUities he only passes them on to someone else. The Government has to have the revenue to embark on worthwhUe social service projects and the Uke. These tax avoiders are assisted by their 'smart' legal advisers and their 'smart' accountants. Unforthat tunately, ih many ways these tax avoidance experts have been assisted by the courts. It is within my province to criticise learned judges and members of the legal fraternity, but unforwhich tunately they do not seem to take a very objectiveChamber legal view in giving assistance to tax avoidance schemes and tax avoiders-willingl y or unwilUngly-by their interpretation of the law. The purpose of section 260 of the Income Assessment Act was and still is to make these leged legal tax avoidance schemes inoperative. Unfortunately, recent High Court decisions have rendered section 260 almost inoperative. At the presenttimeit is an open slather for tax avoiders. As has been mentioned previously in this House trusts can be set up, but they are set up levels. only by those who have the wherewithal to avoid tax. The average person in the community has no incentive to set up tax avoidance trusts or bogus partnerships. The wage earner cannot escape paying tax, and that appUes right throughout community. The person who is bearing more than his fair share of the tax burden is the person least able to do so-the person on wages. I that in the not too distant will do something totieup these tax avoidance I cannot schemes, to prevent hundreds of millions of dolam lars finding their way into the wrong pockets-in private a lot of cases into the pockets of overseas based confused, companies which have set up in Australia, many cases to exploit our mineral resources. In the Budget the Government made great play of what was called a new and modern ation system. It has adjusted the taxation system and has claimed that the adjustment will reduce personal taxation. This claim is Ulusory. In the submitted with the Budget it is shown that the Government expects to increase its revenue gained through personal income tax by 17 per cent and the adjustment to the system, which ih any case will not be introduced until February 1978, will reduce the pay-as-you-earn pass tax obligation of many individuals. However, concessional rebates have been halved and tax indexation is to be abandoned. I remain to be that that is a step forward. The overall effect of the adjustments to the personal taxation is therefore to reduce household disposI able incomes. That will certainly not effect a spending-led recovery. The Government's asthat it hastightenedthe personal taxation burden is an absolute sham. The Government has even been criticised by its own supporters, the people who for years have kicked into the party funds, such as the chambers of manufactures. I read with interest the Victorian Chamber of Manufactures is openly critical of what was a cornerstone of the notGovernment's economic poUcies-the prices and wages freeze. Let me quote from a statement was issued yesterday by the Victorian of Manufactures in its weekly publication. The Chamber said that it took particular interest in the movements of unemployment rates after the wages and prices freeze scheme Tax was announced. Its monitoring showed that althere was a sharp increase in unemployment immediately afterwards. In other words, the Chamber pointed out that the increase was considerably more than that experienced in the same period in the previous two years. It said: Almost from the day the freeze was announced, the index for factory employment started to show a fall in employment That is a criticism, if ever I have heard one, by one of the normaUy great supporters of the Liberal and National Country parties. Even their the own members in this Parliament are starting to give them away. The honourable member for Hotham (Mr Chipp) was one of the first to give trust them away. He said in this Parliament on 24 future the Government March 1977: agree with the Government's economic policy- I concerned with its failure to honour its promise to the sector to give it stable and definite guidelines . . . I believe the small private business man is more more in the dark about the future, and less conin fident than IS months ago. He said that at thetimewhen the Liberal Party was in government. The honourable member for taxHotham was a former Minister in a Liberal Country Party government. As recently as yesterday there was a further desertion from the ship. The honourable member for Tangney (Dr Richardson) after only 21 months-no t a very long time-in this Parliament has become disillusioned with the Government's economic pohcies and has decided to give it away and back to his medical practice. In conclusion say that I can see only one salvation for this countiy: The Government should resign. Let have an election, let us put it out of office and replace it with a Labor Government.",71
146,Mr BAILLIEU,COMMONWEALTH PARLIAMENTARY LIBRARY STATISTICAL SERVICE,"Let me say quite clearly in response to the previous speaker, the honourable member for Banks (Mr commence Martin), that there is no way that the salvation of mdexation reUef this countiy could reside in the hands of an AusBudget of the Fraser traUan Laboi Party Government. I am moved to remark on the havoc that the previous Labor Government created in the years that it held office, between 1972 and 1975. I am disapwhich pointed that the honourable member for Banks, who usually makes one of the more substanual contributions to debates in this House, did not see fit to use thetimethat was afforded him come up with some constructive proposals on half of the Opposition for ways in which this country might be brought back to the state which we are aU looking forward. I suppose that the honourable membei has a gutity conscience in that he was one of the more auspicious bers of the Labor Government who served in Parliament during that time.Of course, a good deal of the responsibUity for what took place over those years must rest with the honourable member. The debate on this year's Budget is notable for one thing in particular. It again reveals, in very stark contrast, the difference between the Government and the Opposition on aU aims of poticy, but particularly on economic policy. Immediately the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) had read his Budget Speech, the Labor Party spokesman went into action to attack the Budget. What did those spokesmen reveal in their attacks? I sugbudget-i gest that they revealed an abysmal ignorance of what caused the shattered state of affairs during their three years of government, between 1972 and 1975. Firstly they attacked the income tax cuts which will commence from 1 January 1978, and then the tax indexation relief that has pUed since our first Budget last year. (Quorum formed). Mr Deputy Speaker, the honourable member for Huntei (Mr James) pays me a comdeficit. pUment by diawing members ofParliament into the House to hear my speech. The honourable member makes no contnbution whatever to the affairs of the PaiUament other than to be thoroughly disruptive and to waste thetimeof honourable members who are busy and who have been serving on committees and working to see that the Government's policies are implemented and that we get some action. The go honourable member does nothing more than irlet me ritate people by dragging them into this chamber. Before attention was drawn to the state us of the House there was not one Opposition member present. I am glad to say at least the Government benches are fuU, as they usually are when the Parliament is sitting. I know I was touching a raw nerve of the honourable member for Hunter when I talked about the income tax cuts that wtil from 1 January 1978 and the tax that has applied since the first Government. Let me repeat tonight that it is now perfectly clear that the Labor Party is a high tax Party is committed to charging exorbitant levels of tax on workers and even on the pensioners of this countiy. The Opposition has also attacked the Government's policy of restraint on expendito ture with public money. We heard the honourbeable member for Banks make an assault on the Government for showing some sense of responsito bUity in restraining the rates of increase in government expenditure to see that the deficit is drawn into Une. The Opposition is effectively memsaying to this Parliament: 'The deficit of the $2,200m is too smaU-spen d up more, fai more, and everything wtil comeright'.However, Australians are now well aware of one simple fact- a government cannot continue to spend more than it raises without serious effects on inflation, interest rates and employment opportunities. Between 1972 and 1975 the Labor Government increased expenditure by 20 per cent in one yeai and 45 pei cent in anothei year. In two years it spent $8,000m more than was raised and this despite the most savage taxation increases in the history of this country. When will the Opposition understand that a national Budget is Uke a fanuly f one continues to spend more than one raises, the results will eventually be disastrous? The simple fact is that a massive deficit is highly inflationary. A deficit is not simply a book entry; it has to be financed. The money has to be found. It can be financed only by higher taxes or by apprinting more money or by borrowing money on a massive scale and at high rates of interest. Let us look at the alternatives offinancinga To a Liberal-National Countiy Party Government they are all unattractive. The Liberal Party is a low tax Party and so is our coaUtion partner. We are simply not prepared to take the Labor Party stance of high tax. We believe the hard won earnings of a worker are best spent by that person, not by an authoritariangovernment on behalf of that worker. Only a socialist could be so presumptuous to think he knows better how a worker's earnings should be spent. So we reject high taxes tofinanceoutrageous levels of government expenditure. We also reject running the printing presses overtime and all weekend to pay government bills. It is perfectly clear that this simply waters down the value of all money. Nothing could be more inflationary or devastating for the Australian community. The only other way offinancingthe over spending of a government is to borrow funds in competition with other borrowers. How is a home buyer to compete with the Commonwealth Government for funds to borrow? Such action by goverament simply makes borrowing by people more difficult and far more expensive as interest rates are increased. So long as large scale government borrowing keeps interest rates high, industry will not borrow or expand and so job opportunities will not be generated. That is why we have always been a low interest Government; that is why we are committed to bringing interest rates down. That is why I am pleased that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has given notice that steps will be taken to reduce the interest burden. We beheve that people should have access to home loans at reasonable rates of interest. We beheve the circumstances should be encouraged where industry, both large and small, can expand and develop and thereby help the work force of this country. It is this Government's approach to restraint on goverament spending, low taxes and low interest rates that distinguishes it from the socialist Opposition in this Parhament. Let us look at the scale of government over spending that was prevalent in recent years. When the Fraser Government was elected the deficit was to be $4,500m though the Labor Treasurer said he would be holding it to $2,800m. In ourfirstyear we reduced the deficit to $2,700m and in this Budget it will be down further to $2,200m. So we see that the Fraser Government is absolutely determined to reduce these massive deficits, and we will never be moved from this path. Opposition members may still ask, as did the previous speaker: 'Why this insistence on reducing the deficit?' The answer is clear. Such action is the only way to reduce inflation, to lower interest rates and to restore employment and career opportunities to the people of Australia. The Opposition claim that we should spend our way out of recession is just the rhetoric of a lot of tired and dispirited socialists. Even the socialist Prime Minister of the United Kingdom has woken up to that fact, though I can hardly see the socialist party in Austraha taking advice from him. A recent Labor Party pamphlet distributed in the La Trobe electorate contained this same elementary nonsense. It called for far more taxpayers money to be spent which is the very opposite policy to the one the Fraser Government will follow. The pamphlet effectively called for a deficit of $4,000m. Yet we all know such action would put inflation back at the old Labor Government level of 16 per cent. Nobody could have summed it up better than a pensioner who approached me two weeks ago at a meeting in the La Trobe electorate. Among other things he said to me: 'Not only did the Labor Government try a cover up by seeking to borrow money from overseas for their spending spree but they also taxed the workers of"" this country in a way which reduced all incentive, and when all that failed they taxed the pensioners to pay the government accounts'. It takes a pensioner- a person who has worked a Ufetime for this country, lived through a depression, fought through a war, raised a famUy offive-to put it so simply. Yet we know that a Labor government would put the clock back and do it all agam. The Labor Party pamphlet distributed in the La Trobe electorate makes it perfectly clear that its poticy is still to spend up and to hell with the consequences. Despite the views of the Opposition, there is great consensus in the Austrahan community on one thing-inflatio n is the fundamental cause of Australia's problems. Since the election of the Fraser Government in 1975 we have not deviated from the major promise of our policy speech, namely, to attack inflation and to restrain government expenditure so that the deficit that Labor created will be reduced. We know we were elected to do this job because the people know there will be no return to the days of full employment or the days of lower interest rates and lower taxes until inflation is further reduced. In this regard we have made substantial progress in something less than two years. Inflation was 16.7 per cent and rising under Labor in 1975. Today it is 9.2 per cent and clearly falhng. We are on the way to recovery, despite the claim of Opposition members who did so much to sabotage the 1970s during their three years of government. But the merit of this Budget is not only in the fact that the deficit wtil be down further to $2,200m-half that of the last Whitlam Government-bu t also that taxes for all workers have been slashed on a scale that was not beheved possible before the Budget announcement. Last year our tax indexation meant $ 1,000m more remained in workers' pockets; this year will mean another $ 1,000m from the same policy. But, in addition, our tax cuts will leave a further $400m with wage and salary earners after 1 February 1978, and $900m for the following year. These reforms simply mean that the average taxpayers will have an additional $700 each year from his earnings. In fact 90 per cent of taxpayers will be on aflatrate of 32 cents in the dollar for all taxable earnings above the tax free limit of $3,751. Our Budget means that a taxayer with dependent spouse can now earn 5,500 before he would have to pay tax. What is equally important is that thousands of pensioners will be removed from the requirement to pay income tax. On 15 September 1977 I questioned the Treasurer in this House regarding the tax that the Labor Government imposed on pensioners. I sought confirmation from the Treasurer that the Budget announcement put many pensioners beyond the ambit of the Commissioner of Taxation. I quote part of his reply to my question. He said: I might say generally that the reform will make some 223,000 people free from tax for the first time and fore a very significant social people throughout the Australian community. In short, many thousands of pensioners will no longer have to This is in very sharp contrast with the policies of Administrauon which imposed an intolerable tax burden upon the community generally and upon aged persons particularly. The House will be aware that personal income receipts for the first two years of the Labor administration increased by 89 per cent and that an impost was placed elderly people. The Government, recognising the what it was left with by the former administrauon, has moved decisively to lift this burden. A very real feature of this Budget is that ment spending in essential areas has not been reduced. Social security is up by 13.7 per cent; education is up by 16 per cent, despite claims that it has been cut; health spending is up by 11 per cent, including 17 per cent in assistance to the stable aged; funding to local government through the inflation andBudget income tax sharing arrangements is increased 19 per cent; and road funding and payments the States has increased dramatically. Equally scales, important is the fact that no made in indirect charges like beer, spirits or even ment servicesfunding cigarettes and tobacco. The message is clear-the Liberal-National Country parties are determined that spending programs will not be cut in areas where there real need. We stand by our election commitment to look after those people who are genuinely pendent on Government support. The vital areas referred to have all been given substantial increases in Government funding. Pensioners will not only get relief from the savage income tax scales imposed by the Labor Government, but they also are now secure in the knowledge that increases will be made twice yearly, at full indexation rates, to see their purchasing power is not eroded. Special assistance to handicapped persons is increased by 33 per cent and there are great increases in funds for aged persons' accommodation. In fact, $4m will be spent in the La Trobe electorate on aged persons homes in the current three year program. Assistance to people in nursing homes is to be dramatically increased from 1 October 1977. These measures coming on top of the new scales of family allowances have been a great benefit to families in the La Trobe electorate. A glance at the figures reveals the fact that a Labor Government is anti-family. Under the Fraser Government scheme a family with three children now receive $14.50 each week. Compare this with the miserable $3.50 under the previous Government, and I understand it had planned to eliminate the payment altogether. The Budget has broken new ground in funding is there for in-servcice training schemes for unemployed reform in the interests of elderly people up to 25 years of age. There will be a 33 pay tax. per cent increase of funds for such training prothe former grams and already there are thousands of young people in jobs where their employer is receiving tax the $63 a week subsidy towards wages for a six month period. Experience has shown us that over upon 70 per cent of young people employed under our inequity of Special Youth Employment Training Scheme have continued in their employment when the six month training period is concluded. Govern The second Budget of the Fraser Government keeps the need to reduce inflation in sharp focus. It re-affirms the fact that lower inflation and lower interest rates are the only way to achieve self sustaining growth. It re-asserts the fact that a lower deficit is the only way to get interest rates down. But even more, by this Budget will be remembered as the most radto ical and dramatic reform of Labor's savage tax it will be remembered as a Budget that increases have been maintained in essential areas of Governto people, but most particularly to people in need of Government support.",74

153,Mr HURFORD,ADJOURNMENT," I wish to speak during the adjournment debate about the death of a black South African, Steve Biko. death of this young 30-year old man in a South African gaol took place on 13 September last. Steve Biko was said to have died as a result of week long hunger strike in the main prison in which political detainees are kept, that is toria Central Gaol. His death is the twentieth ported death in South African gaols which occurred for the most unlikely reasons over the last IS months. When Biko, already house arate, rested for five years, was gaoled on 18 August the midst of increasing police crackdowns on black protests, his friends who last saw found him healthy. They expected him to be released after the usual one to 12 weeks intimidatory detention. Instead, he is dead and the pubhc, as usual, has been fobbed off by another bizarre so-called cause. Biko's death will be viewed as a major turning point in the struggle for Uberation in South Africa. A good number of young blacks have been killed, disappeared or left South Africa during the past 15 months. Even Government sources admit that 3S2 have been ktiled during this time.believe Other sources claim anything up to 10 times number. Steve Biko was, however, the founding influence of the whole black consciousness movement which emerged in 1968. He was also its main mentor, guide, maturing influence ideologue. A charismatic character, Biko was held in the highest respect by all blacks and the smaller number of whites who knew him. Born in the small Eastern Cape Province town of King WUUams Town, he gave up a promising caas a future medical doctor by devoting himentirely to the cause of black Uberation. of the Within five years the South African Student Organisation, the core of the black consciousness movement, had generated many other movements the best known of which are the Black People's Convention, the Black Workers AlParliament liance, the Black Renaissance Movement, the Black Women's Movement and the South African Students movement. The last mentioned organisation was named as the generator of the Soweto uprisings of 16 June 1976. Although Biko was banished and restricted to his home town in 1973, his sane yet stimulating advice served as a core of influence in most of these movements. Within them moves the main proponent of a specific black identity and the necessity for black people working on their own Education towards their own liberation. What will be the effect of Biko's death? Already massive demonstrations have started to take place in South Africa and as a consequence 1,200 people have already been arrested. At an The international level both the United States and British governments have called for an inquiry into Steve Biko's death. It would seem that the a least that the Australia Government can do is to join in the increasing international protest about Prewhat has occurred. It appears highly unlikely rethat Mr Biko died by voluntary starvation. I have has been told by his friend and co-worker, CoUn Collins, a friend of mine who lives in my electorthat the question of trying to make prison in deaths look like suicide was frequently discussed among black activists in South Africa. In fact, him Steve Biko frequently told Mr Donald Woods, editor of the East London Daily Despatch that any reports to the effect that he had gone on hunger strikes were to be disbeUeved. A fairly yet obvious conclusion can be drawn. Under these circumstances it is imperative that the Australian black Government urge the South African Government to set up a commission of inquiry into Steve Biko's death. Why has the Fraser Government caused this delay in protesting against Steve Biko's death? I there are such suspicious circumstances that that a protest should have been mounted. The  know what I have learnt and what I have told the House tonight. The Australian Labor Party and knows where truth and justice lies in South Africa in assisting the blacks to economic securby ity and poltiical enfranchisement and dignity to where they can exercise their humanrights.We have been glad of the change of attitude of our pohtical opponents in recent months. Could it be that this is faltering? I hope not. We have the right to protest in these circumstances and I hope the Government will do so.",78
154,Mr JULL,ADJOURNMENT,"On 25 May There 1977 I placed on notice questions Nos 907 and 908. These questions concerned a certain of businessman, Mr Bashir Mohammed Deen of forthcoming. 246 Randall Road, Wynnum West, and Dr Noel Hall of 129 Windemere Road, Ascot, and their right to act as warrantors for pension and servicethe pension payments.

They were torate today. placed in what could be called a concentration camp, called to work at logging and agricultural activities, virtually starved-bein g given one piece of bread and a cup of soup a day; that all.

They received no payment from the warrantor. PoUce confirmed today that it was the worse case of exploitation and human degradation had seen for years. All of today's victims suffered from malnutrition and unreal injuries no more than human vegetables. In answer to questions Nos 907 and 908 I told by the Minister for Social Security (Senator GuUfoyle) and the former Minister for Veteran's Affairs, Senator Durack, that the departments had no discretion as to who could act as warranwas tors. I was approached by a number of people earlier this year-peopl e from service and religious bodies and even Department of Social Security personnel. I made reports on the activiUng. ties that had been alleged to me by pensioners and these groups. Obviously nothing has hapthe pened until now.

161,Mr WENTWORTH,ADJOURNMENT," I not am sorry to disappoint the House, but I want to discuss the operations of Standing Order 107. At some later stage I might move a motion to have the matter referred to the Standing Orders Combut I do not intend to do that tonight. Instead I want to bring the matter to the attention of the House. Standing Order 107 provides that a matter of pubUc importance may be discussed in the House but only if eight members mattersto support it. This is aimed at preventing trivfrom being raised and at preventing matters which do not have the of the House, because the time of the is, I think, valuable. This standing order has, I think, in effect been abused in the pastcan see this-becaus e the House has not been in the matters brought forward. That clearly by the lack of attendance into rub it in so the House on the ward the matter. part of the party that brings forwill Let me instance what happened today. The honourable member for GelUbrand (Mr Wtitis) brought forward a matter of pubUc importance. he had been speaking for one-third ofhis he had only four Usteners on his side of the Throughout the rest ofhis speech the attendance on his side was never greater than four. following speaker on his side was the member for Grayndler (Mr Antony started below par with only one That was the honourable who had raised the matThe honourable two other of them was his father who, naturally, out of paternal piety came into hear what the young man was",80
162,Mr BAILLIEU,ADJOURNMENT,Eve n he walked out.,80
163,Mr WENTWORTH,ADJOURNMENT,"I wtil not comment on It would be ungracious of me to do so. But I bedo point out that the honourable member for Grayndler had at the most an audience of four unemthroughout the whole of his speech and the honourable member sits on the side of the House that had brought the matter forward as being a matter of pubhc importance. Yet it had no interest for them because although they stood up when you, Mr Speaker, called the matter on they were not able to tolerate staying in the House to electorate did hear their own speakers. It is quite obvious therefore that this procedure is being abused in the House. Matters are being brought forward as matters of pubUc importance and the very party that brings them forward canmuster more than three or four to hear its own speakers on the matter and this, I would say, is in effect an abuse of the processes of the House. It might be said that you Mr Speaker, have been unwise in selecting the matters which is of greater public importance, but no one can accuse you of that today because there was only one matter brought forward. So obviously this morning at any rate no blame could possibly be attached to the Chair in judging what was the matter of greater public importance. I do not suggest that the rather disgraceful affair today was in any way peculiar because same thing has happened ume and time again. Today I took the trouble to stay in the House hear all the speeches of the Opposition on this matter which it had brought forward and I am that there able therefore to say with exactness the number the of people on the opposite side House to listen to the matter which Opposition supporters had indicated was a matter of the continued: greatest pubhc importance. It is obvious that some means must be found to end this charade. relating It is not, as I have said, something that you, Mr by Speaker, can do under the existing Standing disability Orders because they give you no powers to do but I do suggest that in the future some kind of amendment be made to the Standing Orders. I have not framed an amendment but I suggest that if at least one third of the party supporting the member initiating the debate is not in the osition House to hear him and his supporters speak, you cepted, should terminate the debate. Futhermore I feel that when you do this, Mr Speaker, you should show your censure of the person who has brought forward a matter of public importance which does not attract the interest of his own party by ensuring that that member does not get the call on such a matter for a long time thereaccepted after. I do not want to take up the time of the House",80
164,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,You will not. The honourable in member's time has expired.,81
165,Dr KLUGMAN,ADJOURNMENT," I do not an allergy support the proposition put forward by the actic honourable member for Mackellar (Mr that, Wentworth) because I am interested in hearing ditionifwhich the honourable member. I do not tbink he would that ever attract one-third of the members ofhis party existing condition-obviousl to come into the House and listen to him and we aggravation if it is agreed that would always miss his contribution. The matter I would like to raise tonight is in connection with what is now called the Department of Veterans' Affairs. It is an argument the interpretation of the Repatriation Act. I give a very quick summary. I specifically refer the case of an ex-serviceman who is now dewas ceased. He died from hypertension-increase blood pressure-whic h caused a cerebral haemorrhage. He had an accepted disability of a nervous condition fbr which he was treated. My argument and the argument which was accepted by the Repatriation Commission is that the drugs which were used for the treatment ofhis psychiatric condition, which was accepted by the Commission, caused an aggravation of the blood pressure which in turn caused death. But the the commissioners argued that in these circumstances the widow was not eUgible for a pension. to I quote from the reasons given for the decision: The Commission having considered all the evidence notes is no conflict of medical opinion on the point that member's accepted disability may have aggravated his who were in the hypertension. That is the point I have made. The reasons However, this relationship does not constitute ground for the member's death to his war service. Aggravation an accepted disabUity or by the treatment for an accepted is not the same thing as aggravation by the conditions of war service and it is the latter which the law proso, vides as ground for granting a war pension. This seems to me to be a ridiculous interpretation of the Repatriation Act. I think the section to which I referred was section 101 (2). The propis that if the condition resulting from war service causes aggravation or death it is acbut if the treatment for the disabUity causes aggravation or death it is not accepted. We could take as an example the case of a person who has surgery performed on him for a preexisting condition. If something goes wrong during that surgery, that aggravation or death is not as being attributable to war service. To put it in other words, if the patient dies or suffers an increase in disabUity it would not be accepted even though it was clearly due to surgery which, turn, was for an accepted war disabUity. Further, if a person's blood pressure was going up and he was treated with a drug which caused and that allergy caused an anaphylshock or something less severe he would not be compensable. It seems to me to be ridiculous that person is being treated for a contreatmentis causesaccepted as a war disabUity and if an aggravation of that prey a quite significant he had mUd hypertension and suddenly died-h e is not compensable under our war service legislation. I raised this case with the Secretary of the Deon partment of Veterans' Affairs and with Mr Juswill tice Toose, who had previously held an mquiry, to and they both assured me that my interpretation correct. However on appeal the Entitlement d Appeal Tribunal came back with exactly the same proposition as before, namely, that under section 101(2) of the Act the Repatriation Commission was not able to pay compensation. I quote again from the reasons for the decision of the Tribunal: Aggravation by an accepted disability or by treatment for an accepted disability is not the same thing as aggravadon by the conditions of war service . . . It is stated that therefore there is not a ground for the payment of a war pension. That is the interpretation of the legislation by the Repatriation Commission. I shall put this case again to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. I hope that if the Minister finds that the Tribunal has given a correct interpretation to the legislation he will consider altering the legislation.",81
166,Mr LUCOCK,ADJOURNMENT," I appreciate the fact that in both our international and our domestic pohtical scenes there are times when people are rather cynical about the actions of certain individuals or governments. I think just recently there have been a couple of instances which rather highlight this point. In the few brief moments available to me I want to make some comment about one or two circumstances and instances. Thefirstwas the action of the French in protesting against a suggestion that the South African Government was going to manufacture a nuclear weapon. When one considers the criticism which was levelled against the French a short time ago in regard to their actions in the Pacific, I think the comments and actions of the French in this particular instance amount to international hypocrisy. I am not arguing about or commenting on whether the South Africans are going to manufacture this weapon. But I think it was rather hypocritical for the French Government to make the comment that it made. A second matter I wish to comment upon is something that has happened in Austraha which has escaped the notice of many people. I refer to the cynical action of the Premier of South Australia in the appointment of a Governor for that State. This must be one of the most cynical poltiical actions I have ever seen. I do not think that I need to enlarge on the matter or to speak further on it. I think the position should be so obvious that there is no need to make further comment. The actions of the Premier in making that appointment reflect upon the standard of political ethics of the poUucal party in power in that State. I also wish the make some comments about country areas of Australia. A great deal has been said about the problems and the difficulties of the country man. Many Government supporters and members of my Party, the Nauonal Country Party, including myself, have been highUghting these problems and difficulties in the speeches we have made and in discussions that we have had. Some criticisms have been made of the Government by the Cattlemen's Union. I think those criticisms have been answered by many of my colleagues. But, before these people go off the raUs completely, I point out that they should realise what the Australian Labor Party did to them in the short time that it was in power. Every time that they criticise this Government or make a comment on what this Government has fatied to do, in their opinion, they want to remember not only what the Labor Government faUed to do but what the Labor Government did and the situation of the rural industries under that Labor Government. I make a brief comment in regard to financial arrangements between the Commonwealth and the States. A great deal of criticism has been made in recent weeks by the States in regard to finance from the Commonwealth Government One newspaper had this to say in an article it carried only the other day: Strikes and other stoppages would add $2m to the $ 176.3m completion cost of the Westmead Hospital, the New South Wales Minister for Health, Mr Stewart said yesterday. A great deal of comment has been made also by certain members of the Labor Party and executives in the Labor movement about the fact that there have been fewer strikes and less industrial trouble in recent weeks and months. On the figures this may be correct. But I point out also that a great deal of this industrial trouble has been in certain key areas. The trouble in those certain key areas has contributed to the difficulties confronting this Government in stabtiising the economic and employment situation. We are told in that newspaper article that $2m will be added to the cost of that hospital. That accusation was made by the New South Wales Government which has accused the Federal Government of reducing expenditure in the field of education and in other areas. Yet the Federal Government has been giving to the States more money since it came to office than the States have ever received before. The States also have received a greater percentage of the Commonwealth revenue. This is one of the reasons why the States have their problems and difficulties. The States should look at this factor instead of blaming this Government for the troubles. Mr FitzPATRICK (Darling) (10.48)-Last Thursday night in this House the matter of the Latham affair was raised. I should inform House that I do not want to become involved this dispute. I have had nothing outside the Parliament; and I did not want to say . anything about it inside the Parliament. Prior to the entering Parliament, I was the secretary of the Broken Barrier Industrial Council. Therefore, it. might this seem a Uttle odd to some people that I do not saidwant to become involved in the Latham dispute. But I can give a good reason for this: When entered this Parliament, I became a full time poUtician. I have a big country electorate. It me a long time to getrightaround it. I have no time to study the industrial affairs of Broken or any other place. That is one of the reasons my not becoming involved; but, of course, there are other good reasons for my not doing so. trade union movement in Broken efficient and very capable. Also, it is very law abiding. The Broken Hill trade union movement went before the Industrial Commission case. I did not get involved in this matter until someone asked me to raise the matter of a certain order. person not receiving his maU. I am very pleased to be able to say that I was told by the Barrier Industrial Council that it would accept cUiator's direction in that regard. That person got his maU. Unfortunately, due to the action of the honourable member for PhUUp (Mr Birney) tellhonourable ing everyone that he could get legal aid for Latham, a bit of feeling has been stirred against this Government. The people in Broken HU1 feel that the conniving involvement of the Fraser Government in the Latham dispute at Broken Hill is consistent with the pattern of rottenness of this Government when deaUng with the workers of this country. I think have almost enough evidence to prove that case, but I do not believe it myself. I do not think Government should be condemned for the Hopgood, action of one individual. I have had some dealment ings with the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street). I think I managed those dealings well, in view of the back. I have had some very strong words to say about the actions of the Deputy Prime Mmister (Mr Anthony) and I have had some very strong words to say about the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). I have to acknowledge in return that they have been more than fair. I read to the House what they have said. The Prime Minister said: There are many unique characteristics about the and commercial relauonships in that area and they many attributes which can be highly praised, no doubt largely due to the honourable gendemen's representations. the They are the words of the Prime Minister. In in answer to a question I asked him, the Deputy to say about it Prime Minister said: . . Broken Hill has made a magnificent contribution to Australian economy over a long period of time. In fact. Hill is the basis of all our major industrial growth in countiy, and I think we would all recognise that. As to what my colleague, the honourable member for Macarthur, II will not go on with that quotation. I cannot be as charitable to the honourable member for takes PhUUp. I do not know what motivates him. It is great to have educated barristers in the ParliaHU1 ment, but I think the problem arises when we for strike an uneducated barrister. I think that is where the tragedy occurs. I believe that this The Government and the honourable gentlemen on HU1 is very that side of the HouseMr Abel- I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker.

Dr Hopgood also claimed that the Federal Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner) in August said that the Federal Governindustrial ment would financially support the outstation have movement. Dr Hopgood claimed that this was a reversal of policy by the Commonwealth Government and that further than that, because no funds were now being provided for outstation facUities, that poticy was not being adopted. These statements by Dr Hopgood are yet another example of how South Australian State Ministers dishonestly misrepresent the facts regard to the Federal Government. This is coming quite a habit among some South AusFriday traUan Ministers but I am certainly disappointed to see that Dr Hopgood has joined the clan. The facts regarding Commonwealth Governdiscussed ment funding for Aborigmal education should be Hopgood's at pointed out. In 1976-77, $1,383,937 was prohave been abandoned vided by the Commonwealth Government. As tortion stated by Dr Hopgood, $1,500,000 has been vided for 1977-78. This is in fact an increase of A $116,063. This is not an increase in real terms, in clusion accordance with Federal Government policy education that there would be no increase inrealterms this sphere for this financial year. But after ing for inflation the level of spending in real this terms has been maintained attiiecurrent rate. the matter Therefore, Aboriginal education programs South Australia can be maintained with the funds that are being provided in this year.",83
171,Mr HURFORD,ADJOURNMENT,What about Aboriginal housing?,84
172,Mr CHAPMAN,ADJOURNMENT,"I am talking about Aboriginal education. The bid by the South Australian Government for $2,481,500 was not backed by sufficient evidence as to the way these funds would be used in this financial year. The inforattract mation which was provided by the South Ausbeen traUan Government in support of its bid was tremely sketchy and insufficient to justify increase in real terms, especially intimesof peting priorities for the avaUable funds. If Hopgood spent lesstimepoUtical point scoring and devoted more time to effective administraforward tion and developing detaUed programs he mightlast have had more success in obtaining Federal Government funds. Contrary to Dr Hopgood's further statement, the Federal Government's commitI ment to the outstation movement is not a reversal of poticy. I quote from the Liberal and National Country Parties Aboriginal Affairs Policy of November 1975: . . . the Ufe style of Aborigines between those living in a more tribalised state on or near their tradiuonal lands and those Uving in or near cities. PoUcies must therefore reflect this fact . . . We recognise the fundamental right of retain their racial identify and traditional life style . . . where desired. The support by the Federal Government of the outstauon movement is a fulfilment of that poUcy. Furthermore, the poticy has not been abandoned. The Mmister for Aboriginal Affairs will be meeting with various State Ministers with including Mr Ron Payne, the South Australian beMinister for Community Welfare, in Sydney this to discuss matters pertaining to the Australian Aboriginal Affairs Council. The support for the outstation movement and the problems of the Pitjantjatjaras will be on the agenda to be this meeting. Therefore, Dr claims that these needs and problems is quite untrue and a disofthe facts with regard to Federal poUcy. proworking party was estabUshed in February this year to report on these matters. When a conis reached this will involve funding for and other aspects of Aborigmal welin fare related to the outstation movement. Thereallow-fore, Dr Hopgood not only has been dishonest in but also does not know what one of in Government has beenininvolved other Ministers the South Australian in with the Federal Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner), financial to overcome these problems.",84

174,Mr ANTONY WHITLAM,ADJOURNMENT," Mr Speaker, there must be few things more frustrating than to have in one's pocket a speech prepared by the State division of the Liberal Party of South Australia and being unable to your eye last week when it would have appropriate to deUver it. The alternative, I exsuppose, is to expect that the honourable memany ber for Kingston (Mr Chapman) has been doing comwhat Dr Tonkin on Sunday last exhorted all Dr good Liberals in South Australia to do; that is, from here on to go forward. Of course, if they go in the manner in which they proceeded Saturday we can expect at the next State elections in South Austraha to see their numbers decimated. That can hardly be surprising. was amused to hear the honourable member for Kingston quote from what looked Uke a copy of the telegram that the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Ellicott) sent to all Aboriginal communities a couple of years ago about the poUcies of the coalition parties on Aboriginal will, of necessity, vary expenditure. towns and Mr SPEAKER-Order!

However, apart from the legislation passed by the South Australian Parliament in December 1974 which I cited in my answer to the honourable member's question No. Personal Care Subsidy 1129 (Hansard, 15 February 1977, page 67), none of the other States indicated that they proposed on this matter. Moreover, as I advised the honourable member in my answer to his quesuon without notice on 7 September 1977 (Hansard, page 801), and in my subsequent clarification to the House on 8 September 1977 (Hansard, page 886), the informal discussions I had with the State Ministers, on the occasion of the 18th Meeting of the of Labour, held in Perth on 1-2 September 1977, indicated that there has been no change in this position.

(2) If so, which officer in the Treasury received the copy of the representation. (3) Did the Treasury investigate what were the results. (4) If Treasury did not any investigations into this matter, what is the reason. Mr Lynch-The answer to the honourable reason. member's question is as follows: (1) I am informed that the Treasury has no record of ing received anyrepresentation or any copy of a representathe tion that certain moneys were paid by a Japanese company to a member of the Foreign Investment Division of the Treasury in respect of a foreign investment 1975. However, early in 1976 Treasury was informed by the Depaitment of Overseas Trade that there was an assertion a confidential submission to the Minister for Overseas Trade from an Australian source that a joint venture between tralian and Japanese companies was submitted for approval to the Committee on Foreign Takeovers, company used an Australian the venture, that the principals of this firm claimed that had connections with the previous Government and for a consideration of $10,000.00 would ensure that the appUwho cation was not rejected and that this money was subtions sequendy paid. (2) This assertion was passed to the then Chairman of the Foreign Investment Advisory Committee in the Treasury. (3) I am informed that it was referred for consideration by principals senior officers within the Foreign Investment Division but no the basis for any relationship between circumstances of the referred to and any of the cases that had been dealt under foreign investment procedures was identified. The partment of Overseas Trade was advised that Treasury had no knowledge of the kind of practicereferredto assertion. (4) I am also informed that Treasury has since conducted an exhaustive examination of all posals by Japanese companies, whether takeovers on new investment, which have been the subject of foreign investment screening procedures. This has given no indication of any circumstances which would support allegations of money being paid to officers of the Commonwealth PubUc Service to influence a ministerial foreign investment decision. Treasury: Allegations of Payment to Member of the(1) Foreign Investment Division Mr Keating asked the Minister for Overseas Trade, upon notice, on 17 August 1977: (1) Were representations from Japanese sources received by the Depanment of Overseas Trade late in 1975 that tain moneys were paid by a Japanese company to a member of the Foreign Investment Division of the Treasurer in respect of a foreign investment proposal.
