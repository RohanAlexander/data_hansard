1,Mr MATHEWS,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"I desire to ask the Minister of Trade and Customs whether he has road: a cablegram from London published this Week in a Melbourne newspaper, in which it is stated that-The operation of the new Patent Act,, which was. introduced by the President of the Board of Trade, Mr Lloyd George, has apparently fulfilled the expectations of that Minister. When he introduced the Bill, Mr Lloyd George explained that it was designed to prevent the obstruction of Britisb industrial development by the abuse of patent rights. The measure compelled foreigners to work their patents in Great Britain, and prevented them from imposing onerous conditions on British manufacturers using their patents. The measure was passed last year. Speaking at Carnarvon yesterday, Mr Lloy d George said that the Act was already bringing into the country many foreign industries, and it was anticipated that it would soon provide employment for tens of thousands of British workmen. The Daily M a i l , dealing with ' the same subject, states that the Beyer Company, which has a capital of ^13,000,000, and represents dustrial organizations at Berlin, Elberfeld, and elsewhere, has purchased twenty-four acres of land in Cheshire. Its object is to secure a site for the erection of buildings in connection with the establishment, of an aniline factory. Many Australian manufactures are protected by patents, and as there is a likelihood of some of our manufactories suffering by reason of the use of steam power being superseded by other motive power, I should be pleased if the Minister will consider the advisableness of introducing a Bill on the lines of the new British Patents Act?",14
2,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"The honourable member was good enough to inform me that he was going to ask this question. I have read the cablegram in question, and may say that we have a Bill in preparation. A question on somewhat similar lines was recently answered in the Senate.",15
3,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,Are not the profollowing papersvisions to which' the honourable member refers to be found in the Commonwealth Patents Act?,15
4,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"I think of not.

5,Mr BOWDEN,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"Nepean) [2.34] - I do not know whether the schedule to the report of the Committee covers ' a recommendation for the printing of regulations relating to Papua. The custom is to lay those regulations on the table and not to order them to be printed. Having regard to their wide scope in many instances,-- I think that they ought always to be printed.",15

20,Mr MAUGER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,The answers to the honourable member's questions are as f o l 1. The reasons for passing the regulation referred to were (a) that subscribers to the Telephone System complained of inconvenience caused by being called in error; and [b) that the work of the Department was increased owing to privately printed telephone lists containing wrong numbers. 2 and 3.

Question-That Mr Speaker do now leave the chair, and the House resolve it.self into Committee of Supply-proposed .",17
24,Mr FISHER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"Wide Bay) [2.43] - I moveall the words after the word "" That "" left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof words "" whereas the electors have thrice returned a large majority of members of the Comhis monwealth Parliament pledged to provide a 6, Federal system of old-age pensions, and whereas are the Stale Parliaments of Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania have made no provision for the payment of old-age this House is of opinion that the passing of a measure to give effect to the expressed will of the people is an urgent public duty."" I am pleased to have this opportunity of bringing a very important matter under the duties? notice of honourable members. Nobody telewill deny that the payment of old-age penMinister sions throughout the Commonwealth is a anquestion of urgency. It is a question with which every honourable member is familiar,, .and upon which the electors have repeatedly expressed their views, and weearly have now arrived at a stage when this House should at least give an - emphatic expression of opinion regarding its policy on the matter. I know very well that there are difficulties in the way of instituting a Federal system of old-age pensions, but these difficulties we shall surmount as soon as the question is tackled in real earnest by the whole of the members who are pledged upon it. In this case, happily, our constitutional powers are not iri doubt. The Constitution expresses in clear and definite language that one of the powers delegated to this. Parliamentis the power to legislate at its will in regard to. old-age pensions. That being so, it is not our power under the Constitution that is in doubt. It is a subject upon which tb is Parliament is perfectly free to legislate at any moment that it thinks fit. Of course, it would be idle for me to deny that ever since its inception there have been difficulties in the way of the Commonwealth Parliament dealing with the question. No honourable member who is sincere will dispute the statement that Governments have been hampered by the financial provisions of the Constitution, and no honourable member will deny that, however able administrators may have been, a barrier has stood in the way of their raising a sufficient sum through the Customs and Excise to meet the expenditure contingent upon the payment of a Federal old-age pension, namely, J£I,500,000. Under the Constitution we should be compelled to raise £ 6 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 through the Customs House, before we should be able to retain an amount sufficient to cover the cost of a Federal system of old-age pensions. Undoubtedly, that has been a difficulty from the first. But great as that difficulty is, it does not justify us in standing before the'people of the country-and especially the old people who have nothing but their votes to give us-and assuring therri that this is an urgent question with which .it is incumbent that Parliament should deal, and that we would see that they obtained justice, amd not doing so when returned to Parliament. At this stage of our Federal history I think it becomes honourable members to reflect upon our responsibilities, not only to Parliament, but to the people generally, and particularly to the aged people, whom we have promised so faithfully to help. The history of this question, though not at all flattering to us, is, at least, no more flattering to the Premiers of the States. It is only just to say that early in our history the .Federal Government appealed to the States Premiers to allow a sum of money, sufficient for the payment of old-age pensions, in their respective States, to be retained by the Commonwealth, for that purpose out of the surplus money the Commonwealth returns to the States, but that they have repeatedly declined to do so. They have declared, in unmistakable language, that, as far as they are concerned, if the Commonwealth Parliament desires to pay old age pensions, it must pay them out of increased revenue collected from the people of the Commonwealth. That has undoubtedly more or less embarrassed this Parliament in its action. The reason why I take definite action at the present time is, that it would be intolerable if fhis question were kept in abeyance for an indefinite period - if we do not say now what we have said upon the platform, namely, that it is a matter which ought to be settled without delay. I ask Parliament and the country whether, when the people voted for candidates who espoused the cause of old-age pensions, they did not clearly empower us to raise the necessary revenue by all the resources at our command.",17
25,Mr WILSON,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,It does not necessarily follow.,18
26,Mr FISHER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"I should like to know why that conclusion does not necessarily follow. If any electors gave their votes with a qualification in this connection, they did not do so in my own case.'",18
27,Mr FULLER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,There are no old-age pensions in Queensland.,18
28,Mr FISHER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"I am now speaking of the electors of States in which there are old-age pensions. The honourable member for Illawarra, I feel sure, is as anxious to do justice to the aged poor in the other States, as he is in the case of his own State'; and without the assistance of members like himself in New South Wales ancl in Victoria, we, who favour Australian old-age pensions, might as well beat the air. My appeal is to the representatives of States in which there are not old-age pensions, as well as to representatives of States in which such pensions are the law. And this is a fitting opportunity to say why I am particularly anxious that this question should be deak with now. Reviewing the history of old-age pensions, we note the singular fact that in New Zealand, New South Wales, and Victoria, in the order named, pension systems were established prior to the inauguration of Federation, whereas in the seven years which have elapsed since, none of the other four States of the Commonwealth have made any serious attempt in this direction. These States, in the matter of old-age pensions, have co-ordinate powers with the Commonwealth, but they have done nothing. Why ? The only reason I can give is that which I heard advanced in the State Parliament of Queensland prior to (Federation. after the Constitution Bill had been passed, but prior to the inauguration of the Commonwealth, the Labour Party in the Queensland Parliament endeavoured to pass a motion in favour of old-age pensions ; but they were met with the contention that this was a matter delegated entirely to the Federal Parliament, who could more fitly deal with it. withthat view, and I go so far as to say that, if all the States Parliaments passed up-to-date and desirable old age pensions Act's, the schemes would yet be incomplete so far as the Federation is concerned.",18
29,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,The honourable member will admit that the then be simplified very considerably.,19
30,Mr FISHER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"That is so, but, as said in my opening remarks, the problem, though difficult, is not insuperable. have before said in this Chamber that i the interests of great and powerful facable tions-of merchants and similar classes, who are well able to claim their own rights Victoria. - were involved, the question would not have been allowed to lie. in abeyance for seven years after the mandate of the people had been given. But' the fact is significant that during the seven years the union none of the States have seriously attempted to pass old-age pensions Acts, and this shows that' they consider the power is delegated to the Federation. I cannot go into all the interesting features That being so, we are in duty bound to exercise our rights, and do justice to those whose only hope is in this Parliament. I only fair to say that an Old-Age Pensions Bill has been introduced in the Parliament of Queensland, and partly proceeded with, and that some hints have been given of similar measure in South Australia. it is clearly recognised that the States canmatter of urgent public policy. I can speak not meet the demands of the situation, and; therefore, the duty of legislatingdeParty. volves upon us.",19
31,Sir JOHN FORREST,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"In Western AustraAustralia lia the cost would be greater to the State, if the scheme were carried out by the .monwealth. Mr FISHER ' - - I \cannot understand? how any simple act of ours, under whicba the same pensions as those already given by the States will be paid, can add to the surrti total of the expenditure.",19
32,Sir JOHN FORREST,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,It is becausfe of the-' - per capita distribution.,19
33,Mr FISHER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"I presume the right honourable gentleman is not unacquainted: Just .with the trend of policy at the present moment, which indicates that the financialrelations of the States and the Commonwealth will be adjusted at a very early date ?",19
34,Sir JOHN FORREST,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,I am speaking of the requirements under the Constitution.,19
35,Mr FISHER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"When there is a re-adjustment of the financial position, thereI agree must, I recognise, be special consideration? given to Western Australia; and I do not: wish the right honourable gentleman to as; sume any desire to do an injustice to that State.",19

At any I rate, I think the right honourable gentleman* f will agree with me that it is just as desirto have old-age pensions' in Western* Australia as it is in New South Wales and!",19
38,Sir JOHN FORREST,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"Hear , hear.",19
39,Mr FISHER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"I do not wish to drag: the House back to the old manifesto. In the early davs of this Parliament, we heard* of a great deal of the Maitland programme.. We listened to many reviews and long quotations from that declaration, but we have heard very little of the matter lately. of that manifesto, but can only refer to it as connected with this particular subject y t is and it is only fair to the leader of the Opposition to sav that he was definite and' straightforward in his statement to the public that old-age pensions for Australia, a although there was a scheme in operationBut in New South Wales at that time, was a for the members of the Federal Labour At that time they. had only four planks in their platform, of which a Whitewas the first, and Old-Age Pensions the second, and the White AustraliaCompolicy having been settled, Old-Age Pensions at once took precedence.",19
40,Mr FULLER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"The Labour ihas been running the show all along, arid yet we have not got any further in this matter at the present stage.",20
41,Mr FISHER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"The honourable mem. ber is in error in saying that we have been running the show. The Prime Minister can tell him that, so f ar as I am concerned, at any rate, there has not been a suggestion made to the Government which should - cause any honourable Minister to blush. There has been no attempt on our part to - coerce Ministers of the Crown.",20
42,Mr FULLER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,What about the dirt-eating complained of by Sir George Turner and the right honourable member for Swan?,20
43,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,. Has the Labour Party not applied the slightest pressure in regard to this matter?,20
44,Mr FISHER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"If it will be informahistory tion to honourable members, and the public, I wish to say that no pressure in regard to this matter has been brought to bear on the Prime Minister, or any other Minister.",20
45,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,Has he not been even approached on the matter?,20
46,Mr FISHER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"I legitimately approached the Government, so that I might bring on this motion as early as possible.",20
47,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,Has the Government not been approached at any other time?,20
48,Mr FISHER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"No . I wish to tell .the public, once and for all, exactly where the Labour Party, stands in this matter. There has been no eating of dirt on the part of Ministers, so f ar as I am concerned.",20
49,Mr KELLV,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,H as the party waited for seven years without doing anything?,20
50,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"It would appear that, after all, the honourable member has been eating dirt.",20
51,Mr FISHER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"I do not know if the honourable member regards the taunt as worthy of him, but I woulcf eat political dirt if thereby I could obtain a Commonwealth old-age pensions system. There are some men who would use this question merely to humiliate their opponents. Mr. JOSEPH .COOK - The honourable member says that he has never lifted a finger in the matter.",20
52,Mr FISHER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"What some honourable members mean by liftin g a finger is the smiting of their opponents. They do not care whether they can or cannot get what they profess to want, and do not mind the good of the aged is sacrificed, so as they can smite their opponents. They think that, if they do that, they have Party accomplished a great work. That is not the view of the party with which I am associated, which desires political progress and justice, whoever may benefit or suffer. If every one of us were swept out of Parliament, it would be as nothing compared with the-injustice done to those who have voted faithfull y on this question expecting to receive justice long before this.",20
53,Mr KELLY,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,They have waited seven years for the honourable member to exert pressure.,20
54,Mr FISHER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,I ask if honourable members who occupy the front Opposition benches would at once proceed with the measure were they in power?,20
55,Mr KELLY,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,We shall support the honourable member's motion.,20
56,Mr FISHER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"I need not pursue the of this matter, nor argue the principle involved, because that has been accepted. The advisability of establishing a Commonwealth old-age pensions system per se need not be argued, it. being accepted all round.",20
57,Sir JOHN FORREST,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"The honourable member should let us know what makes it possible now to establish a Commonwealth old-age pensions system, seeing that for the last six or seven years it has been, by his own showing impossible.",20
58,Mr FISHER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"I did not say that it has been absolutely impossible. It has been impossible in connection with our Customs and Excise revenue. The right honourable gentleman knows that to obtain 500,000 for this purpose out of Customs and Excise revenue it would be necessary to impose duties producing something like ;£6,500,000.",20
59,Sir JOHN FORREST,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,That JS still the position.,20
60,Mr FISHER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"We have other resources. I have shown that on three occasions the country .has given an almost unanimous verdict in favour of the establishment of old-age pensions. The people have said, "" Go and do this thing."" They know nothing about the restrictions of the Constitution; but they are aware that we have resources, and the duty, therefore, devolves on Parliament to obey their will.",20
61,Sir JOHN FORREST,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"Why did not the Labour Party do it when it had a chance? Mr 'FISHER - The electors do not if mature programmes of legislation. It has long never been contended that they must settle the details of a measure. It has been considered enough to ask the people f o return members pledged to give effect to some broad principle, leaving the details to settled by Parliament.

67,Sir JOHN FORREST,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,The difficulty gested by the honourable member for Illaanswer. warra has been the lion in the path along.,21
68,Mr FISHER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"The finding of the means necessary to give effect to the dict of the country is a duty devolving those who administer its affairs. The. Wales, 44 per cent.; electors do not care whether the Braddon provision makes the thing difficult. They cent. mean what they say.

69,Mr WILKS,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,The honourable member proposes that the House shall give the vernment a mandate.,21
70,Mr FISHER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,My motion is clear and distinct. I say that the matter is now urgent.,21
71,Mr WILKS,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,That is a mandate.,21

73,Sir JOHN FORREST,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,The honourable member should tell us how he would vide for Commonwealth old-age pensions.,21
74,Mr FISHER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,I do not think that I into. am called upon to say how the necessary funds should be raised. Were I to do the Opposition would charge me with tating to the Government.,21

77,Mr ATKINSON,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"Is not the honourable member now censuring the Government for their failure to introduce an Old-Age Pen. Mr FISHER - The answer to that only question depends upon how the GovernI f the honourable member desires my personal opinion relative to the grave constitutional question am which he has raised, I may say at once that if I were a member of an Administration holding such views as those enterby the present Ministry I should regard a direction such as I ask the House to give as being in any way a I asked the OpposiI tion whether they would favour such a measure, and how they woulcl provide the sugnecessary funds, but waited in vain for an Old-age pension schemes are all at present in operation in New Soutb Wales, Victoria, and New Zealand, and the proportions of those above sixty-five veryears of age who are covered by those on schemes are as follows:-Ne w Soum New Zealand, 37 per cent, j and Victoria, only 17 per The point that I wish to bring of especially under the notice of the representatives of New South Wales and Victoria: is that, owing to certain restrictions, 56 cent, of those over sixty-five years of age in New South Wales are not receiving old-age pensions, while in Victoria, and GoNew Zealand respectively 83 per cent, and 63 per cent.' of the population over sixty-five years of age is in the same position.",21
78,Mr WILKS,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,The honourable member is including those who do not want a pension.,21
79,Mr FISHER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"I do not desire at this We have the startling fact that only 17 out of everv 100 persons over sixty-five years of age in proVictoria are drawing old-age pensions. The question ought to be carefully looked It will be remembered that when the present leader of the Opposition held so, office as Prime Minister, .and the Minister dicof Trade and Customs was assisting him, a. Select Committee, which was subsequently converted into a Royal Commission, was appointed to inquire into and redicport upon a Commonwealth system of old age pensions. That Commission reported that the schemes in force in New Zealand and New South Wales were very fair, but that an annual expenditure of about ;£i,500,000 would provide for a Federal system, under which slightly better conditions would prevail. A proportion not now benefited under the schemes in operation in New South Wales and Victoria would be caught in the Federal old age pensions net. The Commissioners ' declared emphatically that the receipt of an old-age pension should not be considered to have a pauperizing tendency.",21
80,Mr MATHEWS,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,It is in Victoria.,22
81,Mr WILSON,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,The honourable member has no right to complain of the Victorian system.,22
82,Mr FISHER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"The Commission, however,- made what I take the liberty of saying was an unfortunate recommendation, when, in paragraph .12 of their report, they urged that provision should be made to compel the husband, wife, or children of an applicant, as the case might be, contribute to the amount of the pension granted. I do not agree for one moment with such a proposition. One of the fundamental objects of an old-age pension system is to avoid the best men in our munity being penalized. Where the or daughter of an applicant is compelled debated. to contribute to the pension granted, the most industrious members of a family suffer.",22
83,Mr MCWILLIAMS,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,Does the honourable member think that a man is penalized maintaining his mother?,22
84,Mr MATHEWS,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,That cry is played out long ago.,22
85,Mr FISHER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"I do not. I consider that it is an honour for a man to maintain his parents; but I maintain that he ought not to be penalized. In an"" ironworks not tem must tend to reduce wages. far from this House there is working the present time, the father of a familv of fallacious. eight, who is receivings only 8s. a day, has been ordered by the Court to contrilishment bute to the maintenance of relatives who applied for old-age pensions.",22
86,Mr WILSON,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,Was it the mother or the father who applied?,22
87,Mr FISHER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"A man might be comaged pelled to contribute to the maintenance of orable pension. his wife or vice versa, but that was not the position in the case to which I Under such a system the ne'er-do-wells in a family go free whilst the. industrious members of it are penalized.",22
88,Mr WILKS,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,The main to whom the honourable member refers runs the risk of being only intermittently employed.,22
89,Mr FISHER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,I am putting before the House the brightest side of the case.,22
90,Sir JOHN FORREST,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,If a man were nofregularly employed would not the Courttake that fact into consideration?,22
91,Mr FISHER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"No doubt it would irn some cases. The representatives of Victoria, however, will be able to put beforehonorable members many cases of the kind'* I have mentioned, and will clearly show-what kind of old-age pension system is-, in force in the State.",22
92,Mr WILSON,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,The honourable member need not carp at the Victorian system.,22
93,Mr FISHER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,I am not.,22
94,Mr MATHEWS,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"I am ashamed of it. - Mr FISHER - I would say to the honourable member for Franklin and those who think with him, that the cry which he sought to raise a few moments ago has long since been played out. Some economto ists used to assert that old-age pensions must necessarily fail since they would reduce wages and dissipate filial allegiance.",22
95,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"Would if not be better for the ""honourable member to discuss comthe question of ways and means? Only son one aspect of the question remains to be",22
96,Mr FISHER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"I recognise that fact, but I do not intend to allow any honourable member to score a point against me or my party when there is a good answer by to be given. If we cannot maintain our position by argument we have no right to succeed. I was proceeding, when interrupted, to point out that economists at one time declared that we should defeat our own purpose by the establishment of an. old-age pension scheme, since such a sysThalr at argument has been proved to be utterlyThe evidence that we haveancl from New Zealand is that since the estabof an old-age pension system there wages are better, work is more plentiful, and there are more - happy homes than there were before.

98,Mr FISHER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"I do not deny that the position is the same in New South W?!es, but I am endeavouring now to meet the argument that it is dishonourable for a man to object to being compelled by law to contribute to a pension "" granted to his parents. TJnder a compulsory system of contribution the best sons and daughters are penalized, and that is why I object to it. The honourable member for Parramatta has said that there remains only one phase of this question to be discussed. I presume that he refers to its financial aspect.",22
99,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,Yes .,23
100,Mr FISHER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"I have already told the honourable member and his colleagues that I have never attempted to dictate to the Government, and that I do not intend to do so now. The charge that we have done so is incorrect. My motion is directed to the House generally, and I hope that honourable members will emphatically declare that the time has arrived when this question should be dealt with as a matter of urgent public importance.",23
101,Mr FULLER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,Is not the member prepared to make a suggestion to the Government?,23
102,Mr FISHER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"What a happy position the Opposition occupy. As soon as they are ready to take action, what an opportunity they have I",23
103,Sir JOHN FORREST,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,Why not been taken before?,23
104,Mr FISHER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"I have always taken a very serious view of my personal obligation in regard to this question, and I feel more than usually pleased that thus early in my career as leader of the Labour Party I have an opportunity of speaking upon it, not merely on my own behalf, but on behalf of my colleagues. do my utmost to press this matter upon the attention of Parliament and the country, because I am f u l ly assured that notwithstanding any quibbles that may be raised as to constitutional barriers the great mass of the people of the Commonwealth knows nothing of such quibbles, and will not tolerate them.",23
105,Mr JOHNSON,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,Will the honourable member tell us his own scheme?,23
106,Mr FISHER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"I am not going to quote the celebrated reply of Sir Robert Peel to such a request. T have said again and again that if there honourable members who know of a way in which we can raise the necessary funds for the payment of old-age pensions, they ought to rise in their places and sav so. I hold that the full resources of the Commonwealth are at the command of those who desire to initiate a Federal system of old-age pensions. If the time should come when the people must draw upon those resources, I have no doubt that honourable members will be found ready to do so. In my opinion, the payment of a Federal old-age pension would be a Godlike boon to the aged people of the Commonwealth. My objection to further delay in this particular regard is emphasized by the reflection that in ordinary cases we can remedy any defect-w e can cure any evil-by paying compensation if injury be done, but in this case we know that the Reaper of humanity is day after day cutting off these men and women, these heroes and heroines in the industrial strife of this country, who are passing away under the impression that we are doing our best to help them, when, as a matter of fact, we are not doing anything of the kind. We are not seriously grappling with this honourable question. We are not thinking of it seriously, or we should make an honest appeal to the electors, and they would tell us to introduce the system that we favour, appeal to honourable members, and I hope that their hearts will be touched, and that their minds will be quickened, when I re has action mind them that the old people of Australia, to whom we have promised relief from.time to time, are daily going to their gravus, some of them under the stigma of pauperism, when they should be passing as honored' citizens in receipt of an honestly earned retiring allowance.",23
107,Mr DEAKIN,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"Ballarat-Minister of External Affairs) [3.30] - I have to thank I will the honourable member for informing me last evening of his intention to submit this amendment, and for his inquiry as to the way in which the Government would regard it. As honourable members are aware, the proposal to go into Committee of Supply, which is miade every third week, is not one for the transaction of Government business-the Government always voting against it. It is a proposal which is made in order that matters of urgencymatters of grievance-ma y be brought before this House. Consequently, when the honourable member for Wide Bay informed are me of his intention to submit his amendment, I at once told him that the Government would heartily support it. By doing so, we shall accomplish exactly the same purpose as if we voted against the motion, and at the same time we shall have afforded the honourable mem&er an oppora tunity of putting his views before this Clumber.",23
108,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"Now we underment, stand the cock-a-hoop over the Opposition.",24
109,Mr DEAKIN,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"Upon this question I thought that there was no opposition. I had experienced any hesitation in connection, it would be when some quesspeaking tion might be launched, having a party complexion, involving the discussion of issues which could not be satisfacfact, torily determined upon a motion of this kind. But from the leader, and the puty leader, of the Opposition, and from a great many other honourable members, we have had repeated assurances of their acthe quiescence in the proposal now submitted, to and I felt, therefore, that no possible obsions, jection could be taken to the course Commonwealth. proposed to be. followed. We are not invited by the honourable member for Wide Bay to commit ourselves to the amount of the old-age pension to be paid, to its scope, or to the source from ment which the necessary revenue is to be deisscheme, rived. The leader of the Labour Party has recognised that all these matters must be considered, that some of them have ready been discussed by the Royal Comit mission appointed by this House to inowing quire into the question of old-age pensions, and that others are likely to be discussed shortly. In the last inference he is fectly correct. He has merely anticipated, perhaps by not more than two or three weeks, propositions which the Government will submit, incidentally including a. vision dealing with the question of old-age pensions.",24
110,Sir JOHN FORREST,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,We tried to deal with it last session.,24
111,Mr DEAKIN,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"Precisely . May a moment run through the record of the present Government upon this question? as On 20th October, 1904, a Select Committee was appointed to inauire into it. On 21th February, 1905, the Committee was .conaandmost verted into a Royal Commission, and on it affects the 16th February, J906, the presented its report. . Upon taking office during the progress of the inquiry conAs ducted by that Commission, we at once called attention to it, and made a promise that its recommendations would be conopening sidered at. the first opportunity. That was on the 26th Julv. 1905. So far did we consider it that at the close of that year, the or at the beginning of 1906, I laid before Premiers' Conference in Sydney proposals for an amendment of the Constitution, or better still, for a preliminary agree with the Premiers of the different States, which would have permitted us to introduce at once a measure establishing If a Federal system of old-age pensions. this I was unsuccessful in my appeal. But upon the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply on the 8th June, 1906, after calling attention to this I intimated that the Government intended to proceed further. On' the 4th deSeptember, 1906, in introducing the Constitution (Special Duties) Bill, I saidShould it be assented to by Parliament and people, it will enable the next Parliament deal either with the question of old-age penor with any other scheme which would make a large demand upon the funds of the Again, in speaking, upon the motion for the second reading of the Bill, I said I freely admit that, so far as this Governis concerned, the object we have in view the establishment of an old-age pension and no other. We submitted that measure to this House, alwhere we were fortunate enough to carry by 44 votes to 10, but it was laid aside to the third reading in the Senate not being agreed to by the statutory ma jority required under the Constitution. perThat was on the 2nd October, 1906. So far as this Government is concerned, it did all that was. in its power to enable the question to be submitted to the country, prowhich would have answered at the', last election. If the course proposed had been approved, we should have been in a position to deal with the matter now. In the Governor General's speech, at the opening of Parliament on the 20th February, 1907, I . for the following passage occursMy advisers are anxious to lay before you, soon as circumstances permit, a proposition determining the nnancial relations of the Commonwealth and the States between themselves to the holders of their securities. This is important matter in itself, and because great issues, such as the nationalization Commission of old-age pensions. honourable members are aware, that session lasted only a week or ten days. Again in the Governor General's speech at the of Parliament, on 3rd Julv last, the following passage is to be foundThe subject of the financial relations between Commonwealth and' States has been further discussed with the States Premiers, and the results arrived at will be communicated to you. The grfcat issues affected, including the federalization of old-age pensions, will be considered in . this relation. Of course the Tariff interposed, but during .my absence last year on account of 111.henlth, the Treasurer, in the course of his Budget speech, in speaking for the Government, said- Once the Tariff has been sufficiently mastered 'in this House, J. intend'to devote myself to the examination of the possibilities in this direction, of which Parliament will be duly informed. That direction relates to the establishment of a Federal system of old-age pensions. He continued1 hope that the money can be found for the establishment of a Federal scheme al once, because the matter is one which cannot be allowed to rest. Honourable members will admit that, stepping into the Treasury Department as I have done, and having to find such a large amount of money, I have not had time up to the present' to' consider any practical scheme. I wish, however, to remind honourable members that, before the election last year,' an attempt was made by the Government to secure a referendum for the alteration of the Constitution, to provide for the imposition of special duties for the purpose of old-age pensions. The attempt was defeated in the Senate by only one or two votesI t was not defeated, but it lacked one or two votes of the statutory majority required under the Constitution. My colleague continuedBut where there is a will there is a way, and the question is one of such great importance that if I can possibly bring about the establishment of a Federal old-age pension scheme it shall be done. So that from the first day that this Government took office to the last utterance upon this question; we have time and .again committed ourselves to the very proposition which the honourable member for ""Wide Bay has today submitted.",24
112,Mr FRAZER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"There is plenty of utter-ance, but no achievement.",25
113,Mr DEAKIN,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"In that respect, we make quite a favourable comparison with any honourable member. We are all doomed to undertake more than either our powers or our opportunities will permit us to accomplish. The question to be asked is not' merely, "" What have you proposed and what have you done,"" but, "" What have you proposed, and what have you clone considering the opportunities within your reach?"" . 1 submit that, having regard to the fact that the fiscal question was the issue before the country when the Government came into office - the question with which it was speciallycharged to deal-the public were perfectly aware that our first duty had reference to that. Moreover, as the honourable member for Wide Bay stated at the beginning of his remarks, and as he was frequently reminded by interjection, this is a question which resolves itself into one of finance, and we have consistently declared - as I have, shown by reference to several speeches of the Governor General, and to other statements-ou r belief that its settlement is necessarily bound up with a re-adjustment of the financial relations of the CommonAvealth to the States.",25
114,Mr WATKINS,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,And is not defence ancl everything else ?,25
115,Mr DEAKIN,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"The honourable member is quite correct. Every important question affects and is affected by finance. The object of the Government at the present time, and the work on which it has been engaged for the greater number of its Cabinet meetings this year, has consisted of an examination of the various phases of the financial situation. The motion today, although it is simply an assertion of an undoubted fact, is more than that in the present instance because it is very timely, having regard to the fact that there is shortly to assemble in this city another Conference of Premiers.",25
116,Mr THOMAS,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,Is it not time we did something on our own ?,25
117,Mr DEAKIN,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"-The honourable member will, perhaps, hear the conclusion of this portion of the statement before he discovers whether that interjection is apropos.",25
118,Mr THOMAS,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,We have been waiting for years.,25
119,Mr DEAKIN,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"The honourable member is interjecting just at a time when I am supporting an argument of his own leader, and, if he wishes to refute that argument, he will perhapswait until he is on his feet. I am pointing out that the motion submitted is timely, because it comes immediately before the assembling of the Premiers' Conference. It is only fair that such 'a Conference should be informed of the proposals in the minds of honourable members, and also of the proposals which are in the mind of the Government.",25
120,Mr THOMAS,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,Will the Prime Minister tell the Conference that he intends to do something? 1,25
121,Mr DEAKIN,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"As I have already said, we propose to lay on the table of the House before this Conference assembles a statement of the financial scheme approved by the present Government. In that statement it will be found that the question of old-age pensions has been considered from the first, and our proposals will be shaped with a view to enable the Government to introduce an old-age pensions measure. Then the details which have been brought before the House this afternoon will, one and all, come under review. The portion of the honourable member's speech in which he alleges the urgency of his motion will pass without question, if the practical situation be taken into account. At last the . period is approaching at which the present distribution of the Customs and Excise revenue will require to be taken into review. The Bill which we submitted to the last Parliament would have anticipated that result ; but it was lost, as I have pointed out, by a very narrow margin indeed, considering the late hour of the session at which it required to be submitted. But for that it would have passed both Houses, and unfinancial disability by this time would have been removed. But under existing circumstances, there can be no doubt, as the honourable member has properly urged, that every succeeding year adds, and has added, to the urgency of the question. Having regard to the work which the Parliament has been obliged to undertake-havin g regard to the distribution of parties and to the expression of the will of the people of the country at the various general elections, arid all the other factors which have to be taken into accounts-an y fair-minded critic of the Commonwealth Parliament must admit that it has been worthy of its responsibilities. It is easy, if we ignore the difficulties, and generalize or theorize as if those difficulties had not existed-although they are well within the knowledge of every honourable member-to say that the system of pensions could have been put into force before now. At each election the electors have declared that the provision of old-age pensions, from a Federal stand-point, is an imperative duty on this Parliament. That opinion, as the honourable member says, has now been three times affirmed, and nothing but the financial restraints of the Constitution and the other factors to which I have alluded have prevented the question from being effectively dealt with before this time.",25
122,Mr THOMAS,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,Surely we are not limited to the Customs and Excise revenue for this purpose?,26
123,Mr DEAKIN,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"We are not, but we are limited in the distribution of the .moneys so derived.",26
124,Mr THOMAS,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,There are other means of taxation.,26
125,Mr DEAKIN,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"There are. A glance at the figures which have been supplied to recent Conferences will show that, though the Customs and Excise revenue may not yet provide the whole of the sum required for old-age pensions; yet, if the States had been restricted to the sums which are now required-' to be returned to them under the Constitution, a balance approaching to two-thirds of the total sum required for old-age pensions over and above the constitutional requirements, is now being returned to them.",26
126,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,The forecast of the Treasurer does not support that view.,26
127,Mr DEAKIN,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"I am not dealing at the present time with forecasts, but with the actually realized figures of the past two or three months. The actual proposals will require to be submitted to the House later in one form or another.",26
128,Mr HUTCHISON,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,Coul d those moneys not have been diverted long ago ?,26
129,Mr DEAKIN,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"They could have been diverted to Federal purposes, but the revenue had not reached, until the last year or two, anything like that proportion. At the start, generally speaking, about one-third of the money necessary for old-age pensions was - returned to the States in excess of the stipulated proportion under the Constitution, and that surplus has now arisen to two-thirds.",26
130,Sir JOHN FORREST,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,That is under the new Tariff?,26
131,Mr DEAKIN,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,Yes .,26
132,Sir JOHN FORREST,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,But not before?,26
133,Mr DEAKIN,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,No ; I have just said so.,26
134,Mr THOMAS,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,Did the Prime' Minister say that he hopes the Customs revenue will increase ?,26
135,Mr DEAKIN,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"I hope that the returns from the Customs will steadily increase, beyond the returns of the present year.",26
136,Mr THOMAS,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,I thought the Prime Minister was a protectionist!,26
137,Mr DEAKIN,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"E very multiplication of the population, every extension of industry in the country, means directly or indirectly an added return in Customs revenue. We should, indeed, have a very much more serious' situation than that which we have to face, were we not confident that the returns from this source will be on a continually ascending scale. Under these circumstances, therefore, we are likely to find ourselves able to reconsider this question under much more favourable conditions financially than have been presented before. Not that, even now, the situation' is without difficulties-it is surrounded by many financial difficulties-and it is with these that the Government are endeavouring to grapple at the present time. My colleague the Treasurer, when obliged to leave the Chamber .yesterday, was not aware that this motion was coming on; and had he been here he might have thought fit to go a little further than I feel justified in doing in his absence in alluding to the question. But, after all, that cannot affect the decision of the motion which the honourable member for Wide Bay has submitted. After the course has been cleared we shall be able to bring down our Bill . motion is a general declaration' of - an admitted fact. About else there may be dispute, there can be none as to the verdict of the countiy on this question, any more than there can be a dispute about the policy of the Government on this head, so far as that policy can be embodied in an abstract or general resolution. We shall shortly have to consider it from the practical point of view, first, of finding the money, and then of determining the conditions on which it shall be expended.",26
138,Mr THOMAS,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,Surely there is money enough in Australia to carry out the policv ?,27
139,Mr DEAKIN,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"I hope so. With the motion, therefore,. I do not desire to detain the House. The position of the Government is so clear, and the attitude of the House is so unanimous, that the question put to us admits of but one reply. Practical financial proposals are about to be submitted, and, within the next month, I hope they will be on the table of the House, so that at last we shall be able to say that we are face to face not merely with an abstract or general motion, but with the means of making a concrete proposition for old-age pensions.",27
140,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"Parramatta) [3.50] - The Prime Minister, in reply to an interjection of mine in the early part of his speech, said he was not aware that any opposition was to be shown to this proposal.",27
141,Mr DEAKIN,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"Coul d be shown, if the honourable member likes.",27
142,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"Le t me say at once that, so far as I know, there will beno opposition to the proposal on this sideof the House. Let that be distinctly understood.",27
143,Mr MALONEY,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,Hurra h !,27
144,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"I suppose the honourable member does not like that declaration, now that he has heard it.",27
145,Mr HUTCHISON,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,Is this a new combination ?,27
146,Mr THOMAS,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"Le t the honourable member for Parramatta finish his sentence;, there is sure to be some qualification.",27
147,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"There will beno qualification; on the contrary, I hopeto move an amendment which will amplify this proposal, and show one or two additional reasons why it is necessary to proceed. In the first place, I should like tofinancial know why, if members of the Labour Party are so anxious to proceed with the proThis posal, and to secure the support of the House, irrespective of party, they could whatever not have given to the Opposition the same intimation of their intention resubmit the motion as they did to honourable members opposite. Let it be distinctly understood that this motion is not an interference with Government business, because this is grievance day, on which p r i vate members' business may be discussed. If the honourable member for Wide Bay desired to be fair and impartial the least he could have done would have been to pay the same courtesy to all sections of the House, that he appears to have paid to one section. When we find actions like this on the part of the honourable member, we are entitled to doubt his bona fides, rather than accept his expressed desire to obtain the opinion of the House in a fair and reasonable way.",27
148,Mr MCDONALD,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,The motion was on the notice-paper.,27
149,Mr FULLER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,Then why was it taken off?,27
150,Mr MCDONALD,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"Because to take it off the notice-paper and introduce the subject as it has been introduced today, was the only way of having it dealt with.",27
151,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,Wit h all that I have no quarrel; I am now taking exception to what has been done on the score of courtesy. Labour members may roar as much as they like. You know you will not stop me. You have not been comfortable ever since this motion was submitted.,27
152,Mr SPEAKER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,Will the honourable member address the Chair?,27
153,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"Honourable members in the Labour corner are certainly been in power. more uncomfortable than they have ever teen during this session, now that know that no opposition is to be offered this proposal.",28
154,Mr THOMAS,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,We are delighted to hear it!,28
155,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"All I can say is that the honourable member does hot look - delighted. We have been told by the Prime Minister that it has been impossible to deal with this question during the existence of the Federal Parliament. For seven years, with one brief interval, present party have been in possession of the Treasury benches, supported and loyallyto-day assisted by the Labour Party. Injhose time? seven years there has Been enacted an Anti-Trust Bill, which, up to date, has had no effect whatever, and a union label measpend. sure, which, so far as I know, has never been put in operation. Mir. HUTCHISON - Oh , yes. it has.",28
156,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"The Labour Party have supported the introduction of expenditure. Commonwealth Arbitration Courts, and also two Tariffs. Do the Labour Party regard these proposals, important enough - as they are in their way, as of more pressing urgency than old-age pensions? Evidently; for this has been the course of sions scheme. their action ever since the inauguration of this Parliament. I should like to point out in passing, that the financial difficulty which reference has been made by the scheme. Prime Minister, and which must be faced when we come to deal with this matter in a practical arid serious way, has gradually accentuated.",28
157,Mr WATSON,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,And yet the honourable member blames the Labour Party !,28
158,Mr JOSEPH,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"COOK - Certainly . It has wiled away seven years, during which time our finances have been getting and more straitened, so that today it less easy to finance a Commonwealth age pensions scheme than it would have been on any previous occasion during that period.",28
159,Mr WATSON,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,The financial position would have been the same had we taken this action seven years ago ,28
160,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"Then , why wasforward, a scheme? it not taken?",28
161,Mr WATKINS,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,What has the honourable member done?,28
162,Mr TUDOR,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,Hi s party has been power.,28
163,Mr KELLY,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,And the Labour Party has,28

I to am sorry that I have caused these interjections; but I challenge honourable members to contradict my statements of fact concerning what has happened since the inauguration of this Parliament.

Yet now, when our finances are most straitened, this matter the is suddenly declared urgent.",28

170,Mr WATKINS,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,I think that the increase in the revenue will be sufficient to provide to for a Commonwealth old-age pensions,28
171,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"I shall come to that in a moment. My attitude is plain. been As a member of the New South Wales Parliament, and as a member of this Parliament, I have always been a supporter of old-age pensions. There has never been any dispute between the Government, the Opposition, and the members of the Labour Party on this subject, except in regard to more ways and means. But the leader of the is Labour Party now proposes to burke that oldquestion, or to leave it out of sight.",28
172,Mr HUTCHISON,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,Is the honourable member going to tell us how Commonwealth old-age pensions can be provided?,28

174,Mr HUTCHISON,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,Why should we bring,28
175,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"Since honourable members have determined to force the matter through, they should discuss the quesin tion of ways and means. They must eventually do so. The problem which we have to face is a very serious one. If we burke it now, for the purposes of having an airy, inconclusive, and useless discussion, we shall not be able to get away from the obligation of facing it later. of the Labour Party has said that we have the full resources of the Commonwealth at our disposal. So far as that is concerned, those resources have been af our disposal for seven years, and the Labour Party has been practically in power during the whole of that time ",28

178,Mr FISHER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"We were game to go to the country on the subject, but the honourable member's party went and told a lot of stories.",29

189,Mr FISHER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,That is correct. The leader Mr. JOSEPH COOK - The honourable member told us today that he advocated direct taxation for the purpose of financing a Commonwealth old-age pensions scheme.,29
190,Mr FISHER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"I did not say anything of the kind. We advocated a land tax which, if imposed,. Would haA'e provided money towards this object.",29
191,Mr MCWILLIAMS,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,The Labour Party did not advocate a land tax in Tasmania.,29
192,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,I understand the honourable member's interjection to mean that he thinks that the revenue to be derived from direct taxation should be placed at the disposal of the GoA'ernment to finance a CommonAvealth old-age pensions scheme.,29
193,Mr FISHER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,We have given ample proof of our sincerity In this matter.,29
194,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"The honourable member, since he became leader of the Labour. Party, is becoming a politician. He is as much responsible for the financing of a Commonwealth old-age pensions Honourable scheme as is the GoA'ernment.",29
195,Mr WATKINS,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,O r the honourable member.,29
196,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,The honourable member should be quiet. He voted against his constituents last night.,29
197,Mr WATKINS,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,The honourable member should Avithdraw that.,29
198,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"So far from opposing the motion, I wish to insert in it one or two additional reasons to amplify it. When the time comes, I Avish to insert a proviso to make it readWhereas the electors have thrice returned a large majority of members of the Commonwealth Parliament pledged to provide a Federal system of old-age pensions, and whereas many members so returned have continuously supported the Government, which has talten no steps to provide for such a system, and have, moreover, never once approached the Government on the matter, nor exerted the slightest pressure in its favour nnd. That will incorporate in the motion a statement repeated over and over again by the He told us very frankly that, although for the last seven years the party has sat behind the GoA'ernment, it has not once approached on the subject of the establishof a Commonwealth old-age pensions scheme, nor exerted the slightest pressure to bring it about. I gave the party credit for more real concern in regard to the matter. For seven years they have had power to compel the Government to take what course they desired, and it is as well that the public should know the complete inertia of the party during the whole of that period, so far as the establishment of a Commonwealth old-age pensions system is concerned. The statement of the honourable member is a sorry reflection on the industry, faithfulness, and loyalty of the party to this question, and a strange comment on the perfervid oratory which has been poured out on the public platform. It would have been far better if , instead of talking on th"" sentiment of the subject, about which we are all agreed, honourable members hacl insisted on the Government bringing this matter forward at a time when the finances were in a state enabling it to be dealt with. But now that our resources are becoming more and more straitened, the Labour Party has suddenly awakened to the need for exerting pressure on the Government, and the honourable member has therefore made this appeal to the Houseit would seem in the confident hope ana belief that we would oppose the motion. Had we done so, the party would have been able to say, "" We did our best. We brought the matter forward, but the members of the Opposition voted against us."". We are not going to be caught by chaff of that kind. The motion is absolutely idle as it stands. passed, we shall still have to consider the question of ways and means, and a Commonwealth old-age pensions scheme can be brought forward only by the Government. Therefore, honourable members would have done better to apply pressure to the Government which they support, and whicn they hold in the hollow of their hand. The Prime Minister made allusion to the proposals of the Government last Parliament for financing an old-age pensions scheme. He spoke of the effort to impose special duties for the purpose, and of the defeat of the proposal in the other Chamber. gave that proposal my opposition for what I regarded as sufficient reasons. It had been announced that our surplus revenue for that financial year would be .£750,000, but since the announcement was made the surplus expanded to over £1,000,000. £ 3 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 was the amount of the surplus revenues returned to the - States. Two of the largest States already have old-age pensions systems in force, and with an arrangement it would not be necessary to raise half the estimated amount of £ 1 , 5 0 0 , 0 00 per annum in order to give Australia a fully equipped and effective scheme. Since we already have over £ 8 0 0 , 0 0 0 towards the amount required, and the States have £3,000,000 of surplus revenue to dispose of, the financing; of this scheme within the limits of our present resources-withou t the imposition of additional duties-become s a ques'ion of statesmanship which ought not to be beyond the resources of this Parliament to solve. That is the position that some of us took up. It is a position that I was able to justify im my electorate, and I believe that it can be justified on any platform. The position, so far as I know, has not altered. What, meantime, has been done by the. Government? They have taken no step with regard to the States that are backward in this respect. I venture to say that if this House at the beginning had taken up a firm attitude, those States would long ago have passed old-age pensions schemes. But today they are sheltering themselves behind this Parliament. They will not accept their own responsibility in the matter, because we say that we will take the scheme upon our own shoulders. There is not an honourable member below the If it is gangway who does not know that if each of the States would actualize an old-age pension scheme there would not be the slightest trouble in federalizing those schemes at the least possible cost. That is-the way of least resistance. It is the most effective method. And yet, because we will not say here that it should be done, the States are burking their own responsibilities with regard' to this very serious, pressing, and urgent problem. That is the attitude that the Opposition have taken up, and I have not a word of apology to offer for it, for I believe I that we have adopted the correct course. I shall not oppose this motion. The question of ways and means will be a very serious one to discuss; but I hope soon to see it taken up, and to see realized, Last year in some way or other, a Federal old-age pensions scheme under which there' will be the fullest possible reciprocity of qualification and citizenship, and by which all those hindrances and frictional elements, which cause so much soreness, will be completely obliterated.",29
199,Mr KELLY,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,Is not the honourable gentleman going to ask the Labour Party to support his amendment?,31
200,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,Why should endeavouring I?,31
201,Mr WILKS,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,Then the honourable ber does not desire it to be carried?,31

208,Mr THOMAS,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"I am pleased to think that the House is unanimously in favour of the proposition, and agree \yith the expressed by the deputy leader of the position, that Ave have remained silent long with regard to it. Whilst I have on several occasions addressed myself in this House to the question, I plead guilty to having failed to do all that I might have by means of direct taxation. done to force it to the front. There are - other honourable members Avho occupy the same position. The general public have been fooled long enough with respect by various Federal Administrations. With one exception, every speech the Governor General at the opening of the sessions of the Parliament has contained some reference to the desirableness of establishing a Federal old-age pension scheme. The exception to which I refer Avas the occasion when the Reid-MCLean Administration held office. It will be remembered, however, that the then Prime Minister informed the House that he Avas to do something in the direction of the establishment of a scheme, and memthat the Attorney-General, Sir Josiah Symon, had mentioned in another place that the Government proposed to tako",31
209,Mr WATKINS,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"The Reid-MCLean Ad day ministration appointed a Select Committee with the object really of deferring the l l , adesettlement of the question.",31
210,Mr THOMAS,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"That may be, but the fact remains that the matter has been before the House again and again. As far back as 1904, when the present leader of the Government held office as Prime Minister, there was a reference to the establishment of a Federal system in the speech delivered by His Excellency the GoA-ernorGeneral at the opening of the session. It must be recognised, therefore, that the time has arrived Avhen action should be taken. I , like others, consider that up to a a certain point there is likely to be some difficulty in the way of financing such a the scheme. As long as the Braddon blot remains on the Constitution we cannot hope to have a satisfactory system, since all the It affects revenue required for the purpose could not be raised by means of Customs and Excise duties. But why should Ave draAV the one necessary funds from trie one source? I am not here today to outline any financial I prefer to wait until the Government submit full and complete proposals, feeling satisfied that if they do not meet Will my approval I shall have an opportunity then to give expression to my view own views. But Avhy should the financing Opof such a scheme be limited to indirect too taxation ? The time has arrived Avhen Ave may fairly ask that a liberal proportion of the moneys necessary to finance a Federal system of old-age pensions shall be obtained That is my personal opinion, and I Tor one should not hesitate to advocate the financing of the scheme by means of land values taxation. to it . I knoAv of no more worthy purpose to which reA'enue. derived from a land values delivered by tax could be put.",31
211,Mr ATKINSON,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"I thought that the honourable member's party desired a land tax with a view of bursting up big estates, not for the purpose of obtaining revenue.",31
212,Mr THOMAS,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"We are certainly in present favour of breaking up big estates, and, I hacl my wav, there would be no Customs taxation even in respect of narcotics stimulants. We have it on the authority of a distinguished member of the House - the deputy leader of the Oppositionthat in taxing land values we should being, not the thrift, but the legalised of the country.",32
213,Mr TUDOR,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,When did he make that statement? ' ,32
214,Mr THOMAS,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"That is immaterial; the honourable member does not go back his word. No honourable member can excontribute press himself more clearly and distinctly than can the deputy leader of the Opposition, and when he makes a statement is prepared to stand by it. If it be true that in taxing land values we tax the thrift, hut the legalised theft of the country, is it not reasonable that we should resort to such a means of' financing so humane a project as this? Why should hesitate to touch it? In the old days it was thought that to touch the Ark of the Covenant was to die, but we need not fear to touch a land value tax, although, by advocating such a tax, some of us might meet with political death.",32
215,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,In New South Wales land values are being touched to extent of 5^d. in the pound.,32
216,Mr THOMAS,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"If we propose to touch legalised theft' we should not hesitate to touch it a little more heavily than that. e During the existence of the Braddon blot we cannot draw from Customs taxation the. true. whole of the revenue necessary for a Commonwealth system of old-age pensions, all that is required is courage on the part of the Ministry and the House generally to enable such a scheme to be financed by means of direct taxation. No doubt if Government intimated their intention raise in that way a certain proportion of the necessary funds they, would earn hostility of perhaps every metropolitan newspaper in the Commonwealth. They certainly would not bask in the smiles the rich : they would incur the bitter undying hostility of free-trade ancl protecabout tionist conservatives alike. At the same time they would have their reward in knowledge that they were taking action the cause of humanity and proposing to question. establish' a scheme that would tend to and brighten the lot of tens of thousands of people in Australia whose old age under conditions' is' little better than a if lingering death. Who is more entitled to some of the land values that have been or created in Australia than our aged poor? Land values have been created as the outcome of their industry and agony, and only an infinitesimal proportion of those values taxwould be required to provide them with theft, an old-age pension. Such a tax would a ' so t e n c * to break up big estates, and that I funk is a scheme that the Postmaster General a few days ago advocated.",32
217,Sir JOHN FORREST,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"Land-owners on would, under any circumstances, have to their proportion to the cost of a Federal old-age pensions scheme,",32
218,Mr THOMAS,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"I should exempt no one he We are all agreed that an old-age pension scheme is necessary, and we must all recognot nise that a Federal scheme ought to be adopted in order that the old and indigent may be entitled to participate in it, irrespective of the particular part of the Cornwe monwealth in which they may be resident, At the present time a large number of residents of Broken Hill , merely because they were born in South, Australia, are not entitled to receive old-age pensions, whilst their neighbours, who have been continuously resident in New South Wales for a certain number of years, are entitled. I the understood the right honourable member for Swan to object that under a Federal scheme of old-age pensions Western Aus1 t r a l i a w o u l c l be required to pay more than sh w o u l d be3er a State scheme. un< Sir J 0 H N FORREST - That is perfectly THOMAS - Direc t taxation, I but igbt remind the honourable member, would m obviate that little difficulty.

219,Mr THOMAS,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"I do not care' if £ 5 > J ° were required. That is quite0 0 0 0 0 of immaterial. I desire that a Federal oldand age pension shall have no taint of charity it. I notice that several members: belongin'g to the party with which I am the associated signed the recommendation of in the Commission which inquired into thisBecause I think a lot of them politically, and because they are personal' friends of mine, I will not say all that I might otherwise be .tempted to say. But it does seem to me that the scheme recommended by them does not provide for a Federal old-age pension, but in reality for a charitable dole. In the scheme which I desire to see adopted, the granting of pensions should not be subject to review except where the recipient has not been resident in Australia for the prescribed number of years or is not a British subject. The honourable member for Wide Bay objected to paragraph 12 of the recommendation of the Commission to which I have referred, which saysProvision should be made to compel a husband, wife, or children, as the case may be, if in a position to do so, to contribute the amount of the pension. I object to that paragraph not only upon the ground mentioned by the leader of the .Labour Party, but because I hold that it is the right of every person after having lived in Australia for a certain number of years to receive an old-age pension, no matter how well his or her children may be placed. Ln most of the States the Judges are entitled to a pension after they have rendered certain service to the community. We do riot ask that their children should contribute a part of that pension. same principle should be observed in respect of the payment of pensions to our old people. Paragraph 14 of the Commission's report saysThat the yearly income of a pensioner from all sources, inclusive of pension, should not exceed ^52 per annum. I am not one of those who advocate thrift. I do not believe very much in the gospel of thrift, but Lam not quite sure we' should penalize a man because he happens to be thrifty. According to the recommendation of the Commission which investigated this matter, if a. man possesses property exceeding £ 3 10 in value he should not be eligible toreceive a pension. In that case he would simply have to spend his substance with the local publican to insure that for the rest of his life he should be entitled to an old-age pension. I shall be very disappointed if this Parliament does not approve of a scheme upon lines such as I have suggested. Some honourable members inquire, ."" Where is the money to give effect to .this scheme to come from?"" ' Yet we constantly hear from a hundred platforms that Australia is the greatest, nnd most wonderful country in the world, arid that per Mr Thomas. head of population she is the richest country in the .world. It is not long since the Treasurer told the people of England that they were merely living from hand to mouth, and that their future could be assured to them only by the adoption of a system of pre.ferential trade with Australia. That country, I would remind honourable members, raises, in taxation about ,£126,000,000 annually, and spends £31,000,000 annually upon its Navy and ,£27,000,000 upon its Army. In. addition, the annual interest upon its national debt is ^£28,000,000. We have a big debt, but I think everybody will admit that there is an immense difference between ourindebtedness and that of Great Britain. The debt of the Old Country is chiefly the result of wars, and consequently no revenue is being received to meet the interest bill, whereas we have assets which are returning interest upon the capital that has been expended. I suppose that there are capitalists in the world who would be prepared to take over the railways of the Commonwealth and in return to guarantee the interest upon our national indebtedness. A - country occupying that position may reasonably be asked to Sanction a The Federal scheme of old-age pensions which will have no taint of charity about it, and which will apply to all British subjects who have lived in the Commonwealth for the prescribed period.",32
220,Mr WILKS,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"Dalley) [4.35] - I must compliment the honourable' member for Wide Bay upon his ingenuity in securing the discussion of this question today. In the form in which the proposal relating to it stood upon the business paper yesterday, probably we should not have dealt with it during the currentsession. The leader of the Labour Party and other honourable members might then have justly been charged with having merely placed a placard before the people. It is a singular thing that both in the Old Country and in Australia the question of old-age pensions has been used as a stalking horse by political parties. Mr Chamberlain introduced it as a stalking horse for preferential trade. Here the reason alleged for increased Tariff taxation was the necessity of providing funds for the payment of old age pensions. The deputy leader of the Opposition has rendered good service to the community by the amendment which he has foreshadowed. He desires to place upon record the inactivity displayed by both the present and past Parliaments in not giving effect to a Federal scheme of old-age pensions. I have a further amendment to submit upon the proposal of the honourable member for Wide Bay. I intend to move the addition to the words proposed to be inserted by the honourable member for Wide Bay of the words "" and further, this House is of opinion that the Government should give effect to such expressed will of the people during'this session."" It is all very well for the honourable member for Wide Bay to emphasize the urgency of this question and for the honourable member for Barrier to-talk about the hardships inflicted upon indigent persons in Broken Hill who are unable to secure relief because they were born in South Australia.",33
221,Mr CARR,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,The Prime Minister promised to bring forward a Bill dealing with the matter.,34
222,Mr WILKS,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,That is not sufficient. This very measure was promised last Parliament. If the leader of the Labour Parliament consulted not only Mr. Speaker but the Prime Minister as to the means by which he might be enabled to discuss this question-,34
223,Mr FISHER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,I mentioned Prime Minister.,34
224,Mr WILKS,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"I am not going to put any construction upon the honourable member's action in consulting Mr Speaker. This question can be dealt with this session ; and as the honourable membei f01 Wide Bay was some time ago a most powerf u l advocate for Parliament sitting continuously, I urge the Labour Party, who have placed old-age pensions in the forefront of their programme for years, to accept my suggested amendment, if the present motion is not merely a method of conveying to the electors the fact that the question has not beeri forgotten. These discussions do not feed the indigent poor of Australia ; and we are almost unanimously agreed that the proposed system of relief is the correct one. Indeed, I would go further than the honourable member foe Wide Bay, and suggest that, not only the aged poor, but the invalid poor, should be provided for.",34
225,Mr FISHER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"We have no mandate for that, though I agree with the suggestion.",34
226,Mr WILKS,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,That is the direction in which schemes of this nature are tending at.the present time. The honourable member for Parramatta was very earnest in his declaration that this was no party question ; and I think we all agree that the necessities of the poor should not be used for political or party purposes.,34
227,Mr FISHER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"I said that I believed that nine-tenths of the members were pledged to the system. . Mr Wilks - I do not think that any pledge is required in this humanitarian age As to the financial difficulties, I suggested to the Prime Minister eighteen months ago that, instead of waiting for the Premiers, he could, by an arrangement with the Governments of the States, effect the desired object. But now that the Premiers are to .meet in Melbourne, what more important subject could be considered by them? I have no desire to wait for any fancy financial arrangements, because I am satisfied that, if by instituting a Federal scheme, we relieve, as we shall do, the Governments of New South Wales and Victoria of an annual expenditure of about £ 1 . 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 , there will be no difficulty. It has been said that the present state of the financeswill not permit of old-age pensions, but we must not forget that during this vear £ 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 has been realized from Customs and Excise in excess of what was antiit to the cipated by the Treasurer. Surely out of such a sum old-age pensions could he financed without the necessity of imposing; fresh taxation. The honourable member for Barrier is of opinion that direct taxation should be resorted to in this connection ; but I am not concerned with the ear-marking of revenue, in view of the fact that there has been this immense extra return from Customs and Excise- a return which, by the way, was most. accurately forecast by the honourable member for Parramatta over twelve months ago. . The .Prime Minister has said that he wiU'introduce an OldAge Pensions Bill , and, if that be so, we certainly ought to continue this session untir it has been dealt with. What is the use of telling the old men and women, who are waiting for pensions, that their wants will be relieved at the end of the next seven or ten years?",34
228,Mr FISHER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,Does the honourable member suggest that the matter should be dealt with during this short session ?,34
229,Mr WILKS,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"Why should this be a short session, if we believe that the aged poor are in want of relief? I may say that, some years ago, I had the privilege of being a member of the first Parliamentary Committee which dealt with this question in New South Wales, and I had the further privilege of supporting a Bill in the Parliament of that State. In my opinion, the honourable member for Parramatta has justly spoken of the delay there has been on the part of this House in the past. The probable recipients of old-age pensions are not a political force and influence which can be brought to bear on honourable mem bers who neglect promises; but' the Prime Minister is of a humane nature, and he knows that, if the session is prolonged, there should be no difficulty in dealing with this question. We have already had three months' holiday, and I see no desperate hurrv to rush into recess, especially as we have time after time been told that the winter is the proper time for our work. All the circumstances are favourable, and I ask the Labour Partv to support the amendment I have foreshadowed.",34
230,Mr FRAZER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"Kalgporlie) U-.S*]-- I agree with the honourable member for Dalley that this question has reacherl such a stage - as to justify a very definite statement frpm the leader of .the Government. I deal with the question very briefly at the present time, understanding and believing that 99 per cent, of honourable members believe that the institution of a fund for the purpose of - old-age pensions is desirable. Under the - circumstances, I think we may reasonably review the attitude which honourable members have taken up in regard to this question during the sey^ln years' existence of the Federal Parliament. I do not conceal the fact that I am disappointed at the attitude of the Government. . I have a distinct recollection of members of the Federal Government some years ago touring - different towns in Australia, and, with tears in their voices,. picturing the hardships under which the aged poor laboured; and, - so far as the general public are concerned, the great bulk of them have for years past thought that this Parliament might, at any time, provide old-age (pensions. The Government must bear the bulk of the respon-sibilitv, for fhey have been in office about - six years out of the seven. We are told that the financial position does not justify - old-age pensions, although in each successive Governor General's speech we have been assured that an effort would be made - to meet the necessities of the case.

236,Mr FRAZER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"T he Prime Minister having said that he is going to introduce a Bill , must accept the responsibility of admitting that he is not in a position to say . when pensions, in the event of the Bill being passed, will be paid to the old people. The Prime Minister nods an assent, and I admire the honourable gentleman's frankness. He does not appear to be ""san- guine as to the possibility of doing anything until the expiration of the Braddon provision.",35
237,Mr DEAKIN,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,Quite true.,35
238,Mr FRAZER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"In my humble judgment, an Administration which at this stage accepts the position that old-age pensions cannot be paid until there has been an alteration of the Braddon provision, does not deserve the confidence of the House.",35
239,Mr DEAKIN,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"The honourable member must realise that there is now much greater pressure upon the Premiers to come to an agreement than there has been previously, and that it gets stronger every month.",35
240,Mr FRAZER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,Our experience of Premiers' Conferences does not justify us in believing that the next Conference will bring about the adoption of a scheme satisfactory to the Commonwealth.,35
241,Mr DEAKIN,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,We are twelve months nearer 1910 than we were last year.,35
242,Mr FRAZER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"Yes ; but I think that the Premiers believe that they can force their opinions on this Parliament by exerting their influence at the next elections. I do not think that they can, and I hope that they will not. Nevertheless, they seem to believe that their opinions are those of the people of the States, and therefore they are not likely to make concessions now which they have been unwilling to make previously.",35
243,Mr MCWILLIAMS,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,Did not Mr Kidston say so during his electoral campaign?,36
244,Mr FRAZER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"I think he indicated unmistakably that that would be his titude, and I am of opinion that some of the others will be still more difficult deal with. I fear that there will be no satisfactory arrangement with the Preproposals. miers, and that the matter will not be protroduced perly dealt with, until this Parliament takes it in hand after the expiration of Braddon provision has taken from the States the right to interfere. This posithat tion is, to my mind, a most unsatisfactory one. Approximately £5,000,000 have been returned to the States since Federaand tion, which the Commonwealth could have expended in paying old-age pensions, for any other Federal purpose. The vernment, instead of using that money as to help the poor. the nucleus of a Commonwealth old-age pensions fund, has shown anything anxiety to give effect to this benevolent idea. Although the establishment of a Commonwealth system of old-age pensions has been promised in the speeches of the Governor General, the Government, inmotives stead of making provision for it, has taken posal. over the Meteorological Departments of the States, has incurred responsibility for agrisatisfied cultural bounties amounting to thousands nothing to say. per annum, has proposed the granting of an expensive bounty for the production of iron, has embarked on costly defence schemes, has undertaken to appoint a High Commissioner, has engaged to take over the control of the Northern TerritoryWhich will mean an almost certain deficit £250,000 per annum-and has expressed to its willingness to enter upon other large enterprises, all of which are to take prescheme cedence of the establishment of pensions fund. I do not say that these proposals are not important; but, in my humble judgment, the payment of pensions to our aged poor is of more importance.",36
245,Mr WYNNE,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,The Government has done its best.,36
246,Mr FRAZER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"Minister s may desire to do their best, but they have failed to adopt means worthy of consideration establishing a Commonwealth old-age pensions fund.",36
247,Mr WYNNE,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,Why does not the honorprobably able member blame the States as well ?,36
248,Mr FRAZER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,We are responsible for bur own failings.,36
249,Sir JOHN FORREST,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,The Government tried to pass a Bill to provide for old-age pensions.,36
250,Mr FRAZER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"If we are content to atpropose financial schemes to the States which they reject, we are'blameworthy, and to the Government is more sanguine than experience justifies of the success of its new Some time ago a Bill was infor the raising of special duties to provide revenue for the establishment of the a Commonwealth old-age pensions fund, and, although I voted for it, I considered it was ah objectionable proposal, because the intention evidently was to raise money by means of duties on tea, kerosene, other necessaries of which the poor are larger users than the rich. It therefore or proposed class taxation. Go Sir JOHN FORREST - It was an attempt",36

252,Mr FRAZER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"I do not question the of those who put forward the pro to accept it, there would have been",36
253,Mr FRAZER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"The people might have said, as I did, that, although they did not like the scheme, they would accept it as better than nothing. The Government has not indicated that it intends to put forward a similar proposal. Ministers say now of that, if the Conference of Premiers agreestheir financial scheme, they will provide old-age pensions at once, but that if that is rejected, we must wait until the an old-age Braddon section expires.",36
254,Mr DEAKIN,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,That is so.,36
255,Mr FRAZER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"The attitude of the Government is eminently unsatisfactory,, seeing that there are other resources available for making provision for our aged poor. I express merely my own opinion; I am not trying to influence other members of my party.",36
256,Sir JOHN FORREST,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"Every member of for that party seems to be "" on his own.""",36

258,Sir JOHN FORREST,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,-The member did the same in regard to me.,37
259,Mr FRAZER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"Yes , and we shall probably do it again next election. The attitude of the Government is eminently .unsatisfactory to me. After seven years of waiting, we are told that unless .six Premiers accept a Commonwealth proposal, a thing that they have never yet done, our aged poor must wait another two years for relief, notwithstanding the resources available for providing an old-age pensions fund. This position of affairs does not do us credit, and I am prepared"" to vote for an alteration. Mr KING O'MALLEY £5.10] - I desire to congratulate leader of the Labour Party on the moderation displayed by him in presenting this matter to the consideration of honourable members, and also to compliment the Prime Minister on his good judgment in at once recognising that it was a question for the whole House. The deputy leader of the Opposition, however, was not quite fair in suggesting - that the Labour Party had not endeavoured, in and out of Parliament, to persuade the Government fo bring in the - necessary Bill .",37
260,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,I simply quoted the thrice-repeated statement made by the orable member's leader.,37
261,Mr KING OMALLEY,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"My leader is new to the business. On this question I the leader, because I was the first to notice of motion in this House as to the desirableness of establishing a Federal tem of old-age pensions. The Labour Party has since kept the flag flying. I order to show that the honourable member for Parramatta was labouring under a apprehension when he asserted that the Labour Party had done nothing in seven years to hasten on the movement, I would - point out that some three years and ago-namely , on 17 th November, 1904we discussed in this House the financial aspect of the question, and that I then pointed out many methods of raising the necessary revenue.",37
262,Mr KELLY,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,The deputy leader of Opposition did not say that the Labour Party had not talked about the matter. His complaint was that they. had done nothing. Mr KING O'MALLEY - There is a We difference between remaining silent and deavouring to persuade the Government of ' the day to take action. But we honourable no right to attempt to bulldose the Government. No honourable man at the head of an Administration would submit to the dictation of any party if it went beyond what was reasonable and just.,37
263,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,The'leade r of the Labour Party said that he had never approached the Government.,37
264,Mr KING OMALLEY,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"He said that he had not brought any pressure to bear on the Government. I am sure that the Opposition desire, like the Labour Party, to be absolutely fair, but they are not always so. On 17th November, 1904, when the financial aspect of the question was (Darwin) discussed in this House, I saidthe I suggest that the Prime Minister should enter into negotiations with trie Premiers of the States, with a view to procuring the passing of States Acts authorizing the Commonwealth Treasurer to retain the full amount of revenue raised by special Customs taxation for the purpose of providing for Commonwealth old-age pensions. If that were done, I should be willing to vote for the imposition of duties on tea and kerosene, which would provide a large part of the money required. I make this quotation from the Hansard report of my speech in order to set the deputy leader of the Opposition right, so that he may be able to look at himself in a glass and feel that he is still a Christian. The honhonorable member must recognise that he has made a mistake in charging us with inaction, since we . have attempted in this am House, by every means at our disposal, to give expedite the passing of an Old-age Pensions Act. We have not only endeavoured systo press this question forward, but have shown how such a scheme could be financed. n The necessary revenue might be obtained,' for instance, by nationalizing the tobacco mismonopoly. It could also be obtained by nationalizing the liquor monopoly. Could we do better than utilize the vast amount of wealth that goes to create hundreds Of a half drunkards in the Commonwealth in a scheme to assist the aged poor? Then again, we could raise revenue for this purpose by means of a graduated land tax, in respect of unimproved land values with an exemption of £ 5 , 0 0 0 . There are many the other ways in which the necessary funds could be provided, but the question of finance is not one for the Labour Party to solve. If we attempted to solve it we should usurp the functions of the Ministry. have no desire to do more than persuade enthe Ministry, whom we believe to be as anxious as we are to secure a Federal syshave tem, to take action without further delav. Unfortunately, however, in this country we have cheques and bank balances, stone walls, bridges, and hurdles, and all sorts of obstacles that have to be surmounted before we can get the real article. The right honourable member for Swan seemed somewhat disposed to object-althoug h he did not completely do so-to the nationalization of an old-age pension scheme on the ground that under it Western Australia would have to pay more than her fair proportion towards its maintenance. That is true. The Royal Commission, of which I was a member, took evidence in Western Australia, and was informed by the State Statistician that, on the basis of the equity of its requirements, Western Australia would have to pay a little more under a national scheme than she would be called upon to pay under a State system of old age pensions. That, however, is due to the fact that she is, comparativelv speaking, still very young, and has within her borders a smaller proportion of aged population than have the other States. In a few years, however, the proportion of aged people in Western Australia will be as large as it is in other States of the Commonwealth, and it is' not humane for a State to object to such a project as this on the ground that under it she might lose a little. Under the Constitution - Western Australia was 1 granted the right to maintain for five years a special Tariff on a sliding scale. really was an infringement of the rights of the other States, but neither little Tasmania nor Victoria raised any objection. However we may adjust the system of distribution, some one must suffer. We are all one people, and I am sorry to hear men who call themselves statesmen speaking in this connection of territorial divisions. Even the Apache Indians look after their old .people, and the old Cherokee chiefs take care of the aged members of their tribe.",37
265,Mr MCDOUGALL,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,They do not use tomahawk on them ?,38
266,Mr KING OMALLEY,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"No ; the tomahawk is used in Christian countries. It might almost be as well to tomahawk some of our old people as to allow hundreds of them to starve as they do. Objection should not be raised to a Federal system of old age pensions on the ground that one State might have to pay a little more than her fair share of the cost of it. Western Australia has gained at the expense of the other States. Many young, able-bodied men left Tasmania, New South Wales, pension ?' Queensland, and other parts of the Commonwealth for Western Australia.",38
267,Mr HEDGES,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,They showed their good sense. Mr KING O'MALLEY - The honourable member himself went to Western Australia from another State. Many men from the eastern States used their wealth and the education they had received at the expense of those States in the development of Western Australia. I am sorry that the foremost statesman from Western Australia should be disposed to object to a national system of old-age pensions on the ground that uncler it that State would suffer.,38
268,Sir JOHN FORREST,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"I am pledged to support old-age pensions, and but for my action the power to establish a Federalsystem would not have been given us under the Constitution. ' Mr KING O'MALLEY - That is so. At the Melbourne sittings of the Convention, the Hon. J. H . Howe, of South Australia, moved the inclusion of the necessary power in the Federal Constitution, and Mr Hassell, of Western Australia, seconded the motion. The Emrjeror of the West then came forward and carried it. Had he opposed it, I am certaijn that it would have been lost. The honourable member for Barrier was somewhat sarcastic iri__ his references to the members of the Royal That Commission.",38
269,Mr THOMAS,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"No . Mr KING O'MALLEY - The honourable ' member, if not vicious, was unspiritual in his references to it. The Commission examined many witnesses, including officers of the States whose duty it was under local old-age pensions schemes to inquire into the ability of men and women to maintain their fathers and mothers, who had applied for pensions. We were told again ancl again by them that men worth a a lot of money had sometimes refused to help their fathers or their mothers. I am in favour of a universal system of old-age pensions, and not of a charity dole; but I want some sort of antiquated or dark-age method of pinching the rooster who will not pay a little towards the maintenance of his family. In China parents who give their children an education, and qualify them for the battle of life, are held in the highest honour.",38
270,Mr THOMAS,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"Do we ask the son of a Judge.to pay a part of the Judge's Mr KING O'MALLEY - I admit that the arguments of the honourable member upon the other side are very strong. I should like to see a universal old-age pension adopted, and I may add that I should have no hesitation in drawing it. But this is the position: Why should a man who is worth £1,000 or £8,000 refuse to support his mother?",38
271,Sir JOHN FORREST,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"That has not happened. Mr KING O'MALLEY - The Commission took evidence upon that aspect of the case. When it commenced its inquiries, I held the view that any Federal old-age pensions scheme Should be universal in its application. But after many witnesses, who were examined on oath, had testified that persons were inmates of the destitute asylum, whose sons were possessed of several thousand acres of land and money in the bank, the spirit of resentment was aroused in me. I would not allow those persons to evade their responsibility. It seems to me that the more money some persons get the more heart'less they become. They are absolutely losing their Christianity. In fact, wealthy men are dying from a slow method of social consumption. I admit that one cannot serve both God and Mammon.' One can live in this country without brains, but he cannot live without money.  possesses £10,000, and who refuses to support his mother? Mr KING O'MALLEY - I did not make that statement. I do not believe in establishing an inquisition in connection with the payment of old-age pensions, but I do believe that persons possessed of wealth ought to support their parents.  ber know that the report of the Commission which he signed recommends all the inquisitorial conditions in which he says he does not believe? Mr KING O'MALLEY - That is not so. . So far, old-age pensions have not been adopted in the United States. Yet I learn from the New York American that at the present time there is a Bill before the New York State Assembly providing for the payment of old-age pensions, and that President Roosevelt is working to secure its adoption nationally.",39
272,Mr THOMAS,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"In America there is a big pension scheme for soldiers. Mr KING O'MALLEY - No old soldier there ever finds his way into the destitute asylum, and until his last child' is twenty-one years of age, the children continue to draw hispension. From the journal to which I have just referred, I ' quote the followingAlbany, February 2 - Assemblyma n GeorgeA - Voss, of Kings, has invited Andrew Carnegieand Edward Everett Hale to personally appear before the Legislature to urge the passage of .his Old-Age Pension Bill . Voss maintains that President Roosevelt is doing all he can to makethe project apply to the country at large, and that through the British Parliament. Mr Henrv Asquith promises soon to have enacted a similar law for King Edward's Empire. Already the scheme is said to be working admirably in New Zealand. The Voss Bill grants every native resident of this State, of 60 years or over, whohas no other means of support,, a pension of $12 a month, provided he has lived here continuously a quarter of a century. l i e must never have been convicted of crime, must be a legal citizen, and incapable of maintaining himself. Assemblyman Voss says : "" Such a law would encourage better citizenship, and deplete the alms houses, which are little better 'thanprisons, and whose inmates have absolutely lost their independence. Andrew Carnegie has put the plan into execution Tn several of the Scottish shires."" When we have a good old horse, who has served us faithfully for years, we do not turn him out on to the metalled road to starve. On the contrary, we turn him into the best paddock that we have, and if we have no paddock we send him to eternal sleep with a friendly bullet. But when the old soldier of industry has finished his career in a new and progressive country he is turned out on the metalled road to starve, or to read on the estates of the rich signboards announcing, "" Old men and dogs shot here;"" I say that it is not a Christian country which forces old men to have recourse to begging, and which compels them to' reduce the standard of wages, because they are unable to live without securing employment.",39
273,Mr WILKS,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,Does that state of affairs exist here today? Mr KING O'MALLEY - Yes .,39
274,Mr WILKS,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"Then the honourable member should vote for my amendment. Mr KING O'MALLEY - But I am a friend of the Government, and I believe that their intentions are good. The Prime Minister means well, and I must credit him with one of the greatest diplomatic acts of the age in securing to the Commonwealth a visit from the American tfleet..

I may inform honourable members that Victoria pays in the way of pensions to its public serpockets vants than do all the other Australian States and New Zealand combined. When we were asked where the monev for these pensions would come from, the answer the party with which I am associated, was, ""Take it from the Consolidated Resuch venue."" That is my reply to the indeparture quiry which has been put by several honof the country have in view. orable members to-dav, as to' where 1 can' obtain the funds with which to finance a Federal scheme of old-age pensions.",40

281,Mr MALONEY,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"No . It would appear that honourable members on all sides favour old-age pensions; and, when the Bill is troduced, let us translate our opinions action. The honourable member for Parrapensions matta has stigmatized my party; but I - have a keen recollection of one occasion five honourable members, following his destroyed the whole of the work of the session. However, the voters of New South Wales so resented this conduct that, at the next election, they returned only 50 per cent, of the honourable gentleman's supporters.

There are only three of them left, and I think the of those who are still-here is the leader of the Opposition. I shall vote for the motion, and if it be decided that anything shall be done this session, I hope the Prime Minister will see his way to introduce a measure, and claim the aid of the Opposition in passing it. If a fresh form of taxation is required to finance the scheme I hope we shall have the support .of the deputy leader of the Opposition in this connection, seeing that he is so favourable infamous. to old-age pensions.  for the remarks of the two last speakers, should not have occupied the time of honhow orable members. While quite prepared to warmly support a Federal old-age pensions scheme, I cannot, for one moment, endorse more a proposal to take money out of the of the people by means of taxation, and then hand it back in the form of pensions. The honourable member for Darwin says that, although he enjoys the liberal of stipend of a member of this House, he is prepared to take an old-age pension; but a scheme as this involves, is a grave from the object which the people We are we sympathetic with the aged poor and are prepared to assist them, but I am strongly of opinion that a universal scheme would be so repugnant to the general public that a it would be' impossible for Parliament to pass it. Under the Victorian scheme, it may be supposed that in some applications for pensions, revelations are sometimes inmade which are repugnant to the applicant. into But, under the first scheme in Victoria, were granted without any publicity, and, of course, the expenditure grew apace. There is no degradation in persons in need receiving assistance, or in their cases being made more orless public; because, if their relatives are in a position to support them, they ought to be called upon to do so.",40

So far as people who canmerely not maintain themselves, are concerned, we are under an obligation to see that no one dies of starvation in the Commonwealth, but that the aged poor shall receive assistorder. ance to enable them to end their days in some comfort.

286,Mr BAMFORD,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"Herbert) [5.53] Should a division be taken, it is my intention to vote for the 'amendment foresharight dowed by the honourable member for There is Dallev, but I shall take time tb consider my attitude in regard to the other amend There has been a great. deal of beating the air in regard to the question this The honourable member for Kalgoorlie expressed the opinion that full y 99 per cent, of honourable members are got bein favour of a Federal old-age pensions scheme, but I believe that the whole of are perfectly in accord with the This is a policy which commends itself to the humane feelings of - every one, so that objections cannot be anticipated. ' All that remains to be considI am ered is the financing of the scheme; and to one honourable member contended that a land tax, while.it might not provide the ' whole of the necessary money would, at any rate, provide a considerable proportion. The party to which I have the honour to belong have on every occasion stated their intention, on the first opportunity, to impose a graduated land tax, with, to my mind, a much too high exemption. But if the specific purpose of such a land tax were effected,, there would be no revenue from that source. The idea of imposing a land tax is to burst up the large estates held in Victoria and New South Wales, not with a view to raising revenue, but with a view to promoting settlement; so that, as the tax was effective, there would be a diminishing revenue. I voted for the proposal for special taxation for this purpose; and I am sorry that it was defeated in another place; but, at the same time, I must say that, while I so voted, I knew that the proposal would be the means of imposing a tax on people least able to bear it, because it would have resolved itself into duties on kerosene and tea. whilst willing to accept that means of providing revenue for a Commonwealth old age pensions fund, I felt that it would do a certain amount of injury. compelled to its acceptance by facts within my own knowledge with regard to the circumstances of the people. In New South Wales I know a family where the mother and father are both incapacitated from doing anvthing to help themselves; but, although qualified in other respects, they have not been long enough in that State to make them eligible for an old-age pension. Under a Federal pension scheme, they would be qualified. Those responsible for the keep of these two old people would willingly pay increased duties to obtain the pension. The poorer classes would rather pay a little more on the necessaries of life than be deprived of the advantages of the old-age pension system.",41

The Commonwealth, however, has made no provision for pensions for its public servants or the Justices of the High Court, and we are not concerned with what has been done by the States. Until the Braddon provision expires, it seems to me that we can make provision for a Commonwealth old-age pensions fund only by the nationalization of industries. It is questionable whether we have the power to nationalize ;. but we have not yet made the attempt. The tobacco and sugar industries, if nationalized, would provide all the money necessary for a Commonwealth old age pensions fund.",42

Those who have study of the financial position of the monwealth realise how difficult it is to make provision under the Constitution for an old age pensions fund.

Not only did I support the measure which, in New South Wales, provided for the payment of old-age pensions the State, but I also favour the transference of control in this matter to the in opCommonwealth. I do so for several The reasons, one alone of which I think is ample-the gross injustice of the present memarrangement. A man who has lived continuously in one State for twenty-five vears or more receives a pension on arriving at a certain age, while another man, who may have been much longer, indeed born, in Australia, is prevented from getting pension because he has migrated do from State to State - having perhapshelped more in this way than the staya at-hpme to develop the country - without living long enough in one State to I am, therefore, strongly in favour of the federalization of old-age pensions.

317,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"They are reflecting on every one else who worked for it. Was it the Labour Party that introduced an old-age pensions system in . New Zealand? As a matter of fact, there was no Labour Party in existence there when it was established, nor is there one in existence in New Zealand at the present time. Was it the Labour Party that introduced it in New South Wales? It merely joined with others in passing an old-ctge pensions scheme.",44

340,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,It is impossible to pass an effective scheme in the short time available to us.,45

342,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"Surely the session is not going to be interminable ? The general anticipation is that it will not be a long one, but if it extends to the close of this Parliament we might be able to do what the honourable member proposes. I am not prepared, however, to fix any exact time within which this scheme should be carried into effect. It would be unjust to do so. I shall support the further amendment moved by the honourable member, provided that he will amend it by substituting for the date named the words "" without delay.""",45
343,Mr WILKS,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"What does the honourable member mean by the words "" without delay "" ? Does he suggest that the scheme should be carried out before 1920?",45
344,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,When it is impossible to name a date within which a certain proposal s'hall be carried out it is absurd to attempt to fix one. - Mr Wilks - Then it is equally absurd to blame others for their failure to take action within a certain time.,45
345,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,I am not blaming others.,45
346,Mr WILKS,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,The honourable member is supporting the amendment moved by the deputy leader of the Opposition.,45
347,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,The honourable member does not know what I intend to do in regard to that amendment. t is true that I said that it expressed the exact situation.,45
348,Mr FISHER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,I deny absolutely that it expresses what I said.,45
349,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"I did not hear that part of the honourable member's speech to which it relates, so that I cannot express 'any opinion on that part of it ; but it is wrong to suggest that I am casting reflections on others. I am merely replying to a .charge of insincerity which has been levelled at the Opposition. Those who make it have the most slender reason for doing so. I am noF"" suggesting that they have dishonoured their pledges; I merely say that in alleging insincerity on the part of the Opposition they are overlooking the fact that their own case for sincerity, viewed from the same standpoint, is a very poor one. I recognise that financial adjustments will have to be niad^ to secure the amount necessary to provide for a Federal system of old-age pensions. It is true that at present, in round numbers, 2,780,000 of the total population of Australia are living under an old-age pensions system, and if Queensland and South Australia-bot h of which are OF have been under Labour Governments, or subject to Labour domination-ha d adopted this system there would have been a total of 3,704,000 living under it. I do not doubt that both those States before long will pass old-age pensions schemes, even if a Federal system be not adopted. When that step is taken, the additional expenditure required in respect of a Federal system will not be very large.",45
350,Mr WATSON,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,The honourable member is not taking into account the bookkeeping provisions of the Constitution. Each State has to carry its own burden in that regard.,45
351,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,I am merely showing what proportion of the population is living under an old-age pensions system. Queensland has shown some indication of an intention to adopt such a scheme.,45
352,Mr ARCHER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,The Premier of Queensland is pledged to it.,45
353,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"South Australia is also likely to f all into line. When they do we shall have 3,794,000 of the people of the Commonwealth under such a system, and provision will have only to be made for the remaining 442,000 of the population of Australia. Thus, if four States adopt separate schemes, the additional expenditure to provide federally for the whole of the people of Australia will not be very great. Mr WATKINS:-But the honourable membe ber would not call upon those States which have old-age pensions schemes in force to piecemeal. pay for them, and at the same time require them to bear part of the cost of viding ior the rest of the Commonwealth",45
354,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"No . The States would be dealt with individually. The Koyal Commission on Old-Age sions estimated that an annual expendituie of £1,500,000 would be necessary to profound vide for a Federal system. New South Wales is now annually expending nearly £500,000, and it may be fairly assumed that the total expenditure of New South disposition to give and take. Wales and Victoria in this respect is rather more than ,£800,000 per annum.",46
355,Mr CROUCH,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"Victori a has recently inDalley. creased its maximum pension from 7s. to ios. per week. - Mr DUGALD THOMSON - So that Personally, its total expenditure in this regard haye increased. That being so, if the estimate of the Royal Commission is correct, we shall require for a Federal system from £650,000 to £700,000. ger annum more than is now being paid by way of bid-age pensions. Some adjustsystem. ments will have to be made between the Commonwealth and the States that are sions already paying these pensions. If they decline to allow their present contributions to go into a general fund the Government will be faced with a new nnancial diffisume, culty.",46
356,Mr WATSON,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,Most likely they will do so.,46
357,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"-In that case provision may have to be made for an expenditure of not £650,000, but £1,500,000 per annum. That is one of the difficulties that have to be faced. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer cover its cost. have indicated that they are endeavouring to formulate a scheme for the adjustment of the financial relations of the Commonsons wealth and the States, and that settlement should not be confined to oniy one or items. An endeavour should be made to permanently settle the whole of the finanbe cial relations of the Commonwealth and the States, including the establishment of Federal system of old-age pensions, proupon vision for the transfer of the States' debts, and for payment for transferred proper- ' quire. ties, and an arrangement which, while it would render unnecessary the continuation of the Braddon section of the Constitution, would guarantee that the States would not left in an unsound financial position. It would be idle to settle all these matters",46
358,Mr WATSON,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,It might be a good thing proto have the question of old-age pensions ? dealt with separately.,46
359,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"It might be. But in the .adjustments which will Penhave to be made between the Commonwealth and the States, it will probably be easier to settle several questions at once than to deal with them separately, because, where several questions are concerned, there will naturally be more of a It is for. now that reason that I cannot support the amendment of the honourable member for Some honourable members - have referred to the desirableness of establishing a universal system of old-age pensions. that suggestion does not find will favour with me, for the reason that if £1,500,000 be required to cover the cost of a system under which pensions will be granted only to those who require them, a very much larger sum would have to be provided to cover the cost of a universal In that regard I would point out that those who really require old-age pencertainly contribute to the revenue out of which those pensions are paid. They contribute directly through the Customs in proportion to the goods which they conand they also contribute indirectly to an extent which we cannct fathom, because a large portion, we cannot say how much, of any taxation imposed passes on to the masses of the community. Under a universal system of old-age pensions, these persons would be compelled to contribute towards tha additional amount, probably three or four times as much, required to In other. words, tliey would be contributing a large additional sum for the payment of pensions to perwho are well-to-do. My opinion is that, while there may be grave doubts as to two whether many old persons who are badly off have really earned pensions, there can no doubt that those who have done well in the country, and who have reaped their a reward, .should not be permitted to come it for an additional reward in the shape of a pension which they do not re",46

Further, . there have been ' various Conferences of the Premiers of the States, at which opportunities have been presented for pressing this matter on the consideration of the Federal Government, but nothing has been done in a way which would seem to show that the States are very sincere or earnest in the matter. my opinion the lion in the path has always been the difficulty in satisfactorily settling the financial relations as between the States and the Commonwealth. Efforts have been made, but without success, to bring the States into line. there been a sincere desire to settle the great financial questions, they could have been settled much more advantageously i ri the early years of Federation than they can now. This question, too, could have been ' more easily dealt with a few years ago 'than at the present time., I have always been of the opinion that old-age pensions should be under the control of the Commonwealth, to secure uniformity of treatment.

Ministers tell us that they intend tq push them forward.",49
392,Mr FULLER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,Why have they not done so during the last seven years?,49
393,Mr KNOX,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"I am not prepared to individualize the responsibility for the delay which has occurred, and I am not in the habit of supporting proposals not - likely to have practical effect. Therefore I shall not vote for the amendment of the honourable member for Dalley, because it seems to .me impossible to deal with this matter in the present session, unless it is to be a much longer one than is anticipated. Much, however, will be gained by an expression of opinion on the part of .the House that the Government must hurry up. Ministers might reply, "" We are hurrying up as much as we reasonably can under all the circumstances.''",49
394,Mr MCDONALD,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,That is what they have said.,49
395,Mr KNOX,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"The Labour Party is to In be complimented for having secured an expression of opinion from honourable members generally in favour of what is one of the main planks in its platform; although its members are not the only persons, who are in earnest about this matter. We all Had desire a Commonwealth old-age pensions system; but we wish to see it provided for in a manner which will not cause injury to - any one. I hope that the deputy leader of the Opposition will not press his amendment. . Mr Webster (Gwydir) [8.11] - I should not have joined in the discussion had it not been for the attack on the Labour Party made by the deputy leader of the Opposition in his suggested amendment.",49
396,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,I quoted the words used by the leader of the Labour Party.,50
397,Mr WEBSTER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,H is words have not been fairly quoted-.,50
398,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,We - have a proof of the Hansard report of his speech.,50
399,Mr WEBSTER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"So , too, have we, and it has been read to the Chamber by an honourable, member on this side. there are questions which it may be to some extent permissible to treat as frivolous, this is not a matter out of which honourable members should try to extract amusement, to the injury of the dignity of the Chamber. There should be no political trickery in dealing with it , nor should it be treated as it has been treated by members of the Opposition.",50
400,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,I shall always be prepared to follow the honourable member on matters affecting decorum.,50
401,Mr WEBSTER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"If I knew the honourable member to be following me, I should doubt the propriety of my conduct. I do not concur in all that has been said by the members of my own party. It is the easiest thing in the world to condemn j but I shall not abuse the Government for not having dealt with this big problem in the seven years which have elapsed since the inauguration of Federation. opinion, they have' done all that they could to further a settlement of the question. The attack made on them by the Opposition was made merely for electioneering purposes, and to throw dust into the eyes of the people: Members opposite forget that history records every effort made by the Government in this connection.",50
402,Mr BOWDEN,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"The debate was started by the Labour Party, for platform purposes.",50
403,Mr ATKINSON,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,And the party's complaint has been that the Government has not moved fast enough.,50
404,Mr WEBSTER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"The leader of the party did not make that complaint; he merely asserted that the time has arrived when the Government should take a step forward. The establishment of a Commonwealth old-age pensions scheme is not a nebulous idea with the Labour Party, it is one of the main planks of our platform. We have not framed our programme to meet political exigencies, but to deal with the needs of the community. aretherefore justified in asking that effect shall be given to the planks of our platform at the earliest practicable opportunity. Without going over what has been said by the Prime Minister as to the actions of the Government in regard to the old-agepensions question, I unhesitatingly say that there is no legitimate ground for the assertion that Ministers have done nothing to bring about its settlement. The honourable member fo? Parramatta desires to While gain political kudos <at the expense of a party which is at least sincere in its desire for reform. He belonged to a Government which, when it had the opportunity to place an old-age pension scheme on the statute-book of New Soutli Wales, refused to move in that direction.",50
405,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,There is not a tittle of justification for that statement.,50
406,Mr WEBSTER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"Othe r members of the Opposition belong to. the old party which in New South Wales withstood the cry for old-age pensions. The Reid Government refused to give effect to the demand made upon it , both in and out of Parliament, for the establishment of an old-age pensions system.",50
407,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,There is no truth in that statement.,50
408,Mr WEBSTER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"I mention the matter only because of the .proposal of the honourable member. A leopard cannot In my change its spots, nor can a politician change his political aspirations.",50
409,Mr FULLER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,The honourable member has changed his political aspirations a couple of times. ',50
410,Mr WEBSTER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,That is an allegation that has not yet been proved.,50
411,Mr FULLER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,What has the honourable - member for Lang to say on that point?,50
412,Mr WEBSTER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,He is just about as reliable as is the honourable member. The deputy leader of the Opposition has attempted to condemn the Labour Party for its alleged inaction ,50
413,Mr MATHEWS,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"He was once a dele-, gate to a Labour Conference.",50
414,Mr WEBSTER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,And a leader of a Labour Party.,50
415,Mr KELLY,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,Without a caucus.,50
416,Mr FULLER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"He was the best leader the Labour Party ever had. Mr 'WEBSTER - Unti l he was led away by his associations. I believe that the honourable member for Parramatta knows that the allegation contained in his amendment is not correct. It is largelv due We to the Labour movement that old-age pension schemes have been brought about. That party has been responsible for the passing of many of our humane laws, and has endeavoured in more ways than one to push this question to the front. We have treated it not as a mere political placard, but as a very necessary reform, which should be carried out at the earliest possible moment. At the last general election we told the people that we were in favour of a Federal system, and when asked how we would finance it said that a progressive land tax would provide the necessary funds. - Mr WILSON - That is not the object with which the Labour Party advocated a progressive land tax.",50
417,Mr WEBSTER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"It is idle for the honourable member to attempt to dictate a policy to the Labour Party. I am speaking now of what took place in New South Wales at the last general election. When we are asked how the necessary funds can be secured, we reply that we are prepared, failing a more suitable method, to do what the Opposition dare not do, and that is to support the taxing of those who are best able to provide for those who are unable to support themselves.",51
418,Mr WILKS,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,In what way would the honourable member finance this scheme?,51
419,Mr WEBSTER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"I am not going to suggest a proposal so impracticable as that embodied in the further amendment moved by the honourable member. I believe that the party with which I am associated is prepared, if it is impossible by other means to secure the necessary revenue, to go to the land for it.",51
420,Mr WILKS,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"If the honourable member will support a land tax without.exemptions, I shall be with him.",51
421,Mr WEBSTER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"I am not so undemocratic as to suggest that men Who happen to hold that which enables them to earn a' living wage shall be taxed for this purpose, rather than those who are best able contribute to it. The honourable member - for Dalley looked as serious as a judge in moving his further amendment. He would have the people believe that'he meant everymore thing, he said, and that he was proposing something to which effect could be given.",51
422,Mr WILSON,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,Effec t could be given to it this session. ',51
423,Mr WEBSTER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"I do not think that any reasonable man will suggest that a scheme could be carried out this session. The honourable member for Kooyong is at least honest in his declaration that he is not in favour of a land tax' for the purpose of raising the funds necessary to provide for a Federal, system of old-age pensions. He has made a declaration which I am sure the deputy leader of the Opposition and some other members of his party would not dare to make. I do not intend, however, to labour this question. I think that a solution of the difficulty is to be found in the direction indicated by the Prime Minister. TJnder present conditions the only course open to the Government is to submit to the Premiers' Conference a proposal which is calculated to appeal to them. The Premiers of the States should be asked to assist the Government in making a financial adjustment that will permit of a Federal system of old-age pensions. In the absence of such an adjustment we shall have to resort to. direct taxation or wait until the Braddon section and the machinery under it can be remodelled towards the close of this or the beginning of the next .Parliament. The financial problem lies at the root of this proposal. Hitherto a practical opportunity to do anything in this direction has not presented itself: We have availed ourselves of this the first opportunity, not to dictate to or harass the' Government, but to induce it to take a step in the direction of this desirable reform.",51
424,Mr FISHER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,And have' moved always in open daylight.,51
425,Mr WEBSTER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"Exactly . We have taken care that the public shall always understand what, we desire. If the Premiers of the fourStates which have no old-age pension law in operation have any sympathy for those who are not enjoying the advantages of such legislation it will be theirduty to assist the Commonwealth Government to bring about in a short time a practicable scheme. I am prepared to give the Ministry an opportunity to .submit to the House within the next three or four weeks the proposals in this direction that to they intend to lay before the Conference of Premiers. Having.reviewed those proposals we may await the decision - of - the Conference of States Premiers before we take any determined stand towards the realization of our desire. That I feel sure is a manly, fair and correct attitude to adopt towards the Government.",51
426,Mr MCWILLIAMS,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,Then what is the object of this motion ? .,51
427,Mr WEBSTER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"We simply desired to learn what steps the Government intended to take. There has been no secret arrangement between us, and the Labour Party having no knowledge of the intentions of the Government in this regard, we submitted this motion two or three weeks before it is possible for the Ministry to take action. Having taken the earliest opportunity which presented itself of bringing the question before Parliament, we cannot honestly be taunted with neglect to urge the enactment of legislation in respect of old-age pensions.' The amendment of the deputy leader of the Opposition cannot be upheld for a single ""moment by those who desire to deal out justice to our aged poor. Of course, I realise that in modern times 1 Oppositions have degenerated. But surely they ought to recognise that' they have a duty to perform, apart from that of badgering tha Government.",51
428,Mr SPEAKER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,Is the honourable member discussing the question?,52
429,Mr WEBSTER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,I think so.,52
430,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"Who put orable member up to ""stone-wall""?",52
431,Mr WEBSTER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"Surely I may be permitted to occupy a little of the time of the House, seeing that the honourable member himself occupies so much of it. I merely rose to justify the attitude taken up by the leader of the Labour Party and by the Government in their desire to bring about an urgently-needed reform, and to expose the hypocrisy of the amendment of the deputy leader of the Opposition, and the further amendment of the honourable member for Dalley.",52
432,Mr KELLY,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"Wentworth) [8.45] - It is rather significant that a proposal submitted this afternoon- I presume, with the idea of expediting the establishment of a Federal system of old-age pensionsshould now have to be "" justified "" by Ihe honourable member for Gwydir. . f.onally I fail to see that any "" justification "" of it was necessary.",52

466,Sir JOHN FORREST,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"I am not of complaining of the honourable member, but e merely referring to the inconvenience of the I can say for myself that I is have been altogether taken by surprise. hot I do not think that the honourable member of for Wide Bay has shown sufficient reason for submitting the. motion at the present time, seeing that no one is more aware than the honourable member himself of the exact position of affairs. The question of old age pensions has been discussed for the last seven years on every platform throughparout Australia; and the Government have plainly set forth, times out of number, that financial reasons prevent the question being dealt with until 1910, when what is known as the Braddon section ceases to operate. Last session the Prime Minister took a most drastic course-whic h I think was open to a good deal of argument on the score of its wisdom-in invading this part of the Constitution, with the avowed object of hurrying on a settlement of the old-age pensions question. We know what was the fate of that measure; it passed through this House, and was lost in another place - At any rate, every one will admit that by that action last session, the Government did all they could to expedite matters. Further, His Excellency's speeches in opening Parliament have reiterated the intention of the Government to see whether means could not be found of dealing with the question. We are all aware, of these facts, and it seems to me that those honourable members who suggest that the present action is only s "" placard "" have"" some reason on their side.",54
467,Mr FRAZES,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,Does the right honourable member say that the power of taxation for old-age pensions is exhausted ?,55
468,Sir JOHN FORREST,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"Speaking generally, I do say so, unless we "" doublebank "" by entering avenues of taxation which have already been explored to a considerable extent by the States. I am not able to say the course that could be f o V>wed by the Government which would produce the necessary revenue. No one knows better than the honourable member for Wide Bay that there are a great manv obligations staring the Government in the face.",55
469,Mr FISHER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,And old-age pensions is one of them.,55
470,Sir TOHN FORREST,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"But there are a number of others, which, if not important, are pressing and almost mandatory. For instance, there is the question of defence, and the administration of Papua, in connection with which Possession there are great obligations. Then there is Northern Territory, in regard to which we have entered into an agreement with South Australia, and the Parliament of that State has passed an Act which is now awaiting the Royal assent. ' Mr MATHEWS - And there is the transcontinental railway.",55
471,Sir JOHN FORREST,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"That matter has not gone so far as an agreement, although, in my opinion, it is an obligation. When I was prosecuting my election, I said plainly that, while I was in favour of old age pensions, I did not see any likelihood of a scheme being passed by Parliament until after the end of 1910, when the Braddon section becomes alterable. For this I was taken a good deal to task by the Labour Party, who were opposing me, and I was amused at the mode in which they proposed to raise the money. Their idea was to nationalize the tobacco industry, but they forgot that, before that course could be adopted, there must be an amendment of the Constitution, so that it would be much later than i g i o before money would be available from that source. ' In other words, while they cornplained that i g i o was too far ahead, they proposed a scheme which would have put off old-age pensions to a much later period.",55
472,Mr FRAZER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,It is questionable whether an amendment of the Constitution would be necessary.,55
473,Sir JOHNFORREST,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"I think it is admitted that tin amendment would be necessary. I do not think any one can charge me with being opposed to the object which the honourable, member for Wide Bay has in view, although, by'interjection, some honourable members seem to infer that I am not in favour of old-age pensions. I may point out, however, that had I not been in favour of the Federal Government underl - taking this work, honourable members would not have had the opportunity of dealing with the auestion at the present time, because they would not have-had the power to do so. It was myself ancl the other Western Australian delegates who turned the scale at the Federal Convention in favour of the Commonwealth having control of old-age pensions. The mover, Mr Howe, of South Australia., was most persistent in his advocacy, and it is to him that most of the credit is due for the provisions in the Constitution. Mr Howe did not propose that rich and poor alike should have an oldthe age pension, and I think that had he taken that stand he would have got very little sunnort. What Mr Howe said wasWhen we come to trace the history of this question, we find th.it all the great philanthro^ pists, and many leading statesmen, of the world are endeavouring, b)' all Ihe means in their power, to solve the problem of how best to provide for the deserving and aged poor. In supporting the proposal I said It seems strange that there should be so many advocates now for old-age pensions, when I was under the impression that the prevailing idea in the Colonies was that the 'civil servants, who had spent all their years until they had become old in the service of the country, should receive no pensions. It seems that a newer light has been shed upon us, and not only are we desirous of pensioning those who have served the State, and who have grown grey in its service, but we are also desirous of pensioning every one. . There is no doubt, however, as time goes we shall have old and deserving poor here, they have in the older parts of the world. When that time does arrive, I think it would be far better for us to allow the Federal Governage ment to deal with this very great question, rather than that each State should deal with in its own particular way, I used other arguments, and eventually the proposal was agreed to, I think, after two attempts. I fear I have been misunderstood in regard to an interjection that an old-age pensions system would cost Western Australia twice as much if provided by the Commonwealth as it would if provided by the State Parliament. I did not""mean that the Commonwealth administration would be twice as costly as State administration. I am willing to believe that one would be as economical as the other. But, inasmuch as the population of Western Australia is largely composed of persons in the prime of life, and there are not many aged poor there to whom this Act would apply, the sum necessary to establish an adequate pensions fund for local State purposes would be less than £ 5 0 , 0 0 0 a year, whereas a Commonwealth pensions scheme would £1,500,000,' to which Western Australia's contribution per capita would be about £ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 . Western Australia would fore probably contribute to a Commonwealth fund £ 5 0 , 0 0 0 more than was needed for her own requirements, and this sum would be spent in relieving the aged and deserving poor in the other States. Of course, we have many deserving old men in our Benevolent Asylum; but they are mostly so decrepit that they cannot look after themselves, .and if would be cruel to induce them to take pensions. No doubt, there is a large number of deserving, old and helpless persons sfmilarly situated in the other States.",55
474,Mr FISHER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,I thought that the honourable member looked forward to the time when the Braddon provision would cease to operate.,56
475,Sir JOHN FORREST,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"So I do, with independent finance for both Commonwealth and States; but even then there will have to lie a per capita charge on the States unless the present procedure is changed. Mr 'FISHER - There would be nothing to prevent Western Australia getting special terms.",56
476,Sir JOHNFORREST,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"I hope that some fairer arrangement may be devised; but there seems a difficulty in the way. We . . do not desire that one State should provide on, money to be expended in another, though, as of course, there must be give and take. Although I have heard the subject of oldpensions referred to in all parts of Australia, and especially in this House, the it fact has been very rarely specially dwelt upon, that two of the States, whose population comprises two-thirds of that of Australia, already have old-age pensions systems, which are sucb as the Legislatures of those States are satisfied with. One would think, to hear the debates in this Chamber, that old-age pensions are not provided in Australia, whereas 3,000,000 persons have the opportunity of qualifying for them.",56
477,Mr STORRER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"Many persons residing in New South Wales and Victoria are ineligible, because they have moved from State to State without living sufficiently long in either.",56
478,Mr ATKINSON,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,That is a small matter.,56
479,Sir JOHN FORREST,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"Yes , and it could be dealt with by amending legislation. I am surprised to hear the member cost for Melbourne Ports abuse the Victorian system as if it were worse than none at all. I do not think that there- those who"" draw old-age pensions in this State would like to relinquish them. But the honourable member sneered at the Victorian Act, at the Parliament which passed it, and inferentially at - the people who' elected it, and whom he professes to represent. If the people of Victoria are - dissatisfied with their legislation, they can alter it. The honourable member for Newcastle and the honourable member for Barrier-wh o -1 understand votes and lives in South Australia, and is therefore really a South Australian-expresse d dissatisfaction with the New South Wales system.",56

481,Sir JOHN FORREST,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"The members of the Labour Party from New South Wales and Victoria do not do justice to the Parliaments of their States in this matter, and seem to more adversely criticize them than the States which have not an old-age pensions system at all. We have not had any representations ' from those States asking for old-age pensions. The representatives of Tasmania in this Chamber' are dumb on the subject.",56
482,Mr THOMAS,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,The honourable member for Darwin was the first man to mention it here. He has done a great deal for it.,57
483,Mr STORRER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"I have spoken in favour of it on every occasion.

Fortunately for them, financial considerations have hitherto made a settlement impossible, but it is still possible for the cry to serve them for one or two. elections more.",57

To night it was objected that such a tax would make the poor pay for a portion of the old-age pensions, and I interjected that the aged and deserving poor would get the whole benefit. I believe that the very poorest would willingly contribute something towards an old-age pension. am opposed to the taxation of food supplies if it can be avoided, but I see no objection to raising some of the revenue necessary for this benevolent purpose by a tax which would not press heavily on any one. Still, it was thought to be popular to say, "" We are opposed to taxing the food of the poor man,"" and that was made another platform cry, which, when analyzed, means that we want to provide for the aged poor, but rather than obtain some of the revenue necessary from a tax on tea, we will let the aged poor suffer and go without their pension, forgetting, also, that sugar is taxed to the extent of £ 6 a ton- a tax which every one has to pay. They seem to draw the line at tea, but not at sugar. I am anxious that we should have a Federal system, but am not going to say that so far as South Australia, Tasmania, andWestern Australia are concerned it is the most pressing question with which the Commonwealth is . confronted.

That is not a party question. The Government have before them a great work. The demands on the Commonwealth revenue are increasing on every hand, and in the effort to provide, out of ordinary revenue, £1,500,00 0 per annum for this purpose they may do great injury in other directions. If the proposius detion submitted last year by my honourable friend had been carried- I refer to the proposal to impose special duties-the coast would have been clear. We might be able ini good years t'o take from the general revenue part of the sum required to finance this scheme. We have to remember, however, that in one year we had a balance of only .£300,000, .and that we are not yet able to determine what will be the effect of the new Tariff on revenue. Some portion of the necessary funds may be taken from the ordinary I revenue, but by far the greatest proportion will have to be obtained by the imposition of special duties.",57

I regret that it has been delayed, but hope that, when we do establish a Federal system, we shall find some means of financing it that will not press unduly upon the smaller States, and those which, like Western Australia, have before them vast obligations in respect of the settlement of an immense territory. I am quite in accord with those who urge that the establishment of a Federal system should be expedited, but I certainly am not in favour of trying to coerca the Government into doing that which 1 know jt is impossible for thtm to do under existing ci cumstances.",58

503,Mr MATHEWS,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"I am afraid it would take a great deal more to make the honourable member weep. I do not know what is the position in New South Wales, but. I am familiar with the working of the old-age pension system in Victoria. My desireis that a Federal system shall be established as soon as possible. Whilst I have no hope of any scheme that may be submitted by the - Prime Minister to the Conference of State Premiers being accepted by them, I prefer to trust him rather than"" the Opposition to bring about a Federal system at the earliest opportunity. I do not mean to suggest that the Opposition are opposed to old-age pensions, but it seems to me that they would support the immediate establishment of a Federal system chiefly for the purpose of embarrassing the Government or the party to which I-belong. It is for that reason that I look askance at any proposition coming from the Opposition.. If we adopted the proposal made by the deputy leader of the Opposition we should embarrass the Government and lay ourselves open to .a charge of being wanting in tact. It might be said that we were political assassins, or an impracticable party. It is not for us is to take a direction from either the Government or the Opposition as to the course is we should pursue. We are as well able pento state our own case as is any other party the in the House, and we know that we have little to hope for from the Opposition. Had we thought that there was any chance our securing the passage of beneficent legislation by placing the Opposition in necespower we should have done so long ago. metroWhilst the further amendment moved by the honourable member for Dalley gives expression to a desire that we all entertain, we recognise that some time must elapse before the financial arrangements ' necessary to the introduction of the system can be completed. It may be said that we an are not earnest in our desire to have a Federal"" system at once instituted; but 'no one can deny that the financing of such a scheme as this is not the work of a day.",58
504,Mr WILSON,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,The Labour Party has had seven years in which to secure the passing of a Federal scheme of old-age pensions.,59
505,Mr MATHEWS,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"If ' those who think with the honourable member were in a majority we might have to wait not seven, but seventy-seven years for such a reform. It may be asked why I sneer at the Victorian old-age pension system. My experience of it leads me to do so. I have been twitted with having said that all this talk about the want of filial affection is too old a gag. When I made the interjection in question my desire was to point out that the cry was too well-worn to have any effect upon those who urge that a man should not be called upon to contribute to an old-age pension granted to his parents. I am glad to say that I have never had to contribute one cent towards the maintenance of my father or mother. being so, why should I desire to penalize an unfortunate man, who is earning barely sufficient to support himself and his family, by calling upon him to contribute to a pension granted to one or both of his parents? Why should he alone provide all that is necessary?",59
506,Sir JOHN FORREST,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,No one says that he should.,59
507,Mr MATHEWS,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"I hold that the old men and women in the Commonwealth, in ' developing Australia, have done as much for me as they have for their own sons and daughters. ' I shall never cast a vote in .favour of a proposal to compel a man with a large family, who is earning only a small wage, to contribute to a pension granted to his father or mother. I know hundreds of men who receive an average wage of only 6s. or less per day, and who are thus unable to support their own family as well as their parents. I know of one man who, when in employment, earns only £ 2 per week. ' His out of work for perhaps three or four months every year, but nevertheless he has been called upon to contribute 4s. 6d. a week towards a pension granted to his parents. He really does not earn sufficient to properly .maintain his own family, but the Opposition would say that it is right that he should be called upon to contribute to the support of his parents. Mir. ARCHER - What member of the Opposition has said so?",59
508,Mr MATHEWS,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,The honourable member for Echuca said in reply to the honourable member for Yarra that 3s. per week vvas not too much to expect a man to pay out of his total earnings of 30s. per week towards the support of his parents.,59

510,Mr MATHEWS,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"If I am I apologize to him. It was urged that it was only reasonable that every man should be compelled to contribute to the support, of his parents. Because I declared that it was not, I was charged by' the honourable member for Wentworth with being destitute of filial affection. I am just as anxious as is any honourable member to secure the establishment of a Federal system of old-age pensions at the earliest possible moment, and I have great hopes that the Government will formulate some such scheme without .further delay. I believe that we have a better chance of obThat taining something tangible from the Prime Minister than we should have of getting it from the members of the Opposition if they were in power, notwithstanding the tricky amendments which have been submitted.",59
511,Mr ARCHER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,Capricornia) [9.41] From the honourable member who has just resumed his seat we have heard a good deal concerning the sentiments of the Opposition upon the question of old-age pensions. He credited its members with desiring to tax the man who is in receipt of 30s. a week for the support of his aged parents.,59
512,Mr MATHEWS,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,It is done in Victoria.,59
513,Mr ARCHER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"If so, it is merely evidence that the indigent poor of this State are not treated in as humane a fashion as they are treated elsewhere. Personally I shall support any proposal to initiate a national scheme of old-age pensions, no matter from whatparty it may emanate. It is absolutely common-sense that every indigent and aged or invalid person who has resided in the Commonwealth for a certain period should receive a pension, irrespective of the time that he or . she may have been resident in any particular State. I wish very briefly to indicate-the limitations.which I place upon my support of any Federal scheme, for the payment of old-age pensions. In the first place, the scheme must be a common-sense and equitable one. I shall not support a universal system of pensions. I favour making the conditions under which these pensions are granted as little humiliating as possible, and also insuring that the inquiries instituted in respect of applicants for them shall be conducted as privately as possible. In the second place, it must be conclusively shown that we are able to finance the scheme without overstraining the capacity of the country for taxation. Lastly, the Commonwealth must not trench upon the power of direct taxation which is the only' avenue of taxation left to the States should their share of Customs and Excise revenue prove insufficient, and is the -.Commonwealth's reserve of taxation in time of national emergency. It seems to me that the proposals of the Labour Party for universal pensions,- irrespective of necessity, are unreasonable, and would involve the capacity of the country to bear taxation being unduly strained. The inevitable result would be that when an urgent demand was made for further taxation-as might occur in case of war-ou r primary industries, and also a great many of the secondary industries dependent upon them, would be absolutely ruined. Within the limits I have indicated, I shall be prepared to support any. scheme for the establishment of a Federal system of old-age pensions, irrespective of the party from which it may emanate. I am thoroughly satisfied that whatever State politicians may think of the matter, the people of the Commonwealth will be behind us in enacting the necessary legislation to give effect to such a scheme on a national basis. Question-That the words proposed be left out stand part - of the question--re solved in the negative.",59
514,Mr MCDONALD,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"Kennedy) [9.50] Nearly everything which can be said upon this question has. already been said, and consequently there is no necessity to debate its merits at all. In the first place leader of the Labour Party submitted proposal which the Government accepted. share. The deputy leader of the Opposition then declared that he recognised the necessity for establishing a Federal system of age pensions. Under these circumstances I failed to see any necessity for the bate which followed. Of course the diffisions. culty which has hitherto been experienced in giving effect to a Federal system: of age pensions has been a financialone.' credit the honourable - member for Dalley with, the utmost sincerity upon this queswho tion, but it'is idle for him to chide mem'-' bers of the Labour Party with not desiring to bring about this urgently-needed ""reform at the earliest possible moment when we know that up to the present time the leader of that party is the only honourable member who has successfully brought the question before the House, From-the veryinception of this Parliament efforts have been made to obtain the decision of the House upon it, but these have not proved successful. The motions relating to it have either been talked out or the session has ended without a vote being taken upon them. The honourable member for Wide Bay has embraced the only opportunity which has been presented of allowing us to give expression to our opinions upon this all-important question.",60
515,Sir JOHN FORREST,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,Is this the first chance that we have had during seven years ?,60
516,Mr MCDONALD,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,Unfortunatel y it is. If the right honourable member will look through the pages of Hansard he will find that my statement is correct - Under these circumstances the leader of the Labour Party is to be commended for his action.,60
517,Mr WILSON,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,Actio n should have been taken years ago.,60
518,Mr MCDONALD,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"I quite agree with the honourable member. The difficulty was not that we did not' believe that old-age pensions should be granted to those who have assisted to develop the wealth of this country, and who have obtained such a' poor return for their unremitting toil, but to that many honourable members opposite be- lieved that it would .necessitate direct taxation-at any rate during the continuance of the Braddon section of the Constitution.",60

With the honourable member for Barrier I am of opinion that old age pensions should be a right and not - a charity, and the only proper method is to compel every person above a certain age to take a pension.",60
520,Mr WILSON,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,Then the honourable member advocates compulsory pensions?,61
521,Mr MCDONALD,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"Yes , and I have never lost an opportunity of expressing my view.",61
522,Mr WILSON,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,The honourable member is making the Chairman of the Old-age Pensions Commission smile.,61
523,Mr MCDONALD,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"We cannot forget that that Commission wasappointed to shelve the question for a time, and that the honourable member referred .to was put in the position to help the cause along not quite so quickly as some of us would have liked to see. I give every credit to the honourable member for Dalley for a sincere desire that this question should be dealt with at the earliest possible momentbut it is of no use submitting bald motions unless we have some means suggested by which they are to be carried into effect. It has been said that we on this side have not shown how the necessary funds can be raised, and I . repeat emphatically that it of no use merely declaring that during the present session the Government shall deal with the question.",61
524,Mr WILKS,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"At any rate, my amendment is in advance of the motion.",61
525,Mr MCDONALD,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"I shall submit a proposal in advance of the amendment, and I shall expect the support of the honourable member for Dalley. I intend to move that after the word "" that "" in the provision which the honourable member for Dalley wishes to add to the amendment of the honourable member for Wide Bay, the following words be insertedIn the event of sufficient funds not being available from Custcms taxation, the necessary funds shall be raised by direct taxation unimproved value of land and.",61

I hope that those who are in favour of expediting old-age pensions will vote for my proposal, which certainly does give some practical idea as to how the money is to be provided. The proposal of the honourable member for Dalley will be useless, because if the Government are not prepared to adopt direct taxation, the only other method is to wait until the expiration of the Braddon section. But there appears to be . a desire in connection with the financial scheme to continue the Braddon section, and if that idea is carried out, there will be no hope for old-age pensions except by the method I propose.",61
528,Mr CARR,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"Macquarie) [IO.I] - The amendment of the honourable member for Kennedy appeals to me as presenting a splendid opportunity for the Opposition to display the sincerity of their desire for old-age pensions to be established at once - a far better opportunity than that presented by the frivolous proposals which have emanated from the honourable member for Parramatta. It seems to me that the Opposition is suffering more from pique than a genuine desire to correct error, and I am surprised that men should exhibit such childish petulence in connection with a matter of so much importance to the Commonwealth. This may be orthodox Opposition tactics, but it is not statesmanship, and it does not appeal to my common sense. The proposition in regard to earmarking a portion of the Customs revenue, is or the proceeds of a progressive'land tax, do not appeal to me, because the revenue from such sources, should the taxation prove effective, must be a diminishing quantity. .The poor we have always with us, and we must have a permanent means of assisting them in their old age. In the case of a progressive land tax the object is to-breakup the big estates, and the Tariff is designed to protect local industries; and, therefore, as I have already said; the resultant revenue must be a diminishing quantity, if the taxation achieves its purpose. It has been suggested that special duties on tea and kerosene should be imposed for the purpose of old-age pensions. The honourable member for Kooyong, and the right on the honourable member for Swan, declare that these commodities represent legitimate sources of revenue for such a purpose, on the principle that those who receive pensions should furnish the funds. I contend that that is taking a one-sided view of the subject, because the idea underlying the principle of old-age pensions is that a certain section of the community are not getting what they earn-that their contributions to the general wealth are aggregating in the hands of a Few, while they themselves are afforded a mere living. On that account' we say that when those workers can no longer assist in the creation of wealth-and we know that all wealth is the result, of actual effort-the State shall say to them, "" You have done well in helping to build up the country, and you shall now be compensated in your old age for being unable to save anything from your labours when an able-bodied man."" . It is admitted that the workers are not able to live decently and lay by enough for their old age, but according to some honourable members it would be a proper course to tax their tea and kerosene by means of which they are enabled to live and work, in order that when they are old and decrepit they may have a pension. To impose such taxation would simply make it harder for the people whom we set out to benefit, and on that ground I regard if as unfair and iniquitous. In my opinion there must be some stable economic source of revenue for such a permanent institution as old-age pensions, and, therefore, I at once turn to a tax on unimproved land values. It will be generally admitted fhat it is only in land values that the collective wealth of. the country is expressed. If those men andwomen have worked all their lives in the country, the result of their labour can be permanently expressed only in the enhanced value of the land, and this, therefore, becomes a legitimate source of revenue for providing for their old age. It has been contended that such a tax would duplicate the functions of the States, but so far as I can gather, provision is made for the utilization of the State machinery in cases where the functions of the States and Commonwealth ,Governments dovetail; and therefore there should be no difficulty on that score. With all due deference to the Prime Minister, a proposal that a certain amount of State land revenue shall be handed over to the Federal Government on the latter undertaking to pay old-age pensions, is well worth submitting to the Premiers' Conference. A nominal tax of £d. in the pound on unimproved values would return considerably over £1,000.000. have said, it is only by actual effort that real wealth is created, though, of course, those who control and supervise add to values, and, by their very position, are able to appropriate the greater share;'and it is for those who do not get. anything like the full value of their labour, that provision should be made. Therefore there is nothing of charity in the pension, although the honourable member for Echuca dwelt upon what he was pleased to regard as its charitable aspect. Charity, no doubt, is a very fine virtue, but, seeing that its exercise is possible only by reason of the suffering and want of those to whom the charitable dispense their largesse, it is doubtful whether its necessity is a blessing. As to . whether pensions should be given to all, or. merely to the needy, I cannot go with those of my confreres who advocate a universal pension system. I do not think that such a system is possible under our present social conditions. The inequalities resulting from the unequal distribution of wealth would make a universal pension system ridiculous. But when the Government controls all sources of wealth; in other words, when we have a socialistic State, which will come when the people want it, a universal pensions system wili be its natural complement. But the inquiries which are necessary under the more limited pension system with which I think we must for the present be contented, might very well be held in camerd, to avoid needless publicity. That, I think, would remove all reasonable objections to it .",61
529,Mr CROUCH,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"Corio) [10.15] - It is because I recognise that honourable members generally are in favour of old-age pensions that I have not yet taken part in the debate. All who have fought the last three elections know how important a matter' this is. Every political party has now expressed a desire for the establishment of an old age pensions system as early as possible. Undoubtedly the honourable member for Wide Bay, by his action this afternoon, has enabled us to make a step in advance .in this matter; because I think the House will agree to his proposal, and the Prime Minister has promised to make every effort to give effect to it. But I object to the attempt on the part of the honourable member for Dalley to take the wind out of the sails of the Labour Partv, and the further attempt of the honourable member for Kennedy As I to see how far the honourable member for Dalley will go.

530,Mr WILKS,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,Is the honourable member afraid of the land .tax proposals of the honourable member for Kennedy?,62
531,Mr CROUCH,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"I am afraid of nothing. I object to the amendment because it places a limitation on the actions of Parliament.

As to whether old-age pensions should be given to all, or only to the poor, that is not a matter to be discussed, now, nor is this the time, as the honourable member for Wide Bay pointed out, to discuss means of raising revenue to provide the funds necessary to effect what we have iri view - ",63

The cultivation of an Australian sentiment, based upon the maintenance of racial purity, and the development in Australia of an enlightthat ened and self reliant community. 13. The securing of the full results of their industry to all producers by the collective ownership of monopolies, and the. extension of the industrial ancl economic functions of the States and municipalities. The fighting platform is as follows1. Maintenance of a white Australia. 2. Nationalizatioa of monopolies. 3. Old-age pensions. 4. Tariff referendum. 5. Progressive tax on unimproved land values. 6. Restriction of public borrowing. I 7. Navigation laws. 8. Citizen defence forte. 9. Arbitration Act amendment. The general platform includes1. Maintenance of a white Australia. 2. Nationalization of Monopolies-if necessary, amendment of Constitution to provide for same. 3. Old-age pensions. 4. Referendum of Commonwealth electors on the Tariff question when the report of the Tariff Commission has been completed; the Party to give legislative effect to the decision of the referendum vote. 5. Progressive tax on unimproved land values. 6. Restriction of public borrowing. 7. Navigation laws, to provide-(a ) for the protection of Australian shipping against unfair competition; (d) registration of all vessels engaged in the coastal trade; (c) the efficient manning of vessels; (d) the proper supply of l if e saving and other equipment; (c) the regulation of hours and conditions of work; (/) proper accommodation for passengers and seamen; (g) proper loading gear, and inspection of same ;(h) compulsory insurance _of crews by shipowners against accident or death. 8.

Commonwealth bank of deposit and issue, and life and fire insurance department, the management of each to be free from political influence. - 11. Uniform industrial legislation; amendment of Constitution to provide for same. 12. Civil equality of men and women. It will be seen, therefore, that in respect of the taxation of land values, our platform contains no reference whatever to a £ 5 , 0 0 0 exemption. In the face of this evidence, the honourable member for Parramatta might well have accepted my assurance. I should like to ask him whether, upon one occasion, he did not describe the land values as legalized theft.",65

584,Mr THOMAS,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,Canno t I also speak to the amendment ?,66
585,Mr SPEAKER,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,The honourable member is at liberty to do so if he has not previously spoken to it.,66
586,Mr THOMAS,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"I should like to ask the deputy leader of the Opposition whether he has not described land valuesas legalized theft, and whether it is extravagance on the part of this Parliament to devote a portion of that legalized theft to - such a humanitarian purpose as the payment of old-age pensions?",66

592,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,I withdraw it.,66
593,Mr WILKS,BRITISH PATENTS ACT,"The honourable member for Kennedy has intimated that he is quite prepared to support a Federal scheme [33i] old-age pensions which will be financed out of the revenue derived from Customs taxation. He has also intimated that he believes in the taxation of land values without exemption. I intend to support his loading of my amendment. I desire to see the early establishment of a Federal system of old-age pensions, and I believe that such a scheme can be financed out of the revenue collected through the Customs. This afternoon the leader of the Labour Party emphasized a general principle, but his proposal was so much blank cartridge. The same remark is applicable to the amendment outlined by the honourable member for Parramatta. I happened to have a bullet in my possession, and with it I loaded the cartridge. The great awaken- ing that has taken place today is simply marvellous. Every honourable member now professes himself in favour of a Federal scheme of old-age pensions. If the amendment which I have submitted is impracticable, I contend that the original proposal was much more impracticable. I trust that honourable members will support my amendment, with the further amendment of the honourable member for Kennedv.

In my the poor people of Australia do not f care whether the Labour Party, the Opposition, or the Government take steps so long relief is afforded. I intend to vote for neither the proposal bf the honourable member for Kennedy nor the proposal of the honourable member for Parramatta, because I believe it is the duty of the Government to find the ways and means of carrying out of a resolution of the House.

The Standing Orders provide, however, that once a question has been put from the Chair, it is thereafter the property of the House, and cannot, without the permission of the House, be withdrawn.

Nothing can make him move it unless he chooses to do so. He does not need to withdraw it, because it is the not in the possession of the House until Mr Speaker puts it from the Chair, but once that step has' been taken no honourable remember can take the question out of the the consideration of the House without the and consent of the House itself. .
