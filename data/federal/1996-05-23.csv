3,Mr ROSS CAMERON,Unknown," Mr Speaker, in rising as the new member for Parramatta, I follow a very distinguished series of predecessors. I note in particular Howard Beale, Sir Garfield Barwick and Sir Nigel Bowen. The latter two both rose to the rank of chief justice of their respective courts, they being the High Court and the Federal Court of Australia. I submit that we would have to go far and wide to find an individual who has made a greater contribution to public life than Sir Garfield Barwick. The seat was also held by the honourable member for Berowra, Phillip Ruddock, who is currently the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and who continues to serve the House with distinction. In more recent times, it was held by two members whose party is now on the other side of the House. I am speaking of the Hon. John Brown and the Hon. Paul Elliott, my opponent in the campaign. The Hon. Paul Elliott· is a very decent human being and was an honourable opponent who conducted both a robust and a fair campaign. I note that he is now assiduously seeking to retain his nomination. He is present at virtually every function in my electorate. I submit to the factional leaders of the Labor Party, who we are assured make these decisions, that he is entitled to another go, and I look forward to a similarly robust contest in three years time. Mr Speaker, it was a great campaign. It was not an individual effort but a team effort. A great number of those who made an outstanding contribution are with us in the gallery today. I would like to acknowledge my debt to the conferences of Berowra and Parramatta. I would like to acknowledge my debt to Phillip Ruddock, who, aside from giving me a great deal of personal support, managed to persuade his conference to weigh in heavily behind me. I note the member for Warringah, Tony Abbott, sitting here in the chamber. Can I just say that he is a magnificent envelope folder and letter stamper. I see that, from those humble beginnings, he has now been elevated to the executive. There were numerous others. The Chief Government Whip (Mr Cadman) went above and beyond the call of duty and gave very unselfishly to assist in my election. To him, I am indebted. I note also sitting in the front row is the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop), who I continue to believe is Australia's preeminent marginal seat campaigner. The contest could not have been resolved in the manner it was unless literally thousands of Australians voted Liberal for the first time in their lives. Those people have a legitimate expectation that we on this side of the House will deliver a different and better form of government and that I, as their new member, will be an effective advocate for their particular needs, hopes and aspirations. Might I say that the needs of Parramatta are not something to which I now refer as a matter of custom; I refer to them as a matter of pressing urgency for consideration by this House and, in particular, by those who sit on the front bench on this side. Mr Speaker, we need to look at the fact that the demographic centre of Sydney is Parramatta. The population has shifted ever westward, but the policy preoccupation of decision makers has tended to remain on the northern and eastern suburbs of Sydney. I want to see Parramatta achieve its natural destiny as being the capital of western Sydney and Sydney's second CBD. The metropolitan planning study in 1988 conducted by the New South Wales government identified Parramatta as the natural second CBD of Sydney, but we have not delivered the economic and social infrastructure that the city needs in order to thrive and flourish in that capacity. I will continue to be an advocate for those causes I will also be an advocate for causes such as the University of Western Sydney, which is opening a new campus at Rydalmere, and for the heroic work of people such as Dr John Yu, Australian of the Year in 1996, who works at the new Children's Hospital in Westmead and continues to perform miracles daily for the children of this country. Mr Speaker, the single most decisive issue and turning point in the campaign was the issue of youth unemployment. The people of Parramatta rose up with the people of Australia and said that the sustained level of youth unemployment at about 30 per cent was, in fact, unsustainable. They said, 'Enough is enough.' They said, 'There has to be a better way.' I confess that I went into the campaign with some deep-seated reservations about our approach to the issue of youth unemployment to date. Let me acknowledge that it has been an intractable problem not just for the previous government but for governments on both sides of this House over the years and for governments around the world. It is an issue for which I hope we can establish a degree of bipartisanship. I note that in the first days of World War IT Menzies offered to actually form a joint party government. Such was the menace of the external threat facing us as a nation. I \uggest that youth unemployment is an issue of such menace and of such fundamental importance to our future as a nation that we ought to be able to establish a degree of bipartisanship. I came into the election with grave concerns about the way in which the issue has been handled to date. I came into it with a fear the direct interventions of government into the labour market had been spectacularly unsuccessful, and I thought we had to find a different solution. I set about to re-position the whole discussion about the youth unemployment problem in Parramatta-not as a government problem that was going to be solved by some nameless, faceless, bureaucrats in Canberra-and I challenged the local business community to take ownership, to step up to the plate and say, 'These are our children; this is our future, and we are not going to wait around like a group of mendicants with our hands out in the expectation that someone else is going to come along with some Messianic ability to solve the problem.' So, we launched the Parramatta youth jobs initiative. I acknowledge my debt to the numerous people who responded to the call, even in the context of an election campaign. They did not come to support me personally or to support the Liberal Party; they came because they wanted a fresh approach to the problem of youth unemployment-the fact that we had 4,000 young people between the ages 16 and 25 in Parramatta who could not find a job. We established a mentoring program where individuals could volunteer to take a young person to help them write a CV, a letter of application, to understand what their skills were, to identify their talents, and to be introduced to employment opportunities. We worked with the 1/15 Royal New South Wales Lancers-one of Australia's oldest military regiments, which has agreed to provide two days paid training to any young person who is looking for work. We had businesses come forward and say, 'Yes, we would like to help in giving young people jobs.' Route 66 spent the last week in my office interviewing 1,000 young people for a new restaurant that they are about to open. I am delighted to say that 100 new jobs for young people will result from that initiative. My concern is that overarching involvement of government in these issues can actually weaken the muscles of self-reliance without which none of these problems are going to be solved. That leads to the question of one's personal philosophy: what are the motivating that drives that cause one to aspire to occupy a seat in this place. Naturally, when one considers such issues, the emblem for me is found in the year 870 and in the person of King Alfred the Great. King Alfred is an emblem of virtually everything I believe in. His first act as king was to collect together all the laws that had been passed by those who preceded him into one document and have them translated into English, undertaking much of the task himself. And, in doing so, he laid a stake in the ground for the principle of the rule of law. His second act was to declare that every member of that community, from the least to the greatest, would be subject to the rule of law, including himself. Then he went out in an act of what I regard as heroism and organised the forces of Wessex and Mercia to resist the onslaught of the Danes when the largest Danish army ever to set foot on England came over in 860. The writing seemed to be on the wall that the English would be destroyed like the Britons before them. But, by combining the two kingdoms, he was able to resist with such ferocity that the Danes were forced to negotiate the Dane law-which proved to be a line in the sand preserving parliamentary democracy and in my view Western civilisation, without which we might all well be speaking Danish today. He then established the principle that individuals can make a difference; that we are not mere pawns, mere subjects of faceless, inexorable historical laws. I quote Paul Johnson, the eminent historian. On reflecting on Alfred, he said: He is a demonstration of the fact that one individual with sufficient clarity, single-mindedness, energy and will, can thrust his shoulder against hinge of history and shift the equipoise and thereby achieve the work of multitudes. So we in this House uphold the principle of liberalism which says that individuals can make a difference-and if one can make a difference, what can 148 of us achieve in this place? I mentioned my concerns about the overarching reach of government. The statistics in relation to the proportion of the gross domestic product which is consumed by the Commonwealth provide a stark assessment of the position. In 1934, at the height of the Depression, Commonwealth consumption of the gross domestic product was 11.1 per cent. By 1955, that figure had doubled. By 1995, the figure was 28.l per cent. When you add to that the spending by all other levels of government, the figure rises to 37.8 per cent, or $176 billion expended by governments out of the total gross domestic product of $455 billion. I am not advocating the abolition of the state. I am not suggesting it has no role, but I am suggesting it has gone too far. I am suggesting that enough is enough. I am suggesting that, when mum and dad out there in Main Street have to go to work all day Monday in the shops and in the factories and come home at the end of the day without having generated the first dollar for themselves and their families, it concerns me. When they have to return on Tuesday morning knowing that they will work all through the day until afternoon tea before they generate their first dollar, I suggest that we are upholding an incredibly powerful disincentive to initiative, enterprise and employment. My feelings on the issue of youth unemployment and on the need for self-reliance are influenced by my family's own experience. We came to Australia in 1837 aboard the ship Brilliant-200 Camerons travelling stowage third class. We came as crofters, from the Highlands of Scotland, who had failed to develop the skills which would make them competiti ve. As the Industrial Revolution swept up in a wave through England, they were smashed against the rocks. They had no basis upon which to resist. Their cottages the were burnt down. They were forced onto the boats and flung, as the flotsam and jetsam of the Industrial Revolution, to the four comers of the globe-to places like Nova Scotia and New South Wales. Australia's gain was Scotland's loss. Nonetheless, I would prefer that we had been coming as a maffer of deliberate choice and not as economic refugees. My grandfather-who was a patriotic Australian; he was in the saddle in Australian uniform at the last charge of the Light Horse at Beersheba-was a blacksmith. But when he returned to Australia, he found that his skills with the hammer and the anvil were simply not the skills required by the emerging economy as the motor vehicle replaced the horse and sulky. So he drifted around from one clerical position to the next until he, my grandmother and my father, their own child, came to Sydney to occupy a council flat in Concord. So, Mr Speaker, I feel these issues quite intensely, and I refuse to stand by and watch the young people of Parramatta, likewise, become the victims of the third wave as the information revolution sweeps across this country. We must work to equip them with a set of skills which are relevant to the industries which are emerging and not those which are passing away. We must work to keep alive that spark of ownership and self-reliance within the community without which none of our efforts as a government can ever be successful. None of us arrives in this place without the assistance of numerous others who have made a contribution by way of inspiration by example. There are literally hundreds whom I could name, but there are a couple I particularly want to place on the record. I am indebted to the Hon. Neil Pickard; he is a man who has been much maligned but, in my opinion, he is a great Australian. I note, just for example-and I could cite many-that when my father had a heart attack, which almost terminated his life and certainly terminated his parliamentary career, Neil got out of bed at 1 o'clock in the morning and drove to the other side of Sydney to be with my family and me. I remain indebted to him. I am indebted to people like Bruce Baird, one of the most effective ministers that the New South· Wales government has ever produced; he has been a friend and mentor and encourager of young people throughout his public life. I am indebted to my firm, Blake Dawson Waldron, who went above and beyond the call of duty in their support of my political aspirations. Can I say to the businesses of Australia: I encourage you to seek to identify with the aspirations of your employees. If our party, if our philosophy, ever becomes subject to any sectional or class interest, it will be weakened to that extent. I challenge businesses to get involved in the problem of solving some of these intractable issues we face, and I note that we only give 0.5 of a per cent in philanthropic giving in this country as opposed to something like four times that amount in the so much maligned United States. Mr Speaker, I am indebted to my family, which is an extraordinary group of people. My sister Margaret is not here today because she is in Uganda running a local high school; she is one of the most inspiring young Australians I have ever met. I am indebted to my mother; she provided the glue which held our family together and, like so many others, did all the work and received none of the credit. I am indebted to my father who many, particularly in New South Wales, will know of as a crusader, a campaigner, a person who was prepared to stand up for his convictions-whether or not they were popular, whether or not they were controversial. But I appreciate some of his more human qualities which tend to get lost in the fray: his respect for his opponents, his courtesy, his genuine liking of people and his belief that a difference of opinion, no matter how violent, ought never to impact on the quality of a personal relationship. I am indebted to my wife, who is the most wonderful companion a man could ever ask for. I suspect there are few members in the chamber whose spouses have expertise in the science of primate evolution; she may well be conducting a mental case study on our progress in that regard at the moment. But she has been a wonderful comfort and support to me in this period of enormous change in my life. So, Mr Speaker, I rise with a great sense of honour. I have enjoyed meeting members on both sides of the House. I have enjoyed the maiden speeches and the other contributions. I hope that I may look forward to making a contribution myself over the months and years ahead. Honourable members-Hear, hear!",13
4,Mr WILLIS,Unknown,"Gellibrand) (9.52 a.m.)Firstly, I congratulate the member for Parramatta (Mr Ross Cameron) on his very confident and assured first speech. The supply bills-Supply Bill (No. 1), Supply Bill (No.2) and Supply (parliamentary Departments) Bill-that are now before the House represent the first steps in budgetary provision for the year 1996-97. I want to say quite a bit about the budgetary policy for 1996-97 and beyond. Before doing so, I emphasise that the economic circumstances in which this budget for next year is being put together are infinitely better than the economic circumstances which the Labor government faced when it carne to office in 1983. Instead of an economy in recession, with double digit unemployment and double digit inflation, we now have an economy experiencing a record period of growth, which has created more jobs in the past three years than the Fraser government created in 7'/4 years. The now Prime Minister (Mr Howard) bequeathed us an inflation rate of 11.4 per cent when he ceased to be Treasurer. Today, it is 3.7 per cent. He produced an average 50,000 jobs a year in the period that he was Treasurer. Under Labor, it was 160,000 jobs a year. He left 158,000 youth unemployed. Labor has left 88,OOO-a point I would particularly draw to the attention of the member for Parrarnatta. As Treasurer, Mr Howard achieved average economic growth of 2.2 per cent. W.e achieved average economic growth of 3.7 per cent. Foreign debt increased under Treasurer Howard by 35 per cent per annum. Under Labor, it was half that rate. He handed over a highly regulated, highly protected, uncompetitive, inward looking, dispute ridden, sclerotic economy. He now takes charge of an economy that is substantially deregulated, lowly protected, outward looking and export oriented, very competitive, much more productive, and with far lower levels of industrial disputation. There are still things to do-there always are-but there is no gainsaying the fact that the Labor government handed over an economy in infinitely better shape than it received 13 years ago. Even with regard to the budget, the outlook is vastly better than that left by the Fraser government in 1983. The revised budget figures-about which I will have much to say-released by the new government show a projected budget deficit for next year of one per cent of GDP. That compares to a deficit of just under five per cent of GDP left by Treasurer Howard in 1983. When the government talks about budget black holes, it should be damn thankful it is not left with Howard's humungous hole-if I can use that colloquial expression. A great deal has been made of the revised budget estimates by the new government. The former Labor government has been accused of economic mismanagement, failure and deceit. On the basis of the alleged budget hole, a major change to fiscal policy has been announced, involving taking measures to cut the budget by some $4 billion in 1996-97 and the same again in 1997-98. I want to make a number of points about these new budget figures and the allegations and policy changes that have resulted from them. Firstly, I completely repudiate the allegation of deceit. The fact is that the Labor government provided far more information regarding the prospective budget than its predecessor government ever did. Treasurer Howard provided virtually no information at ail about the out-year budgetary situation. With one notable exception, he only provided information for the current budget year. The exception was during the 1983 election when he made up his own figures, even though he later admitted that he had different figures provided to him by Treasury. He confessed after the election that he had been told by Treasury before the election campaign of an $8 billion budget deficit forecast for the next year and that that figure was subsequently revised up to $9 billion a week before the election, and then to $9.6 billion the day before the election. None of those Treasury estimates were ever released before the election. What wa- released by the then Treasurer, now Prime Minister, during that election campaign was the figure of $6 billion for the next year's budget deficit, which he later justified, saying it was a personal estimate that he was entitled to produce having been Treasurer for five years. In the light of that disgraceful perfonnance, it is extraordinary that the perpetrator now has the hide to accuse the Labor government of deceit, particularly when that government provided far more information about the budget outlook than he ever did. All of it, I must say, was official estimates; none of it was personal estimates. The Labor Party brought in three-year forward estimates of outlays early in our period in office. We brought in three-year forward estimates of revenue and, therefore, of the whole budget outcome, a couple of years ago. We brought in a mid-year review of the current year budget. We brought in a fiscal framework which set out at the beginning of the budget preparation process the economic and financial framework in which the budget was produced. Despite all this information, which no previous government had ever provided, we are accused of deceit because we did not update the out year budget figures when we announced the mid-year review of the current budget last December. That was totally consistent with our original decision when we introduced the concept of the mid-year review for the current budget year a couple of years ago, which was not to revise the out years in between budgets. We took that decision, not to hide worthwhile information from the public but because, obviously, unlike the current year, for the out-years we did not have any experience of what had happened during the year-that is only something that was there for the current year. Also, we knew from experience over the previous decade and more that the initial budget starting point, which we obtained at the start of the budget preparation process, always varied considerably, sometimes enonnously, through the budget preparation period. It did so because of changes by Treasury and the joint economic forecasting group to the economic forecast, and also because of changes in program parameters. They delivered different outcomes for various reasons from what was expected. Thus we concluded that to release the budget starting point figure at the start of process, or to update the forecast for the outyears in the mid-year review, would be highly likely to mislead the public as to what the actual no policy change outcome would be at the time we finalised the budget for the next year. This chronic unreliability of budget starting point numbers well before budget finalisation was acknowledged by the now Prime Minister after the 1983 election when he justified his non-release of official estimates for the next year's budget outcome by saying-and it has been mentioned by others in this House-that estimates of this kind are notoriously unreliable guides to the ultimate outcome. Of course, that is precisely what we said and that is why we did not release them, and then we were accused of deceit for not doing so! What we are now accused of is withholding information, which no government in the whole history of this country has ever released-with the infamous exception of 1983-information that would certainly be revised in future months leading up to the finalisation of the budget, and which information we had not sought nor obtained from the bureaucracy because the budget preparation process had not begun. We therefore completely and absolutely reject the allegation of deceit. Let me tum to the allegation of economic failure and mismanagement. This stems from the revised budget outyear figures which show the headline budget outcome for 1996-97 of $4.9 billion compared with the 1995 budget forecast of a $3.4 billion surplus and an underlying outcome for 1996-97 of a deficit of $7.6 billion compared with the 1995 budget forecast of a deficit of $0.6 billion. In the two subsequent years, the headline deficit goes down to $3.9 billion and the underlying deficit to $3.3 billion. So why this change in the expected budget outcomes from those outlined in last year's budget? There are two principal reasons. The first is that the coalition in opposition deliberately undermined the budget. They tried to do this in 1993 when they opposed $3 billion worth of budget tightening measures. They were unsuccessful in respect of that. In this that current year's budget, they opposed $2Y2 billion of budget tightening measures for 1995-96 and $4'h billion for 1996-97. So they tried to wipe out the projected budget surplus of $3.4 billion for 1996-97 by opposing $4'h billion worth of measures. So much for professed concern, hand on the heart, about benefits. the need to have a budget surplus. Why did the coalition in opposition oppose the measures which at that stage they would have believed would have wiped out the budget surplus anyway? They were successful in blocking $0.3 billion in 1995-96-which, I might note, is enough to stop a surplus this year on the revised figures-and they blocked $2.3 billion in 1996-97. Thus, in part, the deterioration in the budget outcome that they are now fulminating about was brought about by their own actions. Nevertheless, the major reason for changed budget outcomes is the change to economic parameters. As noted by the Rea serve Bank governor in an address in late March this year, 90 per cent of the change in the underlying budget balance is due to revisions in the economic forecast which come from the December forecasting round by the joint economic forecasting group, requires which is made up of representatives of Treasland economics. ury, Finance, PM&C and the Reserve Bank. So what are these changed economic forewe casts? In part they reflect reduced real growth of GOP in employment-real GOP growth is had down half a per cent in 1995-96 and 1996-97; employment growth is down a quarter per cent this year and one per cent in 1996-97expected but in part they also reflect reduced inflation. The real gross non-farm product deflator, which is for the non-farm economy the which complete inflation indicator, is down a quarter per cent in 1995-96 and three-quarters per cent in 1996-97, from 3/A per cent to 2'h per cent. Thus the nominal level of GOP 1996-97 has been lowered significantly by a combination of lower growth and lower inflation. As Treasury notes in the 12 March release of the revised budget figures, the level of nominal GOP for 1996-97 is now expected to be 2% per cent less than was projected at budget time and, for each one per cent fall nominal GOP, revenue declines by $1'h billemment's ion. So revenue was down in 1996-97 by it some $4'h billion due to reduced real growth and reduced inflation. With lower growth, outlays are also increased, especially for the increased expenditure on unemployment Two key questions arise from all of this. The first one is: is reduced economic growth and inflation evidence of economic failure and mismanagement by the previous government? I must say it is a curious development indeed when lower inflation is said to be evidence of economic failure. It is what we were trying to achieve. In fact, the mark of the economic success of the previous government was that we achieved a substantial and enduring recovery with low inflation. The fact that inflation in 1996-97 is now forecast to be less than we previously forecast is clearly not the a bad thing-well, at least I would have thought so. To argue the opposite is to take complete Alice in Wonderland approach to economics. That is what the current government is saying. It is saying that lower inflation, because it reduces the expected budget outcome, is evidence of economic mismanagement and economic failure and therefore major budget cuts. This is just fairyAs to reduced growth, that is clearly what do not want to see. Australia's performance on growth is still very good. We have a record four and a half years of continuous economic growth. Our current, albeit reduced, rate of economic growth is still to be the highest for all the major OECD countries this year. To be bottoming out in the business cycle with a growth rate still has us top in the growth league for comparable countries is hardly evidence of of a economic failure or economic mismanagement. The resultant revised budget deficit is in hardly massive by the standards of other countries. In fact, at one per cent of GOP, it is almost the lowest budget deficit in the major OECD countries. The second key question that arises from these reduced economic parameters is whether this warrants the government's response of $8 billion of budget tightening measures. I would in argue emphatically that it does not. The govresponse is utterly illogical because is a structural response to an essentially cyclical problem or phenomenon. The changed budget outcome for the outyears does not represent a structural deterioration caused by wild government spending or programs running out of control; rather, apart from the damage caused by the coalition's own actions in opposition, it is overwhelmingly a cyclical phenomenon due to lower growth and inflation. What if the cyclical change had been greater? Let us assume inflation had been one per cent lower in 1996-97. What would that have meant? On the government's approach it would have meant that we would have been a couple of billion dollars further down in the budget position; therefore, it would have required a couple of billion dollars more of expenditure cuts because we had a lower rate of inflation. What if the economy had collapsed? What if we had a recession like Treasurer Howard left us with-a budget deficit of five per cent of GOP, which would leave a budget hole of $28 billion? Would we require cuts of $28 billion in those circumstances? Clearly, on the government's logic we would since that would be the size of the black hole you would have to fill. Such action would be utterly perverse. It would undoubtedly have major counterproductive effects on the economy as well as horrendous social effects. Indeed, even with the $8 billion cuts, this is likely to be so. is because government cuts of $8 billion will of themselves have a contractionary effect on the economy. It represents a withdrawal of the three-quarters of a per cent of GOP in each year. Of course, it is argued that will be counteracted by a boost to confidence, especially business confidence. But business and consumer confidence is already high. The December capital expenditure survey showed business expectations for capital spending for the first half of this year to be quite strong and for 1996-97 to be 27 per cent higher than the corresponding expectation for 1995-96. Of course, that was all before the change of government. In such circumstances, it is hard to envisage that business confidence could be greatly increased and that that could lead to an additional splurge of business investment. So we have the certainty of lost public sector demand versus the possibility of some offset in private sector demand. Already private sector forecasters like Westpac are saying that this will result in reduced growth of half a per cent in 1996-97 and 1997-98. With reduced growth it follows that much of the apparent gain to the budget from the budget measures will be lost in the net contractionary effect on the economy. So what we gain on the one hand from the budget measures will be, at least in part, offset by the lower growth that will occur. Clearly, on the face of a cyclical rather than a structural deterioration, we should work on improving the cyclical outcomes; that is, try to increase growth, not inflation. There are good prospects of this anyway. The Governor of the Reserve Bank has publicly stated that his hunch is that GOP growth in 1996-97 will be a bit stronger than the current official forecast of 3- per cent. Since the revised budget figures were announced, the release of the December quarter national accounts showed GOP growth of 0.5 per cent. That compared with the JEFG, Joint Economic Forecasting Group, forecast for the December quarter of 0.2 per cent-O.5 per cent against the forecast on which the budget figuring was made of 0.2 per cent. Already we see that those numbers This are out of date and it could well be that following the Joint Economic Forecasting Group round, which would follow those December national accounts figures, we will have additional estimates which the government has not released. Over the last three years the Labor government achieved real growth of GOP averaging four per cent per annum, despite a severe drought, low commodity prices and our major trading partner, Japan, being in almost continual recession all through that period. With the drought broken, commodity prices rising and Japan back in a growth mode, if the new government could just match Labor's performance and get four per cent per annum growth over the next three years, the supposed budget hole would basically disappear. It is also necessary in any budget round to run a tight ship, to look for and make sensible savings and, unless the economy needs a boost, not to take decisions that structurally deteriorate the budget. But that is not what the coalition did in the election campaign. As has been said, they made promises with offsets which did not stand up and we have found a $4 billion hole in respect of those offsets. The fact that the government will not release the finance costings of their funding measures is a clear indication of their unwillingness to reveal the extent of the fiscal hole that they have dug themselves into. Of course, that is a structural hole. So if, as the Prime Minister maintained in the election campaign, they keep their election spending promises regardless of the deficit much of the $8 billion will be required to offset the hole they themselves have created. It is hard to conclude other than that the billion of budget cutting measures that this government is planning to introduce are essentially based on ideology rather than economics. This government wants, for ideological reasons, to implement much of its Fightback public expenditure cutting agenda under the cover of a supposed budget black hole and, for the reasons that I have given in this speech, we do not accept that it has such cover. The slashing and burning of the public sector, the thousands of sackings, the decimation of Canberra, the wholesale scrapping of labour market programs, the vandalising-or 'Vanstone-ing'-of the higher education system, the damage to our export drive and our relations with Asian countries and the hurt and pain they will inflict on many people will all be their responsibility, not that of the former government.",16
5,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Mr Jenkins)Before I call the honourable member for Paterson, I remind the House that this is the honourable member's first speech and I ask the House to extend to him the usual courtesies.",21
6,Mr BOB BALDWIN,Unknown," Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, I congratulate you on your election and the dignity with which you are carrying out the duties of Deputy Speaker of this House. The seat of Paterson is, beyond doubt, one of the most diverse electorates in this country. In its original form the seat was named in honour of Colonel William Paterson, soldier, explorer and Lieutenant Governor of New South Wales in 1809. But, with the re-creation of the seat in 1992, Paterson was appropriately named after the great balladist, Banjo Paterson, a person who regularly wrote of the spirit of a young Australia. Like my forebears, I have continued the coalition tradition that was but briefly lost. Sir Allen Fairhall, a senior minister throughout the Menzies era, held the seat for eight consecutive elections between 1949 and 1969. The late Frank O'Keefe then sustained the coalition stranglehold until Paterson was that dissolved in 1984. Bruce Cowan, the former long standing member for Lyne, similarly $8 represented for many years a great portion of what Paterson geographically represents today. The work and contribution of all three of these gentlemen are held in the highest regard by both sides of this House. No-one could better describe the area than did the poet Dorothea Mackellar when, in 1908, she penned the poem My Country as she sat on the verandas of the historic property of Torryburn between Vacy and Gresford in the heart of the Paterson electorate. The poem was inspired by the breaking of a long drought of that time. I would like to read a few selected lines from that poem, lines which all school children throughout Australia have committed to their hearts and minds: I love a sunburnt country, A land of sweeping plains, Of rugged mountain ranges, Of droughts and flooding rains. I love her far horizons, I love her jewel-sea, Her beauty and her terrorThe wide brown land for me! The language that Mackellar speaks is apt in its description of Paterson. 'Of rugged mountain ranges' speaks of the Mount Royal Ranges, which include the magnificent Barrington Tops. These rise in splendour and possess pockets of SUbtropical rainforest. The Paterson and Allyn valleys are prime dairy and beef country and their majestic geography undulates mile after mile. The jewel-seas are the Pacific Ocean and pristine waterways of Port Stephens and the Myall Lakes. These unreplicated waterways meet Nelson Bay and the villages of Hawks Nest and Seal Rocks, where time seems to tick by just that bit slower. 'And flooding rains' - the historic footage of yesteryear can only jolt the memories of the mass flooding of the Hunter in 1955 which engulfed so much of the electorate, yet drew forth the true spirit of Australia so revered in our culture. This was her heart and this was her country. Like Dorothea Mackellar, I too have developed a love for the area, its people and what it offers. As I stand proudly, surrounded by this new government, a worthy opposition, the legislators of Australia's future, I am led to comment on the responsibility and focus we face together. Labor has run its platform of equal opportunity in the workplace and in particular in this parliament, of trying to establish safeguards that minimise poverty, of attempting to promote a system of medical care for all Australians and of sustaining a welfare system that protects the needy and the unemployed. On the canvas, Labor had painted the big picture for our nation. It had attempted to reignite Ben Chifley's light on the hill-a light that never truly caught fire. Unfortunatepredecessors ly, the big picture was painted on flimsy brown paper. Today everything has a price and, regrettably, a social cost. Once established, society readjusts quickly to a new status quo, creating a feudal system in reverse where an increasing percentage becomes totally dependent on a welfare state that does not do enough in providing incentive for individual productivity. For all Labor's good intentions, we have seen Labor's dream become Paterson's curse. In 1996 we are currently in a drought of a different kind, one that the flooding rains of 1955 will not fix. Our youth, the very future of this country and our source for optimism, have been failed; yet it is here that this has struck, and struck hard at the very social and cultural core. As I move around the electorate I am confronted by the reality of (I young Australians just waiting without direction and, worse still, without hope. They feel deserted. But whom do we blame for this predicament, this sad indictment on our society? We simply cannot single out the Labor Party for this one. We are all to blame; yes, every member in this House-indeed, every Australian. You may ask Why. The answer is simple: because we, and I mean all Australians, have allowed this to happen. That is the real curse that we all face. Time has come for real leadershipleadership that shows direction and hope for all Australians. As Teddy Roosevelt, America's 26th President, said: Far and away the best prize that life offers is the chance to work hard at work worth doing. Roosevelt was the can-do leader in American politics. His young nation needed direction; it needed identity. His verve, his patriotism, his passion for the nation he loved excited the American people, instilling in them a sense of pride and promise as the United States entered the 20th century. So now we must do the same in the 21st century. We have our own can-do leader. I see John Howard as the very hope of Australia. I distinctly remember the former Prime Minister once saying about leadership that all his just could not cut the mustard with the Placido Domingo of Australian politics. I see leadership in a far different light, and I am sure many other Australians do. True leadership is about results-getting the runs on the board by holding your team together as the last line of defence and delivering the goods in the line of fire. But it is also about taking others with you on an issue that is right. Can-do leadership is about what the Prime Minister delivered in cementing tougher gun laws that span the nation, where the boundaries of states cannot impinge. The term 'leadership' will be redefined under a John Howard government, so much so that he curse will not just be the Placido Domingo of leaders but all three tenors rolled into one. Sensible, responsible government is not about intruding into community life but about providing the framework for individuals to achieve their maximum potential in life, yet still maintaining the support mechanism for those who genuinely need support. Unemployment is a major problem in Paterson. Unemployment, at the current rate of 11.2 per cent in the Hunter, continues the tragic and historic trend in our area of being well above the national average. Even more concerning is the sad indictment that we have some 30 per cent of our local youth wanting work; they are presently jobless. If those youth figures seem high and are the subject of embarrassment to the former government, then what should be considered is that the figure for youth unemployment would be much higher if we did not have one of the highest incidences of young people leaving home and heading to Newcastle or Sydney to find work. Through Labor's failed policies we have lost generations of people who will never, never return to the farm. The former government's programs of Priority One and Working Nation have failed our youth. Remember the classic line-with tear in the eye and hand on the heart-that no child will live in poverty by 1990. Six years on, for all Labor's intended good, Labor's dream has become Paterson's curse. Paterson's curse is often known by another name: Salvation Jane-a strain prevalent in the drier lands and used by stock in drought. So out of the dry well of ideas of Labor, what can I offer as solutions to the people of Paterson? One of the chief mantras repeated over and over is the need to get our small business sector in Australia back into business. The issue resonates with people because the concept is so easy to understand-it is logical and it is right. Small business has long held regional and provincial Australia together. Without invigorating the small business sector right across Paterson, no new jobs will be created and existing jobs will be lost. During the election campaign, at a meeting of small business proprietors at Raymond Terrace, the member for Pearce (Mrs Moylan) and I said that we would be a government committed to listening to the people. That is why in just over a month's time. I am holding a small business and jobs summit in the electorate, briefing local business on our reforms but, more importantly, listening to their concerns and what they need to get jobs back on track in our electorate. That is what it is all about: motivating small business to get people back into work. This is a two-way deal and, yes, it is a worthy partnership in the future of our nation. Small business will not change unless a decade of government neglect and abuse is overturned in the Hunter. The record closure of small businesses in Paterson destroyed confidence and brought a community to its knees. On terra firma there was also a similar scenario unfolding. I seek to remind the members of this House of the promises of the previous government, who said in 1990 they would deliver a $1 billion package to make over the Pacific Highway. The member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), who unfortunately is not with us in the chamber at the moment, sought when Minister for Transport to upgrade the highway's chief black spots, including the death trap of 0' Sullivans Gap. Yet, for all his talk in promising new bitumen, he could not even deliver a bulldozer. The former government thought so little of the people who used this road. But we have listened. The coalition has committed funding of $386 million to build a new highway from Bulahdelah to Coolongolook and then on to Possums Brush-not a simple patch-up job but a new highway. And we will deliver, and we will help prevent horrendous accidents like the ones that have claimed over 600 lives since 1987-the equivalent of more than one life per week on Highway No .. 1-as well as an untold number of serious accidents. The timber industry is a critical economic lifeline for many local communities within Paterson. Just as the local people are passionate about their work, so too are outsiders equally passionate about restricting their future evolution. Encouraging such emotions to come to the boil is no way to solve the industry's future or its problems. What I say is it is time to stop playing politics and start putting practical initiatives into place to maintain a sustainable timber industry. If the Australian ethos of a fair go is observed, timber workers will now be at the top of the queue to receive their fair share. It saddens me to see the environmental vandalism that occurs from the burning of waste timber that could be used as woodchips to help small towns and our national debt-all because previous governments would not listen to the very people who knew the industry, people like Royce Dawney delah and Mark Scifleet at Gloucester, people who are from generations of loggers, people who have timber in their blood and in a responsible fashion make it their livelihood. I am personally committed to working with the local timber industry and achieving a winwin situation for all sides. The implied threat or otherwise of Newthe castle disease and avian flu however inadvertently, our country could have an enormous impact on both the chicken trade and the local environment. Within Paterson, chicken farming outranks all comers-dairy production and cattle included-as our biggest rural income earner. In light of the recomproud mendation by the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service to lift the import ban cooked chicken, I have to say I am saddling done. up with my local chicken growers to challenge this view. Disease knows no barriers state borders or livestock crossings. As seek to establish ourselves as the food to Asia and increasingly the wider Western world, I owe it to my rural producers, their work force and their families that our primary industry sector sustains the premium price in the market place for the produce which friend disease-free food carries. When Sir Allen Fairhall, the first member for Paterson, gave his inaugural address in 1950, he spoke of the honour of representing some of Australia's most rich and fertile lands-and pay dirt. However, he made it clear there was also a heavy toll to be He said: . . . soil erosion is taking its toll . . . The silting up. and can no longer drain off all the that falls in the catchment area ... At present there is much wasted effort in our attempts to cope erosion, the rabbit pest, failing soil fertility decaying mineral content of the soil. The burden we threaten to leave our children and our children's children if we continue to not so much neglect but pass up an opportunity to revitalise, clean up and adequately resource our local environment will be a great one. The price paid will be our nation's loss. This government's historic commitment to the environment through a $1 billion Natural Heritage Trust is, I know, well supported at Bulahacross the community. Listening to the thankyous and the extending of gratitude can be onerous on the ear, but it is pleasurable to my soul. Without the fantastic support and love of my wife, confidante and best friend, Cynthia, and my forgiving very young children, David, Robbie and Samantha, who are here in the gallery today, flame of desire to succeed would have re-entering, been quickly doused. And one should never forget one's mum. My mum, Betty Baldwin, is the very person who instilled in me the care and love for family, for others and of country. My late father, David Baldwin, would be immensely at my achievement, but as a foundry and worker and former Labor voter he would on surely tum in his grave at what Labor has Thanks go to Mike Warczak, my sailing of buddy and the very person who introduced we me to politics and ensured that, when I got bowl angry about something, I got up and did something about it; my political mentor and friend Senator John Tierney and his media junkie, Graham Hallett-they helped put me on the path to victory; my state colleague and Peter Blackmore, who I know is listening in state parliament at the moment-he literally holds the right to what grassroots campaigning is all about; my friend and state colleague Patricia Forsythe MLC, who gave me the confidence and encouragement to stand, Chris Hartcher MLA and John Jobling paid. MLC who put in so many hard yards. Thanks also go to the campaigning team, which was headed by Richard Filewood and rivers are footed by upwards of one per cent of the water actual electorate in manning the 84 booths on with the day-their·reward was victory itself; my and the treasurer, tower of wisdom and adopted uncle, Ian Paul, and his wife, Dorothy, who knew I was worth investing time in; Daryl Lewis, true National with a liberal heart the size Paterson; my guiding light Mike Breen; and my personal team of Tony MCCormack, important Malcolm MCPhan, Colleen Essex, Robert Frost, Ross Cadell, Ben Howell, Dawn Anderabout son, Bunny Almond, Phoeme Wallace, Fran Dawson OAM, Beryl and John Purdy and increase Greg Hansen, Peter Hulsing, Wilf Smith, and not forgetting our wise but not so old regional president, Arch Humphrey. All were spokes in the wheel. All came to the fore when it was time to be counted. To our State President, Bill Heffernan, State Director, Tony Nutt, and John Burston and his dynamic team at party headquarters: their never say die attitude when Labor let loose with both barrels pushed my campaign to the finish. To John Howard, Tim Fischer and Federal Director, Andrew Robb: stood and united they succeeded. To my supporters from the prev-ous caming paign in the seat of Dobell in 1993 who urer continued on-Ron Moss, Betty Talarico, Phil and Colleen Walker, Paula Allan, Brenton Nanette Pavier, and Don Frasca-lowe you about all a great deal of gratitude for originally dipping my feet into the political well. But most importantly to my friends, colleagues and supporters from both the National and estimate Liberal parties-the coalition family was never tighter and hence the victory forever sweeter in Paterson on 2 March. Finally, at the end of the day if I can be remembered for one contribution to this House I would want it to be that I was part the team that helped tum the ship around; steer a new course towards the nation's salvation. Ultimately, however, I have sent to do a job, and it is a job that I will undertake with pride. I am here and I will continue to speak out for Paterson. Thank you.",21
7,Mr LANGMORE,Unknown,"I in would like to begin by congratulating the honourable member for Paterson (Mr Bob is Baldwin) on his fluent speech and also on his sense of humour. I would like to talk about the Supply Bills and use that as an opportunithe ty for talking about the strategy which government is putting forward. It is an extradeficits a ordinary strategy, as the honourable member of for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) has shown so eloquently a few minutes ago. One of the most things he showed is that the strategy is based on a serious misunderstanding the nature of what is going on in Australia at present. As he showed vividly, the in the claimed deficit is due very much to the reduction in the rate of inflation. A reduction in the rate of inflation is what everyone in Australia wants, but its effect is to reduce the rate of growth of nominal national income, and therefore to reduce the rate of increase of revenue and so to increase the size of the deficit. That is a cyclical problem, as he said, not a structural problem. It is entirely inappropriate for that cause to be the justification for a structural response of the seriously damaging and destructive kind that united they is being proposed. One very simple arithmetical way of showthe misunderstanding that the new Treas(Mr Costello) seems to have is to look at the figures. He is saying that in 1996-97 there and will be one per cent less growth in GDP, $5 billion. Yet he is saying at the same time that that reduction in GDP of $5 billion will lead to an increase in the budget deficit of $6 billion. So we have the extraordinary that a $5 billion reduction in national income will lead to a $6 billion increase in the budget deficit, making the government worse off and the people of Australia $1 billion better off. That does not make sense. The figures are wrong and hollow. They need of to be redone. The assertions about a so-called to Beazley black hole are hollow. They are simply assertions, and no more. They are been based on hollow economics and hollow arithmetic without any foundation. Simply to go on asserting them is no argument at all. The figures are sloppy. They are 'severely rubbery', as an earlier Liberal Treasurer said the late 1970s, or I think it may have been 1982-in the Fraser government years. There no crisis. It is important for the Australian people to understand this. Australia has one of the lowest deficits at present and, even if government's estimates were correct, it the would still have one of the lowest budget amongst the advanced countries of the OECD. Even if we accepted their figure it would be the second or third lowest in the whole advanced country league table. As well as that, Australia's outlays and revenue collections as a proportion of GDP are the lowest in the OECD area, amongst Western advanced countries. As I have been arguing in this place now for some years, we have one of the lowest public debts. Depending on how you estimate it, we have the fourth lowest or the second lowest debt, whether gross debt or net debt. It is clear that we do not have a problem of government debt. The issue of overseas debt is different, but overseas debt is principally private sector debt; it is not government debt. But in terms of our national debt, the debt of the government to the Australian people, we have the second or the fourth lowest amongst all advanced countries. So on every count there is no crisis. Yet we are being presented with figures as if they were the basis for demonstrating a crisis and then we are told that they justify these terrible longer. cuts. But not only do they not justify them. I will come to the cost of them in a minutethey are also counterproductive, they are perverse. More cuts will further slow down the rate of economic activity. They will have a contractionary impact on the Australian economy, and that will cause higher unemployment. A thoroughly sound estimate of that is that the rate of growth will slow down by about half a per cent a year in each of the next two years if the cuts are made, as has been discussed. That would reduce employment by about 40,000 in each of those years. So at the end of the two-year period we would be 80,000 jobs worse off. That is perverse. It is a serious misjudgment. What we should be looking for are policies that will increase the rate of economic growth. That is the challenge that the member for Gellibrand threw out this morning. Why not aim for a four per cent rate of economic growth so that we will speed up the rate of employment creation? That strategy WOUld, of itself, obliterate the budget deficit within a couple of years. What we should also be aiming for at present-which the government seems resistant to accepting-is a reduction in interest rates. The inflation rate is falling and interest rates are being reduced overseas. We should be reducing our interest rates so as to stimulate private sector economic activity. The preconditions for it are there. If they had not thrown away the accord, we would have had that reduction in interest rates already. But even without that incomes policy instrument, we do have the capacity now to responsibly reduce interest rates. The Reserve Bank should be doing that and the government should be recommending it. One of the real tragedies of the strategy that the government is putting forward is that it seems to have abandoned the goal of full employment. Nowhere in the Governor General's speech was there a clear commitment to full employment. The government talked in very general terms about wanting growth in employment-and I do not doubt that it does-but it does not seem to be committed to the goal of full employment any Certainly the Treasurer is mocking even the goal of five per cent unemployment by the year 2000. He was quoted in the Australian Financial Review shortly after the election as saying that was always a fantasy and that there was no way it is possible, in effect. That is simply not true. It would have been possible and, by criticising that goal, he is demonstrating that the government is no longer even seeking that goal. That is a tragedy for the Australian people and a particular tragedy for those people who are going to lose their jobs as a result of the policies that have now been put in place. There are really severe costs resulting from these proposed cuts, and it seems that the government is quite lacking in comprehension about the costs of what it is proposing. There seems to be an incomprehension about the importance of human services and what they do for the Australian people. What is good government about? Good government-at least in part-is about maximising the growth of employment, maximising security and improving and maximising the quality and accessibility of the services the government provides for the people. That is what people want. If a government set out to do those things only, it would be almost guaranteed re-election. But what is the government doing? It is undermining each of those goals. To take some very obvious examples, the government is talking about reductions in the allocations to universities and to other postsecondary education. That will reduce enrolments, reduce the quality of teaching at universities and TAPEs and undermine the goal of trying to make Australia a clever country. That damages the lifetime employment prospects and opportunities of numbers of Australia's young people. That is a tragedy. There will be reduced work experience and training opportunities if the government goes ahead with the decimation of labour market programs that it is talking about. Those labour market programs are demonstrably effective in increasing the employability of the people who go through them. Not everyone who goes through them gets a job, but the people who do go through them have a better chance of getting a job than those who do not. All the research about the outcomes of those programs demonstrates that quite clearly. To reduce expenditure on those programs is to undermine the employment prospects of the long-term unemployed, and that is simply inhumane and irresponsible. The government is talking about making cuts in all sorts of areas of the Public in ways that will directly undermine the well-being of Australian people. I heard at the weekend that there are major cuts in the provision of public health. Public health is one of the most cost-effective areas of health expenditure that you can imagine, because it encourages people to live healthier lives and it deals with major health problems in ways that reduce ill health before it occurs. To cut back on those public health programs is to undermine a demonstrably cost-effective area of government expenditure and it will also undermine the health of the Australian community. There is talk of either combining the offices of the Department of Social Security and the Commonwealth Employment Service or cutting back staff in those areas. To cut back staff in those areas would be to reduce the quality of service to people who need it at the most vulnerable time of their lives. I went with a constituent to the Social Security office in my electorate just a few days ago. I was very pleased to find that the waiting time was short, that the person behind the counter handled the client effectively and with good knowledge, and that the problem was dealt with quickly. I was impressed with that standard of service but, if staff is cut, that standard of service will be undermined. Again, that will inhumanely reduce the quality of service to the Australian people at the time they need it most. A particularly damaging consequence of the cuts is t-at regional offices of many departments WIll be closed down. I am surprised that the National Party has not protested more about this. We have heard of tax offices being closed, offices of the Family Court being closed and CES and Social Security offices being closed. No doubt there are many others. That really will reduce the standard of service and the accessibility of service in regional Australia. It is true that those offices are sometimes a little more expensive per client than are offices in the capital cities, but that is something that the Labor government was prep-ed to accept in order to ensure a high quality of accessible service in regional Australia. The new coalition government seems to have neglected people who, one Service would have imagined, it would want to represent effectively. There are many other cuts as well. Cuts which have already been announced are 530 in Health and Family Services, 180 in the Environment Protection Agency and 400 in Customs. We have got the absurd situation of Customs offices closing in ways that will make it much easier for people to try to avoid customs. We have people being cut from the Australian National Audit Office which, again, is perverse because that undermines the scrutiny of effectiveness and efficiency within the public sector. This is ideology carried to destructive extremes. It is extraordinary. The Department of Industry, Science and Technology is downsizing by 200. Worksafe Australia has been told to cut 80 staff-again contributing to reducing the effectiveness of work safety programs in ways that will lead to more work injury and, again, greater damage. The National Crime Authority has been told to reduce its staff by 50. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission has been told to reduce its staff by 35. The Australian Securities Commission, which is a very important area for ensuring ethical and legal business practice, has been told to reduce its staff by 150, for goodness sake. The Commonwealth Ombudsman has been told to reduce its staff by 48. These are extraordinary misjudgments. It is ideology carried to extremes. One of the extraordinary things is that this is happening at exactly the time that, overseas, where profits have been downsizing, people have been reconsidering their approach. It has been very striking to read in the last few weeks that people who have been advocating downsizing for the private sector are now reversing and saying that they made misjudgments. A particularly clear example is Stephen Roach, the chief economist at Morgan Stanley and previously the chief forecaster at the Federal Reserve in the US. One of the great advocates of downsizing in the 1980s, he has now said that he was wrong and that this is destructive. There are some very good quotations from what he has said. Recently, he writes, for example: For years, I have extolled the virtues of America's productivity-led recovery. While I think it's safe to say that such a scenario has become the new mantra for US businesses in the 1990s, I must confess that I'm now having second thoughts. Slash-and-bum restructuring is not a permanent solution. Tactics of open-ended down-sizing and real wage compression are ultimately recipes for industrial extinction. How right he is or, as he later put it more bluntly: If all you do is cut, then you will eventually be left with nothing, with no market share. It is impressive that he has the honesty to admit that he was wrong; but he is saying that downsizing is damaging to companies. Of course, it is equally damaging to the private sector because: it reduces morale; it reduces efficiency because p-ople are afraid, insecure and cease to take initiative; and the dynamism of enterprises, whether they be private or public sector, is reduced and people become preoccupied simply with protecting their own patch and not with doing the jobs, let alone advancing the organisations they . work for. Downsizing is destructive of the effectiveness of the organisations that are doing it whether they be in the public or private sector. Yet, at exactly the time that such a strategy is being questioned and many US companies are, in fact, reversing their position on it, the coalition government is proclaiming it as the way forward. How extraordinarily misjudged and ignorant. One of the major plans they are said to be making, although we have not had confirmation of this, is that they are planning to transfer many functions from the Commonwealth to the states and territories. No doubt we will be debating this very much more fully in future when we know details. But it seems very likely that, since this is an idea that has been put forward in the past by Treasury and the Department of Finance and the coalition government seems to be of a mind to accept that kind of advice now, they will do so for exactly the same reasons as Treasury and Finance wanted to do it before, which was to use such a transfer as a cover for further cuts. It is very striking that there has been a downward trend in allocations by the Commonwealth to the states and territories during the last 20 years in ways that, personally, I feel have been a mistake. But further transfers of functions to the states and territories would undoubtedly be a cover for further cuts in funding relative to the number of functions to be fulfilled which would be forced on the states and territories. And that, too, would be very damaging to the quality and accessibility of services provided by the states and territories-which are, after all; the main direct providers. One of the most saddening features of this strategy is that it involves the abandonment of political morality. Because, if it is undertaken in the way that is being talked about, it mean the abandonment of many of the election promises that the coalition government made. For example, the present Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Reith), during the election campaign, said that the coalition would aim in government to ensure the employment of a fair and appropriate number of young people within the Public Service. Yet, in the office next to mine, when I was coming into work on Monday, I saw this sign, headed 'Public Service Recruitment Testing in the ACT', which says: There will be no test for 1996. The next test may maybe held early 1997. So this is a direct announcement of a repudiation of a clear undertaking given by the coalition during the election campaign. (Time expired)",25
8,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Mr Jenkins)Order! Before I call the honourable member for Forde, I remind the House that this is the honourable member's first speech and I ask the House to extend to her the usual courtesies.",29
9,Mrs ELSON,Unknown,"It is a great privilege to be standing in this chamber as part of the class of 1996-a large class at that! It is very easy for a lot of us, when we see our name on the ballot paper, to assume that people are solely voting for us as individuals. By the end of a long campaign, when you have knocked on endless doors and you have met what seems to be more people than could possible be enrolled to vote, you start thinking, well they're actually voting for me. After all the sacrifice and sheer hard work of the campaign, I guess it is natural that we indulge ourselves and imagine we are personally responsible for the swings we achieved in individual seats. But I am under no such delusion. Notwithstanding the strong, professional, hard-fought local campaign that my campaign team and I put in, I am entirely aware of why I am here and who the people of Forde voted for on 2 March. They voted for a coalition government and they voted for would John Howard, the member for Bennelong, as Prime Minister. I would like to place on record my thanks to the Prime Minister and his family for their commitment to the Liberal Party and to the people of Australia, particularly during the campaign. Time and time again, as I doorknocked and spoke with the people of the electorate, I heard expressions of respect, trust and admiration for the member for Bennelong. It is a huge testament to him that, despite the fact that politicians are held in such low regard by many Australians, he has managed to maintain trust with the public over such a long period. As a Liberal Party member for over nine years and having stood as a candidate previously, I know that party leadership is crucial. It makes or breaks a campaign. For better or worse, it has become the wave upon which public opinion rides, which is why I know so many of us on this side of the House were delighted when the Labor Party adopted leadership as its campaign theme and slogan, for leadership is purely judged on achievements and outcomes. In that true sense, the Labor Party and its leaders over the past 13 years, particularly the former Prime Minister, failed miserably. They failed the Australian people and they failed the labour movement, as it once used to be. There has been a lot of speculation as to why people voted the way they did on 2 March. It is true that many thousands of people voted for change. But I do not believe they voted for change for the sake of change. It has really amazed me how condescending members opposite have been over the past few weeks about the depth of the message sent to them on 2 March. They seem to regard the results as some sort of aberration. They close their eyes to the damage inflicted on so many individual Australians by their years of mismanagement. In Forde, the largest swings, some 14 per cent, were achieved in what were traditionally considered Labor heartland areas, like Eagleby, Kingston and Marsden. These suburbs are ' made up of good, hard working Australians, blue collar workers, decent Queenslanders. Mr Keating would have described them as true believers. But the fact is they stopped believing in the Labor Party a long time ago. What angers me is that members opposite can still stand in this chamber and declare themselves the champions of the battlers. They believe they have some sort of monopolyon working class values. Well, Mr Deputy Speaker, I am proud to be able to stand on this side of the chamber, as other Liberals have before me, and outline my own working class origins. I am one of nine children. I left school at 13 to work in a factory to help support the family when dad took ill. Through hard work and determination, I was able to complete my education later in my working life. Together, my husband, David, and I owned and ran a small business before hitting hard times under the Whitlam government. We also raised eight children. The fact is we have had to work damned hard to achieve what we have and it really riles me when members opposite sit there smugly and say that we are a party that somehow inherited or bought our way into the world. Well, that old class warfare is absolute rubbish and the people of Australia told them so on 2 March. The reason that so many Labor voters found it easy to vote for the coalition is they did not feel they deserted Labor Party because they knew the Labor Party had actually deserted them a long time ago. I want to place on record my sincere thanks to the people of Forde. My family and I have lived in Forde for the past 18 years. I am honoured and regard it as a great prjvilege to be representing such a diverse and beautiful electorate. Forde is a fairly new seat, having been formed in 1984. The composition of the electorate changed dramatically in the 1994 redistribution. The boundary changes altered its nature from largely suburban-metropolitan to a semi-rural one. It stretches over 4,500 square kilometres. Such is the diversity of my electorate that it contains Australia's premier tourist theme park, Movieworld, at Coomera; some of the most beautiful and pristine national park areas, in Lamington, Binna Burra and Kooralbyn; the scenic rural towns of Beaudesert, Boonah and Rathdowney; and some of the fastest growing residential areas of two of the most rapid growth local governments in Australia, Logan and Gold Coast city councils. The historic sugar cane town of Beenleigh, with its rum distillery, is now a growing regional centre. It is poised to become well known as the gateway to the Gold Coast, with a multi-million dollar transit centre planned this year. Situated halfway between Brisbane and the Gold Coast, Beenleigh is ideally placed to capitalise on the huge growth that is taking place in the Gold Coast corridor. Of course, with rapid growth comes special challenges for the government---challenges that unfortunately the previous Labor governments, both state and federal, failed to tackle. To the north of Beenleigh, at Loganlea, is the Logan Hospital. Like other public hospitals throughout Australia, patient waiting lists have grown to unreasonable proportions. Waiting times for public dental treatment are simply appalling. It is clear that the previous Labor government failed to match funding levels with the demands on this hospital. It has failed to recognise and plan for the rapid growth of this area. This fact was abundantly obvious on a the whole range of issues as I met and spoke with local residents in the 12 months leading up to the election. Rapid growth has also brought added difficulties with crime and safety, and added pressure on our police force. An electorate wide survey which I conducted found that crime and safety was the No. I concern with over 90 per cent of my residents. I know many of us in this place remember the time when doors were left unlocked, evening strolls were relaxed and enjoyable and news of violence and murder was rare and shocking. I am not an advocate of the good old days, nor do I have any desire to turn back the clock. But I feel sad that our children and grandchildren do not share the same sense of personal safety that we did. I feel a very deep responsibility that we as the government have to try to stem the tide of rising crime. We cannot allow it to be left in the too-hard basket. We must take a long-term approach and address the underlying cause of crime-social breakdown. That means restoring the value of the family, gi ving parents more responsibility for their children and trying to foster and instil a sense of community citizenship. There can be nothing more lacking in Australia today than a true uniting sense of community. It is a sad indictment of the Labor government's divide and rule mentality that we seem to be missing the true sense of national pride. I believe this is largely due the fact that we had a Prime Minister who was ashamed of our history and was hell-bent on advocating his vision for the future-a vision which more than half of Australia did not share. Good government, honesty and true pride in a nation will be the foundations for helping mend the social damage done by the Labor government and will go a long way towards uniting our communities. It seems a paradox that the one time. I felt the Australian community grow more united was when we shared our grief over the tragedy in Port Arthur. If we could only maintain that sense of communion, of oneness, each day of the year, then individuals might not become so alienated and lost as to commit such massive destruction. If each of us could show the same concern today for all of our fellow Australians as we now extend to the families of those involved in the Port Arthur tragedy, then we could recognise and perhaps help those in our community who are in desperate need of help. I want to place on record my complete support for the nationwide gun restriction measures that have been agreed to by all states. Further, I am very pleased that the government has indicated that it will closely examine the problems of violence in television and films. I defy anyone to explain the purpose that graphic violence serves. There is little doubt in my mind that this continual of violence is contributing to urban crime. In Forde there are several areas where local residents have experienced what can only be described as urban terrorism. In Eagleby, just to the north-east of Beenleigh, youth street gangs have made local residents fearful of even stepping into their own backyards. A few weeks ago a local Eagleby man came into my office bleary-eyed because he had not slept all night. He was sick with worry about the gun shots and the cars speeding up and down his street constantly. This man broke down and cried, and told me how his wife had been forced to leave their horne to go and live with her mother because it was not safe to stay there. Regrettably, this is not an isolated case. I heard many similar stories from other local to residents. This should not be happening in our suburbs, not in suburbs like Eagleby, where the residents are decent hard working people as well as elderly retired people. Working closely with the new state government to deliver a safer community for all Forde residents, particularly those in Eagleby, is one of my top priorities. Sadly, there has also been an increase in youth crime in rural areas, which for years managed to remain insulated from many of the problems experienced in the city. As regional unemployment has grown and local jobs have become more and more scarce, many local rural children face an uncertain future. In Beaudesert, which is just recovering from severe drought and the destruction of one of its oldest commercial buildings by fire, the recent announcement of the closure of the Australian Meat Holdings processing plant comes as a severe blow. This beautiful country town runs the risk of becoming a ghost town unless other industries can be attracted to the area. I want to assure the people of Beaudesert and surrounding areas that I will work very closely with their local government leaders to promote the area and to assist those who are left jobless by the closure. The rneatworks and feedlot have been part of the local economy for 44 years and employed up to 600 local residents. Last week's shutdown comes after a protracted industrial diet dispute-a dispute which I believe was drawn out due to the attitude of union bosses. I spoke with many local workers during the dispute who wanted to return to work. They did not want to hold out; they just wanted to get on with the job. Sadly, they no longer have a job to get on with. We cannot be sure that if the dispute had not occurred neither would the shutdown, but I am certain that it was a consideration when the company had to make a final decision. I concur with what others have said in this debate: there is a rightful place for unions workers' advocates but not as the controlling master of the government and not as blackmailers of employees. It is a travesty that during Labor's term in office the union movement received on average $14 million each year in the form of direct grants. In the decade preceding my election to parliament, I spent a great deal of time working with associations that assist disabled peopleMulticap, the Queensland Spastic Welfare League and, most recently, the Handicapped Association. I can tell you that $14 million each year would have made a huge difference to those people struggling to lead normal lives and to the families who care for them. Just imagine how many families would have benefited from respite care with $14 million. It would offer welcome relief to the woman who came to see me recently who is caring for her 14-year-old handicapped son. She receives only one day every five months in respite care. Disabled people-yet another group ignored by Labor-disabled youth, the frail and the elderly, and particularly their carers, need more government and community attention. I would like to place on record my utmost respect for the many employees of associations I have worked with, particularly the Handicapped Association, which is now known as the Horizon Foundation. Those employees are making a real difference in the lives of disabled people through offering support and relief for their families. I have focused a great deal on some of the challenges and particular problems facing the nation and the people of Forde. Forde is also an electorate of growing business opportunities. The small business men and women of our regional and urban centres-those who are still there-have weathered the storm of Labor's recession. I want to congratulate the local chambers of commerce for the support and fellowship they have provided to small business operators and the contribution they have made to their local communities. I can promise you one thing: Paul Keating was wrong. That wasn't as good as it gets. Indeed, the best is yet to come, under the Howard government. Already in the first few weeks of parliament the government has as begun to deliver on its commitment to small business. The decrease in the provisional tax uplift factor and the establishment of a small business deregulation task force to have red tape and regulation are solid examples of our understanding of the needs of small business. I would like for one moment to take this opportunity to promote a local industry and to offer to all honourable members of this House a very helpful tip. You could not hope to find a more peaceful, relaxing place to escape to than the Gold Coast hinterland in my electorate-from the mountain resorts of Binna Burra and O'Reillys in the Lamington National Park, to the five-star lUXUry of Kooralbyn Resort, through to the many beautiful secluded bed and breakfasts on Tamborine Mountain. Tamborine Mountain has a very special charm, with its thriving cottage craft industry. I highly recommend it as a great weekend escape, especially to my many Queensland colleagues. The beautiful and historic rural townships of Rathdowney, Mount Alford and Boonah shire also make lovely sight-seeing day trips. For the more adventurous, you can get wet and wild at the Coomera Waterslide Park of the same name or, as I mentioned earlier, visit our theme park Movie World. I am indeed very privileged to be representing this part of the world. Once again, I thank the voters of Forde for the confidence they showed in me on 2 March. In return, I promise that I will constantly thrive to truly represent their hopes, desires and interests. As I said in my opening remarks, I have no delusions about being here. I was elected on the strength of the leadership of the honourable member for Bennelong, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), and the progressive policies of the Liberal Party. The party organisation is to be especially commended for the thoroughly professional campaign and the tremendous support provided to all candidates. I want to express my very deep gratitude to our Federal Director, Andrew Robb, and my personal thanks to his brilliant deputy, Lynton Crosby-whom we were very fortunate to have as a state director in Queensland for a time-and to all the team at the federal secretariat and the many who worked at the campaign headquarters during the five weeks of the campaign. In Queensland, our state director, Jim Barron, and our president, Bob Tucker, have excelled themselves by gaining state government during a federal campaign. As I said earlier, we ran a very tough, grassroots local campaign, and I had a first-class team behind me who kept me going for the long 12 months. I could not have been more proud of how it all came together on election day. Unfortunately, there is not time today to mention everyone who helped, but I would like to thank a few key people who were absolutely crucial to our victory. I would like to thank my current FEC chairman, Bob Carroll, who was pivotal in ensuring we had the resources necessary to fight a professional campaign; our treasurer and all-round good guy, John Wallerstein; and local businessman, Brian Gassman. I want to convey my personal thanks to the honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford), who was very supportive, and his secretary, Margaret, who was also very helpful, and his FEC chairman, Peter Gallus. I also want to thank those people who have supported me in my other campaigns over the past 15 years, as well as this one, Jan and Allan Waite. As my personal secretary, Jan has also been tremendous over the past few months, together with my electorate officer Sheila Boreland, in helping to establish my office. I would also like to thank the powerhouse of the campaign, right from preselection through to election day-my eldest daughter, Selma, and her husband, Andrew Schuller. Andrew and Selma not only devised the campaign strategy but made everything happen. Andrew was part of the team in the campaign headquarters in Melbourne, and so many members would know just how helpful he is. I am very grateful that he managed to find the extra energy to help me out on his weekends and after hours. A special thanks must go to all of .my children: Selma, 27; Kellie, 26; David, 25; William, 24; Edward, 22; George, 20; Johllene, 18; and, Talena, 16Yz going on 17. I am very fortunate to have my eldest and youngest daughters here with me today. Selma works in Canberra and Talena is a student. To all of my children who are sitting by their radios at work today-and I am proud to say that they all work-thank you very much. I am standing here today due to their many years of support, understanding, tolerance, respect and, especially, love. I am very proud of these eight very special Australians. I would also like to mention their spouses and girlfriends, who were also a ready-made work force. I would like to thank John Smits, Tracey Thornbury, Samantha Jones, and Kristy Keevers. To my four absolutely beautiful grandchildren who provided me with the best relaxation therapy possible-Jasmine, Nicholas and Caitlyn Smits, and Jillian Schuller-I say hello. Finally, I would like to thank my loving husband. No-one could wish for a more supportive and loving partner and friend. All through our 29 years of marriage we have shared our lives and our dreams. Our goals have been joint ones, and he has spurred me on on those rare occasions when I felt like giving up. Particularly over the last 12 months, he has kept the home fires burning and has been a constant support to the family. particularly David, this is for you. In conclusion, may I congratulate all of my colleagues who make up this large and enthusiastic class of 1996. I am sure that, like me, you feel very honoured and humble to be part of such a historic victory for our party. We must all continue to share the drive and determination personified by our Prime Minister and to carry through on the responsibility and the trust that are placed in us-to deliver fair and responsible government for all Australians, and for all of us.",29
10,Mr JENKINS,Unknown,"I compliment the honourable member for Forde (Mrs Elson) on her first speech. May she find her time in this place rewarding, and may she also gain the respect of both sides of the chamber that her predecessor, Mary Crawford, achieved. In 1845 Benjamin Disraeli said, 'A conservative government is an organised hypocrisy.' In the weeks since the federal election, it has become clear that this government will prove no different. There has been much talk about mandates. Whatever one's position is on the issue of mandates, it is clear that the coalition government's election was based, in part, on the assurances that were given about what would not happen if it achieved office. Indeed, on the second day of the campaign, the then Leader of the Opposition, the now Prime Minister (Mr Howard), issued an extraordinary list of things that a coalition government would not do. This set the tone for the whole campaign. On every major issue the coalition made soothing statements that this or that would not be changed. But what has happened? Let us look at some of the major areas: first of all, industrial relations. During the campaign there was plenty of rhetoric about noone being forced off awards and no worker being worse off and no big bang in industrial relations. But what has happened? The government proposes to introduce workplace agreements that will take precedence over award conditions. For example, in Victoriawhere thousands of people fled Jeff Kennett's so-called reforms-people will lose the protection of a federal award. All that they will be left with is a workplace agreement that meets a handful of minimum standards. The Industrial Relations Commission, which during the campaign the Australian community was assured would not be gutted, will have its jurisdiction limited to these handful of minimum standards. The hallmark of the new system will be the potential domination, under a cloak of secrecy, of individual employees by employers. This potential is as old as capitalism itself; it is the reason why trade unions were formed in the first place. This government would do well to reflect on the Westminster traditionthat right-wing governments since that of William Pitt the Younger in 1799 have been attempting to use legislation to crush trade unions. And they have all failed. The next area to look at is taxation. During the election campaign the Australian people were exposed to the absolute theatre of the coalition's bullyboy shouting on the television, shouting on the radio, shouting about 'no new taxes' and 'no increases to existing taxes'. He could not have been more emphatic if he had borrowed George Bush's campaign trail answer about new taxes, 'Read my lips'. But after just a few short weeks the credibility of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) is in tatters, hanging by a thread-the only finance minister in modem history to contend that a tariff is not a tax. The Treasurer has been widely claiming that the government decision in relation to the tariff concession scheme was a reduction of 40 per cent in the impact of a Labor government proposal on business. Businesses are always a special interest group closest to the hearts of coalition governments. But who picks up the difference for the reduction of this burden on business? The consumer; of course, the consumer-Fightback through the backdoor. Turning to tax avoidance, it would seem that the government is now preparing to keep its 'no new taxes' promise at least in one area-that of trusts. I have grave fears that the government is preparing to prevaricate on the introduction of tough measures to put a stop to the misuse of trusts. On the Sunday program the Treasurer said: If need be we will be introducing legislation, but with all these things, its not an easy line to draw and I am now advised its such a difficult line to draw that its going to take a lot of public discussion and we'll engage in that. This is the sort of dissembling language once referred to by George Orwell as 'falling upon the facts like soft snow, blurring the outlines and covering up all the details'. The tone of the statements attributed to the tax commissioner in the Financial Review yesterday morning is markedly different to the equivocation of the Treasurer. But it will require political will to bring these changes into being. It seems that it is fine to attempt to sell Telstra and smash the industrial relations system in Australia in this first parliamentary session. But to tighten loopholes exploited by the rich? That takes time. It is remarkable how easy it is to pick who the winners are under a coalition government. The next area I turn to is higher education. In higher education grand promises were extolled during the campaign that were designed to lull the community into a false sense of security. The Prime Minister said that a coalition government would: ... at least maintain the level of Commonwealth funding to universities both in terms of operating grants and research grants; Mr Deputy Speaker, you cannot get clearer than that, can you? According to numerous reports, this promise was laughed off as a joke by the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone, over dinner with the vicech-cell-rs: In question time on Monday, the Pnme Minister refused to reaffirm his commitment. There have been suggestions that the coalition government will slash up to 12 per cent from the higher education budget. A cut of anything like this magnitude will leave the - ystem-a - ystem that has been incrementally Improved SInce the days of Gough Whitlama ruin. Australia is now looking at nothing short of a headlong return to the days when university education was a privilege to be enjoyed only by the rich few. The Australian electorate did not vote for this. Another area we can look at is immigration. The coalition election commitments were also quite specific in the area of immigration and ethnic affairs. There was a commitment not to reduce the humanitarian and refugee program. Now it is revealed that there will be a fairly significant reduction. This is an open and direct breach of pre-election commitments. The baseline is to be reduced from 13,000 places to 10,000, with a corresponding cut in the refugee program from 4,000 places to 3,335. In a cabinet submission, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) has outlined the development of a strategy. But what is the strategy for? It is a strategy for hiding this breach of coalition election commitments. This example heightens concern about what the government ·has planned for other categories of Australia's immigration program. The coalition's statements on any issue before the election obviously cannot be relied upon. Earlier this week the member for Denison (Mr Kerr) pointed out a whole range of proposed changes in the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs that the government is implementing. They amount to a dismantling of bipartisanship on these issues and are of serious concern, given the coalition's rhetoric before the election. I share the concerns of the member for Denison about the impact of these changes on those who come to Australia from other countries and on the ability of the department to deliver services. Another area we should be concerned about is the environment. This government was elected on a clear promise to maintain all existing environment programs funded by the Labor government. Of course, this was part of the wider fiction that the coalition, after years of opposition to major environmental initiatives, had suddenly turned out to be greenies at heart. Some people saw through this fiction, but I daresay others did not. It has now all begun to unravel. On the one hand, the Prime Minister has been suggesting in this House that members of the opposition who voted against the sale of Telstra legislation had no concern for the environment. I have already placed on record my total rejection of this spurious argument. But what do we see from the Leader of the Government in the Senate and Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) on the other hand? He is quoted as saying, in reference to the National Heritage Trust Bill: We don't want to clog up our own program with bills that are not essential. Apart from the remarkable circumstance of the Minister for the Environment suggesting that the environment is not essential, at the same time as they are delaying this bill, the funding of 10 vital programs to the environment is due to expire on 30 June. Where is the commitment to ongoing funds for these programs from this 'green' government? The programs in question are not peripheral. !hey d-al with - atters as vital as preven-ng mdustnal pollutIon, combating feral pests, protecting nature reserves, weed control, feral animal control and so on. What is the justification that is used for squirming out of so many ironclad, rock-solid commitments? We get the answer: the underlying deficit. Noone, apart from the coalition apparatchiks, believes this to be a real number, certainly not an important number, but I am sure that many people in the electorate are confused by the repeated claims and counter-claims. This morning both the member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) and the member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) have dealt with the budget deficit myth with devastating effect. If you take away all the rhetoric and look at what academic economists have to say, the coalition's con is exposed for all to see. I refer to a public letter in the Financial Review of 20 May from Professors Fred Argy, Fred Gruen and John Nevile. This letter from these distinguished commentators needs to be quoted often and at length. They say: Public discussion of the projected $8 billion deficit needs to be put in a better perspective . . . The figure of $8 billion is itself not a finn figure. a Treasury forecast assuming no policy changes and a rate of growth of 3.25 per cent ... The Australian economy is currently running between 1.5 and 2 per cent below its full capacity level. If it were at full capacity that alone would reduce the starting deficit for 1996n by about a half. The professors conclude with a warning: It is neither necessary nor desirable to seek to reduce discretionary spending by $8 billion over the next two years simply because the economy is forecast to grow more slowly. If the economy is indeed slowing down, such a policy may well slow it down even further and increase unemployment in the short tenn, while helping neither the fiscal deficit nor the national saving rate. Certainly no-one voted for higher unemployment, but this is exactly the course on which the government has embarked. Having been elected on a string of commitments that conflict with its basic ideology, the coalition is seeking to manufacture a pretext on which it can escape them and at the same time implement an agenda more in line with its core philosophies. As the former Prime Minister, Paul Keating, said in his concession speech, the Liberal and National parties won the election on the promise not to dismantle the major social and economic infrastructure built up during Labor's 13 years in office. In the short weeks since 2 March, the real agenda has well and truly begun to show through. It is not a new agenda; it is one to which the coalition parties have been committed in various guises for many years. It is an agenda that was deliberately obscured during the election campaign. If you examine the government's actions in the weeks since the election, there are two possible conclusions about this government, both of them equally grave for Australia. The first is that this is a government that has an outlook fixed in the 1950s and 1960s and that is acting out of a sense of nostalgia, attempting to change things back for the sake of it. The second conclusion--equally, perhaps more, ominous-is that the government is preparing to conduct an ideological experiment with policies that have been proven failures in the rest of the developed world. The longevity of the Labor government meant that until now Australia has been spared the It is excesses of ideologically driven free-market economic and social policy, often referred to as Reaganomics or Thatcherism. The government has no mandate for these pernicious policies, which have already been discredited overseas. I was interested in an article which ap..: peared in the Weekend Australian last weekend, which reported on what can occur if rampant individualism is allowed to go unchecked. It is under the heading 'The Me Society'. It relates the overemphasis in American society on the role of the individual and contends that this has led to a destabilising effect on civic society. According to the author, this individualism has led to a viciously greedy form of capitalism. Not only has the role of the state been weakened by this but churches, charity organisations, sporting clubs and even families suffer because people withdraw from participating in society. The article says: The citizenry seems to be losing its remarkable commitment to civic life, whether it is a matter of joining groups, attending parent teacher association meetings, visiting neighbours, or simply bothering to vote. As a consequence of handing over responsibility to the states in the area of welfare, some states are now trying to make their welfare systems as unattractive as possible, thinking that this will push the problem onto . another, perhaps more generous, state. In this article, Harvard law professor Mary Ann Glendon says that this arises because Americans have come to view their individual rights as absolute in a way which ignores community obligations. This a timely warning for Australia. The article says, 'In short, the US is becoming a more selfish society at precisely the time that Australia and other developed nations are becoming more like the US.' We as Australians must retain our sense of community which understands individual rights in the context that we are all Australians together with obligations to each other. In conclusion, I wish to refer to a quote of the great philosopher of liberalism John Stewart Mill, who once wrote, 'Not all conservative people are stupid, but all stupid people are conservative.' I remind the House that the Prime Minister is on record as describing himself as the most conservative Liberal leader ever. For the sake of the nation, let us hope that he does not live up to the other side of Mill's equation. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs Sullivan)-Before I call the honourable member for Robertson, I remind the House that this is the honourable member's first speech and I invite the House to extend to him the usual courtesies.",33
11,Mr LLOYD,Unknown,"I am proud to address the House today as the member for Robertson. As I stand in this chamber to deliver my first speech I am very conscious of the honour and responsibility that has been given to me by the people of Robertson. This electorate covers the southern half of the beautiful Central Coast of New South Wales and is based around the city of Gosford, the town centres of Terrigal, Avoca, Kincumber, Woy Woy, Ettalong, Pearl Beach and Patonga, and the rural areas of Somersby, Mangrove Mountain and Spencer. Robertson's southern boundary is the magnificent Hawkesbury River, one of the finest rivers in Australia, if not the world. I have been lucky enough to have the privilege of living on the banks of the Hawkesbury River for the past 20 years: firstly, on Dangar Island and then in the pretty village of Mooney Mooney, which is still my home today. Robertson is an electorate of 787 square miles covering a diverse geographical region. In the south we have the almost uninhibited Brisbane Water National Park, the Dharug National Park, and the river villages of Bar Point, Wobby Beach, Marlow Creek, Cogra Point and Wondabyne. The residents of these areas have no road access and rely solely on boat access to reach their homes. Robertson and the adjoining electorate of Berowra, held by my colleague the Hon. Philip Ruddock, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, have several hundred constituents whose only contact with the outside world is via the Hawkesbury River. The Hawkesbury River is indeed one of the most magnificent natural assets of New South Wales which must be protected at all costs. I look forward to the one-third sale of Telstra enabling our government to honour its commitment to the environment with an injection of funds to help regenerate the Nepean-Hawkesbury River system. Robertson is an electorate of contrast. It is a rapidly expanding area. It is an electorate of excitement and an electorate of challenge. The Woy Woy peninsula area, covering the towns of Ettalong, Umina and Woy Woy, has one of the highest percentages of older residents and veterans in Australia. It is an area populated by independent hard working people who have supported themselves and their families all their lives and have asked for little help from others. But now as the years roll on, many of these people need help-help which they have not received from the Labor government. Affordable nursing home accommodation is at crisis point in the peninsula area. Time and time again, I am approached by distraught family members or carers seeking my assistance when no place can be found on the Central Coast to accommodate an elderly family member. Can you imagine the trauma when a couple have been married for 50 or 60 years and one partner has to be taken away to be cared for in a nursing home, sometimes as far away as Sydney or Newcastle, because affordable care is just not available in the local area? This situation must not be allowed to continue. I can assure the residents of Robertson, particularly those living in the peninsula area, that I will continue to lobby the relevant ministers to address this situation, which has been ignored and neglected under Labor. According to the 1991 census figures, 22.9 per cent of all residents in Robertson, almost one-quarter, are aged over 60 years and the vast majority of these people live in the Woy Woy peninsula area. Yet under successive Labor governments and Labor members in both state and federal parliaments, this area still suffers from inadequate public transport; poor roads; a lack of public housing; inadequate medical resources; poor job prospects, particularly for young people; businesses and shops that still struggle to survive; and schools that are overcrowded and under-resourced. The people of the peninsula area are fighting back. On 2 March they decided enough is enough and they voted with their feet at the ballot box. Booths that have always been classified as safe Labor showed their anger and frustration at 13 years of neglect. The voters now look to me as part of the Howard coalition government-as someone who is, and always will be, part of their communityto offer them hope for their future and their children's futures, something the Labor government has failed to do. There is a tremendous fighting spirit and a sense of belonging in Robertson. We are all part of the Central Coast and we have all come here to give our families a better future. Robertson is now an electorate on the move. We are blessed with a magnificent environment-one which we must protect at all costs-with scenery and natural beauty ranked among the best in the world. We have magnificent surfing beaches-too numerous to mention here-coastal lagoons, untouched rainforests, wonderful national parks, lush farm land and grazing land in the areas of Somersby and Mangrove Mountain, and river hideaways along the Hawkesbury River-places where time has stood still. We have the bustling city of Gosford nestled alongside the magnificent Brisbane Water. We have the dozens of costal towns like Terrigal, Avoca, Copacabana, MCMasters Beach and Patonga where many of us came for holidays and never left. We have the rapidly expanding areas of Kariong and Kincumber, where every day amongst the sound of the bellbirds there is the sound of the builders' hammers creating yet another Australian dream for another Australian family-a home of their own in a friendly, happy and safe environment. This rapid growth, however, has brought with it many challenges: challenges such as providing adequate schools, hospitals and child-care facilities for the thousands of young families who move to the Central Coast of New South Wales each year seeking a better life for themselves and their children; and challenges such as giving hope to our young people-hope for jobs and hope for the future. There is an opportunity in Robertson to create that future and give these young people the jobs that they so desperately want. Planet Earth 2000 International Garden Festival is that opportunity. In 1994, a team headed by the Hon. Barry Cohen secured the rights to hold the year 2000 International Garden Festival at Mount Penang on the Central Coast of New South Wales. This major international showcase, now named Planet Earth 2000, will run for six months and will complement and enhance the year 2000 Sydney Olympics. A detailed feasibility study is nearing completion and I look forward to briefing the relevant ministers on the exciting details of this study shortly. Already I have had the pleasure to present to many government ministers a preliminary study which indicates that this festival will create over 9,000 full-time jobs and generate many hundreds of millions of dollars in economic activity. I appeal to all government ministers to continue to support Planet Earth 2000 festival proposals, as they will 1?e a springboard for many Australian companies and products into the export markets of Asia and beyond. I would like at this time to pay tribute to the efforts of the Hon. Barry Cohen to make this festival a reality. The former member for Robertson is a man for whom I have great respect and a man who I know has many friends in this place on both sides of the House. As Robertson has grown, so have the pressures of modem life and the expectations on young people to perfonn and be successful. There is an epidemic sweeping the Central Coast-an insidious, evil epidemic-which is claiming far too many young lives. That epidemic is suicide. So far this year, in 16 weeks, 21 Central Coast people have taken their own lives. All but two of these have been men, mostly young men who could not come to tenns with the pressures of life. If I achieve nothing else as a member of this government, it is my wish that I will help create an environment of hope and optimism, giving all Australians a sense of pride in themselves, their achievements, and their community. This challenge is one which we must all face together to build a better community. I have faced many challenges in my life, and two of those I would like to mention today because those challenges are responsible for me standing in this place as the member for Robertson. The first challenge was to open a road-not just any road, but the Pacific Highway-between Sydney and Gosford. In 1991 the Pacific Highway was closed by a landslip, leaving no alternative road other than the F3 freeway. In other words, if the F3 was closed by weather conditions or accidents, which unfortunately are all too regular occurrences on this road, all towns and cities north of the Hawkesbury River were virtually cut off from Sydney. The New South Wales state government at the time made the decision that the Pacific Highway was a low priority road and the road remained closed. In January 1993, despite being told by most people that you cannot change the mind of a government, I started a petition to reopen the old Pacific Highway. This campaign grew into one of the largest community actions ever Seen in New South Wales, with support coming from all sections of the community, including local government, media such as the Central Coast Express newspaper, and hundreds of other community groups. In all, over 30,000 signatures were collected on a petition which was then presented to the then New South Wales roads minister, the Hon. Wal Murray. On 3 June 1994 I had the privilege, alongside the then New South Wales state ministers, the Hon. Chris Hartcher and the Hon. Bruce Baird, of cutting the ribbon to mark the reopening of the Pacific Highway. The Central Coast of New South Wales had shown it had a voice-a voice that had to be listened to-and I had proved to individuals that a person can and will make a difference. At the time of this campaign, I held no public office nor did I represent any particular group. It was just the case of the whole community supporting a campaign for the good of the Central Coast. The second and biggest challenge I faced was to win the seat of Robertson for the Liberll:l Party. Again, I was told by many that it could not be done. It is 26 years since Robertson was last held by a Liberal member. In 1969 the seat was won by the Hon. Barry Cohen, who held the seat until his retirement in 1990, and the Hon. Frank Walker held the seat with a comfortable margin of 5.6 per cent until March this year. After 13 years of Labor government, the electors of Robertson wanted a change. They wanted to be represented by a local-a local who had a record of taking on challenges and standing up for the Central Coast. They wanted Robertson to be part of a Howard coalition government, and they made sure Robertson was part of this new government. The swing to the Liberal Party in Robertson was an incredible 9.1 per cent. Throughout the campaign, which was a long and hard fought one, I was supported by a small but hard working team whose support had encouraged me to complete what many people said was an impossible task. The members of all the local branches did a fantastic job and, more than anyone else, can take great delight in and credit for our amazing win when you consider that they have . worked year after year for the Liberal Party, having always done well at a federal level but never quite winning. This time, they showed that we were indeed a team to be reckoned with. Allan Woods, campaign manager, held this team together and made sure that we delivered a professionencouraged al and cohesive campaign. Colin and May Margin never doubted my ability to win, organised hundreds of volunteers on the Woy Woy peninsula to ensure our booths were fully manned. Suzanne Fosbery convinced me to nominate in the first place, and Ray Carter was always available for advice when it was and principles. needed most. Bob and Bev Ferrier carried on undaunted throughout our campaign, despite Bob's serious illness. Get well soon, Bob, as certainly need you back on deck. My good friends Chris Hartcher, the honourable ber for Gosford, and Mike Gallagher, now honourable member of the Legislative Council of New South Wales, both won their seats in parliament against the odds. They were family breakdowns. always available at any time of the day or night with their advice, friendship and encouragement, which will always remain special to me. The Minister for Immigration and Multiculstrength tural Affairs, the Hon. Philip Ruddock, is here in the chamber, and dozens of fantasAlison, tic supporters from the Berowra conference stuck to the task, and without them my job would have been that much harder. After win such as the one we experienced in Robertson there is always a long list wonderful people who rush to congratulate you. Every one of the cards and messages are very special to me, but none more so than visit I received from Mrs Jessie Hurley. Mrs Guinea. Hurley had baked a cake to celebrate my win. That in itself is not particularly significant, except for the fact that Mrs Hurley was born on 15 June 1890 and will shortly celebrate her 106th birthday. Mrs Hurley still lives a self-care unit with her daughter at Tarragal Glen Retirement Village and is an inspiration to all who meet her. We have invited the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to her birthday and we would be honoured if he would attend this happy occasion. I would also like to acknowledge the bilities honourable member for Dobe11 (Mr Lee), is in the chamber. I look forward to working my with him for the good of the central coast. My family and friends supported and me throughout the campaign, and this has helped me pursue my goals. Many of and these people put aside personal political preferences to assist me. My proud parents, Kevin and Hazel Lloyd, taught me to never give up, to always have faith in yourself and to always have commitment to your beliefs My parents have always led by example, having worked throughout their lives in small business ventures to raise a family and to we provide the secure environment in which my brother and I were lucky enough to grow up. memI am pleased to inform the House that my an parents recently celebrated their - old-n wedding anniversary, an event which IS becoming all too infrequent in these days of When you are the first and only member of your family to be involved in politics and public life, it is at times daunting for your family. Their support has been a great to me. My brother, Dary11, his partwho ner, Anne, and their children-Rodney, Bradley and Lachlan-have always all supported my projects and campaigns and have always had faith in my ability to suca ceed for the good of my community. My irrepressible cousin, Daniel Fitzhenry, was of always on hand when the pressures ?f the campaign were weighing me -0v.:n to lig-ten my day with a 'handy to have piece of Junk or a lengthy verse of Pidgin English, born of the his many years in the highlands of New My sons, Steven and Peter, who have always been my best friends, have grown into two fine young men, of whom I am immensely proud as they now go out into the work in force as young adults.

Our journey through life has not always been an easy one; but, with Kerry as my partner, it has been exciting and always challenging. This journey has moulded a team, a very strong team, which now stands ready to tackle the challenges that lie ahead in making Robertson and Australia a better place for all of us. Finally, I will close with these words: 'Ordinary men can do extraordinary things if but only given the chance.' I thank God and I thank the people of Robertson for giving me that chance.",37
12,Mr CREAN,Unknown,"Hotham) (11.49 a.m.}--I join with the colleagues of the member for Robertson (Mr Lloyd) in congratulating him on his inaugural speech. I look forward to his contribution in this parliament. On 2 March the Australian people opted for a change of government but not a change of policy. On every contentious point of difference raised in the lead-up to the campaign, the coalition adopted Labor's mantle-not necessarily in the detail but certainly in the essence. As far as the responsibility I have in induswould try and regional development is concerned, the government's policy documents consist almost entirely of 'me too' statements. There is no change to the diesel fuel rebate, the maintenance of support for export market development grants, the continued assistance for regional development initiatives at existing levels, the maintenance of the factor F pharmaceutical industry assistance package and the continued 150 per cent tax concession for industrial research and development. Even Labor's commitment to create 600,000 new jobs over the next term found a positive echo in the coalition's promise of 200,000 new jobs in the manufacturing industry. These of course were the promises, but they will be broken promises on 20 August. These supply bills authorise the continuation of supply-the funds to governmentunder current policies; that is, under Labor's policies. Of course, that will not be the case after the budget. We know now, as we suspected during the election campaign, that the coalition has no intention of honouring its promises to maintain our policies. Assistance for industry, in the government's view, is simply business welfare. That is consistent with its ideological view that there is no place for government in the market. We hear from various sources daily the changes being proposed to schemes such as the development import finance facility, the export market development grants scheme, the Asian infrastructure consortia program and the R&D concession. They all add up to a billion dollars a year in program assistance, which the government is about to cut. Add to this the increased pressures imposed on the manufacturing industry in this country by the appreciating dollar and you realise that it is not the time to cut the assistance. But of course the government's vie- is that cutting spending has primacy, no matter what the cost or regardless of the consequences. I will give just two examples of this-statements that have been made over recent days by ministers on the government side. The Assistant Treasurer, Jim Short, told the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry council dinner last week that the government be cutting industry programs that are effective and efficient. I can understand changes need to be made if the programs are not effective or are inefficient, but why get rid of the ones that work? Here is a deliberate statement to an industry that that is what the government is going to do. In addition, the Minister for Small Business  promised to shorten the period required for anti-dumping complaints but is persisting with a 10 per cent cut to customs staff that will make the promise impossible to deliver. I ask the members of the National Party in particular to reflect on that. We have seen significant growth in Australian manufacturing under Labor's reign. Australian manufacturing has been growing more quickly than almost any other major sector of the economy and since 1992 has grown by 26 per cent compared with economic growth overall of 16- per cent. Australia's manufacturing productivity has risen by 16.8 per cent since the end of 1991, and over the last decade manufacturing exports have risen on average by 17 per cent a year. That occurred through policies developed by the Labor government. We created the environment and the assistance by which that growth could happen. It will not happen on its own, as our history has shown. We are not saying that programs should not be reviewed. Many of the programs which now face the axe have been reviewed countlessly and have come up trumps. Look at the reports and findings in relation to the export market development grants scheme. These have significant multiplier effects in the economy. Without the scheme we would not have exports. Those opposite profess concern about making the economy more competitive and correcting our balance of payments, yet they are going to cut the very programs that have assisted us in making some important headway. If as a nation we are to get unemployment down, we need to generate economic growth on average at better than four per cent. That we can do it has been shown over the past 4years, as the member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) pointed out in an earlier contribution today. What also has been shown is that the constraint on doing better than four per cent economic growth is our balance of payments. The economic strategy that has to be developed, therefore, is one that addresses that constraint essentially by expanding our net exports. Whether it is export growth or competitive import replacement does not matter so long as the strategy is to expand net exports. Labor did much in its term of office to transform our industrial landscape. We took it from a protected, inward focused regime which was focused on producing essentially for a domestic market to one which is now internationally competitive and outward focused with significant diversification and already huge growth in export markets, to which I have alluded. But, despite all of that progress, we still have not broken the balance of payments constraint. There is agreement on the need to reduce tariff levels, to pursue micro-economic reform, to secure macro-economic stability, to lock in low inflation, to improve productivity and to lift our skills base. Both sides of the House seem to be in agreement about that. There have been essential elements in the progress that we have made, but in themselves they are not enough. Should we leave the shape and performance of Australian industry-so critical to growth, jobs and regional development-simply to market forces? Labor's view is that we should not. Labor in government did increase industry's exposure to competition and to international market forces, but at the same time it recognised that intervention was necessary to assist industries to make the transition to becoming internationally competitive. We supported this transition with a raft of industry plans, assistance programs, reforms to the workplace, training and education infrastructure, and assistance particularly for disadvantaged groups who were affected by the change. Success is going to be based on both competitive relations and ensuring not only that firms are competitive between themselves but also that we develop patterns and networks of collaborative and cooperative relations between firms and institutions. Critical to both the competitive and collaborative relations is information and understanding of the context of the markets in which they operate. It is in that regard that government also has a critical role to play in establishing these cooperative relations and in developing the understanding of context. The reforms and programs that Labor in government put in place and its recognition and development of the role of government , were based on a recognition of the importance of market forces and also their limitations in making that transition and the risks involved in a complete surrender to them. What really is at stake is whether we actually have a view of how the nation develops and are prepared to act upon it or we simply leave it to market forces. The reality is we need a more active industry policy, one which recognises the limits of the free market philosophy, one which actively encourages and supports the manufacturing sector. Whilst job opportunities in the manufacturing sector are limited, the sector is central this economy because of its wealth creating and technological development roles. It is also the essential underpinning of a burgeoning services sector-the jobs creator. But free market economics does not work perfectly. Individuals and firms do not always act rationally. In some industries few firms compete in oligopolistic markets. Not all of our trading partners and competitors are committed to the same pace of change as us or indeed have caught up to where we are. The so-called free market induced equilibriums do not materialise, as the textbooks and the theorists would have us believe. Knowledge within and about markets is not perfect, as the theorists would have us believe. The doctrine of 'factor endowments' has been swamped by the ability of transnationals to pick and choose the location and operations of their businesses. In essence it no longer a question of what you have naturally; it is what you do with it. We must be in a position where we are prepared to better value add the natural resource base and combine it with our obvious skills base. In this regard significant progress has been made under Labor's reign, but there still is much more to do. I am firmly convinced that it will not happen on its own. We have to support industry in the direction of the change we expect them to be part of. It is not good enough simply to urge industry to become more competitive and productive. We have to assist them to become so. Whilst we have worked well to remove the old protective policy regime and open up the economy with impressive results to date, we must do more now to develop the new policy regime. The debate on industry policy in this country has been debased. It has been simplified to a choice between the free market· and intervention. My argument is that we need to look at these issues strategically, not polemileverage. cally. In essence, the argument is one about reaching our potential in industries where we know we have strengths due essentially to the combination of our natural resource base and our skills base. The approach will increasingly involve regional applications in the context of national strategies and the accessing of to support programs. The approach must be industry driven, not government driven, so that the market structure and its competition are properly understood. The response itself, as distinct from simply the approach, will invariably involve a partnership between government and industry to match the policy instruments to the circumstances, to achieve a proper balance between a market discipline and, where necessary, structural intervention to achieve the national objectives. It will involve a commitment by industry through targets to expand our traded goods and services to become more productive and competitive, but using the partnership to address the impediments which limit the achievement of those targets. I happen to believe that a successful model in this regard is the approach that the previous government adopted in the agrifood indis ustry, the food processing industry. I hope to have the opportunity in subsequent debates in this House to go into more debate about that approach. With government playing a facilitative role and being prepared to offer support to industry-driven responses committed to targets and to growth, we have seen a huge growth in food processing exports in this country. There is a target to achieve $10 billion of exports by the tum of the decade from what was a little over $2 billion just a couple of years ago. Even at $2 billion, the food processing industry in this country was the largest manufacturing employer in the nation, employing about 150,000 people. If we get this strategy right, as all the evidence suggests we will, and expand the exports, it is not just great for our balance of payments; it is terrific for jobs. This is what smart industry policy has to be about-not the programs that have assisted them to get there being cut from underneath them, because then you lose the Then you lose the basis upon which you get the commitment from industry to expand, to grow and to produce the jobs. In government we established policies with broad application to many industry sectors, which I will refer to briefly here. I will be using opportunities in other debates to go some detail about them. We have the export market development grants scheme, the DIFF scheme, the 150 per cent R&D tax concession, the national industry extension service, better access to venture capital because changes that we introduced, and the establishment of Ausindustry and Austrade. Many of those programs will be cut by the government in its ideological drive to reduce business welfare to find the bottom line. The very mechanisms that have helped our industries grow in this country are stripped away from them. They are not props, they are not handouts. I see members laughing over there. I wonder whether, when they approach manufacturers in their industry, they are prepared to laugh in the same way about the insignificance of these programs when they will get swamped with submissions showing the importance of these programs to their growth. They are not props or handouts. They have been instrumental in improving our traded goods performance. Without them the same progress would not have been made. I mentioned examples of those programs that had application across industry sectors, but there are also many examples under us of specific application to certain industries: partnerships for development program, for example, in the information technology, a huge industry growth sector; the factor F plan in relation to the pharmaceuticals industry; the car plan; the shipbuilding industry-we saw the gutting of initiatives under the shipbuildspeech. ing industry in legislation that you introduced yesterday; the coal export levy in relation to the coal industry; the support for the magnesium industry. All of these involve commitments by industry to increase our traded . goods and services to invest in R&D and all have delivered, but they have only delivered against the commitment because we were prepared to use the leverage and the initiative of government programs to ensure that they did, to work in partnership with industry to achieve the end results. Labor believes that policies like these need not only to be continued, they need also to be built upon. Labor's job in opposition will be to hold the government accountable to the promises into they made during the last election, which we are showing increasingly these days were made duplicitously. We will continue to pressure the government to deliver on those promises, those things that the Prime Minister of the (Mr Howard) went on the John Laws program to say, 'I would rather make half the promises and deliver all of them than make all the promises and deliver half,' and who also said, 'Even if it means the deficit going out, we will deliver all of our promises.' This was his 'L-a-w-s' commitment. We have already seen him this week in question time start to walk going to be away from those commitments. While the Prime Minister was elected on a mandate of continuing down Labor's path, he has also very clearly staked his personal reputation on delivering all of the promises. He has said that he wants to be benchmarked. We will make sure that he is benchmarked to deliver better than Labor's 733,000 jobs and slashes the level of youth unemployment below 87,000, as he told the press club. Labor's record has established the benchmarks. We will hold the government accountable against them. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs Sullivan)-Before I call the honourable member for Lilley, I remind the House that the this is the honourable member's first speech. I invite the House to extend to her the usual courtesies.",41
13,Mrs ELIZABETH GRACE,Unknown,"I rise in this place to make my maiden Although the word 'maiden' is no longer politically correct, this is the way most people would describe one's first speech in parliament. According to the Oxford Dictionary, 'maiden' is defined in six ways, including the following: Maiden-involving the first attempt or occurrence particularly pertaining to MPs. To my humble way of thinking, this 'is not at all sexist. It is just a simple and traditional use of English to embellish what would otherwise be a quite ordinary event. I think a maiden speech is a real achievement whereas the description 'first speech' is quite mundane-Qne must always be aware of the thought police. There are many words that have suffered through what is classed as 'politically correct language'. One word that is attacked often is 'chairman'. The 'man' in the word 'chainnan' comes from the Latin 'manualis' meaning hands. Therefore, the literal translation 'of 'chairman' is 'hands on the chair'. It has nothing whatever to do with gender. Political correctness is just one of things that seem to have got out of hand during the previous government's time in office. Education-and as a consequence jobs-is another. Young people are being kept at school until year 12 without any real consideration as to their wishes or, for that matter, what the needs of the community are. If young people were given a good general education until year 12, they could then make a decision about their future or their job path. Young people should be able to choose their future at year 10 and, if they wish, be encouraged to apply for an apprenticeship or a T AFE course, to enter the work force or continue to year 12. Whatever their decision, we as a government should make it as easy as possible for them. The young people who choose to enter the work force would quickly learn the work ethic that a full day's work is required if one is to earn a full day's pay. They would learn that some aspects of their job must be done whether they like it or not. They would also learn that there is a great feeling of selfachievement after completing a good day's work. Young people who choose to enter an apprenticeship would also learn these skills as well as their trade skills. By the time they reached 18, they would have begun to understand what the real world is about. Unfortunately, the current system has put off too many employers who see it as rigid and complex. As a consequence, too many young people are left unemployed with no prospect of attaining work. As the government, we should promote the value of investment in further education and training and we should provide assistance for those who wish to access education and training opportunities. We should train people for real, long-term jobs. Although actually a state matter, it is obvious that the current indenture system for apprenticeships is far too complex. Large amounts of time spent at college and away from the workplace, plus the inability to move easily among states, has made the system very unattractive to small business. Consequently, many young people are being denied the the many opportunity of an apprenticeship. Young people who choose to stay at school should continue their education with an emphasis still on literacy and numeracy. Towards the end of secondary school, those who wish to go to university could devote 12 months to enable them to complete a university entrance exam. Those wishing to study for a diploma course could spend that same time preparing for the course. This way we would cease trying to tum everyone into a university graduate and give young people a chance to realise their potential. Most people are aware of their aptitude. I know I could never have been a brain surgeon or a physicist, no matter how hard I studied. I think. today's young people also know what they are capable of achieving. At present our education system 'is not giving them those choices. My interest in education issues comes from my background in teaching. I became a teacher through a strong desire to help people make the best of opportunities. This strong desire lasted through the raising of two daughters and spending 15 years travelling around country Queensland. My ambition was finally fulfilled at the age of 34 when, on coming to Brisbane to live, I had the opportunity to attend teachers training college. During the last 22 years, which have been spent in the Brisbane electorate of Lilley, we have lived where we chose because it is a convenient location. The electorate of Lilley is in the north-eastern suburbs of Brisbane. It extends from Breakfast Creek to Brighton. Lilley is a very diverse electorate with a large number of industries which range from Brisbane's domestic and international airports to sea cargo facilities, chemical production, light and heavy engineering, warehousing and tank farms. Like most electorates, the demography is constantly changing. With the Australian population so mobile these days, it is not uncommon to live in a street where everyone else originates from a different part of Australia and even the world. It constant population movement that the infrastructure needs of the electorate are difficult to maintain. The Brisbane airport has been at the mouth of the Brisbane River since Kingsford Smith's time. The benefits of Brisbane's domestic and new international airports are their convenient location to the CBD and their accessibility to the main arterial roads that link the Gold Coast and the Sunshine Coast. Furthermore, both airports directly employ more than 5,000 people, with a further 16,000 related spin-off jobs. The annual economic impact of the airport to the region is estimated to be around $2 billion. With the increasing density of population under the flight paths, the noise factor is becoming a matter of concern. The airport environment committee has taken an initiative to minimise the impact of noise by establishing steeper ascent and descent profiles on certain flight paths. This, with the airlines being encouraged to upgrade to more modem and quieter aircraft, will be a help. The local administration of the Federal Airports Corporation is very conscious of the noise problems and monitors them constantly and we as a community have to be vigilant about future development. We must not allow housing to encroach on the buffer zones around the perimeter of the airport. It is vital that we do not become like Sydney airport, and I will fight to ensure that we put people before flight paths. Another environmental issue in Lilley is the Brisbane City Council's planned toxic waste dump at the mouth of the river. This proposal by the Labor council is an absolute disgrace and has met with massive resistance from the local population. The residents of Pinkenba, the suburb most affected, have formed an action group that is lobbying long and hard for the council to change its plans. The dump is sited at the mouth of the Brisbane River and will receive toxic waste from all over Brisbane. This will mean that over 60 per cent of toxic and hazardous wastes will have to be transported across the city, much of it through the CBD, to reach the is because of this treatment works. This site is situated close to Boggy Creek which flows into the Brisbane River and, ultimately, into the Moreton Bay Marine Park. The Moreton Bay Marine Park is a fragile breeding ground for prawns, crabs, fish, migratory birds, seagrasses and mangroves. All of these must be protected. Furthermore, because of the hard work of many community groups, the Brisbane River has been cleansed to such a state we are now seeing the return of dolphins to the mouth of the river. The Brisbane City Council has informed the residents of Pinkenba that the area in which the toxic waste dump will be sited will not flood. I now ask those so-called 'experts' to repeat their guarantees to residents after the last recent heavy rain in Brisbane. I understand Brisbane's need for a new toxic waste dump and, understandably, no-one wants it in their backyard. However, I think a little more council consultation and a little less confrontation would make it much easier for a consensus to be reached. In contrast to the proposed toxic waste site, a few kilometres north is an area known as the Boondall Wetlands. These wetlands were rescued from developers in 1990. With the hard work of a community based committee, the Boondall Wetlands have been transformed into an area that is the pride of Brisbane City. Comprising 1,245 hectares, the Boondall Wetlands are the resting and feeding place of migratory birds from as far away as Siberia, China, Japan, Mongolia and Alaska. The Wetlands Reserve Management Committee has also identified evidence of past Aboriginal occupation. The committee has set up a community program designed to help young Aboriginals identify with their origins while encouraging them to pass this knowledge on to the wider community. Besides their cultural, conservation, geological and visual values, the Boondall Wetlands are an extremely valuable resource that enhances Brisbane's overall quality of life and helps maintain Brisbane as Australia's most livable city. The Boondall Wetlands have the potential to become a major regional focus for eco-tourism, conservation, environmental education and outdoor family fun and recreation. Therefore, it is no surprise that the Boondall Wetlands were the central focus of the 1996 Ramsar international convention. As an electorate, Lilley is a great place to work. It is as diverse as it is friendly. It has great community spirit. Each area is very keen to see that the very best is available for its residents. I find this a wonderful atmosphere. A key community group is NOTION, Nundah's Organisation to Improve Our Neighbourhood. NOTION began in 1993 in response to the uncertainty over the development of Sandgate Road. Sandgate Road is one of Brisbane's main arterial roads through the north-eastern suburbs. In Nundah there is a section of road known as the bottleneck, and it has been an increasing problem for locals for over 25 years. After much community consultation, NOTION came up with the idea of a 'cut and cover tunnel' that would bypass the Nundah shopping centre without disturbing the suburb with a busy four-lane highway. This would maintain the fabric of the Nundah shopping area, which is one of the oldest in Brisbane. It would also improve the traffic flow and maintain the link among residential areas, schools, shops, public transport and parks. The consequences of not addressing the Nundah bottleneck have been devastating for the local community. Accidents and fatalities continue to occur, and traders continue to leave, which affects the social and economic viability of the area. I believe the Nundah road issue should be given urgent attention. But any solution must put the concerns of local residents and businesses first, and not be seen solely as a solution of traffic flow. Lilley also boasts one of the top five industries in Australia-the racing industry. At this time of the year, Lilley is the racing capital of Australia with the staging of the prestigious $9 million Brisbane winter racing carnival which is recognised internationally. Tracks in the electorate are Eagle Farm, Doomben, Albion Park, which is now devoted to harness racing and greyhounds, and the training complex at Deagon. Historic Eagle Farm has been more than just a pillar of racing in the state. Heroic aviator Bert Hinkler of Bundaberg landed on the track to a rousing welcome from the citizens of Brisbane in 1928 after being the first pilot to fly from Britain to Australia. The first rugby match between Queensland and New South Wales was played at Eagle Farm and I am pleased to say that Queensland won that 11 to 10. The first cricket match between England and Queensland was also played there. Almost 1,000 thoroughbred horses, a big percentage from Queensland owned and operated stud farms, are based there. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Minister for Small Business and  way in which they have moved to set up the Small Business Deregulation Task Force. There are many thousands of small businesses in Lilley which are very tired of struggling with the regulations and Labor's unfair, job destroying dismissal laws. Although there appears to be a slight improvement in business confidence, as a government we must continue to encourage the small business community. During the election campaign many small business owners told me they were only staying open because of their duty to their employees. Many told me their employees were taking home more money than the business owners themselves. As a nation, we must stop people feeling gUilty about making a profit because making a profit is not wrong. Making a profit is one way to get this country going again. Recently, I was fortunate to have Senator Jocelyn Newman visit Lilley. It was great to see a minister prepared to visit Lilley and discuss important issues such as domestic violence and social security with the locals. I believe all the people of Lilley will benefit from the Liberal Party's commitment to consult at this grassroots level. I urge all ministers, including the Prime Minister, to come and consult with the talented local organisations and communities in Lilley. As one of the 76 House of Representatives Liberals, I look forward to making a significant contribution in this 38th Parliament to the progress of this wonderful country. A lot has been said about the number of women and what changes we are going to bring to the parliament. I think it is important that we are looked upon as individuals and not as some sort of freaks or super people who are going to sweep all before us. We are human beings with the same strengths and weaknesses as our male colleagues. It should not be an expectation of the community or this parliament that we will succeed or fail because of our gender. We should be judged on how we have worked in our electorate and in the parliament. Dame Enid Lyons, an advocate of strong family values, in her maiden speech in September 1943, said: I believe sincerely that any woman entering the public arena must be prepared to work as men work: she must justify herself not as a woman, but as a citizen; she must attack the same problems and be prepared to shoulder the same burdens. All 26 Liberal women in the House of Representatives and the Senate can be confident that they are here on merit and not because of a patronising quota system. Finally, I would like to thank the hundreds of people who helped me during the campaign. The Lilley Liberal FEC chairman, Peter Nicholls; campaign director, John Blake; campaign chairman, Bill GoBan; chief fundraiser, Santo Santoro; the state member for Clayfield and now a Queensland minister, Councillor Graham Clay, who organised the 47 polling booths; the state president, Bob Tucker; the state director, Jim Barron; and state vice-president, Graham Young, must all be singled out for special mention. A big thank you also to the campaign committee and all the branches that worked tirelessly and faithfully. We were able to have over 450 volunteers working on election day, and I thank them all. We were able to open and maintain a campaign office for nine months prior to the election. This was only possible because of one of our strong supporters who volunteered her time, Mrs Anne Reid. My family were also a wonderful support. My two married daughters, Julie Zerk and Margaret Hendry, both live outside Brisbane, but they, with their husbands, David and Ross, and our three grandchildren, Heidi, James and Tom, gave up valuable personal time to come and help their mum and nana over the line. I don't know what I would have done without them. To my husband of 36 years, Mervyn, I say thank you. It does not seem enough and yet it says it all. He is my best friend, my supporter and the one who took all the flak. He gave up his own personallife--except for the occasional golf game-to support me fully throughout the campaign. It is wonderful to have Mervyn and my 90-year-old dad, Max Dunstone, sitting in the gallery today. Madam Deputy Speaker, I am very proud to be a member of this parliament. I am very honoured that the people of Lilley have chosen me to represent them. I look forward to working with the coalition for the people of Lilley and Australia.",44
14,Mr SA WFORD,Unknown,"I congratulate the member for Lilley (Mrs Elizabeth Grace) on her maiden speech. It is a special time for new members. It does not seem that long since, in 1988, I made mine, just before the member for Groom (Mr Taylor). It was the first maiden speech in this House. In the debate on the Supply Bill (No.1) 1996-97, I would like to examine some of the benefits which the electorate of Port Adelaide has received after 13 years of federal Labor government and in doing so set the standard by which the new coalition government is to be judged. The question that arises is: how many of these benefits will be discontinued by the new coalition government, given its ideological drive to cut billions from government outlays on the basis of the phoney projected budgetary deficit? In the 12 months to February this year alone, organisations in my electorate of Port Adelaide received federal government assistance totalling over $25 million for various projects. Labor cared for our war veterans through the provision of extra hostel accommodation. In fact, a soil turning ceremony was conducted by the Governor of South Australia, Dame Roma Mitchell, on 12 May. Labor cared for the extension of defence home loans to eligible ex-service women and the upgrading of entitlements. Labor cared for young people through the provision of employment and training schemes like LEAP, which were funded under Working Nation, and a new TAPE college in Port Adelaide, funded by Labor. Labor cared for local school children with the provision of funding for capital developments, new information technology equipment and increased levels of recurrent funding. Labor cared for health care through the provision of funding to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital and Medicare. Labor cared for the aged and the disabled through funding of home and community care programs. Labor cared for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders through the funding of the arts and, in the longer term, the passing of the historic Mabo legislation. Labor cared for immigrants through funding of organisations like the Cambodian Australian Association, the Refugee Association, the Indo-Chinese Australian Women's Association, the Macedonian orthodox community, the Overseas Chinese Association, the Serbian community, the Vietnamese community and the Cambodian Association. Labor cared for people with disabilities people in need of crisis accommodation through the funding of the Port Adelaide Central Mission, the Salvation Army, SPARK, the Port Youth Accommodation Services and the Western Areas Women's Shelter. Labor cared for the community through funding to local governments for environment and heritage work, such as the redevelopment of Garden Island, the main street program in Port Adelaide, new roads and the new ecotourism project at the St Kilda mangroves. The question for people in Port Adelaide is just how much of this federal government funding to these and other organisations, which has contributed so much to the development of facilities and the creation of job opportunities in the electorate, will continue. How much of it will be erased by the new government in their ideologically driven cost cutting frenzy? What will be the consequences of the failure to fund these groups and organisations in my electorate of Port Adelaide and the similar groups and organisations in other electorates, including those in the electorate of the member for Sturt (Mr Pyne)? Labor left office having presided over the longest period of sustained economic growth since the mid-1950s, with every prospect of that growth continuing. Job growth was strong, interest rates steady and inflation low. In fact, for the information of the member for Sturt, Port Adelaide had the highest drop in unemployment in South Australia, from 16 to 11 per cent in the last 12 months. Myelectorate had the highest job creation in South Australia. ",48
15,Mr SAWFORD,Unknown,"Thank you very much. board Inflation has been low. The level of real household disposable income increasedby 40.4 per cent under the five successive Labor governments of 1983 to 1996. Real earnings increased by nearly seven per cent, and the real value of additional payments to low income groups almost doubled. In addition the former government has encouraged more flexible workplace arrangements to assist families, including the issues of equal pay, equal opportunity and parental leave that I and hope are dear to you, Madam Deputy Speaker. On economic management, Labor's record has spoken for itself. Furthermore, Labor managed to maintain social cohesion in times of great change. That more than anything was the real measure of the quality of our government. It is that social cohesion which will come under some threat with the new government's individual contracts, job cuts, education cuts, health cuts, social security cuts and cuts to community organisations. Creating more jobs and reducing unemployment was always the Labor government's highest priority. That is why it launched Working Nation, an ambitious jobs and training program. It is sometimes very easy in this place to forget the magnitude of the commitment to that program. It was the biggest attack on unemployment ever undertaken in this country. In its first year Working Nation created over 380,000 jobs, reduced the unemployment rate from nearly 11 to 8.6 per cent, allowed 375,000 long-term unemployed people to receive individual attention and help, ensured a huge boost in the number of Australians gaining skills and training and provided record growth in the number of people starting apprenticeships and traineeships. It delivered, and it also delivered many benefits to the people in my electorate of Port Adelaide. Last year I attended graduation ceremonies for participants in landcare and environment action programs in Port Adelaide. LEAP gave young people the chance to work and train, while at the same time doing something valuable for the environment. It was interesting at that ceremony that some of the business people involved offered one of the young fellows a job as an apprentice butcher. He is still working there. Another program participant was offered work at an aged care hostel. Even though the program had nothing to do with butchery or aged care, people were impressed with the commitment of these young people who had not had opportunities. Thirty thousand young people commenced in LEAP nationally over the last three years and Commonwealth funding was approximately $196 million. In all, tens of thousands of young employed people have gained valuable work experience and new skills through Working Nation programs. Those who graduated that day in Port Adelaide received nationally accredited training over 26 weeks in a selection of modules from the certificate in construction, while assisting in the develophas ment of the Port Adelaide Art and Cultural Heritage Centre. I know the member for Sturt would have seen that the local press showed that the arts community was developing very strongly in Port Adelaide. ",49
16,Mr SAWFORD,Unknown,"Yes, very successfully. Other LEAP projects were conducted on the Linear Park project at Lockleys and on 'the scrub' at West Croydon. The participants in that program built gravel and sawdust paths, replaced fences and restored an old well, as well as gained skills in conservation concepts, micro-irrigation and the preparation, planting and maintenance of trees and shrubs. Some of those people are in business on their own and some of them have taken up franchises. The group also restored indigenous plants previously used by Aborigines for food and medicinal purposes, creating an Aboriginal food trail. The area will become a living classroom for children from the Kilkenny Primary School and surrounding schools to learn about the environment and the importance of protecting and preserving it. Last year a total of $4.4 million was spent on education, employment and training in the Port Adelaide electorate. The resultant new jobs, which contributed to regional development and provided new skills and training, were created by funding from the former Labor government. It was a demonstration of Labor's commitment under Working Nation to provide flexible solutions to improve the employment and training opportunities for unemployed people. I expect that these job and training schemes for young people, unfortunately, may be amongst the first to be slashed by this new government. Last year the Port Adelaide electorate received $3.8 million for health programs, including funding for the new breast cancer clinic in Amdale which was a most welcome addition and greatly appreciated in the western suburbs of Adelaide. The Queen Elizabeth Hospital, under great trauma from the state Liberal government, has, with the help of federal funding, streamlined its services and is regarded Australia-wide and internationally as an example of waiting list management that the potential to be adopted across the Australian public hospital system. The people involved in running that hospital are to be congratulated for their initiatives. It would be a disaster for the western suburbs if the Brown government sold the Queen Elizabeth Hospital following its sale of Modbury Hospital and the fire sale of other South Australian assets. Medicare is a very popular health program because it is fair and efficient, and it has enormous support in my electorate. In fact, it is so popular that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), for the duration of the campaign at least, reversed his lifelong opposition to it. But I believe the coalition's promise of keeping Medicare will be the first promise broken; it will be kept in name only. GPs in my area are already very concerned. The government can do any of a number of things to dismantle Medicare, such as reducing the rebate to doctors for bulk-billing or introducconsequence ing a co-payment, any of which will be a breach of the election promise. The dismantling of Medicare will put an extra cost burden on the people of Port Adelaide, especially families. People in Port Adelaide told me before the election that they wanted Medicare to stay, that they wanted bulk-billing and that they wanted the current arrangements. They said that some changes could be made, but they tended to elucidate only three-changes that would improve Medicare, not destroy it. They wanted coverage for extra health services, such as physiotherapy, dental care, podiatry and chiropractic services. They wanted some financial help to make private health cover easier to afford. They wanted shorter waiting lists for elective surgery. We promised to make all three improvements to Medicare if we were re-elected. Unfortunately, we can be sure that none of these improvements to Medicare will now. be made. Labor recognised that a commitment to our young people, and to this nation's collective future, required the will to fund a significant expansion in the education and training sectors. Labor has a very proud record: a 55 per cent real increase in schools funding and a 79.1 per cent real increase for non-government schools, a 56 per cent real increase in the funding of TAFE and other fonns of vocational education, a 77 per cent increase in places available at universities, a doubling of the proportion of young people staying at school until year 12 from 36 per cent to 72 per cent, a trebling of the number of young people undertaking non-apprenticeship postschool vocational training from 27,000 to 78,000, and a decrease in youth unemployment from 158,000 in 1983 to 88,000 today. The Liberal government prior to 1983-of which the new Prime Minister was Treasurer-was prepared to let young people leave the education system poorly equipped to get work and poorly equipped to be successful in a modern economy. In contrast, Labor in government sought to provide the opportunity for every young person to achieve the education and training they required so that this nation's collective future was assured. The of the coalition government cutting expenditure on education will be detrimental to those currently in education and to the nation generally. It is not always just the higher education sector that should be worried; it is all sectors. Young women in particular have benefited from the emphasis on education and training as opportunities previously denied them have opened up under Labor. Young women now make up more than half the number of students in higher education. Women who wish to work have been supported by legislation like the Sex Discrimination Act and the Equal Opportunity Act, and equal pay and so on. Labor supported the right of parents to choose their children's school by increasing funding and improving facilities in the education system, both government and nongovernment. From 1982 to 1996, the nongovernment sector share of school enrolments grew from 24 to 29· per cent. In that time, Commonwealth funding for non-government schools rose by 79.1 per cent in real terms. When Labor's record on education is compared with the performance of Liberal state governments, there is real reason to be concerned about the new coalition government's commitment to education. For example, in Victoria Premier Kennett has closed 300 schools and reduced teacher numbers by 8,000. Non-government schools have also felt the Kennett razor, with cuts of 8.1 per cent. The Dean Brown Liberal government in South Australia is also showing little regard for education. ",50
17,Mr SA WFORD,Unknown,"It is not rubbish. In the lead-up to the 1993 state election, the Liberals promised that education funding would not be cut. The fact is that they have clearly breached the industrial relations election promise, with cuts of $40 million and closures of schools. In my electorate, they closed the Port Adelaide Girls High School and recently announced the closure of the Parks High School-a disgraceful decision which was against the advice of the Department of Education and even against the advice of the editorial in the Adelaide Advertiser. Schools in the Port Adelaide electorate to benefit from funding by the former government in the last 12 months for specific projects include Le Fevre High, Siena College, Our Lady Queen of Peace School, Portside Christian School, St Joseph's School, Mount Carmel College-both primary and secondary, Seaton High School and primary school, Woodville High and the Aboriginal school, WiItja. In January this year, $1.47 million was provided for new building projects at three schools: St Joseph's School at Ottoway, Mount Carmel College at Rosewater and Our Lady Queen of Peace School at Albert Park. Last year I opened stage 2 of the four-stage master plan for Siena College in Port Adelaide. The new facilities included the extension and refurbishment of the science laboratories, the relocation of a computing room and the establishment of an open learning facility. The government provided more than $% million towards the cost of the developments. The projects, like so many in the Port Adelaide area over the last 13 years, are an investment in the future of South Australia, Australia most importantly, our children. I have always held the view that a strong primary school foundation is critical to a child's future, and so I hope that the new government will continue to expand upon the programs that this government set in place. We all know only too well that children without appropriate literary, numeracy and social skills grow up to be .alienated young adults who are capable of doing anythi-g. The provision of new information technology in schools is vital if the nation's children are to have the benefit of an education which will stand them in good stead in the future in an information-rich world. During the campaign, Labor announced a $300 million information technology package consisting of $240 million over four years to enable schools to buy or lease 150,000 computers, and $60 million to train teachers. It was funding which would have enabled all Australian schools-public and private-to participate in the growing information revolution. The framework for an Australian education network had been created through the establishment of an open net to link open learning students across Australia; and the education network Australia, EdNA, which was to link all schools, TAPE colleges, universities and other education and training providers across Australia and internationally. A vital part of this plan involved keeping Telstra in full public ownership to provide fair and affordable access for all Australian schools. This will become extremely difficult if the coalition government's plans for the privatisation of Telstra pass the parliament. The Labor government funded the Salisbury Highway-South Road connector and duplicated the Port Wakefield Highway. These will greatly improve access from the AdelaidePerth, Adelaide-Darwin national highways to Port Adelaide and Outer Harbour, to Adelaide airport, to the standard gauge rail freight depot at Islington and to industrial developments in the inner western suburbs. Another much needed development is a new bridge over the Port River. The bridge is essential to ease the heavy traffic congestion and, through the streets of Port Adelaide and to provide direct access to the industrial sitesincluding the Submarine Corporation-from the main Adelaide highways to Western Australia, the Northern Territory, New South Wales and Victoria. Under the former government, forward planning for the new bridge was under way. It is a vital development for Port Adelaide and important also for the whole general area. I hope the new government does not abandon this project. The Adelaide-Darwin railway is also important to the future of Port Adelaide and South Australia-and, I suggest, Australia. I hope it too will get the go-ahead. I wonder how hard the member for Adelaide (Ms Worth) and the member for Grey (Mr Wakelin) will fight for the rail workshops and the jobs at Port Augusta and Islington. British Aerospace and the Submarine Corporation at Osborne are the big ticket industry developments in the Port Adelaide electorate which were supported by the former Labor government. They have provided jobs and injected money and expertise into local industry. In the little time. I have left, perhaps I will concentrate a little on families. Providing targeted child-care assistance has been a high priority of the former government in helping families balance their work and family commitments. There are now five times the number of child-care places available than there were 10 years ago. About 76 per cent of families using child care receive some assistance with their child-care fees, while 42 per cent receive full assistance. I wonder what will happen to that in Port Adelaide; I wonder what will happen with that in the electorate of the member for Sturt. I wonder what will happen to single aged pensioners renting privately. I wonder what will happen to unemployed couples with children under 13. I wonder what will happen to sole pensioners, to rent assistance and to the base of the pension? What will the new coalition government do? Will they reduce, as they did when last in office, the real values of pensions? I suppose that is what they will do-I expect so-because they will copy the conservative national government in New Zealand and will cut all benefits by 10 per cent. (Time expired)  me great pleasure to participate today in the debate on the supply bills for 1996-97. I consider it a privilege to serve the people of Australia, particularly those in the electorate of Sturt. Therefore, I will comment on the supply bills today in a general sense on the issue of privacy. We on this side of the House recognise the enormity of the task ahead, that the people have bestowed upon us the honour and responsibility of leading this nation. I hope that we will exercise our authority judiciously to bring about change that benefits all Australians. I have looked across this chamber in recent weeks and seen very few of the faces that I used to recognise and know well when I was in opposition. Some of the old faces are still there, like that of the member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford). But many of his friends, particularly those of the class of 93, have failed to return. They were led to their political deaths by a man who posed as George Patton but proved to be George Custer. Of course, there are plenty of people to be blamed for the Labor Party's Little Bighorn. Some of those who had a hand in it are still here, and I am sure the Labor Party will take out due process on those people who have been in part responsible for the defeat of so many Labor members. The blood-letting remains their prerogative, not the Liberal Party's. We on this side of the House are more interested in governing. If the raft of first speeches already delivered by many of my coalition colleagues is any indication, we have a very sincere and genuine wish to see fundamental change occur in Australia and get on with the job at hand. One area that was danced around by the previous government was that of privacy. It is an issue that has been creeping up on us for a long while. But, with the proliferation of computers, the development of sophisticated software and the need-or the perceived need-for both government and private organisations to collect information, it has become a very important issue. While I am cognisant of the need for reform in many areas, I hope that privacy will be a priority item on this government's agenda; it is certainly a priority on mine. National attention first fixed on the privacy issue in the 1980s during the attempt by the former Hawke government to introduce the Australia card. The people held the view that the search for our national identity did not extend to allocating each citizen his or her own very special number. The coalition opposed its introduction and, with the help of other people, managed to defeat the Australia card proposal-or so we thought. The Privacy Act was passed in 1988 to allay some of the fears that people held about identity cards. But, at the same time, the act allowed increased scope for information gathering and sharing in order to reduce tax and welfare fraud. Eight years down the road, government's access to information exceeds by a long way that whichever could have been anticipated by the introduction of the Australia card. That access has become increasingly available to private companies. No longer must they thumb through the telephone directory to search for new customers. In today's competitive environment they seek qualified leads: people who have purchased goods or services or spent a sum of money that suggests they might be suitable targets. Where do they find such leads? There are thriving companies whose only business is the buying and selling of names of people who have purchased goods or services and are in certain income tax brackets or read certain magazines. The more qualified the list, the more it is worth. While it all sounds a bit sinister, at times we have only ourselves to blame. Recently I noticed in one of the airport lounges a huge bottle of scotch on offer as the prize in a lottery. Mr Tanner-Did you drink it?  free, requiring only that we fill out a card telling the company a little bit about ourselves. A footnote on the card asked if we minded whether that information was passed on to others who might have products that interest us, for example. With eyes firmly fixed on the bottle of scotch, like some of my friends on the opposition benches, I filled out the card and did not bother to read the fine print. We usually do not pay attention to the fine print. But how often have we rued that choice when our mailbox is overloaded with so called unrefusable offers from companies we did not know existed? But in these cases, if we had not volunteered the information, we would not be harassed. Not so when it is a government department or its employees passing on information that we surrender-we are told-for the greater common good. Even the strictest civil libertarian would not argue against the need for governments to keep databases. It makes no sense to issue Medicare cards, drivers licences and the like if no record is kept of their use. But there exists a very real possibility of invasion of privacy when this information is passed on to a third party. The ability to exchange information between departments has certainly aided efficiency and reduced fraud. It makes perfect sense that the Australian Taxation Office should match data with the DSS or that the DSS should match data with Immigration, for example. But, having acknowledged the need for such data procurement, we must also expect that the rules governing the use of such data provide sufficient protection for all Australians. During the last parliament, members of the Labor government praised the success of datamatching. Last year the former member for Oxley, one of those defeated in the election, when reporting on the data-matching program of the Department of Employment, Education and Training said in this House: The privacy question, of course, is something that we always need to be conscious of, to ensure that the Big Brother allegations are not highlighted and pushed too much. One would find it difficult to tell whether the former member was actually concerned about Big Brother or whether he was opposed to aggrieved citizens' complaints about. Big Brother's existence being aired too publicly. The same member told this House that the Privacy Commissioner's office was the only reassurance that Australians needed. Roger Clarke, a senior researcher at ANU, obviously has a different opinion. He believes that more than 35,000 people have been threatened with punitive action arising from decisions based on this system. The Privacy Act of 1988 attempts to provide us all with protection against such abuse, but it is clearly inadequate, according to a report that was tabled last year by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, of which I was then a member. Its inquiry into the protection of confidential and personal information held by the Commonwealth found many problems with the existing legislation itself. There is an ambiguity in the information privacy principles that form the basis of the act. For instance, the term 'protection of the public revenue' is used as an exception in these principles. What is meant by that term? More importantly, how liberal is that term currently being construed? It is open to interpretation to such an extent that departments or agencies could use the term as an excuse to spy on anyone in receipt of any income or benefit. Other acts of the Commonwealth address disclosure and protection of information issues especially relevant to a particular area, but it is the case that the information and privacy principles in the Privacy Act may provide overriding grounds for disclosure. This is an anomaly that needs to be corrected .. The Privacy Commissioner himself has described the data-matching process as the privacy equivalent of driftnet fishing. I believe we must reform the act to ensure that all departments and agencies operate under the same controls. Data-matching programs should be administered by identified senior officers who will be responsible for all such work in that area. Agency and department heads should be at all times familiar with the programs being conducted on their watch. Their responsibility should include continual reappraisal of, and justification for collection of, information from third party sources. The Australian Taxation Office, according to the Independent Monthly, is wired into electric and gas authorities, motor vehicle registries, land title offices, the Securities Commission and the Yellow Pages. That is in addition to the Department of Social Security and other federal departments it uses to aid tax collection. Certainly, I am not in a position to judge how essential such a wide network might be, but the Commissioner of Taxation should be acutely aware of the need and should be able to justify ongoing necessity for such a network. Power of disclosure should be limited to senior officers and precise records should be kept of all such disclosures made. The Privacy Commissioner should be made aware promptly of all disclosures. Detail of all datamatching activities should appear in the annual reports of government bodies. When collecting information about people there is always the danger that it will fall into the wrong hands. I remember another politician saying that he wrote things down only if he wanted them to appear in the newspaper. Government collects information on its citizens who are told on surrendering such information that it may be used by other government bodies. In reality there is not much choice. Receipt of benefits is usually conditional on giving a tax file number and other personal identification details; thus people exchange freedoms for assistance. But, in doing so, they still retain the right to expect that the information will be kept in safe hands. Recent experience tells us that this has not always been the case. Just over a week ago, Telstra announced that it would be spending millions of dollars over the next two years to protect its customers from misuse of phone information. That assurance followed a sixmonth study by a privacy audit panel which found that Telstra failed to meet best practice standards in the areas of accountability, use of information and gaining consent from customers. Michael Pickering, who is Telstra's group manager of corporate policy, sounded an ominous warning. 'I wouldn't want to give the impression that there are no risks,' said Pickering, who went on to explain that Telstra would be doing everything in its power to reduce those risks of privacy invasion. The audit also revealed inadequate confidentiality and security for recorded data transmissions in addition to inappropriate usage of informaits tion by staff. As the audit also stated that Telstra exceeded intemal standards for protection of data, I do not know whether to be reassured or alarmed. The much publicised Independent Commission Against Corruption in New South Wales found that over 30 officers of the Commonwealth have been involved in the sale, supply or purchase of confidential information. These officers were employed across the spectrum of government services in customs, defence, health insurance and social security. In addition to those areas, the information involved in the trades came from Immigration, Australia Post, and Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. The commission had no reason to believe that these were isolated examples of the illegal and unauthorised trading in data. These revelations raise serious questions about access, security and penalties for those who are gUilty of breaking the faith. Certainly, when information is compiled, it is natural to assume that someone must have access to it. But who? For what purpose? Who is checking to ensure that the data is accessed only on a need-to-know basis? What are the penalties? This is no time bomb waiting to explode; this was detonated some time ago. We have already seen some egregious abuses of the system-for example, a tax officer accessing records of a prominent sporting identity on 156 separate occasions over a two-month period. She claimed she had no motive for doing so other than having a crush on the athlete. I am not sure whether she had similar crushes on the other 309 people whose files she accessed over the same period. She claimed not to have passed on the information she had gleaned from these files, and the judge dismissed her case on appeal, explaining that the bad publicity she had received was penalty enough. What recourse then for those whose privacy had been invaded? This example underlines the lack of a privacy culture in the public sector. This woman had no idea she was committing a crime. Because she was able to access the information, she felt it not unreasonable to so. All officers in the service of Australians need to be educated and reminded of their duties to ensure that confidential information remains just so. In another breach of trust, an Australian Federal Police officer was convicted last year for disclosing confidential information to a credit management company. The penalty for this was deemed to be a six-month good behaviour bond, although I imagine the $4,200 bill for witness costs probably had more of an impact. In 1994, an information technology officer from the Attorney-General's Department was responsible for the biggest leak in Federal government history when he mailed computer disks containing nearly 10,000 confidential documents and e-mail messages to my friend the then shadow Attorney-General, Senator Vanstone. This officer did not have authorised access to those documents, but he managed to elude all security safeguards. We have all seen Hollywood representations of schoolboy hackers breaking codes and tapping into government computer records, but no longer can these be regarded as fantasy or exciting. Unless we ensure that our security is tight and our data is safe, the potential for disaster remains great. As we move to protect people's privacy, we must make the punishment fit the crime. Unlawful collection or disclosure of confidential information should be the subject of general offence provisions in the Crimes Act 1914. The Crimes Act should undergo partial consolidation, and penalties should be set out for conduct deemed an offence. With a partial consolidation, various departments could retain the responsibility for determining just what information needs to be protected. By locating the general provisions in the Crimes Act, we will be sending a message to the community that we are serious about respecting their privacy. At the same time, it will serve as a reminder to those responsible for dealing with confidential information that breaches of trust will assume greater gravity than they have been accorded in the past. I note with interest that the Attorney-General of New South Wales has plans for compredo hensive privacy and data protection laws. The European Union has thus far set the standard and the New South Wales legislation will attempt to meet those same standards. There is a good reason for this: the European Union will soon reduce the information loop, restricting it to those states that have adequate privacy laws. By using the European .s-d-d, New South Wales hopes to maximise Its opportunities for business. It also hopes to encourage other Australians to follow suit in tightening their privacy laws. If it makes sense for Europe to have unifonnity, with all its diversity of nationality, currency, customs and laws, then certainly it makes sense for Australia to come together to find the necessary common ground. The committee's final recommendations concern the establishment of a national privacy code and thus extend the protection provided by the information privacy principles to all confidential third party information. proposal for such a code should be discussed by the Council of Australian Governments at their earliest convenience. The world has changed rapidly and will continue to do so at an alanning rate. The information superhighway has made the globe a smaller place, but it has created its own potholes in need of repair. We must be ever alert in ensuring that checks and balances are placed on governments in data collection and disclosure. We must not be left behind. Corporations, particularly those which participate in public-private partnerships, must be held to the same stringent standard as the Public Service. As a Liberal, I believe in the primacy and the privacy of the individual. I am pleased to see in recent press reports that my colleague the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) recognises the weight of the situation and has announced that he will act on the whole matter of privacy. The Australian people should expect no less.",52
18,Mr TANNER,Unknown,"Melbourne) (1.05 p.m.)The backdrop to this supply legislation is the very harsh fiscal policy of the new federal government, which is essentially. designed to decimate critical public sector functions in Australia; to slow the economy by reducing demand at a time when it has already slowed to a relatively painless soft landing under the former government; to increase uncertainty amongst many areas of the Australian community, not the least of which is the public sector; and to cause devastation in many regional economies across Australia as a result of job cuts in the public sector, withdrawal of services and consequential loss of economic opportunities that will flow from that. It is becoming clear that the chant from the new government in response to virtually any criticism about anything is going to be, 'Beazley's $8 billion black hole.' Every question asked on anything to do with any form of expenditure, or any issue that relates to government decisions on any programs, is going to be met with the response, 'Kim Beazley is to blame; there is an $8 billion black hole.' Interest rates are going up: blame Beazley's $8 billion black hole. UnemployThe ment is going up: blame Beazley's $8 billion black hole. Foreign debt is going up: same response. There are floods in Queensland: blame Beazley's $8 billion black hole. Pretty soon it is going to be shortened to 'Beazley's black hole' and it will become a religious mantra. People across the country will chant it long after they have forgotten what it is supposed to mean. In response to accusations of adultery, people will say, 'Beazley's black hole made me do it.' Schoolboys coming home late will tell their mothers, 'Beazley's black hole is the reason I'm late, mum.' The next time Gary Ablett is up before the tribunal he might say, 'My defence is Beazley's black hole.' The government may even legislate to make it a defence for employers in the unfair dismissal legislation. If somebody gets unfairly dismissed and they take the employer to whatever tribunal is going to be hearing unfair dismissals-I suppose we will find out about that some time today-the employer can get up and say, 'Beazley's black hole made me do it and therefore there is no case to answer.' No doubt, journalists from other countries will eventually come and study Australia as an interesting case in peculiar mass hysteria because we will have people running across the length and breadth of the land all chanting, 'Beazley's black hole.' Before it gets completely out of hand-and it is rapidly heading in that direction-we need to have a look at what we are actually talking about. What is going on with the finances of the Australian budget and what, precisely, is this government proposing to do? We are actually talking about a gigantic fig leaf being used to cover a number of things being done by this government. First, it· is a fig leaf to ensure that they can effectively fund a range of unfunded promises-up to $4 billion worth-and slip them in under the guise of blaming the former government for any cuts that have to be engineered in order to pay for those promises. Some of those promises are going to be pretty interesting when they come to implementation. For example, they deal with tax cuts for people on incomes as high as $82,000 a year-the Australian battlers the Liberal Party is so keen to represent. When the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) was on the radio during the election campaign, he did not get his lines right; he was not sure what the upper limit was. But it was demonstrated to him that it is likely that there will be some people on incomes as high as $82,000 a year who will be eligible for tax cuts. How are they going to pay for these things? How are they going to finance tax cuts for people on such miserly incomes as $82,000 a year-more, I might add, than politicians get paid? How are they going to fund those tax cuts? We will see cuts in child care, we will see cuts in social security, we will see cuts in aged care and we will see massive cuts in higher education. That is how they are going to finance their promises. The second part of the fig leaf duction of Fightback. They went to the election saying, 'We are changed; we are soft and cuddly and middle of the road; we are not nasty New Right ideologues any more. Fightback has been put back in the drawer.' But what are they doing now? All of the nasty cuts and all of the winding back of public services for people-all in Fightbackare being introduced one by one. Look at the macro-economics of this mythical $8 billion figure and see what it actually is. In reality it is a $4.9 billion deficit, proceeding very quickly to a $3 billion deficit over two years. Where has it come from? Some people on the other side seem to have pretty short memories. Almost $2Y2 billion of the deficit that they have been left with was caused by their own actions in the Senate. Very shortly we will be dealing with the legislation for the sale of airport leases; This sale should reap substantial revenue for the government. The former government tried to sell airport leases. That was part of its revenue in the existing budget. The deficit blew out because that legislation was stopped by the current government in the Senate. So a big proportion of the problem was something that they created themselves while they were in opposition. It is important to remember that we are talking about less than one per cent of GDP. That is the actual deficit. It is still the best in the DEeD. That has hardly been a secret. There have been tired attempts to beat up suggestions that in some way there was deceit on the part of the previous government; that the former Minister for Finance kept this all a secret; that there was a deterioration in the fiscal outlook. However, it was widely discussed and debated during the election campaign. The Prime Minister said, 'I will give implementation of my promises priority over the deficit.' He said unequivocally on radio in Sydney that he would put that ahead of tackling the deficit. What has happened since he has been in office? Exactly the reverse. Everything relates to the so-called Beazley black hole. Everything relates to the deficit. The promises are being scuttled at an average is the intro- of three or four a day. What has brought this about? It is a change in forecasts. The previous forecast for growth was 3.75 per cent, and that was readjusted by Treasury to 3.25 per cent. That was a pretty marginal adjustment but, for reasons that are obvious, it produces implications for the income and expenditure of the government which, ultimately, tally up into significant amounts of money-in the billions of dollars. That is hardly evidence of conspiracy to mislead. If it were not for the economic policy of the new government, these figures probably would have improved again anyway. They are subject to significant variations from time to time. The Treasury adjusts them as new data emerges. Had it not been for the new policies of the government, the figures probably would have been adjusted upward and, automatically, the anticipated deficit would have been reduced. I draw your attention to a letter of 20 May in the Australian Financial Review from Fred Argy, Fred Gruen and John Nevile, who are amongst the most prominent and respected economists in Australia. They state that the real deficit is about $4 billion, and then they conclude: But, it is neither necessary nor desirable to seek reduce discretionary spending by $8 billion over the next two years simply because the economy is forecast to grow more slowly. If the economy is indeed slowing down, such a policy may well slow it down further and increase unemployment in the short term, while helping neither the fiscal deficit nor the national saving rate. Here is the irony: rather than the so-called black hole creating the cuts, the cuts are going to create the black hole because the economy will slow down. It has had a soft landing in the business cycle for the first time in many years as a result of the proper economic management of the former government. This government is going to slow it down further. The end result will be that it will create its own deficit. Rather than sliding up again a fraction to eliminate the gap that had emerged, by cutting viciously into the public sector the government will cause the economy to slow down further, demand will be reduced, and it will create the very problem that it says is causing the cuts. We are now left with Costello's conFightback without John Hewson. That means nearly $10 billion of cuts without a GSTyet. It means a balanced budget with no growth and no jobs. If the crisis is so serious, why is it that we have not had a mini-budget? Some 5lt2 months have elapsed between the election and the budget. The government is saying that there is this incredible crisis and that Australia has been left in a total mess by the former government-all sorts of nonsense of that sort-but it does not seem to be sufficiently important to have a mini-budget. That tends to suggest that there is a little bit of hype and a little bit of nonsense coming from the other side. What does Labor's legacy look like? Unemployment has diminished to 8.5 per cent; with a much higher participation rate. If we had the participation rate that we had in 1983, unemployment would be about three per cent. The other side seems to have a bit of diffiCUlty working out what its line on this is. A few days ago, the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) said that the 730,000 jobs created in the last three years under Labor really did not matter to because they were almost all part-time jobs. Yet yesterday the Prime Minister said how great it was going to be under the new IR legislation because there would be lots of part-time jobs created. Which is it? Are part-time jobs real jobs, important jobs, worthwhile jobs or not? The government members seem to have a difference of view on that. We had inflation down and steady around two to three per cent; interest rates steady, at eight to nine per cent; a soft landing in the business cycle; wages growth around five per cent based on productivity above two per cent annual growth; the dollar increasing in strength to a point where it is starting to become a bit of a problem so, if anything, we have now got to dampen down the value of the dollar by intervention; an internationally exposed competitive economy; and massive increases in education artd training. We have to concede there were some problems, such as the current account deficit at six per cent of GDP, but it was falling down to about 4.5 per cent of GDP, and when the current Prime Minister was Treasurer he left the economy with a current account deficit of 5.5 per cent of GDP. There were specific factors involved: the drought, commodity prices and the like. Initiatives that were pursued by the former governmentsuch as the superannuation initiative and industry policies-were starting to impact in the long term on the current account deficit. Foreign debt is a symptom of internationalisation. It is very amusing to see Access Economics, the great gurus of the Liberal Party, predicting that under Liberal rule foreign debt is going to blowout to over $300 billion. At the same time as foreign debt increased, the holdings of Australians abroad increased from $4 billion to $90 billion, again, as I say, as a symptom of internationalisation. It will not be very long before the Treasurer (Mr Costello) stops talking about $10,000 per Australian in foreign debt because people will start remembering what he used to say and start realising that foreign debt is continuing to increase for entirely understandable economic reasons. What the Liberals are about is harsh contraction at the bottom of the cycle, turning a soft landing into a hard crash-as the very respected eminent economists I have just quoted indicated-sacking as many public servants as they can, devastating many regional and rural areas of Australia through withdrawal of jobs and services, abandoning any form of wages policy and letting the strong get stronger to get their market outcomes, and letting the weak diminish the limited amount they are already receiving. It is not surprising that when Access Economics looked at all this they came up with the conclusion that pretty well everything was going to get worse over the next five years. These are the architects of Fightback speaking; these are the Liberal Party speech writers; these are the people who the Liberals have relied on for so many years. The reality that those on the other side are going to have to face in a couple of years is that their ance is going to be compared with the benchmarks left for them. Whether it is their performance on inflation, unemployment, productivity or interest rates, they are going to have great difficulties even to maintain the levels set by the former government, much less improve on them. That is when the reality will hit home. What will also hit home is their totally bogus claim to represent blue-collar workers in Australia. There were a few exceptions of course. They did not represent blue-collar workers who happened to be seafarers: they wanted to kick them to death; they did not like meat workers; they did not like building workers: 'We will slug them extra tax'. It is a bit selective and that is going to come home as well. I would like to turn in the few minutes left to me to my own shadow portfolio. It is an interesting example of what is likely to happen under this government. We have got a minister in charge who has tried to force the board of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority to resign after only nine months in the position. He failed dismally at doing this and admitted it. Now he has decided that he is going to legislate to increase the board and put one or two people on it that he hopes will force the other people to resign. He seems to think that the only people qualified to sit on a board of an organisation are those who have actually done the things that the organisation does. On this sort of logic perhaps you would ask why he has appointed Dr Allan Hawke, who is a geneticist, as his head of department. I think it is a great appointment but, using Mr Sharp's logic, perhaps it should be a master mariner or a pilot or a train driver. He is a minister who has said initially about Badgerys Creek, both before and after the election, 'We are going to build it. We are committed to it. Labor will wimp on it. We are very strongly behind it.' He did not happen to mention to the people of Hughes and one or two other electorates around Holsworthy that he was thinking something completely different at the time. In the last few days he suddenly says, 'We have discovered all these problems at performBadgerys Creek and it may have to be knocked on the head.' When Alan Jones on radio 2UE asked him whether he might have to knock it on the head, he said, 'Yes, that certainly could be the case, Alan. We might have to kill Badgerys.' Suddenly somewhere in the vicinity of 100,000 to 200,000 peopl,e in a particular region of Sydney, who were at the polls only a couple of months ago making decisions about who they would vote for, are told, 'Oh well, it has just occurred to us. We might think about whacking an airport next to you.' That had been killed off and left for dead a long time ago by 'the previous government. Did they think to put this to the people before the election? Oh no. But, of course, they do not engage in deceit; they do not engage in subterfuge. We have seen also one or two other amusing performances by the minister. One of my favourites so far would have to be his performance before the Bus and Coach Proprietors Association on the very complex and difficult issue of disabled access to public transport. I would just like to quote a couple of sentences from his speech: Market .forces should have been capable of resolving this issue. Market forces backed by adequate research would have identified the size of the market, its needs and its financial capacity. Market forces, not Labor's politically driven Canberra based agenda, would have solved this problem without a fuss, facilitating the uptake of disabled access vehicles inexpensively. What on earth does he think has been happening over the last 50 years: centralised socialist planning? Market forces are the very reason why people with disabilities do not have proper access to public transport, because it is too expensive for private operators to have the equipment and to modify buses and the like in order to provide the access, and most disabled people are not millionaires. What an absurd perfornlance! He is the minister who proposes to basically decimate Australian shipping by removing the sorts of fiscal support that all major shipping nations have across the world and all the major competitors have across the world. He is the minister who has managed to announce an inquiry into Australian National and its financial problems and at the same time announce who is to blame. So he announces the conclusion of the inquiry at the same time as he announces the inquiry. With this sort of track record, many users and people involved in transport must be shuddering at the prospect of what sorts of cuts he is going to offer up to the Treasury and Finance. Perhaps he will abolish air traffic control or maybe the Maritime Safety Authority or something like that! With the current cowboy type approach, anything is possible. It is instructive to look at the transport budget because it provides in microcosm an illustration of what is actually happening in the public sector in this country. For 1995-96 its budget was $1.37 billion. Only $81 million of that was for running costs, of which $15 million was associated with safety administration. The coalition promises included an extra $147 million in the transport area: $28 million for Adelaide airport; $18.8 million for the Tasmanian sea highway in this forthcoining financial year; $65 million for the Pacific Highway; and $36 million for black spots. The only cuts it promised were the $27 million for the ships capital grants and PAYE legislation which we have just debated in the House. Now, $850 million of the current budget relates to roads, where the coalition was committed to 'continue federal road funding expenditure commitments at current levels and add significant new road infrastructure and maintenance programs'. The next biggest item-and this is where it gets interesting-is noise abatement at Sydney airport: $105 million in 1995-96, to fall gradually to $43 million in 1996-97. So there is not much to cut. Almost all of the budget is in programs which are supposedly supported by the coalition parties. This is where the controversy about Badgerys and Holsworthy becomes so significant, because the forward estimates contain substantial amounts of money, over $500 million over two or three years, to provide for the construction and purchase of land at Badgerys. So now we know what is really going on. It will be very interesting to see those forward estimates on 20 August. Now we know what is really going on, and that is an attempt to rip out that money. Forget about building a second airport for Sydney, because those are the only cuts that are really able to be offered up. This offers a very good illustration of what is happening. There is minimal fat to cut in Australia's public sector. It is overwhelmingly devoted to programs, to delivery of services, not to administration and bureaucrats and fat cats and all the mantras and myths that come from the other side. All of the major items in the budget are things that the Liberals have committed themselves either to maintain or to increase. No wonder they are looking for alibis, no wonder they are desperate to invent any excuse they can to lay waste to the public sector. No wonder we have now got Costello's con-the mythology of Beazley's black hole. I have got bad news for them. The Australian people are not going to wear these sorts of infantile lies and mythology. They won't let them break their promises and they won't accept the sort of Thatcherite regime that they are trying to construct. It is Fightback in disguise, a situation where they are going to lay waste to a whole host of social support mechanisms in regional and rural Australia as a result of their cuts. expired)",57
19,Mr RICHARD EVANS,Unknown,"No century in recorded history has experienced the number of social transformations and such radical ones as the 20th century. In the so-called free market or industrialised countries, which account for only one-fifth of the population yet remain a model for the rest of the world, work and work force, society and politics in the last decade of this century are all different significantly not from the first decade of this century but also from what has existed at any other time in history. They differ in configurations, in processes, in their problems and in their structures. Far smaller and slower social changes in the past have triggered civil wars, rebellion and violent intellectual and spiritual crisis, yet the extreme social transformations of this century have hardly caused a stir. I suspect that this century will be recorded as the cruelest and most violent in history with its wars, mass tortures, ethnic cleansing, genocides and holocausts. Hindsight clearly shows the three evil geniuses of this century-Hitler, Stalin and Mao-were destroyers rather than builders because they created absolutely nothing. Indeed, if this century proves one thing, it is the futility of politics because the social transformations of this century had little to do with political events. The age of social transformation will not come to a close in the year 2000 and the bad news for some in our community is that it will not even have peaked by then. One hundred years ago our society was dominated by the biggest single group in every country, the farmers. Today, however, farmers are at most five per cent of the developed world's population and work force. Traditional farmers are close to extinction and those who remain have become a protected species kept alive only by enormous subsidies. The second largest group in the population and work force of every developed country around 1900 was composed of live-in servants. Ninety years later, live-in domestic servants scarcely exist in developed countries. In the developed society of 2000, farmers will be little more than objects of nostalgia. Yet (Time these enormous social transformations were accomplished without civil war and, in fact, were accomplished almost entirely in total silence. One of the main reasons why these transformations caused so little stir was that by the tum of the century a new class, the bluecollar worker in manufacturing industryMarx's proletariat-had become socially dominant. By early this century society was obsessed with blue-collar workers. It was only fixated by them, bewitched by them. Farmers and domestics were everywhere but as classes they were invisible. The new class, the industheir trial worker, was extremely visible. The people lived in dense clusters within and around cities and they soon proved eminently organisable with the first strikes occurring almost as soon as there were factory workers. Sorel found widespread acceptance of his 1906 thesis that the proletariat would overturn the existing order and take power through the violence of the general strike. Mussolini, Hitler and Mao built their strategies on Sorel's thesis. Mao's statement that 'political power grows out of the barrel of a gun' was a direct quote from Sorel. No class in history has ever risen faster than the blue-collar worker and no class in history has ever fallen faster. The workers of 1913 received no pensions, no paid vacations, no overtime pay, no extra pay for Sunday or night work, no health or old age insurance, no unemployment compensation and, in fact, they had no job security whatsoever. Fifty years later or thereabouts, in the 1950s, industrial workers had become the largest single group in every developed country. They had extensive job security, pensions, long paid vacations, comprehensive unemployment insurance and, in some cases, guaranteed lifetime employment. Above all, they had achieved political power. In Britain, for instance, they were considered the real government with greater power than the Prime Minister and the parliament. Some 40 years later, industrial workers and unions are in retreat. They have become marginal in number. Where industrial workers who made or moved things accounted for 40 per cent of the work force in the 1950s, they now account for less than 20 per cent of the work force, that is, they are no stronger now than they were at the start of this century. I suggest that by the tum of the next century industrial workers will account for no more than one-eighth of the total work force. Union power in the community has been declining very fast. But just as the traditional farmer has become a recipient of subsidies rather than major producer, so will the traditional indushave trial worker become an auxiliary employee. This is because the industrial worker has already been replaced by the technologistattitudes, someone who not only provides labour but also has theoretical knowledge. Industrial workers may soon become just another presupon sure group. Contrary to the chroniclers of the rise industrial worker, the rise of this class caused neither a revolution nor violence. In fact, contrary to what Marx suggested, the indusbelieved, trial worker did not destabilise society. history books record the squalor of early industry, the poverty of the industrial workers and their exploitation. Workers did indeed live in squalor and poverty and they were exploited. But they lived better than those the farm or in a household and they were it generally treated better. Proof of this was the decrease in infant mortality figures during period. The drop in infant mortality can be directly related to the increase in living standards brought about by industrialisation. Industrial work provided farmers and domesrather tics with their first opportunity in history better themselves without the need to emigrate. The rise of the class succeeding industrial workers does not provide an opportunity for those industrial workers. In fact, it is challenge for them. The newly emerging dominant group in our society is the knowtheir ledge worker. By the end of this century knowledge worker will make up more one-third of the work force. That sector will be as large as, if not larger than, the proporeveryone tion that manufacturing workers made up the community. The majority of them will paid at least as well as, if not more than, industry workers, and the new jobs will create greater opportunities. However, and this is the greatest challenge facing our country, the great majority of new jobs require qualifications that the industrial worker does not possess and for which they are poorly equipped to acquire. They will require a good deal of formal education and the ability to acquire and apply theoretical knowledge. They require a different approach a to work and a different work ethic. They will to change their mind-set. Above all, they will require a habit of continuous learning. At the very least they have to change their basic values and beliefs. The fall of the industrial worker in the developed world will have a major impact those countries outside the developed world. Developing countries can no longer of the expect to base their development on their comparative labour advantage, that is, they cannot rely on cheap labour. It is widely especially by labour union officials, The that the fall of the blue-collar industrial worker in developed countries was largely, if not entirely, caused by moving production offshore. But this is not true. The main competition we have, internationally, is from on countries that have high production costs so cannot be that it is cheaper to go offshore. The major competitive factor and the this challenge that Australian businesses must address is the application of knowledge to the manufacturing process. It means that we cannot base development on lower wages but we must gain the flexibility of producto tion from the application of knowledge. But the shift to knowledge based work poses enormous social challenges for our community, the knowledge community. This is the first society in which the ordinary a huge people-and that means most people-will not earn their daily bread by the sweat of brow. It is the first society in which the honest work does not mean how many callusthan es you have on your hands. It is also the first society in which not does the same work. This is far in more than a social change; it is really a be change of human condition. What it means for the values, commitments and problems of the new society we do not know because we are still going through this transition stage. We know that much will be different and that that then leads to a continuing feeling of uncertainty, and that is evident within our community at the moment. That feeling has emerged as the country's most constant social development. The knowledge workers will not be the majority in the knowledge society but they will be the biggest single population in the work force group. Knowledge workers will give the knowledge society its character, its leadership and its profile. They may not be the ruling class but they certainly will be the leading class. Their characteristics, their social position, values and expectations differ fundamentally from any group in history that has occupied the leading social position before. For starters, knowledge workers gain access to jobs and social position through formal education. Knowledge work varies tremendously in the amount and the kind of formal knowledge required. Some jobs have low requirements, others much greater. You can compare a technician in Telstra to a brain surgeon. Some have low knowledge requirements whereas others have greater requirements. But even/if the knowledge required is quite primiti-e, only formal education can provide it. Education will become the centre of the knowledge society and the school will become the key institution. What knowledge we must have and what quality of knowledge we must have will become very important issues for debate. These are questions we need to put to policy developers. It will become a major political question as we move into the 21st century. In fact, the application and distribution of knowledge may come to occupy that place in society that the acquisition of property and income over the last two or three centuries once occupied. That period has become known as the age of capitalism. Clearly, in the knowledge society more and more knowledge, especially advanced knowledge, would be acquired well past the age of current formal education. School as we know it would become the most vital and greatest concern to the new society. Increasingly, the educated person will become somebody who has learned how to learn but who also continues to learn throughout their lifetime. The productivity of the non-knowledge services worker will become the social challenges for the knowledge society. On it will depend the ability of the knowledge society to give decent incomes and dignity and status to non-knowledge workers. The possibility of acquiring knowledge will no longer depend on obtaining a prescribed education at a given age. Learning will become the tool of the individual, available to him or her at any time of their lives. In the new knowledge society there will be no poor countries; there will only be ignorant countries. The same could be said for companies, industries and organisations of all kinds, and it is also true of individuals. Historically, workers have been generalists. They did what had to be done, on the farm, in the household, in the craftsman's shop. It is also true of industrial workers. But knowledge workers, whether their knowledge is primitive or advanced, will be defined as specialised. It demands for the first time in history that people with knowledge take responsibility for making themselves understood by people who do not have the same knowledge base. Most knowledge workers will spend most, if not all, of their working lives as employees. But the meaning will be very different to what we traditionally consider the word to be. Individually, knowledge workers are dependent on the job; they receive a wage or a salary. They have been hired and can be put off, fired or terminated, whatever the terms are these days. Legally, each is an employee, but collectively they are capitalists, increasingly so through their pensions funds. In the knowledge society the employees will own the tools of production. Increasingly, the true investment in the knowledge society is not the machines and the tools but in the knowledge of the knowledge worker. Without knowledge the machines, no matter how advanced and sophisticated, are unproductive. Therefore, we will need a new type of management and management techniques and training. Management, in other words, is a social function and its practice is becoming more of a liberal art. For managers, the days of treating your employees with disrespect are over. The greatest advantage that a manager can have these days is understanding that your assets actually leave at 5 o'clock every day and you hope that your assets tum up the following day at 9 o'clock. So we have to work towards understanding and managing these new assets because the assets are actually in the knowledge worker. I submit that we will need to develop a vital third sector, which is the social sector the community. Already we have a private sector and a public sector, but we heard from the previous speaker, the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner), that we have some major challenges in this particular area of development. Things are not getting done in the community; we have lost our sense of community. The reason is that public and private sectors cannot give this sense of community. So we need to develop a social sector of the community. Knowledge as the key resource is very different from the traditional key resources of the economist: land, labour and even capital. That knowledge has become the key resource means that the world's economy will in fact take control. Every country, every business, will be placed in an ever-increasing competitive environment. Every country, every business, when it comes to decisions, will have to consider its competitive standing in the world economy. The national boundaries are in fact breaking down and few politicians, journalists or civil servants look beyond the boundaries of their own countries when a measure such as taxes or the regulation of business or social spending is being discussed. This will no longer do. The first question will be not whether we need the measure, but what the impact will be on the country's competitive position in the world economy. We will need impact statements similar to the environmental impact statements we currently have; we will need a competitive impact statement. Knowledge knows no boundaries. There is no domestic knowledge and there is no international knowledge; there is just knowledge. With knowledge becoming the key resource, there is only a world economy, even though the individual organisation in daily activities operates within a national, regional or local setting. Knowledge goes beyond national boundaries. The challenges for the future are many. They are more serious and daunting than the social transformations of the last century. We will have to think really seriously about education, its purpose, its values and its content. Most of it is based upon industrial of age thinking; we need to start thinking about the information age and the knowledge society. We will have to learn to define the quality of education and the productivity of education and to measure both and to manage both. We also need systematic work on the quality of knowledge and the productivity of knowledge. Neither as yet can be defined. The performance capacity, if not the survival, of any organisation in the knowledge society will come to increasingly depend on two factors. So will the performance capacity, if not the survival, of any individual in the knowledge society. These factors are: what responsibility knowledge has and what the responsibilities are of the knowledge worker, especially of the person with specialised knowledge. Increasingly, the policy of Australia will have to give primacy to the country's competitive position in the increasingly competitive world economy. Any proposed domestic policy needs to be shaped so as to improve that position, or at least to minimise adverse impacts upon it. The same should hold true for the policies and strategies of any institution or organisation within Australia, whether a local government, a business, a university or, in fact, a hospital. We also need to develop an economic theory appropriate to a world economy in which knowledge is the key economic resource and the dominant, if not the only, source of competitive advantage. We desperately need to develop a strong, independent, capable social sector which is neither public nor private. But we cannot have that alone; we need all three sectors to be operating together. We need to review the political process. The function of government and its workings must be central to political thought and political action. The megastate promoted and indulged in this century has not performed either in its totalitarian or democratic versions. We are in a period of rapid change. Old ways and old systems are not coping with it and we need to address them in all organisations, whether they be political, business or otherwise. We do not even have the beginnings of political theory or the political institutions needed for effective government in the knowledge based society of organisations. If the 20th century needs to be one of social transformations, the 21st century needs to be one of social and political innovations. It is clear from the early weeks of this Parliament that there is only one party capable of thinking towards the future in this regard. I have just listened to the member for Melbourne who was talking about the past quite a lot. He was talking about industry and industrial ways and the industrial era. He was talking about education, social welfare and other issues. They are all very important issues and I do not think there is any politician on either side of the House who will dispute that they are important issues. But they need to be addressed with the thinking of a knowledge society and the information age. Currently we are too much in regression, trying to get back industrial age thinking. There is only one group putting these policies forward and that is the coalition. An example of that will be our workplace reform legislation which we are bringing to the House today. Mr Latham-Why is that an example?",62
20,Mr RICHARD EVANS,Unknown,Because it frees up the industrial labour market as I have just explained. Mr Latham-Cut wages?,66
21,Mr RICHARD EVANS,Unknown,"No, as I explained to you, it is not about cutting wages, it is about increasing wages. But you did not listen, so I will not go into that. So these issues are what the coalition is about and I proudly take my place in the government that will address them to ensure a future for all of our children.",66
22,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,Unknown,"Perth) (1.45 p.m.}-I am pleased to rise to speak on the Supply BiII (No.1) 1996-97, which formally commences the process for the 1996-97 financial year budget to be presented on 20 August. The Supply Bill is treated formally and members tend to wax lyrical about many issues as if it were an address-in-reply. According to the forms, procedures and traditions of the parliament, the Supply BiII goes through as requested by the government. We have had one occasion on which tradition and convention were tom up in the face of Australian democracy. That was in 1975 when a cabal of Liberal Party people such as 38th Malcolm Fraser, John Kerr and Garfield Barwick entered into a conspiracy to deceive the Prime Minister and the government of the day and foisted upon the Australian people an undemocratic election. The process is conducted in a much more gentle frame of mind on these subsequent occasions. The Supply Bill falls in a context of recent, constant assertions by the opposition of an $8 billion black hole in the budget accounts. This is Costello'S con, of course, and it is interesting to draw the attention of the House to a newspaper clipping from the Western Australian Sunday Times that some of us kept from the early 1980s. The article is callCfd 'Howard's budget apology'. The sto,ry-says: The Fraser Government knew before the last Budget that it could create a $4200 million deficit next year, the former treasurer, Mr Howard, said today. 'I knew that figure and I'm sorry 1 did not 'make it public', he said. The story goes on to say: Mr Howard's revelation today comes on top of a mounting political row over the silence, during the election campaign, over a predicted Budget deficit as high as $9600 million. This is about $25 billion in today's figures. The article continues: When Mr Howard delivered his Budget speech on August 17 he made no deficit projections based on the Budget programmes beyond the current financial year in which he predicted a deficit of $1600 million, since b'own out to more than $4000 million. Today Mr Howard said that when the Budget was in its final stages he went to the Treasury and insisted, against its wishes, that it make a projection on the Budget's effects on the deficit in the 1983-84 financial year. The story then goes on to say how Mr Howard kept that exclusively to himself. So there has been a considerable amount of disingenuous behaviour and commentary on the part of the government in respect of this matter. As far as the Supply Bill and this year's budget are concerned, in the course of debate in this House and in the other place, the government has been asked on a number of occasions across a whole range of portfolio areas whether it is proposing to keep commitments it made in the course of the election campaign. The constant reply from those opposite, despite what they said in the election campaign and despite the impressions they conveyed to the Australian community, is that we will all have to wait until the budget on 20 August. In my shadow portfolio area of trade, I have particular interest in a range of trade and industry assistance measures-a range of programs that help ensure that our export and trade performance is at its peak; a range of measures that help to ensure that small and medium size businesses get every opportunity and every incentive to trade, particularly in our own region. Two examples are the EMDG, the export market development grants scheme, and the DIFF scheme, the Development Import Finance Facility. I will start with some comments on the EMDG scheme. The coalition went to the election with a trade document called Meeting the challenges: the new global economy: Liberal and National Party trade strategies for 'the future. On page 3 of that document it says: Australia's Export Market Development Grants (EMOG) Scheme has been in operation since 1975, and has been supported by Australia's export businesses. The coalition will retain the scheme. Later in the document under the heading 'Export incentives'-about page 30--there is a further commitment which, in the course of some description of export incentives, asserts: We will maintain the Export Market Development Grants Scheme. The now Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade (Mr Fischer), when he was shadow minister for trade, went to the National Press Club in the course of the election campaign on 15 February of this year. In his speech he said: . . . it is a privilege to present the Coalition trade policy, 'Meeting the Challenges', and debate that policy. In the course of his presentation in respect of the document I have just referred to, the now Deputy Prime Minister said: And finally, ladies and gentlemen, we of course have as the fifth track in relation to our approach to trade, the promoting and fmancing of Australian exports. Austrade stays, the EMOG scheme stays . . . There was a clear and unequivocal commitment to the Australian people and to Australian companies and to Australian exporters that the EMDG scheme would stay. Of course, since the election the Minister for Trade has assiduously refused in this place or elsewhere, as has the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) in this place and elsewhere, and as has the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser) in this place and elsewhere, to confirm to this House or to the Australian public that the government is prepared to meet that commitment and not break that clear and unequivocal election commitment. It is also the case that in a related document the coalition expressly committed itself to not just maintaining the EMDG scheme but to expanding and extending it to parts of the tourism industry. However, since then we have heard nothing but deafening silence. It appears on the part of those sitting opposite that it is all well and good and appropriate conduct for the then Leader of the Opposition and now Prime Minister to go to a primary school and give assurances to primary school children, which he has subsequently walked away from, and it is all well and good for the now Minister for Trad-, the Deputy Prime Minister, to go to the National Press Club and give assurances, which are subsequently walked away from. The EMDG scheme is not the only trade or industry development incentive program in place. The proposed abolition of a range of these incentive schemes and the adverse effects that would follow was put very well by Tim Colebatch in the course of an article in the Age recently. Mr Colebatch had this to say: In less than 10 years, Australia's exports have more than doubled, $39 billion to $92 billion. Most of that growth was in non-traditional areas: services exports trebled to $21 billion, and manufactured exports grew fivefold to $17.5 billion. The export boom in manufactures and services has added almost $30 billion a year to Australia's output, and perhaps 500,000 jobs. In the course of his article he describes this export enhancement as 'Labor's greatest economic achievement'. He then goes on in the course of his article to describe as 'alarming' the coalition's policy and budget agenda and the lack of any strategy for ensuring the continuing of these trade and industry programs, which are currently, as he describes them, being tossed up as targets for alleged financial reasons. In the course of the coalition's trade document there is also a commitment to ensure ongoing discussions with relevant chambers of commerce. There is a commitment that the views of relevant chambers of commerce will be taken into account by the coalition. That being so, I was interested to see recently a public comment by the Managing Director of  Holt, when he said in respect of the government's proposed abolition of the export market development grant scheme, a scheme which he described as helping small and medium business to get into export markets, that the proposed abolition was a major backward step for small and medium sized businesses. He said that it was the breaking of an election promise which would adversely affect job creation and increase the balance of payments deficit. So there is considerable consternation in relevant groups of industry and commerce about the government's abolition of this particular program in clear breach of an express election commitment. A successful business in Western Australia, my own state, has kindly forwarded to me a copy of a letter to the Minister for Trade in respect of the abolition of the export market development grant scheme. It is from a company by the name of Dynamic Technology which is based in Osborne Park in Western Australia. The letter in part says: Our organisation, being one of the 90% of small to medium enterprises claiming EMDG support in 1995, have committed several hundred thousand dollars to a major export initiative to promote Australian made technology and products into very competitive overseas markets. Our commitment to allocating funds for this export initiative was based on the premise that the Export Market Development Grant Scheme would provide us with the necessary assistance to achieve our export strategy. For the Federal Government to tamper with this scheme would have a major impact on our ... export activities and we believe, it would be a fundamental breach of the coalition's pre-election promise to maintain the scheme and support exporters like ourselves. Mr Deputy Speaker, that refrain has been echoed far and wide by a range of companies and industry groups. I notice that my colleague the shadow minister for tourism, the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin), has just entered the chamber; so I draw to his attention a recent release by the Tourism Council of Australia, entitled 'EMDG scheme must aid tourism industry', with Bruce Baird, the former New South Wales coalition minister and now managing director of the tourism body, calling upon the government to fulfil its election commitment in that particular area. , Mr Deputy Speaker, I referred to the EMDG scheme and to the DIFF program, which has now been abolished by the government. I was interested to see today a story in the Brisbane Courier-Mail, headed 'Cuts to scheme ""foolish'''. It read: Moves to cut two Federal Government schemes just as a rising dollar has spooked the nation's exporters, has been slammed by peak industry body, the Metal Trades Industry Association ... Association chief executive Bert Evans has termed the path taken by the Government as ""foolish"" and ""the most short-sighted thing I've seen in my career"". So here we have the chief executive officer of the Metal Trades Industry Association describing the proposed abolition by the government-in the case of EMDG in breach of its election commitment-as foolish and the most short-sighted thing that he has seen. In respect of DIFF, we have seen the Transfield $60 million Philippines naval vessel contract put in jeopardy; we have seen the former head of Foreign Affairs, Richard Woo1cott, who is now the personal emissary of the Prime Minister to Malaysia, attacking the doing-in of the DIFF scheme and saying in the last couple of weeks: Scrapping them . . . could - ndermine Australia's credibility as a reliable supplier, and advantage our commercial competitors in the region, who may pick up those projects which Australian companies will not be able to proceed with. That litany has been joined by protests from ambassadors from a range of neighbouring countries. I was very interested today, Mr Deputy Speaker, when it was drawn to my attention that the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade had been gazumped by his portfolio boss, the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer), who had refused to provide to the Deputy Prime Minister Department of Finance proposals for expenditure cuts to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, allowing him access only to proposals for expenditure cuts to trade agencies and programs such as EMDG and DIFF. We see today in the Financial Review that, as a result, internecine warfare has broken out between the Minister for Trade and the Minister for Foreign Affairs-internecine warfare as a result of the portfolio boss of the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade doing him in. The article in the Financial Review refers to internecine warfare, to relations between officers of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Trade starting poorly and only getting worse, and describing a degeneration of relations between Mr Downer and Mr Fischer. So what do we have here? What is the reason these trade and export enhancement programs have been done in? We now know why the Minister for Trade sits in this House in stony silence, refusing to give to this House the commitment that he gave to the National Press Club. He has been done in by his political junior-his portfolio boss, the Minister for Foreign Affairs-who, as I understand it, has refused to provide him with access to expenditure cuts proposed by the Department of Finance to the entire Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, leaving the Minister for Trade with access only to information in respect of agencies such as Austrade. So we know why these important export assistance programs like EMDG are being done in-it is because the Minister for Trade is being done in.",66
23,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order! It being 2 p.m., the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order lOlA. The debate may be resumed at a later hour. The member will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. NA",69
24,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"I inform the House that the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) has been in Melbourne today on government business, and his return has been delayed until during question time. In the meantime, the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) will answer questions on his behalf. NA Coalition's Election Promises",69
25,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"My question is directed to the Minister for Finance. Has the Minister for Finance seen a report in today's Australian which says: Senior government sources yesterday told The Australian that the latest finance department costings of the Coalition's election promises showed a greater shortfall in savings than anticipated. They said that, as a result, all election commitments were now on the table for consideration by the Cabinet Expenditure Review Committee. The minister will also be aware of departmental figures which we have dealt with in question time before relating to your pension bonus and migration schemes. I now raise a further matter with him. In the funding of its election commitments, the coalition forecast savings of $330 million from more vigorous activity tests for unemployed people. Then the Department of Finance commented that the proposal contained too little information to enable a valid costing to be made. Can you confirm that your government has received further departmental advice which confirms Finance's pre-election analysis, saying that the savings are 'difficult to quantify with certainty'? When will you come clean on the $4 billion hole in your campaign promises? When will you table the Finance costings?",69
26,Mr FAHEY,Unknown,"I thank the Leader of the opinion Opposition for his question. The answer to the first question is yes, I did see the report in paper. In respect of the issue more generally, I can say this: the government has made it clear on numerous occasions in and outside this House that we are approaching the public accounts in a fiscally responsible manner. were left with a mess and we have to fix that mess in the interests of the future of this country. I can assure the Leader of the Opposition, and all other members of this House, that we will work through the process diligently responsibly over the next several weeks, and we will maintain all of the commitments that we have made to this House. The Leader of the Opposition-and all other members of this House-will get the results they want, and results that are the appropriate results; that we will address the deficit, and they will that result on 20 August. Native Title",70
27,Mr RANDALL,Unknown,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. What action is the government taking to ensure there are practiconsonant cal and lasting amendments made to the made Native Title Act so that there is greater certainty for pastoralists, miners, tourist operators and Aboriginal people?",70
28,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"There is throughout the Australian community at the present time quite widespread and very legitimate concern about uncertainties in relation to the operation of the Native Title Act. I have seen and heard some comments made by the Premier of Western Australia, the Premier of South Australia, the Premier of Queensland and the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory-all of whom have quite legitimately complained about the fact that the way the Native Title Act is operating at present is delaying much needed development in this country. All of the concerns that have been expressed by the state premiers I completely concur with. They are merely giving voice to the legitimate desires of the people and the business organisations within their own states to see a great deal more certainty than exists at present. To the extent that there are differences of around Australia, I would hope those differences of opinion would not be about the the objective, but rather the methodology. What the government has set about doing on this issue is to try to achieve a practical set of refonns to the Native Title Act. We are not in the business of trying to drive a wedge beWe tween different sections of the Australian up community. The pastoralists of this country have a legitimate interest in obtaining security, the mining industry has a legitimate interest in obtaining security and the Aboriginal people have a perfect right to see that their common law entitlements are not taken and away. In framing our approach, we have regard to all of those interests. Quite plainly, the continued delay is causing a great deal of insecurity and a great deal the of uncertainty. There are those who believe is, that the simple answer to the situation is to get attempt to legislate the extinguishment of native title where pastoral leases are involved. I can understand why people would see that as a solution. One of the difficulties is that that solution faces a number of hurdles. The first hurdle it faces is whether it is with the election commitments by the coalition and, on the best advice, it is not. The second hurdle is whether it is likely to draw the support of the necessary numbers in both houses of this parliament and I think, on a present reading, it is unlikely to do that. The third hurdle, even if it were to pass through this parliament, is whether it would then be immune from constitutional challenge and therefore be immune from creating a further delay and, in fact, a greater delay than an alternative that might be adopted. It should not be assumed that going down the route of legislative extinguishment will bring the certainty that the mining industry, the pastoral industry and the state premiers of this country so legitimately aspire for and have so legitimately called for in recent days. It is my view that in fact it may cause greater delay if we were to go down that path than if we were to go down another path. The federal government, in proposing another path, is in no way unsympathetic to the views that have been expressed by the Premiers of Western Australia, Queensland and South Australia and by the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory. We happen to think that the most practical way to get to the goal they want to get to is to go down the route that we have advocated. That is why our approach has been somewhat different and that is why there have been different views expressed on this issue over the past few days. This is not an easy issue and it is not going to be assisted by people taking rigid, uncompromising positions. I do not believe that anybody can regard the position being taken by the federal government as being rigid and uncompromising. We are trying to find a solution to a difficult issue. I say to all of the opinion fonners in this country, including the leaders of the Aboriginal community-and I have seen some remarks attributed to at least one of those leaders in the past 48 hours which were quite unfair in the description given to the attempts my government has made to find a reasonable solution to this problem-that we want practical reform to make the Native Title Act more workable. I want to give certainty to the pastoralists of this country, I want to give certainty to the mining industry and I want to protect the common law rights of the Aboriginal people. Our discussion paper and our goals in this area have been fashioned around those three objecti ves and I believe that what my government has put forward is the speediest, most effective and most practical way of achieving those three goals. Youth Wage",70
29,Mr CREAN,Unknown,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, I remind you of your promise on the Face to Face program on 7 January this year when you said: No, no, no, no, no, no, look there is ... no way that we're going to go into the next election with anything remotely resembling.a three dollar youth wage or anything that can be remotely described as resembling that, full stop, end of story. I draw your attention to a speech yesterday by your Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, Dr Kemp, to ACOSS. He flagged that young people could be forced to work for a weekly take-home wage equivalent to the dole. Do you agree that for a 16or 17year-old independent person this would equate to $3.05 an hour? Is it your view that a $3.05 per hour youth wage does not remotely resemble a $3 youth wage?",71
30,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,I think the member for Hotham has utterly and probably deliberately misunderstood what my colleague the minister said. Mr Crean-I quoted the speech; here.,71
31,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"You do not have to hand me anything. Mr Crean-'No, no, no, no, no.'",71
32,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"Let me say it again: no, no, no, no, no. Do you know what he was proposing yesterday? He was proposing the remarkable proposition that a young person should be paid for the time that that young person works. Isn't that a remarkable proposition! He was proposing the absolutely revolutionary proposition that, if in a five-day period you worked three days a week and you had training two days a week, you should be paid for the three days that you worked! Isn't that a shocking proposition! That was all he was proposing. He wasn't proposing $3 an hour. I say to the member for Hotham: wrong, wrong, wrong again. Mr Crean-I seek leave to table the speech. Leave granted. Unfair Dismissal Law",71
33,Mr BOB BALDWIN,Unknown,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. What are the defects under the existing industrial relations legislation, enacted by the previous government, for dealing with the unfair dismissal of employees?",71
34,Mr REITH,Unknown,"I thank the honourable member for his question and I take the opportunity to congratulate him on his excellent maiden speech today. He will be in this parliament for many years to come. He has asked a very relevant"" question. There is no doubt that, of all the many defects of the existing legislation, particularly for small business, the one that has caused so much angst in the small business community has been the Brereton unfair dismissal law. If someone has been unfairly sacked, then they should have a right of appeal. But that basic principle is not really in contention here. What many people in the small business community properly feel is that the current system just does not work; it is not really fair to anybody. In fact, the current system seems to be designed more to destroy jobs than to provide any support for people who might have been unfairly dismissed. There is no question that the current system is tainting the whole of the work force and thereby proving to be a significant disincentive for many people. Let me in a practical way give the House some examples of some of the cases that have occurred under the existing system. I have been talking about small business, but the system has also had an impact in a wider way. For example, after there was careful examination of certain allegations, a university lecturer was sacked. The allegations essentially amounted to a claim that the university lecturer had sought sexual favours from female students on the basis that they would get better marks. Effectively, he was sacked by the university; under the Brereton law, he was reinstated. A second case involved a major airline in Australia. An employee was using company records to harass both female employees and female customers of that particular airline. This bloke was given a fair hearing and he was sacked. In my view he should have stayed sacked; but, under the Brereton law, he was reinstated. The impact for small business was highlighted in a very practical way last year when one of the small business organisations, as part of its regular advice to a small business that had received an unfair dismissal claim, said that if the matter got to a hearing the small business ought to put aside two weeks on average just for the matter to be heard. Mr Speaker, think of that from a practical point of view. If you are running a small business yourself, putting aside two weeks is a major problem. And that is if they get to a hearing. Many cases are being settled. Why are they being settled? Because the legal advice has been that the average cost to defend such a claim under the existing system is about $8,000. The unfortunate truth of the matter is that, when a small business talks to their local solicitor, a lot of the time the local solicitor says, 'If you want to make a commercial decision, you might as well offer them fi ve grand, even though the claim might be completely baseless, because it will save you two weeks in court and possibly eight or 10 grand in legal fees.' That amounts to a form of blackmail and is unfair to all parties. There is no doubt that this system has to change. The Australian Financial Review had a very good editorial on this in February this year just after the then Prime Minister, Mr Keating, had said that he also thought there ought to be some change. The editorial said: What is needed is a complete repeal of the federal dismissal laws and their replacement with Commonwealth-state legislation based on the key aspects of the existing state laws. Those are the existing laws. I believe that the defects of this existing system are very apparent and obvious to all. On that basis, we ought to have an expeditious change to that law so as to provide some relief for small business and, even more importantly, by providing that relief give a lot of people the chance to get a job that they have been denied under the eXisting system. Youth Wage",71
35,Mr MCMULLAN,Unknown,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, in your previous answer you referred to the circumstances of workers facing off-the-job training. Isn't it the case that training wages also apply to on-the-job training? Could this mean that a young person might attend work for five days but be paid for only one, two or three days? Could this same young person face reduced hourly rates under your junior rates proposal? Isn't this a double whammy for young workers-discounted rates paid for reduced hours?",72
36,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"Let me just say very Labor clearly in very simple language that what we are proposing in no way represents a policy to cut the wages of young people. Let me say that again: we are not cutting the wages of young people. What we are doing is preserving the jobs of young people. What you want to do is destroy about of 200,000 jobs for young people. You want preserve a system that is going to force rate of youth unemployment in this country even higher. No amount of misrepresentation by the member for Canberra or by any other member opposite can alter the fact interested in expanding, firstly, the job opportunities for young people and, secondly, the training opportunities for young people. We are committed to a more flexible of training system. It will not result in a $3 $3.05 an hour youth wage. It will not result in cutting the wages of young people, but will result, much to your chagrin, in an increase in the job opportunities of young Australians. And we will have plenty of opportunity over the next three years to drive that home day after day-to your great politiSouth cal discomfort. The Senate",73
37,Mr FORREST,Unknown,My question is addressed to the Deputy Prime Minister. Is the Deputy country. Prime Minister aware of a new coalition of opposition parties in the Senate which is determined to obstruct the implementation the government's program of practical forms?,73
38,Mr TIM FISCHER,Unknown,"Let me reveal a secret. The first agreement that Alexander Downer and I reached within minutes of being sworn in was to spare the world a particular agony: we agreed we would not send our portrait photographs to the embassies of the world. I think that was a very wise decision-and we have been agreeing happily on everything since. We are not too sure what to do with Gareth's photos from around the world. I say to the member for Mal lee that I am aware there was a meeting this morning on the other side of Parliament House between the Greens, the Australian Democrats and committees. senators as they form this unholy axis to do battle against the coalition government. In the case of the Greens it is a bit curious. Why is it curious with respect to the Greens? Because they went to the election standing up for the environment, I would have thought, yet their first move is to vote against a series initiatives totalling $1 billion in value to to get the environment right in Australia-to the help deal with soil degradation, to help reverse soil salinisation and to improve our coastal areas. The Greens are joining this unholy alliance to vote against a $1 billion that we are environment package. Then we have the Democrats. The Democrats are the real vandals of democracy in this country. They are attacking the real mandate the coalition government. I think it is time or to examine their mandate claims. I reveal to the House that when, on 2 March, people it chose to vote Democrat for the Senate and then exercised their preferences, in Victoria 42.5 per cent of the voters gave their preferences to the coalition; Tasmania, 44.4 per cent; South Australia, 46.2 per cent; New Wales, 46.6 per cent; Queensland, 48 per cent; and Western Australia, 49.3 per cent. The real point is, clearly, almost half the people who voted for the Democrats voted for John Howard to be Prime Minister of this And then we come to the Labor Party. They of are the classics. What they are doing-and rethey do not like hearing this-is voting against better pay for blue-collar workers; they are voting against the industrial relations legislation by joining this alliance. The coalition does have a mandate to get on with the job. We have a mandate which will see our legislation properly presented to the Senate. I reveal one other development which has not yet been focused on: the decision by the Senate to send the Telstra bill not to a legislation committee but to a references committee of the Senate. That is the first time in the history of the Senate that a bill, a piece of legislation, has been sent to a references committee rather than a legislation committee. Mr MCMullan-They used to go to select",73
39,Mr TIM FISCHER,Unknown,"You have elaborately transfonned from the Senate. Perhaps you had better go back there. The reason is simple enough. The opposition in the Senate have the majority and the chainnanship of the references committees. It is clear that this is about sabotage of the legitimate legislative program of the government. The industrial relations bill is likewise heading in the same direction. This coalition government does have a mandate to get on with a popular program endorsed by the people of Australia to get the economy right, to get the environment right, to get industrial relations right. I invite the press gallery to consider an appropriate name for this new non-government unholy alliance. They could well start with 'Luddites'.",74
40,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"My question is directed to the Deputy Prime Minister. I ask him first on this question of obstructive Senates and committees: are you aware of the fact that more than 300 bills in our time in office were sent to Senate committees with the connivance of the then opposition parties, now government parties, in the Senate? Secondly, since you discuss mandate, I ask whether you are aware of this opinion expressed by the Prime Minister when in opposition: The argument that there is some kind of mandate out of the last election is invalid, also on the simple proposition that when people vote at an election they do not vote on only one issue. The mandate theory of politics from the point of view of proper analysis has always been absolutely phoney. Do you agree that on that test the answer that you have just given is absolutely phoney?",74
41,Mr TIM FISCHER,Unknown,"Wrong and wrong. The reason is clear enough. Mr Crean- Mr Speaker, I take a point of order",74
42,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,There is no point of order. Resume your seat. We all know it is Thursday and everybody wants to get out of here on time. Let us address the issues.,74
43,Mr TIM FISCHER,Unknown,"The Leader of the Opposition continues to babble on. He might have been fair enough to quote in full context the quote of the former Leader of the Opposition. You might recall that that was during a period when the Labor Party in government decided to break its mandate on no new taxes and no tax increases. Up went sales tax, up went the diesel fuel tax",74
44,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the quote was from 1987.",74
45,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"You will resume your seat. Mr Reith-Point of order, Mr Speaker: we have now had two if not more frivolous points of order. They do go well beyond a reasonable exchange. I ask you, Mr Speaker, to make it quite clear that you will not sit by and allow such constant frivolous points of order.",74
46,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Frivolous points of order The Senate on a day like today will be tolerated rather harshly. So contemplate your future and if you want to walk, if you want to do a bit of exercise, around the parliament, proceed on the basis that you have been.",74
47,Mr TIM FISCHER,Unknown,"During periods in the 1980s and 1990s the Labor Party in government broke its mandate. It broke its mandate on the Medicare levy, it broke its mandate on sales tax, it broke its mandate on diesel fuel and petrol taxes",74

49,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! The member for Batman! You will need Robin's help in a moment.,74
50,Mr TIM FISCHER,Unknown,"They don't like to be reminded of it. The coalition, in a very responsible way, addressed budget after budget by the Labor Party. There were many things we were opposed to which we allowed to go through the Senate against our core platfonn because we recognised the budget dynamic applying in the Westminster system. I invite this rabble opposite to carefully consider their responsibility under the Westminster system, particularly with regard to the budget. We look forward to seeing their conduct in the budget session. Wheat",74
51,Mr ANDREW,Unknown,My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Could the Prime Minister please clarify the future of a single desk selling point for the Australian Wheat Board?,74
52,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"The Australian wheat industry at present is on the verge of enjoying some very welcome improvements because of changed seasonal and trading conditions. It is a source of satisfaction to all Australians an industry that has suffered a great deal over recent years is at last going through a very buoyant period. It is also fair to say that the industry is going through a very positive period of structural reform. That structural reform is being very strongly driven by the government and by my colleague the Deputy Leader of the National Party and Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. Specifically in response to the question asked by the member for Wakefield, I say to the honourable gentleman that I made it clear before the election, and I make it clear again since the election, that the single desk status of the Australian Wheat Board will be retained throughout the life of this government and it will be retained thereafter as long as the net public benefits can be demonstrated. I made this very clear before the election because in the judgment of the then coalition and in the judgment of the government there was a clear benefit in retaining the single desk. That remains our view. That will remain our view throughout the lifetime of this government. While those public benefits continue to be demonstrated thereafter, then the single desk should be retained. Youth Wage",75
53,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,Unknown,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. I refer to the Prime Minister's response to the previous question on the $3.05 youth wage. Firstly, is it the case that under your industrial relations legislation employers can pay a $3.05 youth wage if they get the agreement of the approving authority? Secondly, is it the case under your proposed act that the approving authority could be Ian Salmon from the BCA, Jeff Kennett, Humphrey B. Bear or anyone else whom Amanda Vanstone chooses?",75
54,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"My very competent colleague the Minister for Industrial Relations will be introducing that legislation this afternoon. In response to the member for Batman-the man who really out-Campbelled George Campbell-according to the former Labor Prime Minister, George Campbell had 100,000 dead men hanging around his neck. If you listen to the rantings of the member for Batman, he wants 200,000 jobs of young that people in Australia hanging around his neck. Mr Crean-I have a point of order, Mr Speaker. This answer is completely off track from the question. If the Prime Minister does not know what is in his industrial relations bill he should sit down!",75
55,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"And so should you. Mr Crean-Relevance, Mr Speaker.",75
56,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Settle down.,75
57,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"The member for Batman invites me to reflect upon the provisions of the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill that is going to be introduced this afternoon. I assume, Mr Speaker, that, as you allowed the question to anticipate that, therefore you will allow me to give a full answer on the workplace relations bill.",75
58,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The Prime Minister would be aware that, whilst the bill is on the Notice Paper, and until we see the contents of the bill, it is impossible to anticipate what is in it. So you may feel free to range widely.",75
59,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"I appreciate that. I am delighted to reflect, as the member for Batman invited me to, on what is contained in the legislation. I can tell the member for Batman a few things that are not contained in the legislation. To start with, the legislation does not continue the legal monopoly over the bargaining process now enjoyed by the trade union movement of Australia. Secondly, the legislation does not continue the prejudice against youth unemployment contained in existing legislation. The third thing is that it does not continue the prejudice against employers and employees making their own bargains. The fourth thing the legislation does not contain is the immunity which is now contained in legislation which allows unions to conduct predatory conduct to destroy thousands of small businesses in Australia. I am also happy to say that the legislation, fifthly, does not contain the preference for unionists contained in existing industrial legislation. Sixthly, the legislation does not contain the de facto protection for compulsory unionism. Seventhly, it does not contain a bias against those who want to make workplace agreements with their employers. Eighthly, it does not continue the collectivist approach to industrial relations. Ninthly, and very importantly, not only will this legislation not discriminate against people who want to exercise freedom of choice at the workplace-not only will people be allowed to join or not join a union according to their choice-but, unlike the member for Hotham and the member for Batman when they ran the ACTU, this legislation will allow workers to decide whether or not to join a union; and, tenthly, having decided to join a union, they can join the union of their choice. That represents 10 responses of mine to the invitation of the member for Batman. Eleventhly, it does not contain a provision for a $3.05 per hour youth wage, nor might I assure the member for Batman does it contain a provision for a $3.05 per hour youth wage. The attempt by the Labor Party to represent this legislation as in some way bringing in a youth wage is a pathetically dishonest attempt to misrepresent the provisions of this legisla- allaw. tion. This legislation represents a new era in Australian workplace relations. This legislation will do more to boost the productivity of Australian firms than any piece of legislation presented to this parliament over the last 20 years and, much to the annoyance of those who sit opposite, this legislation will improve the job prospects of young Australians. It will enable young Australians to have more job opportunities and encourage the employers of this country to employ more young Australians. As much as the opposition might not like it, when this legislation is introduced and the Australian people understand its ramifIcations, they will see yet again that-so far from you people being the friends of the working people of Australia-the true champions of the working men and women of Australia now sit on this side of the parliament. Industrial Relations: Small Business",75
60,Mr LLOYD,Unknown,My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Could the Prime Minister explain how small business currently suffers under the existing industrial relations regime enacted by the previous government?,76
61,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"In responding to the honourable member for Batman, there were four elements of the legislation that I did not touch on. I take the opportunity afforded by this question from the member for Robertson to touch on those. He asked me what were the disabilities for small business of existing legislation covering industrial relations. There are more than four in fact, but let me confine myself to four. The first of those was dealt with very adequately by the Minister for Industrial Relations when he talked about the unfair dismissal laws. All of those newly-elected members-members like the members for Paterson and Parramatta, both of whom made their maiden speeches this morning; they were both first-class contributions to this parliament-have touched on what I think would have been the experience of all of us during the recent election campaign: that, if you spoke to the men and women in small business in this country, the issue right at the top of their complaints list was the unfair dismissThe unfair dismissal law, which has been responsible for destroying more jobs over the last three years than any other legislative act of the former government-the pride and joy of Laurie Brereton-without any warning, without any commitment, without any mention, without any mandate, without any electoral authority and without consultation, was dumped by Laurie Brereton on the Australian public before the last election. What was the explanation? You did not get it from the former minister. You got it from the now President of the ACTU, Jennie George. When interviewed on the PM program not long after the 1993 election she was asked, 'Don't you understand, Ms George, that the employers of Australia object to this legislation? They haven't been consulted about it.' Do you know what she said? She said, 'What the employers of Australia have got to understand is that they lost the election and we won it.' That was the attitude. That was winner takes all legislation. Unlike the Australian Labor Party, we took our plans about industrial relations reform to the Australian people at the last election and they overwhelmingly voted for those plans, and that is why we are going to introduce them. So the first thing that is wrong about the present industrial relations laws for the small business community of Australia is the rotten, job destroying unfair dismissal laws. The second weakness of those laws is the way in which after the 1993 election you destroyed the effectiveness of the secondary boycott provisions of the Trade Practices Act. Those provisions were brought in by the Fraser government in 1977. I am very proud to say that as Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs I authored those changes. I can well remember my discussions with the former Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, and the head of the Public Sector Union in 1978. They bitterly opposed those changes. They knew that those changes were going to make it very difficult and very painful for unions destroy the business operation of many small firms in Australia. If it had not been for section 45D, the National Farmers Federation would never have won its historic battle at Mudginberri in 1985. If it had not been for section 45D, the former Queensland government would never have triumphed over unionism during the south-east Queensland power dispute. If it had not been for section 45D, many small businesses in Australia would have been driven to the wall. What was your response to that? Your response was to destroy the effectiveness of 45D and to expose small businesses to that kind of blackmail and thuggery. So that is the second weakness in the existing laws. The other two weaknesses are that the existing laws do not allow enough flexibility for people to combine their work and their family responsibilities. Many small firms are only too willing to make arrangements with their employees to allow those employees more effectively to combine their work and family responsibility. But, unfortunately, the rigidity of the award system prevents that being fully realised. So we are going to do something about that-and you will find enormous benefits in the legislation. Finally, and most importantly, for the first time in Australia's industrial relati.:>ns history this legislation will allow people who genuinely want to make bargains at the workplace level without the unwanted, undesired and unnecessary intrusion of third parties, to make those arrangements to organise their workplaces in a manner which will boost productivity and protect the job security of the people employed. Of all the groups in the Australian community who will benefit most from the workplace relations legislation to be introduced this afternoon, it will be the small business community of Australia-and that is why they will support us in even greater numbers at the election in three years time. Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme",76
62,Mr GARETH EVANS,Unknown,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Finance and to Acting Treasurer. Are you awar- of continuing concerns being expressed by miners and farmers about possible changes to the diesel fuel rebate scheme? Do you acknowledge that, as the NFF, among others, has been claiming and as your colleague Senator Hill across the way appears to concede, any reduction of the rebate would constitute an increase in the tax burden on mining and agriculture? Do you rule out any such change?",77
63,Mr FAHEY,Unknown,"The shadow Treasurer continues to try to express some concern about the deficit that Labor left this governmentthe legacy that we inherited-and he attempts to express that concern on the basis of various speculation about what mayor may not happen in the next budget. But, of course, his leader went round Australia before the election telling everybody that there was a budget surplus, there was no deficit. It was only a couple of days ago that the shadow Treasurer finally came clean when he said, 'The deficit was no accident. It was a deliberate policy choice.' Mr Allan Morris- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the question did not contain the word 'deficit' whatsoever. I draw your attention to the point of relevance we raised the other day.",77
64,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! There is no point of order. Resume your seat.,78
65,Mr FAHEY,Unknown,"The government has the unenviable task of fixing up the mess that was left to us by Labor. Let me just touch on one of those little areas of that mess. In 1990, Commonwealth debt under Labor was $16 billion--4.3 per cent of GDP. On 30 June 1995, Commonwealth debt under Labor was $83 billion-18.4 per cent of GDP. The course that the economy was set on by Labor before 2 March would have added a further $30 billion to the Commonwealth debt. So let's not listen to any of this bankcard mentality that is going on here from Labor where the shadow Treasurer suggests to us that we should not be concerned about deficit, we should not look at the cost of running this country and we should not go through the process of reducing the deficit. We will act responsibly. We will act with regard to all sectors of the Australian community. And we will deliver a responsible budget on 20 August. NA",78
66,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order! Before I call the honourable member for Page, I am aware that in our gallery today is the distinguished former member of the New South Wales Parliament and former Speaker, Jim Cameron. We extend a very warm welcome to the Hon. Jim Cameron. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Union Membership",78
67,Mr CAUSLEY,Unknown,My question is directed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. In my electorate of Page I regularly receive complaints from constituents that they have been refused jobs or find it difficult to get a job because they are not a member of a union. I therefore ask the minister: does the existing industrial relations system enacted by the previous Labor government discriminate against non-union workers? Why does the current system effectively disenfranchise non-union workers?,78
68,Mr REITH,Unknown,"I have actually got a copy of the act with me today. I suppose I should get the member for Kingsford-Smith to sign it as a memento of his time because I can promise him that it won't look like this for much longer. One of the two great bike riders of the parliament! Section 122(IA) of the existing act states: The following matters are examples of the matters in relation to which it may be directed under subsection (1) that preference is to be given: They are only examples, so understand that this is not a complete list. But it is quite amazing to pull it out and read it. These are the provisions: (a) engagement in employment; (b) promotion; (c) regrading; (d) transfer; (e) retention in employment; (f) taking annual leave; (g) overtime; (h) vocational training. In other words, you can be at work and you can be as good a worker as the person working alongside you, yet merely for the fact that you exercised your democratic right not to be in a union, you can have an employer pick the other one in preference to you, simply because of that fact. In other words, your entitlement, for example, to annual leave can be subjugated to this principle of preference under the existing law. It is absolutely incredible. In a society that prides itself on giving people a fair go and treating people on their merits, we have a system which has institutionalised a system of discrimination against people on the basis that they decide not to be a member of a union. It goes further than that because these matters can be in an award, you can be a small business operator under an award and you are required by law to discriminate against a person because they are not in a union. So it is a basic breach of one of the great tenets of this country-that is, that people are entitled to a fair go, to be treated on their merits. That is part of Labor's existing legislation-a law which must and will be changed. The effect of such laws has been over time to destroy and remove the chance for people to have a job. The idea of no ticket, no start in Australia, unfortunately, is commonplace. How many times have honourable members, particularly on this side, had a constituent ring tion. up and say, 'I'm being heavied by the union because they require us to join up our people in the union?' I must have had loads of those cases. The Transport Workers Union, for example, is well known in this country. You can be a small business operator, tum up on a site driving your own truck and you will be banned from that site as a result of a law put in place by these people at the behest of the trade union movement. It goes beyond these matters of compulsory unionism and preference. Take the existing provisions for certified agreements. They are agreements which are struck at the workplace which are then certified by the Industrial Relations Commission. Under the existing system, those certified agreements are between unions and employers. If you are in a union, as an employee in that workplace, you might have some say-although in a lot of unions the union members have absolutely no say. But if you are in a business and you are a non-union employee, under the existing law there is no requirement for majority support for an agreement. In other words, if the union does the deal with the boss, you get no formal say. If you are a non-union member in particular, you have got no look-in whatsoever. I think that is basically wrong. It is basically unfair. It is unreasonable that people, simply because they are not in a union, should have their rights taken away from them. That is a situation that cannot last, must not last and I say will not last. It is a bit disappointing that we have seen today a move in the Senate by the opposition parties to refer a matter to a Senate committee of a type which in the past has not been used for legislation. The Senate, in the time that they have had a two-track system for committees-references committees and legislation committees-have never, until the last week or so, sent a legislative proposal off to a references committee. They have always gone to the legislative committees. That was the reason why they set them up. On this occasion they have sent them to the references committees. You can only judge from that that there are some in the Senate who want to obstruct the reasonable passage of this legislaI invite honourable members to think about the consequences of that. It is not as if the proposals which we will be introducing today are new. These proposals have been the subject of intense public debate. In a democracy, you cannot have a better debate than to have a public debate and then to have an election to let the people decide. That is what has happened on this occasion. The undemocratic feature of this development today is that the existing rules in the industrial relations system were put together under the previous Labor government but they were rejected in the election. Now we have the Democrats siding with the party that was rejected to obstruct the proposals for which the incoming government has a mandate, which the people have asked us to introduce. The reason they have asked us to introduce these measures is that they give people a chance for a job, they give people at work a chance to have a say and, ultimately, these proposals respect and uphold one of the great values of our Australian society-that is, the right to be treated fairly and on your merits. The current system is unfair. It discriminates against people. It is time that that was brought to an end. Local Government",78
69,Mr ANDREN,Unknown,"My question, which I prepared all by myself, is to the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government. Did you, in a speech to the municipal management conference in Canberra earlier this week, indicate there were far too many local government councils in New South Wales? Did you indicate that in future the federal government would use funding grants to· try to blackmail councils into amalgamating? Do you appreciate the employment value of councils to rural communities?",79
70,Mr WARWICK SMITH,Unknown,"I did address the municipal management conference on Monday in Canberra. Some 400 professional managers from around the country attended. Amongst the priorities which I discussed during my speech, I particularly referred to the increased efficiencies that are required in local governments throughout Australia. I also said that there would need to be a continuation of benchmarking and other continuous improvement activities of councils to improve their service levels and the cost of those services to councils. In discussion of the issue of amalgamation I pointed out that, whilst the jury is still on what is happening in Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania, there have been marked benefits from the processes of amalgamation. I recommended that other states also look at the issue of amalgamation to ensure that, where there are able to be benefits for ratepayers, they will be achieved when sensible amalgamations are pursued. Apprenticeships and Traineeships",80
71,Mrs ELSON,Unknown,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. Will the minister inform the House of the progress of his discussions with the states and territories regarding the implementation of the modern Australian apprenticeship and traineeship system?",80
72,Dr KEMP,Unknown,"I thank the member for Forde for her question. I am pleased to inform members of the House that I will be meeting this Friday with the members of the Australian National Training Authority ministerial council in Melbourne to discuss the implementation of the modern apprenticeship and trainees hip system. Unlike those failures on the other side of the House who did not know how to deal with the problem of youth unemployment, ANTA is desperately concerned to make sure that there are arrangements in place which will give young people the opportunity to work at award wages, or better, and to get training which will lead to real jobs. The opposition was not able to do either for almost 30 per cent of young people who were looking for full-time work. What members on the other side of the House are about is mounting a totally baseless scare campaign about youth wages based on falsehood. Mr Crean-Three dollars and five cents an hour!",80
73,Dr KEMP,Unknown,"Let me set the facts on this matter completely straight so that even the $2-billion man over here, the man who spent $2 billion on labour market programs in the first eight months of the year",80
74,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,And saw unemployment go up!,80
75,Dr KEMP,Unknown,"And saw unemployment go up during the election campaign. He spent $2 out billion in the most irresponsible spending binge since Ros Kelly. He makes her financial management look thoroughly respectable compared with the way he behaved with the labour market programs last year. We might even be able to get into his head what the situation is. Under the training arrangements that will be embodied in the workplace relations legislation, young people will be paid the full appropriate award wage. During the election campaign, the government committed itself to a take-home pay guarantee. This legislation fulfils that take-home pay guarantee. In addition to receiving full award pay, whether that is the junior rate or the full award rate for that industry for productive work, young people will have the opportunity to receive full award pay which all those poor young people who have been forced into part-time work at the moment-forced by your unfair dismissals legislation-<io not receive. The opposition virtually destroyed full-time work for young people in this country. In fact, over the last six years it virtually destroyed full-time work for everybody looking for work. Over the last six years there have been fewer than 30,000 additional full-time jobs. Virtually the whole increase in employment has been in part-time work and these part-time jobs do not have training attached to them. What our legislation will do is provide the opportunity for young people to be paid at the full rate, not at some discounted youth rate, and get training into the bargain. I can assure the House that the states and the Commonwealth government are detennined that we will put in place policies that will provide many more real training opportunities that lead on to real jobs for young Australians. Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme",80
76,Mr OKEEFE,Unknown,"My question is directed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. Given that your colleague the Minister for Finance either did not understand or was unable to answer the question, I ask you: do you agree with the National Fanners Federation and the Australian Seafood Industry Council that any reduction in the diesel fuel rebate would constitute an increase in the tax burden on mining and agriculture and that 'any change to the scheme would represent a breach of the coalition's unequivocal commitment not to increase taxes or to introduce new ones in government'? Will you rule out any such change?",81
77,Mr ANDERSON,Unknown,"I thank the honourable member for a question that he has already effectively put in this place and I give him the broad answer: you know, perfectly well, our policy objectives of undoing the damage that you did to rural and regional Australia. The directions that we set during the campaign were quite clear. I am fully able to argue the case for rural and regional Australia but I simply say beyond that, as I have said before, that I play the game with an absolutely straight bat. I will not engage in speculation, nor encourage speculation, and that is all there is to it. Diplomatic Representation",81
78,Mr NUGENT,Unknown,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I refer minister to his response in the House yesterday to a question regarding political appointments to Australian missions. Has the minister seen the report in today's Financial Review which makes claims about the conditions of service of Australia's ambassador to The Hague and the Holy See? Can the minister confinn the accurac), of that report?",81
79,Mr DOWNER,Unknown,"The report was drawn to my attention this morning. It appears on page 3 of the Australian Financial Review tinder the heading 'Envoy's tenns included parents' visits', and it makes a series of allegations. My first reaction to the article was that this was just another example of scurrilous journalism from the Financial Review! I investigated the allegations made, and I can report to the House several things about these allegations. First of all, it is true that when Mr Tate, the Australian Ambassador to The Hague and the Holy See, took up his post a new BMW vehicle was bought and the existing Citroen was retired to a position in the car pool. Secondly, a new BMW was also bought for the post at the Holy See.",81
80,Unknown,Unknown,Government members interjecting,81
81,Mr DOWNER,Unknown,"No, I don't think it is a shame, as a matter of fact. The first point to make is that the ambassador does have a disability, so it was necessary to purchase an additional car. These purchases of new BMWs were undertaken accordingMr Gareth Evans interjecting",81
82,Mr DOWNER,Unknown,"Don't get excited. I have both good news and bad news for you. This is the good news bit, so don't interject here. I am saying that this is in accordance with the guidelines. I had a look at your minute, and I saw what you signed off on. That was okay; it was in accordance with the guidelines. Two new BMWs-well, it was in accordance with the guidelines; that is, the guidelines under the previous government.",81
83,Unknown,Unknown,Honourable members interjecting,81
84,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order! As somebody with a disability, I am hanging on the minister's every word. Let's take it in.",81
85,Mr DOWNER,Unknown,"The second allegation made in the article is that the parents of Mr the Tate are flown once a year at taxpayers' expense to Europe to accompany him. On the basis of the parents being dependants of Mr Tate, the previous government and the previous minister, who is now the member for Holt, concluded that this was in accordance with the guidelines. The third allegation is that Mr Tate is paid $49,000 a year more for his post at The Hague than his predecessor, a career officer, was paid. That allegation is also right. But it is not the whole truth. It is not true that the ambassador is paid $49,000 a year more than his predecessor at the Holy See. That is not true, because his predecessor at the Holy See was Brian Burke. Remember Brian Burke? That was his predecessor. You appointed Brian Burke, didn't you, or was it Bill Hayden who appointed him? It was you, wasn't it, who appointed Brian Burke? Brian Burke was not paid $49,000 a year less. He was not paid less than Michael Tate; he was paid the same. Brian Burke was paid as a permanent head. There he was, one of the many former discredited premiers of Western Australia, and off he went on the salary of a permanent head. The member for Holt, in his straitened circumstances, has been interjecting throughout this answer, saying that this was the practice of the previous government. In a doorstop today-he has to go to the Reps' entrance now and do the doorstop to try to get publicity; to get the motormouth on television night after night-he said these salaries of the Labor appointees 'were based on a practice adopted by federal coalition governments in the past'. That is what you said. 'All this information was on the public record at the time that each appointment was made.' Remember that: 'All this information was on the public record at the time that each appointment was made.' Then he went on to make what I thought were some rather puerile party-political points. But he is wrong, because all this material was not on the public record. What was on the record was this minute which was sent to former Senator Evans, signed by the assistant secretary for staffing in the department. That minute states: Despite an extensive search of Departmental archives we have been unable to locate the files of ""political appointees"" for the period 1979-86. Oh! You did not say that at your doorstop this morning. This is the department's view. Whom would you believe-the member for Holt or the department? Take your pick. It further states: We do know that several earlier political ees were paid at a senior Public Service level, but at a lesser rate than Secretary level, ego Fairbairn (the Hague) and former Foreign Minister Freeth (fokyo). Oh, dear! The Liberals didn't pay them as much as you paid your mates. The fact is that your running around having doorstops and telling the press gallery that this was the past practice of Liberal governments is proven wrong by a minute that you yourself were sent on 21 December 1990. Mr Speaker, I table that minute. Diplomatic Representation",81
86,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Is he aware of the fact that the gentlemen he named, plus Robert Cotton and others who became ambassadors, under your regime received their full superannuation payments as a result of their retirement from this parliament, which, given their levels of ministerial service, in today's dollar terms would have been about $70,000 to $80,000, on top of their salary? Is he aware that we altered that practice as a result of our concerns about that type of performance?",82
87,Mr DOWNER,Unknown,"When the previous, now discredited, government introduced legislation to cease the practice, a practice from which people like Bill Armstrong benefited, one of your mates in the SenateMr Gareth Evans-Sit down.",82
88,Mr DOWNER,Unknown,"Of course you want me to sit down because you do not want to keep the debate going, do you. You still dream of the day when you are the only person in parliament and you can ask yourself the questions, you can answer the-, you can interject, you can introduce second reading speeches, you can oppose them, you can vote on your own. It is the world you dream of, babbler-babble, babble, babble.",82
89,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order, Minister!",82
90,Mr DOWNER,Unknown,"The point is that Labor appointees from the Whitlam government benefited from that practice. All appointees from both sides of the House at one stage benefited from that practjce-and we supported that change. We assumed that you would appointthen go on and, true to the beliefs of the Labor Party-the great egalitarian slogans of the Labor Party-make sure that heads of mission who were political appointees would be paid in accordance with the principles of equity and decency. But there you were, 13 years in power, and under your leadership you reduced the wages of working people-you reduced their wages-and you paid the likes of Brian Burke $49,000 a year more than a career public servant would be paid in the same position. I have to say: it is pretty rich for the Labor Party, the party that professes passion for workers, the downtrodden, the unemployed, the strugglers, the battlers-that is all your rhetoric-and, when it comes to your mates, you pay them more than anyone has ever paid such appointees in the history of this country.",82
91,Unknown,Unknown,Honourable members interjecting,83
92,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! We are all aware of the provisions of standing order 304A. My only regret is that I cannot apply it to myself on days like this. Employment,83
93,Mrs ELIZABETH GRACE,Unknown,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. What are the employment benefits for those thousands of battling Australians who were locked out of employment during Labor's reign of failure of the closing of the $8 billion Beazley budget black hole?",83

96,Dr KEMP,Unknown,"to restore employment opportunities. Mr Leo MCLeay- Mr Speaker, I raise a how point of order. I know the minister is very wrapped up in his answer. You might draw his attention to the fact that, when you are your feet, he at least is required to sit",83
97,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I take the point of order night of the member for Watson. I did move very quickly and I am sure it was just a blaze light in the comer of the minister's eye. But I am sure he will recognise my movements in future.,83
98,Dr KEMP,Unknown,"Mr Speaker, I apologise for not seeing you standing there. Over recent weeks we have seen simply amazing scenes on the other side of the parliament as they mill about, bumping into each other, trying to decide on what their economic policy will be the over the next three years. On the accord, for example, we have heard the shadow minister for industrial relations tell us that the accord has no future and that he is against another accord, while the shadow Treasurer has been prattling on along the old line in that he thinks there might still be another accord.

101,Dr KEMP,Unknown,"Over the last few weeks, of course, we have seen the shadow Treasurer struggling to get his views straight on the economic policy that he is going to put before this parliament. Over recent weeks he has made the odd comment here or there about the surplus should be treated. He started out by saying, 'I think that maybe we should deal with the surplus, but not yet, not in on 1997-98. Perhaps at some other time in the down. future we'll deal with it.' But on Monday he really let the cat out of the bag in relation to this $8 billion black hole. In a of speech, he asked himself the question: How come the budget is not in better shape after 4Y2 years of sustained growth? Then he answered the question-and the answer spoke volumes. He said: Let me answer it by saying it is not a product of mismanagement in any sense; rather, it is a product of deliberate policy choice.",83
102,Dr THEOPHANOUS,Unknown,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The question had nothing to do with the position of the opposition, which is very sensible on these issues. It was a different question entirely about schools and the budget process. This is totally irrelevant understanding order 145.",84
103,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,There is no point of order. Resume your seat.,84
104,Dr KEMP,Unknown,"The shadow Treasurer said that the deficit was the product of deliberate policy choice. In other words, what he was really saying was that it was the deficit we had to have. He asked himself the question and he got it wrong because, if you do not close this deficit, if you do not want a surplus now in the sixth year of the economic recovery, you do not want a surplus at all. You are not serious in trying to close to this gap. They never were interested in taking the hard decisions-and the Leader of the Opposition knows this because he was rolled again and again by the then Prime Minister during the savings exercises-that would close this savings gap. Unless this gap is closed, there will be continuing pressure in the economy on interest rates. What they are saying is, 'We should continue to finance this government out of growing debt.' It means that we are going to continue to put pressure on small businesses in this country. It means we are going to continue to erode employment opportunities. It is about time that you exercised a bit of the strength which you did not show when you were Minister for Finance and got your shadow Treasurer to face up to the facts of economic life in this country. If this deficit is not closed, the employment prospects of hundreds and thousands of Australians are going to be called into question. We are going to have continuing pressure on interest rates. We are going to have continuing pressure on small business, and these problems will not be solved. You should exercise a bit of leadership.",84

The leader of the article says: Multicultural Australia has suddenly caught up with the emblematic city of Toowoomba in provincial Queensland, with predictable results. In particular, Mr Speaker, I draw your attention to a segment of that article which says: . . . the community has been swept by a persistent rumour that 2500 Aborigines are to be ""shipped"" from the Sydney suburb of Redfern to Toowoomba to make way for Olympic Garnes accommodation. Ludicrous as it is, the local federal member, Bill Taylor, has had to publicly deny the rumour in a so far fruitless attempt to quash it. It has not been a fruitless attempt.

I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",85
113,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,Unknown,"I rise this afternoon to address what I regard as one of the most serious issues confronting Australia as a nation at this particular point in time. I refer to our obligation as a nation to ensure that we protect and give opportunities to our most important resource, namely, our young people. As a country, we must ensure that we have strong leadership that is capable of guaranteeing that, when they go to work, young people have the opportunity to access decent training opportunities and, in doing so, that they are safeguarded at work with respect to having a system in place which guarantees decent rates of pay and conditions of employment. It is on that question that I refer to what I regard as the failure of the current government with respect to the proposed cut in youth wages and the question of continuing support for real training and employment opportunities for young people. In that context, I also refer in passing to the miserable performance of the previous coalition government, prior to 1983, not just with respect to the question of our young, but with respect to the nation at large. With that in mind, can I say that, when the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) was last in office-and I would remind the House",85
114,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,You might recall that we refer to the Prime Minister by his correct title.,85
115,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,Unknown,"When the Prime Minister was in office as the Treasurer of this nation, and when the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, the member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), served as a policy adviser to representatives in that government, the Prime Minister left Australia in a state of disarray. In 1983, he left a legacy of a spiralling underlying rate of inflation of 10.5 per cent, and an unemployment rate of 10 per cent. That is why he was known at the time as the double digit Treasurer-double digit John Howard. At that time, Australia was basically at industrial war. An industrial war was in place in Australia because of the failure of the Prime Minister, who was then the Treasurer, to put in place a reasonable wages policy and to pursue an approach to life that was based on cooperation and goodwill in the workplace. With that legacy in mind, our responsibility was to try to reshape Australia and to take Australia forward. We had to ensure that, as a nation, we had the ability not only to compete lOCally but also to compete on an equal footing with other nations in the international arena in the light of increasing globalisation of the world economy. Our first responsibilities were, for example, to reduce the level of industrial disputation by something in the order of 60 per cent based on the current figures; to lock in a low rate of inflation; and to give workers and their families better opportunities through the development of decent programs, such as through lowering taxes-including, I might say, for the corporate world. People should not forget the level of corporate taxation that existed under the Prime Minister when he was the Treasurer of this great nation. In government, the Labor Party also addressed the question of improvements in child care, access to decent educational opportunities, and public housing. Those issues are all low on the policy agenda of the current government. I refer to the fact that we pursued superannuation and a decent savings policy and that we sought to increase household disposable income not just by increasing the social wage but also by having a record achievement in job creation. The end result was an increase in disposable income in the order of 40 per cent since 1983, when the member for Goldstein was last a policy adviser whilst he sat at Monash University and Melbourne University for the purpose of ensuring that very backward looking approach to public policy in Australia was put in place. It is high time that this nation faced the fact that we made a good start in the last 13 years to ensure that we put in place and lock in once and for all equal opportunities work and at home for our young men and women of Australia. We did not have that opportunity when we assumed power in 1983 because not only was Australia an economic mess and there was industrial war in Australia but also the Prime Minister had left Australia with a record deficit. In dollar terms today that deficit was in the order of $24.5 million or 4.9 per cent of GDP. I understand why members of the government do not like to hear these hard facts: do not like to be reminded of their failure to perform when they were last in power in Australia. We were not just concerned with those issues. We were concerned about ensuring that Australia's young were given not only educational opportunities irrespective of where they came from and irrespective of the level of income or the nature of the job that their parents had but also decent opportunities to access tertiary education. We all know the approach of the member for Goldstein prior to the election of the Labor government in 1983. When he started lecturing at Melbourne University, his first lecture in politics was about what a great lecturer he was. He was only interested in lecturing la creme de la creme, not ordinary working-class kids who had been given an opportunity as a result of the previous decisions by the Whitlam Labor government to ensure that all of us, irrespective of where came from, had access to tertiary education. It did not matter whether you lived at Blacktown in Sydney or Footscray in Melbourne, you were guaranteed an opportunity to pursue a tertiary education opportunity. In addition to that, we are about record job growth. The member for Goldstein likes to forget that, when the current Prime Minister of Australia was last in power, this was his legacy on the employment front-and I know it hurts: he had 700,000 dead men and women hanging on his shoulders. No wonder he his wandered around the nation stooped. But that was not bad enough. He likes to raise the issue of youth unemployment. What was the up to level of youth unemployment in 1983? This is John Howard's legacy-158,100 young men and women of Australia were denied at employment opportunities and, in association with their denial of employment opportunities under the then Prime Minister, they were denied access to decent wages, conditions of employment and decent opportunities of work. I refer to the question of the training wage and I refer specifically to a speech that was tabled in the House this afternoon given by the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training yesterday entitled 'Training: pathways to real jobs'. I urge all members of they the House to read that speech in detail and consider the hidden agenda that is contained in that speech and in the industrial relations bill that is to be introduced into this House today. A very precise examination of that speech, which has been tabled in this House, takes you back to the coalition's policies of October 1992. Yes, Jobsback. I refer specifically to page 9-I am sure the member for Goldstein is aware of this particular policy documentwhich says: (ii) a minimum hourly youth wage for youth: - for 15 to 17 year oIds: $3 an hour; - for 18 to 20 year oIds: $3.50 an hour; I suggest that people do some calculations with respect to the application of the member's speech of yesterday in association with the government's policy of October 1992. This is what it amounts to. Under the we provisions flagged by the member for Goldstein yesterday whereby 'no young person will be required to take up a training option where their total income would be less than under the income support arrangements', I put it to the House that the real application of that speech is as follows. Sixteenand 17-year-old workers can be paid as little as $3.05 an hour. The Jobsback policy of 1992 is calculated on the basis of a 38-hour week-and I assume you don't want to take away the 38-hour week in association with reducing the hours of work and wages of young people in Australia. From the youth training allowance rate for dependants without children in the age group, which is $232.10 per fortnight, you come up with an houdy rate of $3.05 an hour. Let us go to the 18to 20-year-olds. They will get little more than about $3.38 an hour, even worse than the policy of October 1992 of $3.50 an hour. That is also calculated on the basis of a devisor of a 38-hour week from the youth training allowance rate for dependants without children in the age group. Then we go to the new industrial relations regime, the so-called bill. I refer the House the approving authority. What does it say? I refer specifically to the failure of the Prime Minister to answer this question in the House today and I quote from the proposed bilI: It means any person or unincorporated body declared in writing by the ministerand it is the current minister in the Houseadministering the Australian National Training Authority Act 1992 to be an approving authority for the purposes of this definition. That makes you ponder. That could effectively mean, as I said before, Humphrey B. Bear, Jeff or Felicity Kennett, or even Amanda Vanstone's sister, who is now free from pursuing show trials in Western Australia. Because that is what it really says. Opposition member-Judith Sloan. Mr MARTIN ·FERGUSON-As someone has suggested, it could even mean Judith Sloan, the person who often writes in the Australian about the need to reduce wages and conditions of employment and about the fact that the Australian work force structure has changed. She likes to lecture working people about the need to face up to structural change and to accept that the labour market should be deregulated while she feeds herself on champagne and caviar. That is Dr Sloan's approach to deregulation in Australia. She sits in her sinecure in the university system in South Australia while suggesting-and she has been consulted by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith)-that the Australian labour market ought to be deregulated and that ordinary young working men and women should accept wages of the order of $3.05 per hour. You ought to be ashamed of yourselves. It is about time the government came clean and told the Australian public what it is about. But the government is not just about reducing wages and conditions for young people in Australia. It is also going to make it exceptionally difficult, through its attack on Working Nation, to create decent training opportunities for young people who want to get into the work force. They want to get access to decent training that is recognised not just at the local employment centre but also within to their industry and across the nation at large. In answer to a question in the House on Monday, the minister asserted: The government has not frozen labour market program expenditure. Mr Crean-You've got to be joking!",85
116,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,Unknown,"I am sorry, but many people and many organisations have raised this with me. It is interesting to examine specifically the minute from the departmental secretary. I think we ought to look at these issues when considering whether these is a freeze in place or not. What did that departmental secretary's minute say? It said: I do not want us drumming up any new business . .. I am requesting that, from today, you do not approve any new commitments. That message has been conveyed right across the regions. I go to the question of the application of that message in my own electorate. The coalition's commitment to training must sound very hollow to thousands of small business employers around Australia who are being told right now by DEETYA that this government is not prepared to fund labour market programs. What does that mean out in the ordinary workplaces for small business people? I will tell you about the Northcote area in my electorate of Batman. There are 70 small businesses in my electorate which have taken on young people and are prepared to offer training places in association with apprenticeships. The department now says it is not prepared to fund those programs. So much for your commitment to the small business people of this nation. The poor local officials have been required by the department to say that they haveDr Kemp interjecting Mr Crean-You're a fraud. It's a disgrace.",87
117,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Mr Nehl}--The minister at the table will have his turn at the moment, but I do suggest to the member for Hotham that he restrain himself. He does not have the call.",88
118,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,Unknown,"Mr Deputy Speaker, can you imagine: here are the people who boasted that they understood the needs of small business. In my own electorate they are not only denying small business but also denying young men and women the opportunity to take up decent training opportunities at this point in time. It might appear funny to those on the other side of the House, but they ought to get out and talk to some of these young people and get a feeling for the sense of pride and dignity that they take hold of as a result of being given those decent, targeted training opportunities. It is about time that nation at large was given an honest explanation of the government's intentions. (Time expired)",88
119,Dr KEMP,Unknown,"Goldstein-Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training and Minister Assisting the Minister for Finance for Privatisation) (3.34 p.m.}--That was a really pathetic address by the honourable member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson), and a deliberate misrepresentation of the policies that the government has put forward, from a person who has absolutely no credibility whatever in relation to youth unemployment. Along with his mate, the former president of the ACTU, these terrible twins have absolutely devastated employment opportunities for young Australians. If there is one major area of policy which stands out as being the most disastrous failure of the previous government, it is the employment areathe youth unemployment area in particular. The policies that that government put forward destroyed full-time opportunities for young people. In the last six years, there have been fewer than 30,000 additional full-time jobs created by small business in the whole of Australia, yet the member for Batman has the hypocrisy to tell us that they have some sympathy and understanding for small business. These are the people who authored the unfair dismissals legislation and who foisted on small business in this country the highest interest rates in the world, which devastated the small business sector and created one million unemployed. We have got the pathetic sight of the member for Batman, covered in cobwebs, talking about the previous coalition government. People in Australia are interested in your performance-your pathetic, abysmal performance-which, after 13 years, was unable to create job opportunities for young Australians. You put in a series of programs which you tell this House",88
120,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Mr Nehl}-Perhaps the minister is referring to the Labor government and not to me.,88
121,Dr KEMP,Unknown,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for pulling me up on that point. I shall observe the courtesy. The member for Batman the told us that the former government had put into place policies which provided real and genuine training to young people. Youth full time unemployment today, at 27Y2 per cent or thereabouts, is as high as it was when that program was introduced two years ago. As the member for Hotham knows only too well, what the former government put into place was a set of programs which did not lead young people on to real jobs. These programs that the member for Batman thinks are so wonderful gave the merry-go-round a spin and brought 60 per cent of the young people in those programs right back to the end of the unemployment queues again. The sort of training that has traditionally led to real jobs has involved apprenticeship and traineeship opportunities. Last year, near the very end of the former government's tenure in office, the number of young people in apprenticeships and traineeships was, as a proportion of the work force, the lowest for three decades. The whole apprenticeship system was allowed to atrophy. It did not fit in with the training agenda that you wanted to run. It did not fit in with the training agenda that the Acru were promoting. The agenda they were promoting forwarded their industrial relations objectives. They were not the slightest bit interested-they never were interested-in putting into place a training system which focused on training for young people and led to real jobs. The ACTU wanted to link the centralised wages system with the training system. They wanted to have a highly bureaucratic set of arrangements. Every time they could stamp somebody as having achieved a competency level, regardless of the value of that person to the small business, they wanted more money; they wanted higher wages. So young people have been disastrously disadvantaged by the policy of the former government. There are now 26,500 teenagers in Australia who have been unemployed for more than 12 months, and that number has risen in the last year. I am sure nobody is claiming that it has risen because of the policies of the present government; it has risen because of the policies of the previous government. The coalition is about putting in place training opportunities that will give young people a foothold in real jobs-the kinds of training opportunities that the former government and its mates in the ACTU refused to accept. They put in place something they called the national training wage award. They did not bother to talk to small business about that award; that award was designed in the smokefilled rooms of the ACTU. That award put in place proposals and policies which have discouraged small business from taking on trainees, which is why there is such a pathetically low number of trainees in Australia. There could be many more. There could be many more apprenticeships. There could be new·kinds of apprenticeships in new industries alongside the traditional kinds of ticeships. There could be many more apprenticeship type opportunities in the service sector, in information technology and in multimedia. There could be opportunities across a whole range of new industries. But of course the work practices in those industries very often do not fit the kinds of arrangements the ACTU is prepared to allow Australian governments to put in place. The government is putting forward to the parliament a policy which will give young people that opportunity. It is a policy which fully implements the guarantee we gave during the election campaign-that there would be no reductions in take-home pay for any worker. Mr Martin Ferguson-That's not true and you know it.",88
122,Dr KEMP,Unknown,That is absolutely true. Every young person in these training arrangements will have access to a full award wage. Mr Martin Ferguson-What are their appeal rights?,89
123,Dr KEMP,Unknown,"If they believe they are being cheated, they will have the opportunity to go to the Employment Advocate. They will not have to pay a cent to have their rights protected. They will get that full award wage. Mr Martin Ferguson-Three dollars and five cents an hour and you know it.",89
124,Dr KEMP,Unknown,"You know that is not true. This is one of the most disgraceful examples of the betrayal of young people that we have seen from those on the other side of the House. When they were in government they put in place training programs which did not provide adequate opportunities for young people. They are now trying to prevent the new government from establishing programs that will lead young people on to real jobs. The principle we are applying in these new arrangements is exactly the same principle of payment for young people as has been implemented in the national training wage awardthat is, young people are paid for their productive work. That is exactly the same principle for the national training wage award that you negotiated through the arbitration comapprenmission. Young people are paid for their productive work and not for their training. That principle is exactly the same as the arrangements we are putting in place. The big difference is this: regardless of the contribution of the young employee to the productivity of the workplace, the ACTU said, 'If you want to offer that young person training, you've got to pay them as if they were putting in four full days of productive work.' Maybe that young employee was not putting in that work. Maybe they were putting in only three full days of productive workthey did not have the skills; they did not bring into the workplace with them the wherewithal to make that kind of contribution to the productivity of the enterprise. Nevertheless, you said that they had to be paid as if they were contributing four days of fully productive work. We will be changing that. Mr Martin Ferguson-You will be changing that-cutting their wages; tell the truth.",89
125,Dr KEMP,Unknown,We will be allowing a large number of new training opportunities. You cut their wages; you cut them right back to the dole because you threw them out of work.,90
126,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Mr Nehl)Order! The minister will ignore the member for Batman.,90
127,Dr KEMP,Unknown,"Mr Deputy Speaker, he is being very provocative. I am seeking to observe the courtesies as best I can. Thank you for reminding me; I am pleased to have your admonition on that point. Our aim in these new policies is to ensure that a range of flexible new training opportunities are put in place for young people-new kinds of apprenticeships, new kinds of traineeships; not the kinds of labour market training merry-goround programs that took most young people back onto the dole, but programs that give them a foot in the door of the workplace, where a real job can be provided. They are the basic principles on which the government's training reforms are based and no amount of scare talk and dishonesty by the opposition is going to make the slightest difference to the government's intention to give young people the opportunities that they have been denied for the last 13 years. During his speech, the member for Batman told the House that the labour market programs are currently frozen. Let us leave aside the issue of whether or not the training under those programs is high quality training. It is not the accredited training, according to industry standards, that provides portable qualifications for young people. The member for Batman indicated in another part of his speech that that was the ideal requirement for training. It is not training of that kind, and he knows that. But why is there a constriction at the moment on the availability of funds in this area? It has nothing whatever to do with the decisions of the present government. Last year the previous government allocated to these labour market programs an annual budget of $2.1 billion for the current year. That would seem to most people an enormous amount of money-an enormous amount of money with which an enormous amount of good could be done. How was this money used? How was it managed by the former Minister for Employment, Education and Training, the member for Hotham (Mr Crean)? On the Monday after the election, 4 March, no less than $2,000 million of that $2.1 billion-that is, 95 per cent of it-had already been committed. Seventy-one per cent had been spent and another proportion of it had been committed, taking it up to 95 per cent already having been committed. Out of the whole $2.1 billion, only $91 million was left to cover the last third of the year. It would have to be one of the most irresponsible pieces of financial management that this country has seen since Federation. Mr Martin Ferguson-You and the Prime Minister know all about that.",90
128,Dr KEMP,Unknown,"It is an utter disgrace that the young people of this country were made hostage to the short-term political interests of the member for Hotham, who was managing that money, and the member for Batman, who betrayed those young people when he was President of the ACTU. They knew what the consequence of this would be, and they did not care. They knew that there was not going to be another billion dollars to cover the last third of the year. There was not going to be another billion dollars under their government, and there cannot be another billion dollars under this government, especially since we have found out the true state of the nation's finances. They knew that money would not be there. They knew that those programs would hit the wall after the election. Mr Martin Ferguson-You froze them. That's right; you froze them.",90
129,Dr KEMP,Unknown,They knew that those programs would hit the wall. Mr Martin Ferguson-What does the departmental Secretary's minute say? That you froze them?,91
130,Dr KEMP,Unknown,"The member for Batman seems to be determined to continue to mislead the House even from a seated position, when he does not have the call from the chair.",91
131,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"I am more concerned about him defying me. If he really wants to go ta-tas, I could very easily arrange an early mark for him.",91
132,Dr KEMP,Unknown,They knew what the consequence of this would be. The present government will constantly point out to the unemployed people around this country that the former government spent the money before the year was up to change the statistics. They tried to make it look as though unemployment was not as high as it was by hiding people in programs. They tried to redefine the long-term unemployed people as short-term unemployed people so they could say their programs were working. They spent that money on training providers regardless of the consequences for local small business and regardless of the opportunities for unemployed people. (Time expired),91
133,Mr ADAMS,Unknown,"While the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) did not give us very much indication of where he was going, he spoke a lot about the previous government. We know why we have this matter of public importance before the House today: because of the government's failure of young people by its proposal to cut youth wages and to discontinue any support for real training programs in this country. This really is a cynical exercise by the government, which thinks it can cut youth wages and conditions of work so that it can stand up and wave a flag saying it has brought down youth unemployment. That is basically what this exercise is about. The government is going about cutting wages and giving employers basically· open slather on part-time and casual workers and junior workers. It wilI be open slather by the employers in this country. They are going to have every right to treat people as they wish. That is what is going to happen. The youth will be paid less than the dole. They will get three days of 'productive work'-I think that was the term used-a week and they will be paid less than the dole for three days work. That is what this cynical exercise is about. The federal government has cleared the way. It is going to cut wages for apprentices, I am sure, and trainees. Their wages will fall as the government makes changes to the Industrial Relations Act and goes ahead with these exercises under the guise of tackling youth unemployment. Employers will pay young people for only the time they are on the job, or in 'productive employment'. That could be a new term. I am sure some smart employers could tum that around and use it to their advantage by saying, 'You've actually been doing some learning. We won't bother paying you for the last three hours because you were not being productive-you were only learning.' These are the sorts of exercises and the sort of process we are seeing evolve and that is what we could end up with. If and when trainees and apprentices are undertaking training off the job-at a TAFE college or at some other place where they can receive training-they will not receive any payment. That sort of exercise is meant to encourage training or to encourage young people to become skilled, but I cannot think of anything worse that we could offer young people. Where is the encouragement to train? There is no encouragement to train. People have always received training as a part of their income. It is under the guise of flexibility, like everything else, that wages will be cut and people will not be paid for training. We have all been young; we have all had to train-but as you train you. still have to live, you still have to pay the rent, you still have to buy the food, you still have to clothe yourself, you still have the day-today expenses of living. That might not have got through yet because we are only into being paid for being productive. If you are not productive, you will not be paid. That is the new regime in Australia. It is not about somebody receiving an income because they need an income to live at a certain standard of dignity; it is now only about what you can be paid from productivity-only if you are productive. We are going down that road. We will be seeing falling rates of apprenticeships, traineeships and training in Australwill is. It will be going backwards. There is certainly a fall, which will mean wages falling below the dole. In Tasmania-I do not know if it has started elsewhere in Australia-there is now 'dob in an unemployed person'. If the employer does not like you he can ring up about you. If you have fronted up for a job and he says, 'Here is $3.05 an hour,' which is the going rate, and you say, 'No, I am not going to work for $3.05 an hour,' he can say, 'Okay, I am going to dob you into the dole office. You are not going to get the dole, so work for what I am going to pay you.' That is what this government is on aboutMr Wilton-Take it or leave it.",91
134,Mr ADAMS,Unknown,"Take it or leave it; sign or go. In the next few months, as we go through the bill that is coming into the House today, we will be going down that line. It is going to be: 'Sign or go. Do as you are told. Do what I want you to do or don't bother coming in tomorrow because that is what happens out there in the real world.' That is the line we are going down. It will be a case of dobbing in the genuine person. It is not about a fair day's pay for a fair day's wage. It has nothing do with it. The employer contracts for a certain price and then he just brings in the juniors. I do not know how that will increase full-time work in this country. I cannot see how it is going to go anywhere near increasing full-time work because employers will engage more parttimers and more juniors to do full-time workers' jobs. We are going to do away with any link between three tradesmen and one apprentice. That will go. There will not be any link between tradesmen and apprentices or tradesmen and training. It will be open slather. An academic in today's press, Ms Barbara Pollack, who specialises in this area, said in the Financial Review that restructuring the commission's powers to arbitrate on the ratio of apprentices to tradesmen would remove any incentive to training. Of course it will. What other role could it play? It would have to reduce any incentive for training. Why would somebody want to be trained if it is probably going to cost them money? They probably lose income to go into training. There will be a disincentive in getting people to train. The previous government did encourage training. It believed in training. It believed in linking training and work in many ways. Many good programs came out of the previous government, such as school-to-work. Those sorts of programs are excellent programs and should be continued. I can only see them going backwards under this government. Under the previous government we went down the path of locking training and wages together so that we could maintain and educate our young people in the work force to become smarter and better skilled and keep our competitive edge in Asia and in Europe. We talk about being a smarter country so that we can go down that track, but we are not going to become the smarter country; we are going to become the duller country, with fewer skills and with no innovation coming from the other side. We did not hear anything from the minister. He gave us no reason to think that the government has any sort of vision in this area at all other than cutting, going backwards, and reducing people's wages and conditions. The government has said that it is not going to have any regulations on part-time, casual or junior workers and that business can hire whoever they want to. There is going to be a lot less accountability and fewer regulations. How they are going to make that happen I do not know. Somebody turning up will be offered an hour's work. They will either accept the hour's work or they will not get any further work. That is how it will work, to say nothing about what is going to happen to the scope of hours within awards and within award structures. We do not know how this will work and how it will tie into people's entitlements to receive unemployment benefits in the future. This government will make it harsher and harsher for people. You either accept what you are told, accept what you are given and sign, or go-that is going to be the tale. (Time expired)",92
135,Mr CHARLES,Unknown,"I rise to join in this debate with some amazement. We have just heard a diatribe from the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) which would take us back to the Great Depression. He talks about everything that was wrong then and how wonderful everything was under a Labor government. He sat in office with the ACTU and did everything possible to prevent young people from getting jobs, from getting real structured training, from learning new trades and from learning to participate in the life of their nation. We have today one of the highest youth unemployment rates this nation has ever an absolute disgrace. We know it is a disgrace, and this government is going to try to do something about it. We have also just heard from the member for Lyons (Mr Adams). The member for Lyons seems to assume that this government, in attempting to make some changes that would benefit young people, is out to destroy them-we are going to beat up on them and we are going to force them into slave wages. Let me tell the member for Lyons something: people work for fair value. Employers in this nation well know that they are not going to get good productive work, nor are they going to improve their own employment situations, if they do not pay decent wages and offer people decent conditions. We all know that. It is axiomatic. Our social safety nets in this country, applied through the social security department, allow people a living wage. If people cannot get enough income at work to support themselves, then they will live on the dole instead. What a nonsense to say that we will put up a proposal to try to disadvantage young people who have been so demonstrably disadvantaged under a Labor government over the last 13 years! Let us talk about some of the problems we face today in vocational education and training. They are substantial, and I will tell you what: in the eight minutes that I have left to speak, I will not even come close to covering them. Let us start at years 9 and 10 in secondary schools. We have a demonstrable problem in that we are losing out of years 9 and 10 a number of students who are leaving school at that very early age-not to enter the job market and/or to go on the dole. We are just losing them. We do not know where they are going, but we know that they are disappearing out of the school system. They are bored because there is no structured work for them to do and there is no training that appeals to them. They are the ones who are going to wind up on the streets as the homeless and, ultimately, are going to wind up in the dole queues; they may be those who wind up on drugs or alcohol and with other problems; and they may wind up in the courts and seen. It is in the justice system. We have to do something for those kids. I am worried to death about them. It really frightens me. Under the Labor government, our school system has moved away from a concept that we once had-that there were two streams, if you like, to education. One of the streams was basically those who wanted a good general education, for whatever purpose, and then went on to CAEs or universities in order to get further education and further training. The other stream did both academic studies and vocational trade training at school. The member for Lyons knows that, but the government of the day did away with it. Some time in the 1970s they said that vocational training was second-class education for second-class kids, and they wiped it. Late in the piece, the last government finally started to catch on-after 13 years of failure-that the skills base was disappearing, that we were losing skilled tradesmen and that we were losing our capacity to attract people into vocational training. So you started to make some changes. We need for those kids in years 9 and 10 a program that will offer them a couple of days a week at work in some structured training, including training in life skills-how to get up on time in morning, how to be at the job on time, how to brush your teeth, how to use deodorant, how to present yourself as acceptable to the rest of society, how to stay at work until finish time, how to produce something while you are there, as well as how to get on with your work colleagues and do something decent for the company in which you participate-and two days a week in general education at high school. We have tried a pilot program at Berwick High School in my electorate which has become so successful that we desperately need funding for it. They have heaps of kids that they believe are at risk of leaving the school system and being lost out there in the never-never, unrecoverable for a long time. I will tell you another thing about this group of young people: they generally have very poor literacy and numeracy skills. That will follow them all the rest of their lives. There is a real link between non-attendance at school and lack of literacy. We find links between those who are abusive at school to their fellow students, whether it is violence or whether it is verbal harassment, and poor literacy skills. If you go and talk to the youth organisations, they say that there is a real link between those who are on the streets and need help and those who have poor literacy and numeracy skills. These are young people that needed to have a better go at primary school. Beyond this, in years 11 and 12 we are trying to create some structural training, real vocational education and training, that gives the kids a certificate which they can use as part of their time already spent in TAFE or in a private training institution. For instance, a young person who wants a career in the hospitality industry, as part of their VCE in Victoria, can go to school and take a hospitality course and they can get credit for having done that course which gives them time off in either an apprenticeship, a hospitality traineeship or some other courses they want to do at TAFE. There is such a huge proliferation of training mechanisms, devices and authorities all over this country that nobody understands the system. I defy you to tell me one expert in Australia-be it a single official in the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, the minister herself, or the member for Goldstein, the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp), who is now sitting on the front bench-who would be able to name all of the training programs in Australia. There are something like 89 or 90, maybe even more. Some of those are designed to help the unemployed, some are designed for training, some are designed to provide links between high school and tertiary qualifications and some are just mickey mouse courses to recycle unemployed people from one course to another so they can continue to get their unemployment benefits. And that goes on and on. What we need is a rational, structured and objective training mechanism in Australia. It needs to have some semblance of sense. And we will address that. There has been some confusion in this debate about what the member for Goldstein had to say yesterday, and let me tell you. I will read you a little bit of his speech. Mr Martin Ferguson-Have a look at the new bill.",93
136,Mr CHARLES,Unknown,You talked about what he said in his speech on page 9. Read what he said on page 8. He said: The Workplace Relations Act will provide an authority to be able to detennine the proportions of time spent in productive work and training for particular traineeships and apprenticeships developed under the modem Australian apprenticeship and traineeship system. The involvement of an approving authorityAre you listening to this? Mr Martin Ferguson-I've got the definition. Have you seen it? Have a look at it.,94
137,Mr CHARLES,Unknown,"-'-Just listen. Mr Deputy Speaker, ask him to listen. It states: The involvement of an approving authority will ensure fairnessunderstand that word 'fairness'?for both the employer and employee. That is what it is all about, is it not? We want to give young people a break. You talk about the apprenticeship system. Let me tell you that under the previous government apprenticeships and traineeships fell so dramatically that it was not even funny. That is one of the reasons why we have so many unemployed young people. If it were not for the group training scheme-fair dinkum-the number of apprenticeships in this country would be absolutely diabolical. The Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training is trying to create opportunities for young people to participate in the training market, to get structured training off the job and to have jobs where they get paid equitably and fairly for what they do but to give them an opportunity to be employed. Really, if we go down the route of the member for Batman, we will have a commissar for education and training, a commissar for employment and we will put everyone into a box, tell them how to perform and tell them what to do.

NA NA BILL 1996 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Reith, and read a first time. Second Reading",95
139,Mr REITH,Unknown,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. NA Today is an important day for job-seekers, for individual Australian workers and their employers, for trade unions and employer organisations, for industrial tribunals and for the community generally. The bill I introduce today represents a break with a system of industrial relations that has been based on a view that conflict between employer and employee is fundamental to the relationship and that an adversarial process of resolving disputes is appropriate and inevitable. The bill rejects the highly paternalistic presumption that has underpinned the industrial relations system in this country for too long-that employees are not only incapable of protecting their own interests, but even of understanding them, without the compulsory involvement of unions and industrial tribunals. The system of industrial relations which this bill seeks to reform has almost become an end in itself, doing more to protect the interests of those involved in the system, rather than the people the system is supposed to serve. This bill, by contrast, seeks to restore the focus of the system on those who really matter, employees and employers at the workplace and enterprise level. Despite supposedly being designed to help employees, the system this bill seeks to has helped contribute to a long-term decline in workers' living standards in Australia, relative to those in many other countries, while contributing to our unacceptably high level of unemployment. Up until the 1980s, the economic deficiencies of our industrial relations system were largely concealed by the strength of this country's agricultural and minerals sectors. However, the 1980s saw a significant reduction in the capacity of our primary industries to generate the growth in living standards which Australians had come to expect, and the manufacturing sector had proved to be ill-equipped to compete ,on world markets. This resulted in our chronic and growing current account and foreign debt problems. The ALP government eventually responded with a series of structural reforms, such as reductions in protection and deregulation of financial markets. However, labour market reform-the most important type of structural reform needed--came very late in the process, and was entirely inadequate. Throughout the 1980s, the coalition championed the need for major reform. Many on our side contributed to this debate, both parliament and in the wider community. They did so even though they were subject to much vitriol and vilification from the then federal government, which steadfastly defended the centralised system, even as its defects became increasingly obvious to most objective commentators. The introduction of this bill is the final vindication for the reformists amongst whom none stand higher than the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). He has capped off the intellectual debate with his political leadership, has paved the way for the introduction of this bill. History will record that the intellectual debate, the battle of ideas, was finally won with the concession in 1993 by Paul Keating in a major speech to the Institute of Directors where he said that: * Australia needed a model of industrial relations 'which places primary emphasis on bargaining at the workplace level within a framework of minimum standards provided by arbitral tribunals'; * '... compulsorily arbitrated awards and arbitrated wage increases would be there only as a safety net.' * 'The safety net would not be intended to prescribe the actual conditions of work of most employees, but only to catch those unable to make workplace agreements with employers. ' * 'Over time the safety net would inevitably become simpler. We would have fewer awards with fewer clauses.' * 'For most employees and most businesses, wages and conditions would be det-rmined by agreements worked out by the employer, the employees and their union.' * 'These agreements would predominantly be based on improving the productive performance of enterprises, because both employers and employees are coming to understand that only productivity improvements can generate sustainable real wage increases.' It is now notorious that Mr Keating did not have the necessary leadership skills to deliver an industrial relations system along these lines. As happened on so many occasions in the under the Hawke and Keating governments, he buckled under pressure from the ACTU. By delivering on our election policy, Better Pay for Better Work, this bill will deliver the framework for structural reform of the labour market demanded by the imperatives of world competition and warranted by the legitimate expectation of Australians to enjoy improved living standards through higher employment and better paid jobs over time. If anyone has any doubts about the need for which genuine reform of our industrial relations institutions and arrangements, they need go no further than the latest ABS statistics which show: * an intolerable rate of unemployment, at 8.9 per cent (and a disgraceful 27.8 per cent for our youth); * booming current account deficits contributing to our net foreign debt of $185 billion (or almost 40 per cent of GDP); * real wages stagnant or falling over most of the Labor years, with a deteriorating gap between rich and poor; * erratic productivity growth, with industries like the waterfront, that are so critical to our competitiveness, going backwards compared to overseas benchmarks; * industrial disputation, while lower than the horrendous heights which marked so much of the postwar period, is still unacceptably high against the yardstick of our competitors, who have been making greater strides toward cooperative workplace relations; and * finally, every Australian knows that we still experience some of the highest real interest rates in the developed world, a hurdle made so much harder to overcome given the 'black hole' legacy left by Mr Beazley to the tune of some $8 billion in our national finances. Structural rigidities in the labour market are a major contributor to those sorry outcomes. We can and must do better. We know from experience that what we have doesn't work. Australia needs a fresh start. This bill provides just that. Mr Deputy Speaker, this bill is about providing employers and employees with much greater choice about how to regulate their relationships, in a way that accommodates changing societal and economic trends and which is focused on delivering better outcomes rather than propping up outdated institutional arrangements for their own sake, regardless of their adverse effects on the livelihood of everyday Australians. In promoting the cause of flexibility as a legitimate and necessary aim of our policy for the labour market, the coalition's approach to realising that goal also keeps faith with the basic Australian values of ensuring a 'fair go' for all. Ours is not a model that relies on cutting workers' incomes; we saw enough of that under the accord years. Employees' wages will not be reduced by any provision in this bill, whether in respect of awards or agreements. This bill balances the promotion of flexibility with the provision of statutory protections that ensure: * fair dealing, particularly in the areas of termination of employment and the removal of discrimination; * fair competition, by removing monopoly rights and compulsory membership of industrial organisations; * fair agreement-making, underpinned by a set of guaranteed minimum conditions; and * fair compliance arrangements, so that people are held to their commitments, once entered into by agreement. Mr Deputy Speaker, it was because this balance was so relevant to the current and future needs of our nation that the coalition received an undeniable mandate in the last election. Some five million voters judged our policy on its merits and endorsed it. We are returning that vote of confidence by responding, as a matter of priority, in this first session of the parliament, with legislation that does what we promised we would do. Against that benchmark, we are happy for the Democrats to 'keep us honest' when the bill reaches the Senate. NA Since the election, we have been concerned to ensure that our policy would be implemented in the most effective way possible. Accordingly, we have consulted widely with employers and employer organisations; with unions and the ACTU; with state and territory governments; with women's organisations and the churches; and with ethnic, community and welfare groups. We have been open to the views put by all these groups, and from many others who have been directly and indirectly involved in the consultative process, including: those who have made written submissions; representatives on the government's Policy Implementation Taskforce; and a wide range of individual commentators and experts. We have benefited considerably from their suggestions on many policy implementation issues, and this is reflected in the bill that is before the House. But let me make it clear that the fundamentals of the policy itself remain as put to the Australian people on election day. OVERVmW OF THE BILL The principal object of the proposed Workplace Relations Act expresses our intention to establish a framework for cooperative workplace relations which promotes the economic prosperity and welfare of the people of Australia. The object focuses on giving primary responsibility for industrial relations and agreement-making to employers and employees at the enterprise and workplace levels, with the corresponding role for the award system being to provide a safety net of minimum wages and conditions. As a corollary, emphasis is placed on due compliance with awards and agreements, reflecting the responsibilities that properly accompany the provision and negotiation of industrial rights and entitlements. The object also gives priority to ensuring freedom of association, with democratic and accountable employer organisations and trade unions that employers and workers, respectively, are free to join or not join. Finally, object of the proposed act gives expression to the social importance of avoiding discrimination and assisting employees to balance their work and family responsibilities effectively. Mr Deputy Speaker, I would now like to elaborate on some of the key elements of this bill to explain how the government's reforms are to be implemented. Our legislation puts the emphasis on direct workplace relationships, and on the mutual interest of employer and employee in the to success and prosperity of the enterprise. The bill promotes a legislative framework, without unnecessary complexity or unwanted third party intervention. Above all, the legislation is designed to empower employers and employees to make taken into account. decisions about relationships at work, including over wages and conditions, based on their appreciation of their own interests. Unfair Dismissal Mr Deputy Speaker, most fair-minded observers would acknowledge the absolute disaster that was Labor's unfair dismissal laws-interventionist regulation that depressed small business confidence, discouraged investable cause. ment and diverted the attention of industry from its prime task of making workplaces The Award System more efficient and providing more real jobs. The government is replacing Labor's failed arrangements with a new unfair dismissal scheme-a system which provides employees with access to a fair and simple process appeal against dismissal, based on the princicoverage ple of a fair go all round. It * is fair to both employee and employer; * ensures legalism is minimised, while discouraging frivolous and malicious claims; and * is in line with Australia's international obligations. A new jurisdiction will be put in place for the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, empowering it to consider whether a termination of employment was harsh, unjust or unreasonable, and to create new entitlements accordingly, by way of orders, where approthe priate, which will be enforceable in a court. An applicant will be able to be represented by a registered organisation. This jurisdiction will apply only in the traditional federal area of coverage. Terminating employment on certain proscribed grounds will be unlawful, reflecting the current legislation, with the addition of protection against dismissal where an employee fails to sign an Australian workplace agreement. The commission will be required to attempt settle an unfair dismissal claim by concili.ation, and if conciliation is unsuccessful, by arbitration. Where it determines that a remedy is appropriate, the commission will have to consider its possible effect on the viability of the employer's business. This will allow the special circumstances of small business to be The commission will be able to grant reinstatement, and ancillary orders in respect of lost pay, or if reinstatement would be inappropriate, such payment in lieu of reinstatement as the commission thinks appropriate. The commission will also be able to order payment of costs in cases of applications instituted vexatiously or without reasonI now tum to consider the impact of our reforms on the award system. At the outset, let me state that the government has maintained its commitment to ensure that all of employers and employees with federal award will have the choice of remaining on is a scheme that: their awards. However, the role of the commission, the scope of awards, and arrangements for their adjustment, need to be consistent with and reinforce the role of awards as a genuine safety net. This is important for the viability of the wage system-to ensure its capacity to provide safety net protection, to encourage agreement-making and to meet overall economic objectives. The commission's role in relation to wages will focus on the setting of minima-it will not generally be able to arbitrate claims above the minimum safety net. The mechanism by which the commission adjusts safety net rates of pay and other award minima will not be prescribed in the legislation. This will be a matter for the commission to determine, through a review of wage principles, within the framework and objects of the legislation and after hearing the submissions of all the parties. Consistent with the focus of awards on safety net minimum wages and conditions, the commission's jurisdiction, and thus the capacity of the parties, to incorporate matters awards will be confined to certain allowable matters. The bill provides for a full bench of the commission to establish principles relating to the future handling of these matters, as it has done in the past with its existing award jurisdiction. All matters beyond those specified in the legislation should generally be determined at the enterprise or workplace level, whether in formal agreements or informally. However, conciliation will be available with respect to all matters, including agreements. When conciliating, and if requested by the parties, the commission. will be required to make a recommendation by consent to resolve differences, provided it is satisfied that the parties will abide by the recommendation. From the date of commencement of the new act, new awards will not be able to contain matters other than those allowed by the statute. Transitional arrangements will apply whereby parties to existing awards are encouraged and assisted to simplify their awards to focus on the allowable terms and conditions, with other matters addressed by agreement. After 18 months, any disallowed matters remaining in awards will not be enforceable. Such reforms to awards will deliver critical changes that were acknowledged by the previous government as necessary, but which it failed to put into place because of the straitjacket of its accord relationship with the ACTU. The commission will also be reviewing awards to ensure that provisions are more flexible and geared to the needs of individual enterprises and workplaces. In particular, restrictions on regular part-time work will be removed from the award system. Such part-time work, with pro rata entitlements to the conditions available to full-time workers, and reasonable predictability in the manner in which hours are worked, will be a boon for many workers who, for reasons such as family responsibilities, are either unable or do not wish to work full-time. With awards concentrating on safety net minimum standards, new paid rates awards in will not have a role in the wage system. Existing paid rates awards will be subject to the award simplification process applying to awards generally and, over time and after consultation, will be treated in the same way as minimum rates awards. All current legislative provisions relating to paid rates awards will be repealed and the commission will no longer have the power to make such awards. Current entitlements for the allowable matters under such paid rates awards will be protected, with any changes being subject to the commission's wage principles. It is expected that parties to these awards will make agreements that determine the detailed remuneration and working arrangements to apply, as most have done to date via certified agreements. Because awards will be simplified, there will be more choice about how work is to be organised at the workplace. With simplified awards, employers and employees will find themselves talking to each other more about how they would like to organise, to their mutual benefit, matters that, until now, have been dictated to them by the award. Junior rates of pay will be retained to protect the jobs of thousands of young people whose employment prospects would be jeopardised if they were abolished from awards, as Labor intended. However, as appropriate, support is provided for improved training arrangements through trainee wages in awards. Provision for supported wages for employees with disabilities is also made. Agreement-making Under this bill, the options for agreementmaking will be significantly expanded and simplified. Employers and employees in the federal jurisdiction will be able to choose whether they want informal over-award arrangements, or whether they want to formalise their agreements. For those who want formalised individual agreements, we have provided Australian workplace agreements, A W As. If they prefer formalised collective agreements, they will be able to choose certified agreements, CAs, made with unions or made directly between employers and employees. For those who want agreements under a state jurisdiction, we are providing access to such agreements, bearing in mind that it is a matter of consent for the parties they choose to go that way. The bill does not discriminate in favour of one form of agreement over another-collective or individual, union or non-union. These are matters for decision by employers and employees, according to their own circumstances and their own perception of how their interests are best served. Both Australian workplace agreements and certified agreements have been designed to meet the objectives of placing the primary responsibility for industrial relations with employers and employees at the workplace, and reducing the complexities imposed by the current system. However, agreement-making under the government's legislation will be subject to a set of statutory minimum conditions to ensure due protection for workers. (i) Minimum Conditions Both AWAs and CAs will have to meet these minimum conditions. Consistent with our election guarantee, pay must be no less than that prescribed under the relevant awardwhether you are a regular worker, a casual or a pieceworker. Other guaranteed minima cover conditions relating· to annual leave; personal/carer's leave; parental leave; long service leave; equal pay for work of equal value; and jury service. (ii) Australian Workplace Agreements (AWAs) A major innovation in the bill is the establishment of AW As, allowing agreements to be reached directly between an employer and his or her employee(s). The government accepts that greater emphasis on flexibility and selfregulation under AW As must be accompanied by appropriate employee protections and sanctions against those who abuse the flexibility we are providing. AWAs will be formalised simply, by being filed with the Employment Advocate, EA. The EA will be an independent statutory officer whose powers and functions are laid down in the legislation. The Office of the Employment Advocate will be established as a distinct entity to facilitate the operation of A WAs and foster proper understanding and application of the opportunities, rights and if obligations provided for by the new act. Advice to employees on statutory entitlements and services of the EA will also be required by the legislation, and the EA will provide employers with readily accessible information and pro forma material for this purpose. This will enhance access to the system for thousands of individuals who have understandably steered clear of it, because they don't have the time to waste interpreting complexities that have been generated over the years by the system. Procedures for filing AW As will be straightforward. A simple declaration will be made by the employer that the statutory requirements for the AW A have been metmost notably, that the AWA provides terms and conditions which are no less favourable than the statutory minimum conditions. The EA will not vet the agreement before it comes into effect, and all agreements will be confidential to the parties, as they should be. There is no conspiracy of secrecy here. Current overaward arrangements, which are not tested by any third party, can't be accused of secrecy simply because they are not subject to public disclosure. Complaints relating to non-observance of AW As, including breaches of the minim-m conditions, may be taken to the EA for investigation, and following investigation and conciliation, can be taken to a court. Thus, if a worker has not received any of the legislated minimum conditions-or any other entitlements in the agreement-and if that complaint is substantiated, employers will be liable $10,000 penalty for breach of the agreement, as well as whatever recovery of entitlements is due to the employee. The use of duress to obtain an AWA will, where a complaint is upheld, lead to its invalidation, appropriate orders by the court, including rectification by the parties, and/or a penalty. The EA will be empowered to investigate complaints of duress in the making of AWAs. In the course of reaching AWAs, there will be a right to take protected action. However, there will be no such right during the period of operation of an AW A. We are relying on a range of constitutional powers for AWAs, particularly the corporations power. Provision is made for the states, by complementary legislation, to expand the coverage of AWAs to employers and employees outside the scope of those powers. (iii) Certified Agreements (CAs) The current certified agreement provisions are being revised substantially. Transitional arrangements apply to cover existing agreements, including Enterprise Flexibility ments, provision for which is being repealed. We will again rely on a range of constitutional powers to support the new provisions. New simplified arrangements will make CAs more accessible and able to be finalised more efficiently. An agreement will be able to apply to all employees to which an agreement applies within the enterprise, subject to majority endorsement. The majority approval requirement will obviate the need for the present complex consultation requirements. CAs may also be made directly with employees. This mechanism will replace Labor's failed enterprise flexibility agreements, of which there have been few, because the provisions invite an intrusive and unwarranted role for unions. If a union wishes to make an agreement, or to participate in negotiations as a principal party or on behalf of members, it must have a member in the enterprise concerned whose industrial interests it can represent. In the case of agreements made directly between an employer and employees, a union will be able to represent any member in discussions with to a the employer and, if it so chooses, may become a party to the final agreement if a member so requests-although the union may choose not to be bound by the final agreement. However, the agreement must still be approved by a majority of the employees to be covered, whether or not a union is involved. Special provisions will accommodate greenfields sites, so that agreements can be struck in advance of a business becoming operational. Given the enterprise-based focus of the agreement system, it is appropriate that the capacity for multi-employer agreements to be certified should be tightly circumscribed and involve testing against the public interest by a full bench of the commission. The consent of all employers and the majority of the employees to be covered by the agreement will be required. Protected action will not be available in the making of.such agreements. The provisions relating to protected action for bargaining for single business CAs will be retained, in modified form, but any industrial action during the specified period of operation agree- of an agreement will be prohibited. Prior to certification, the commission will test agreements to ensure the statutory minima are met. In that regard, as is the case with Labor's no disadvantage test, the minimum pay guarantee may be satisfied on a collective basis. Thus, the guarantee may be met for each employee of a particular kind covered by an agreement if the commission considers that, when considered overall, the wages payable to all employees of that kind under the agreement satisfy the minimum pay requirement. This will facilitate the ready handling of certification of agreements by the commission. In agreements with cashed-up penalty rates and annualised salaries, for example, the minimum pay requirement will be satisfied if earnings under the agreement at least match what could reasonably be expected to have otherwise applied under the award at the time of certification. There would be no ongoing test against the statutory minima, unless provided for by the agreement. The government has also responded to concerns raised by various women's groups and community organisations by retaining absence of discrimination as a precondition to certification. Finally, the bill contains a requirement for a triennial report on agreement-making to be produced, covering the operation of AWAs and CAs. Freedom of Association and Organisational Arrangements I now turn to address the key issue of freedom of association and the role of registered organisations under the bill. Among the fundamental principles underpinning the government's industrial relations policy, are the principle of freedom of associationincluding the choice whether or not to be in a union or employer organisation-and the principle that all Australians be treated ly before the law. Under the government's proposed legislation, employees will be able to make choices about union membership and, if they wish to be in a union, they will be able to join any union whose eligibility rules cover them. They could set up an enterprise union of their own. They could establish a union with special skills and service delivery to suit them, without artificial limits that protect current union monopolies. If they believe the 'super union' which covers them is too distant from its grass roots, they can vote to establish an enterprise branch, or vote to support disamalgamation. The commission will be denied jurisdiction over preference in employment. Existing award provisions providing for preference will cease to have effect. Under the bill, individuals, including independent contractors, will be protected against coercion to join or not to join an organisation or to cease to be a member of an organisation. Closed shops will be abolished. The government is not anti-union, and our legislation is not an attack on unions. The legislation will assist unions who are seeking to be effective in providing a good service to their members. Far from withering away, entrepreneurial unions will succeed in this environment. Some in the union movement know this is their future and are already responding by looking at innovative approaches to providing services for their members. I support this development as an early and promising response to the new environment of choice that lies in front of us and is supported by this bill. To support that development and to overcome the union monopoly situation conferred by the current act, the 'conveniently belong' restrictions on registration and changes to eligibility rules will be repealed. The new provisions will assist in the establishment of new unions, including enterprise unions. The existing requirement that, to be registered, a union must be capable of being a party to an interstate dispute, will not apply. The minimum registration requirement will be lowered, from 100 to 20 members. The equalmaximum annual income for organisations to be subject to less demanding financial accounting requirements will be raised from $10,000 to $20,000. Mindful of the possibility of adverse effects for innocent third parties from greater competition between unions, the bill provides powers to the commission to make orders about the representative rights of organisations. This will allow it to make orders to deal with disputes between registered unions over the representation of workers where there are actual or imminent harmful effects on an employer's operations. In making any orders, the commission will have to take account of the views of employees involved, and the effect on the operations of the employer. Provision in the bill to allow for the disamalgamation of federally registered unions recognises that there may be situations where amalgamations turn out to be unsatisfactory. Amalgamations occurred after 1991 in the context of pressured circumstances-for example, new provisions of the Industrial Relations Reform Act 1993 designed to force small unions into such relationships. There should be an avenue for members to deal with unsustainable situations where disamalgamation provides a basis for more effectively representing their interests. Accordingly, and subject to a majority being in favour of dis amalgamation, the Federal Court will be able to approve the disamalgamation and make appropriate orders about the fair division of the assets and liabilities, and any other matters necessary to be dealt with t.o implement the disamalgamation fairly. In the legislation, and reflectpowers ing the new objects that are proposed, we have moved to strengthen the powers of the industrial registrar to ensure that organisations meet the financial accountability and reporting requirements of the act. Consistent with our view that uninvited intervention by unions in workplaces should be addressed, the current provisions in the act relating to the rights of unions to enter workplaces are restricted under our bill to unions with members who have requested them to visit their workplace. Finally, the Trade Union Training Authority Act 1975 is also being repealed through this bill, allowing for the winding up of the authority'S operations. The government considers that it should be the responsibility of unions and their members, rather than the taxpayer, to provide the wherewithal for union training. Compliance The existing compliance arrangements in the federal industrial legislation .to not a fair balance and have been overhauled. Consistent with the generally accepted principles of collective bargaining, industrial action will be permitted in certain circumstances. Provided conditions are met, there will be a right to take such action and a right to lock out in relation to bargaining for a single business CA or an AWA. However, there will be effective legal remedies available to those who suffer harm from illegitimate industrial action. (Extension of time granted) Secondary boycotts are not an acceptable form of industrial action. Accordingly, meaningful secondary boycott provisions will be restored to the Trade Practices Act 1974, and the relevant provisions of the Industrial Relations Act 1988 will be repealed. The current provisions effectively allow unions to hold sectors of the economy to ransom for three days at a time. This is inimical to an internationally competitive economy. The commission will be able to conciliate where a federally registered union is involved in a boycott, but there will be no requirement for a specific period of conciliation before legal action may be initiated by firms which are affected by boycotts. The commission will continue to have to facilitate bargaining for CAs and to suspend or terminate the bargaining period, particularly where genuine bargaining is not occurring or where there is risk of serious harmful effects for the economy or the community. In handling the latter case involving critical situations, the powers of the commission will be closely circumscribed, emphasising the need for conciliation to be exhausted before any consideration is given to arbitration. Any such arbitration will generally be confined and be undertaken by a full bench consistent with principles established by the commission, and taking account of how productivity might be improved in the business concerned. Industrial action other than for genuine bargaining for agreements is not compatible with the norms of the system and will not be protected. Existing restrictions and delays inserted by the Industrial Relations Reform Act 1993 on access to remedies for such strike industrial action will be removed. The commission will have powers to give directions to stop or prevent unprotected industrial action. This will apply to any matters within its jurisdiction, including interorganisational disputes-for example, demarcation-representation disputes. The Federal Court of Australia will be able to enforce such directions by injunctions and will be able to award damages and sequester funds. Parties suffering from illegal industrial action will have access to effective legal redress, including injunctions and/or damages. Industrial action that continues in breach of such directions from the court will be in contempt of court. The commission will also continue to be able to exercise its existing powers in relation to unprotected industrial action-that is, stand down provisions; refraining from hearing matters where a party is not complying with an award, order, direction or recommendation; suspension or cancellation of awards; and orders in relation to industrial action in the Commonwealth and territory public sectors. Non-compliance with an order will provide a new ground for deregistration. Deregistration matters will be dealt with by the Federal Court. It will be unlawful: for an employer to pay strike pay; a union, or its representatives, to take industrial action to pursue strike pay; or for an employee to accept strike pay. Minimum Entitlements In addition to provisions relating to unfair dismissal, a range of other minimum entitlements provisions, dependent on the external affairs power, were introduced by the Industrial Relations Refonn Act 1993. They concern minimum wages, equal remuneration for work of equal value, termination of employment, and parental leave. As each jurisdiction has adequate machinery to deal with minimum wages and equal remuneration, these provisions are redundant and will be repealed. The principle of equal pay for work of equal value is enshrined in the legislation as a factor in setting minimum award wages by the commission and as a minimum condition for AW As and CAs. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission will continue to provide the means for complaints against alleged discrimination in the overaward area to be dealt with. The Role of the Commission and Institutional Arrangements Mr Speaker, at this point and before concluding, let me put to flight any suggestion that the government is, through this bill, diminishing the standing of the commission. Certainly, the commission's role will change, as must that of any institution for it to adapt to the dynamics of society and operate in a global economy. However, the commission will continue to play an important role in Australian industrial relations. This may be readily appreciated, simply by reviewing aspects of its role, which include: . its new unfair dismissal jurisdiction; the need to establish new principles for the simplification and review of current awards and to govern the handling of the allowable award matters; arbitrating safety net adjustments, taking account of the needs of the low paid; managing competition between unions where this harms the business, by determining representation rights; mediating and conciliating for positive outcomes from agreement making, including through recommendations by consent; handling, including the possible arbitration, of disputes where all attempts to reach an agreement have failed and the dispute threatens serious harm to the community or the economy; active involvement in the resolution of disputes in the award area, and where the disputes procedures in agreements empower it to play such a role; and ensuring compliance with awards and agreements, and supervising recourse to protected action and dealing appropriately with unlawful action. The bill also introduces certain complementary institutional changes to give the commission's operations greater flexibility and effectiveness. These are: the obligation on the President to establish industry panels is being removed and the President, in directing the business of the commission, is being required to have regard to efficiencies and effective handling of the commission's work that may be achieved by complementary arrangements with state tribunals (for example, in cases involving transfer of jurisdiction); and the bargaining division is being abolished, in light of the much clearer delineation of awards and agreements and the inefficiencies which the current provisions have caused for the commission. In keeping with the government's election commitments, the bill provides that the jurisdiction of the Industrial Relations Court of Australia be transferred to the Federal Court of Australia. The detailed arrangements for this have been developed in conjunction with the Commonwealth Attorney-General and in consultation with the chief justices of both courts. The bill protects judicial independence and preserves the position of all judicial and quasi-judicial office holders. All judges already have commissions on both courts and the judicial registrars will be appointed as judicial registrars of the Federal Court. NA In essence, this bill meets the commitment which we made to the Australian people 2 March this year-a commitment to put the focus of industrial relations policy on the workplace. This bill has as a key premise that the simplification of industrial relations processes and formalities is an essential part of our to empower individual employers and emindustries ployees. People will make different between all the available options and we welcome that. This is an enabling systemsubstantial not a prescriptive system. It gives people our workplaces the opportunity to design vicinity arrangements which: first, suit their competitive circumstances and customer requirements so that their enterprise has the best chance of achieving high productivity and prospering; and second, are best tailored to employee needs-enabling more innovative work styles and working patterns that balance their work and family responsibilities more effectively. Such arrangements will deliver more jobs, better work and better pay for Australians because they are more productive, returns also for investors. That is fundamentally what reform of workplace relations this country must be all about. It's what this bill is all about. I commend the government's proposals to the House .and I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill. Debate (on motion by Mr MCMullan) adjourned. AIRPORTS BILL 1996 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Sharp, and read a first time. Second Reading",95
140,Mr SHARP,Unknown,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. Government's Approach to Airports The government recognises that airports are on vitally important to the communities and regions which they serve. In circumstances where airport usage is increasing rapidly, passenger and freight users need airports which are operating efficiently, are responsive to user requirements and which deliver the services necessary to meet the requirements aim of the Australian tourism, export and service which depend on air transport to choices compete in world markets. At the same time, airports can generate adverse impacts, particularly for in the communities located in the immediate of airports. The government is acutely aware of the aircraft noise issues related to Sydney and Sydney West in particular. Our election commitments therefore included that: Sydney and Sydney West would be withdrawn from the airport leasing process until there is a solution to the aircraft noise issues there the east-west runway would be opened a full EIS would be undertaken on Sydney West airport. We have already taken decisive steps to deal with these issues, and processes are under way to ensure permanent solutions to aircraft with better noise issues in Sydney. In essence this bill and the Airports (Transiin tional) Bill 1996 provide the legislative framework for granting of leases to airport specific companies and the transfer of assets and obligations associated with those airport operations from the Federal Airports Corporation to the companies. They restart a process which stopped under the previous government's heavy-handed approach to Sydney airport and its role in the sales process. We have excised Sydney and Sydney West from the first tranche of sales. The process can thus recommence. The bills before the House substantially match those previously put forward by the Labor Party. The sales process demands continuity, if it is to proceed quickly. Given the familiarity of the House with the basic provisions of the regime previously proposed, I will run through the essential provisions and then concentrate on the improvements we have made. These improvements meet our election commitments which reflect the interests of airport users; the interests of local communities; and the interests of bidders. Government Airports Policy The government's decision to establish long-term leasehold arrangements at federal airports will improve the efficiency of airport investment and operations in the interests of users and the general community. Leasing of the airports will facilitate innovative management and greater local involvement and input to decisions on their operation and development. Airports deliver highly specialised services to the Australian economy. There will be opportunities for greater autonomy of individual airports post leasing and for airports to cater better for the particular markets which they serve and therefore to meet the needs of local and regional economies. Aviation regulatory arrangements Leasing of airports does not change the regulatory arrangements in other areas of the government's aviation policy nor the fundamental roles played by the individual agencies. The Civil Aviation Safety Authority will continue to have primary responsibility for air safety in Australia. Airservices Australia will continue to provide facilities and services required for the operation of the national airways system. Regulatory provisions authorise the establishment and monitoring of quality of service performance indicators and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission scrutiny to back up these aspects of the business. With the advent of leasing, the government is also aware that significant market power will move from the public sector to the private sector. The government is thus committed to putting into place an appropriate regulatory framework to protect the interests of current and future airport users and local communities. At present, the Federal Airports Corporation operates as a self-regulating government authority in respect of land use, planning and building and on-airport pollution control. Post leasing, these responsibilities will need to be assumed by the government itself to ensure appropriate public interest regulation of the activities of airport lessees and other users. As well as providing a regulatory regime which can replace those regulatory functions currently performed by the FAC, the Airports Bill establishes appropriate transparency and reporting obligations on airport operators. In summary the provisions ensure: - majority Australian ownership; - a five per cent limit on airline, and associate, ownership; - environment strategy requirements; - financial transparency. These provisions apply to 'core regulated airports' and other airports specified in the regulations. Core regulated airports are: Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, Adelaide, Darwin, Hobart, Launceston, Townsville, Coolangatta, Canberra, Alice Springs and Sydney West. There are also provisions relating to demand management, protection of airspace around airports and other on-airport activities. Airport regulation-post leasing I tum now to the essential provisions of the Airports Bill. Leasing and management of airports The bill establishes several key rules for the leasing of Australia's major international and interstate gateways including: - the lessee must be a company specifically established to operate the airport; - the terms of the initial leases are to be 50 years, with or without an option for renewal for a further 49 years; - only one company will be able to lease an airport. The bill will make it mandatory for joint ownership by the same airport-operator company of Sydney and Sydney West airports. The bill allows for Sydney and Sydney West to be structured as separate companies and leased together. Other airports will be leased separately. Current leasing arrangements for airlines and other on-airport businesses ferred with existing obligations and benefits, in accordance with nonnal practice. Restrictions on ownership of airport-operator companies We will be ensuring that airport-operator companies are majority Australian owned with central management to be exercised from within Australia and a majority of directors being either Australian citizens and/or residents. The airport-operator company will be subject to the following ownership controls: - a 49 per cent limit on foreign ownership of the airport-operator company; - a five per cent limit on airline; and associments ates, ownership of the airport-operator company. . The bill includes significant anti-avoidance grams. provisions to cover schemes to circumvent the leasing, management and ownership rules. The government, in recognition of the excision of Sydney/Sydney West airports from the first set of sales, has not set down cross ownership provisions in the bill. Such restricadopt tions could reduce the number of potential bidders for the first tranche airports. Land use, planning and building controls There needs to be clarity and certainty on processes which allow government and community input, and a greater compatibility between on and off airport development. Accordingly, each regulated airport operator will be required to establish: - an airport master plan-essentially a long term land use plan to cover a 20-year period; major development plans for projects, for example, runway, terminal development, at airports which can, where significant environmental impacts result, require appropriate environmental impact assessment processes as is currently the case; and - airport operators will also need approval for new building activities on airport sites. Master and major development plans, and environment strategies will be subject to will be trans- ministerial approval. The bill ensures that the airport-operator company undertakes a 'public comment' process providing the opportunity for all interested parties to comment on master plans, major development plans and environment strategies. The views of airport users, such as the airlines and other tenants, state and local governments, will be a significant part of the comment process. Environment management Under no circumstances will airport lessees or other persons on airports be able to escape environmental obligations post leasing. The development of airport regulatory arrangepost leasing supplements the operation of existing legislation and regulations which cover the curfew, runway operations, flight path and noise acquisition/insulation proAn important requirement imposed on airport operators will be the need to develop and implement approved environment strategies. These strategies will include specific measures which the airport lessee proposes to to prevent, control or reduce environmental impacts associated with airport operations. In developing such strategies, operators must have due regard to public comment requirements and report on consultations held with state and local governments, airport users and others. Environmental strategies proposed by airport operators will be subject to ministerial approval. The bill will also provide the ability to make regulations on environmental standards and impose requirements to be complied with, in relation to the prevention or minimisation of poIIution at airport sites. Significant penalties will apply to breaches of these standards backed by the ability for court injunctions if necessary to ensure regulatory compliance. Monitoring and remedying breaches of environmental standards is also provided for under the bilI. Accounts and reports of airport-operator company Reporting and accounting requirements within the bill and the use of common terminology will facilitate the comparison of airport performance in a transparent manner. Airport operators will be required to publish annually reports on their operations as determined by the ACCC. Pricing and quality of service The government's aim is to ensure there is no abuse of the potential market power of airport operators. Our election commitment was to cap landing charges at the airports using a CPI-X system. The necessary prices oversight can be undertaken by the ACCC. The government is giving careful consideration to the detailed pricing oversight arrangements. Future airport operations The bilI places a restraint on the Commonwealth not to close or vary airport leases without the consent of the lessee. Under the proposed airports regime, Australia will require airport operators to meet international air service obligations and, if necessary, specific regulations can be made to this effect. This provision can cover all major airports in Australia as weII as those currently operated by the FAC. Regulations can be made under the bill to control on-airport activities including liquor, commercial trading, vehicle movements, gambling and smoking. The government intends to discuss the control of these onairport activities with the states and territories. In the absence of regulations being made by the Commonwealth, state/territory legislation would apply. Protection of airspace An important protection for the current and future operation of airports is established in the biII by provisions relating to the protection of airspace. The biII provides that, if it is in the interests of safety, efficiency or regularity of air transport operations, a declaration of prescribed airspace can be made. New Provisions The Airports BilI 1996 gives effect to the government's election commitment to access provisions for new airlines, and provides more certainty and clarity in several key areas. Access for New Entrant Airlines Provisions have been included in the bill on access for new entrants which will trigger the access provisions of the national competition policy reforms. Airport operators will have to satisfy the ACCC on how they intend to provide access for civil aviation operations, or be deemed a 'declared facility' for the purposes of these services. It is the government's intention to maximise the opportunity for commercial negotiation to solve access issues, but the ACCC may take an arbitration role if negotiation is unsuccessful. This approach will apply at the core regulated airports-that is, the major 12 FAC airports. Of course, the government will maintain its discretion to introduce demand management schemes-thus access provided would be subject to the demand management provisions of this bilI. Status of FAC Master Plans The Airports Bill provisions require ministerial approval of airport master plans, which relate to a period of 20 years. These provisions are designed to provide a very high level of public consultation. There is a provision, too, which will allow the new airport operator to adopt an FAC master plan for the airport as its own draft master plan, but this plan cannot be approved without complying with the public comment provisions of the bill. Demand management Demand management is a power essential to ensuring our election commitment to cap movements at Sydney's Kingsford Smith airport can be enforced, should circumstances so require. Importantly, we will allow airport operators to provide their input into any decisions, but the ultimate decision remains with the government. Given the importance of the potential use of demand management powers for the airport operator, the bill includes the opportunity for the airport operator to provide the minister with a submission for consideration before demand management measures are introduced at an airport. Explanatory Statements A small number of ministerial decisions provided for in the bill are not subject to review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, given that the minister is the appropriate final arbiter in these areas of public interest and regulatory control. To assist with transparency in the exercise of these discretionary powers the bill requires the minister to table in parliament a statement when exercising these powers, except where disclosure could prejudice substantially the commercial interests of an affected party. Rescue and firefighting services The bill includes provision for Airservices Australia to generally oversee the provision of rescue and firefighting services at federal airports. There is a need for flexibility in circumstances where these services can be more efficiently provided, working to standards set by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and with relevant equipment and training. The bill therefore enables the minister to approve these services at federal airports. Definition of a Major Development Major development approval provisions are included primarily to allow all such developments to which airport operators or other parties are committed to be examined for their environmental impact. The bill now before the House provides that the definition of major airport developments encompasses, as well as passenger terminals, all proposed new buildings over $10 million and other significant developments. Defence The bill also provides for priority of access to airports for Defence related purposes and for emergency and disaster relief. Regulations While more certainty and clarity has been provided in the bill, regulations will still play an important part in the final regulatory framework. I intend to ensure that draft regulations will be provided for consultation and comment before finalisation. In this cooperative and responsible way, the best outcomes can be achieved for government, the travelling public, potential airport operators and investors and the community at large. Conclusion The Airports Bill 1996 will form the central part of the regulatory oversight of the operations at Australia's major airports post leasing. The leasing of airports represents an important part of the government's transport reform program. The government's Airports Bill 1996 and companion Airports Transitional Bill 1996 will allow the leasing to proceed swiftly and with strong protection of the public interest. The government's airport reforms will provide a significant boost to employment and investment in the Australian economy. I present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Ms Macklin) adjourned. AIRPORTS (TRANSITIONAL) BILL 1996 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Sharp, and read a first time. Second Reading",105
141,Mr SHARP,Unknown,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The sale of long-term leases over airports currently operated by the Federal Airports Corporation, FAC, forms an important part of this government's privatisation program. The government is confident that the leasing process for the federal airports offers a number of long-term benefits to the Australian people. The decision to sell long-term leases offers benefits to airport users and the community as a whole. The leasing process should lead to further improvements in the operating efficiency and quality of service of the airports by exposing them to private sector disciplines. It will also provide an opportunity for the funds of Australians to be productively employed in the provision of national infrastructure through the involvement of superannuation and investment managers. The provision of airport infrastructure has traditionally been considered the responsibility of government due to the large amount of capital required. However, today, Australia's capital markets have reached a level of maturity and sophistication capable of supporting the evolving infrastructure requirements of airports. The Commonwealth's involvement in the provision of such infrastructure will no longer be necessary given the protection to public interest considerations afforded by the proposed regulatory regime of the Airports Bill 1996. The primary purpose of this bill is to put into place a framework to facilitate leasing of all federal airports effectively as ongoing businesses under a two-stage sales process. It is proposed that Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth airports will be included in the first phase leasehold sales. Adelaide will also be added to the first tranche consistent with our election commitment, subject to decisions to be taken in the budget. The leasing of Sydney and Sydney West airports will be deferred .pending resolution of noise issues at Sydney airport and an environmental impact study being conducted on Sydney West airport. In the meantime, consideration will be given to how best to position Sydney and Sydney West airports for future sale. The bill provides for the transfer land and other assets from the FAC to the Commonwealth; the granting of leases over the airports and transfer of associated assets to individual airport companies; and the orderly treatment of the FAC's debts during the sales process. Provision has also been made in the bill for the transfer of airport staff employed by the FAC to the airport companies. The companion bill, the Airports Bill 1996, will establish the regulatory regime for airports post leasing. This regulatory regime is designed to improve the efficiency of airport operations while ensuring the protection of airport user and community interests. Leasing the airports permits the government to retain some control over the land on which the airports are located. The long term of the lease will ensure that sales proceeds are similar to sale under freehold title. The sale of long-term leases is expected to produce a significant net offset to outlays in the forthcoming financial years. Provision has been made in the bill to allow for the orderly disposal of the FAC's assets and facilitate and account for the leasing process. The transactions associated with these provisions are expected to be budget neutral. As honourable members would appreciate, it would not be appropriate for the government to disclose details of expected proceeds from the leasing of the airports, as it is likely this would influence the outcome of the sale process, possibly reducing proceeds. As I have indicated, a number of measures designed to facilitate the leasing of the federal airports are contained in the bill now before the House. These measures provide for the land and associated assets of the FAC to be transferred to the Commonwealth, as well as provide for the Commonwealth to grant a lease over land at a particular airport to a company referred to as an airport lessee company. Following this, the bill provides the government with a flexible disposal strategy to grant an airport lease to a company either established by the Commonwealth or the purchaser. In both instances when the lease is granted, the FAC's contractual rights, obligations and liabilities are transferred to the of airport airport lessee company. The bill also provides for airport staff to transfer to the airport lessee companies at the time a lease is granted over the relevant airport. The bill also contains provisions to enable transfer of accrued benefits and leave entitlements post-sale. These provisions are designed to ensure fair and consistent treatment of staff. To ensure that state and territory governments receive duties to which they are entitled on sale transactions which take place in their state or territory, the sale of shares in airport lessee companies or the sale of leases over the airports will be subject to state and territory taxes and stamp duties. The bill does, however, provide for the transfer of the lease or assets that take place while the airport lessee company is owned by the Commonwealth to be exempt from stamp duty. This exemption does not cover the sale by the Commonwealth of its shares in the company, nor the transfer of the lease or assets to a company where that transfer takes place after sale time. A number of taxation provisions have been provided for in the bill to ensure that both the purchasers and existing lessees of the FAC are not disadvantaged from a taxation perspective. The government has adopted these provisions in respect of transactions between the F AC, the Commonwealth and the airport lessee company to ensure that the tax effect of the transactions would be the same as if it were a sale by the FAC in the private marketplace. Provisions have also been made in the bill to deal with the FAC's debt, which comprises both Commonwealth and non-Commonwealth . debt. These provisions, along with the existing provisions in the FAC's statute, provide the government flexibility to deal with the FAC's debts in the most appropriate manner. In managing the FAC's debt during the sale process, the government can assure honourable members that the FAC bondholders' interests will be taken into account. The bill also provides for the treatment of the debt during the sale process to be properly recorded in the Commonwealth's accounts. Following the leasing of the major federal airports, the FAC head office will continue to have a role in overseeing the management of the remaining federal airports prior to their leasing in the second phase of the sale process. These second phase airports present specific regional and administrative issues which will need to be addressed prior to their lease. Among these are the joint user airports at Canberra, Darwin and Townsville, which are jointly operated by the FAC and the Department of Defence. The development of new operating arrangements with Defence will be required before the civil facilities at these airports can be leased. It is expected that a number of the second phase airports which have been unprofitable in the past should prove commercially viable under private ownership through cost reductions and improved revenues. The government will examine options to secure the future of the remaining few airports that may prove to be commercially non-viable by taking into account the specific financial characteristics of each airport as well as regional interests and concerns. This bill is intended to provide a framework for the sale of leases over the airports currently operated by the Federal Airports Corporation. This bill and the companion Airports Bill 1996 are designed to promote the most efficient operation and maintenance of Australia's airport infrastructure, while ensuring that the benefits of increased efficiency are passed on to airport users and the community as a whole. The government is confident that these arrangements will ensure a fair return from the airports while allowing it to divest itself of a function in which its involvement is no longer essential. I present the explanatory memorandum . Debate (on motion by Ms Macklin) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT (NEWLY ARRIVED RESIDENT'S WAITING PERIODS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 1996 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Ruddock, and read a first time. Second Reading",109
142,Mr RUDDOCK,Unknown,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. A 26-week newly arrived resident's waiting period for certain social security and other payments has operated for several years. Refugees and humanitarian migrants are exempt from this requirement. · The government expects that new entrants to Australia should provide for their own support during their first two years, 104 weeks, in Australia and, as a result, announced as part of its 1996 election policy commitments that the newly arrived resident's waiting period would be so extended. This bill implements that commitment. As a general rule, a newly arrived resident's waiting period of 104 weeks will apply to migrants, except for refugee or humanitarian migrants, immediate family members of refugees and humanitarian migrants at the time that the refugee or humanitarian migrant arrived in Australia or existing holders of subclass 820 visas, who arrive in Australia on or after 1 April 1996 or who are granted permanent residence on or after I April 1996, and who wish to claim certain social security benefits such as jobsearch allowance or sickness allowance. In the case of some other social security and other payments, the 104week waiting period will operate in respect of certain migrants entering Australia from the day of royal assent. The 26-week newly arrived resident's waiting period will continue to apply to migrants who had arrived in Australia and been granted permanent residence before 1 April 1996. A newly arrived resident's waiting period will apply to the following payments: carer pension; disability wage supplement; widow allowance, excluding cases where the woman has 10 years residence at some time prior to claiming payment or where both the claimant and her former partner were Australian residents at the time when they separated, became divorced or her partner died; jobsearch allowance; newstart allowance; mature age allowance paid under part 2.12B of the Social Security Act 1991; sickness allowance; special benefit except for those situations where a migrant's circumstances have changed significantly following their arrival in Australia, and for reasons beyond their control; partner allowance; maternity allowance; parenting allowance; child disability allowance; double orphan pension; mobility allowance; and youth training allowance. In addition, a newly arrived resident's waiting period will also be imposed for the seniors health card, health care cards under the disadvantaged persons scheme and for the payment of more than the minimum standard family payment rate.",111
143,Mr KERR,Unknown,Disgraceful!,112
144,Mr RUDDOCK,Unknown,"Well, that is in accordance with the commitment that was made. Further refinements to the operation of some of the newly arrived resident's waiting periods will ensure that: the existing exemption is removed for newly .arrived migrants who, immediately prior to their arrival, were members of a couple and whose partner has been an Australian resident for at least 26 weeks prior to their arrival; the waiting period will commence upon arrival in Australia or grant of permanent residence, whichever is the later; and except for cases stated above relating to widow allowance, the waiting period will be extended by' whatever period or periods a person is absent from Australia, if the person leaves Australia after their waiting period has commenced. The changes to the newly arrived resident's waiting periods in this bill are modest and reasonable and will ensure that taxpayers only pay for those in need. As an adjunct to the changes, the government is reviewing sponsorship arrangements with a view to ensuring that anyone who sponsors a migrant should provide financial support for that person before any calls are made on the taxpayer. The bill will also implement legislation aimed at streamlining information gathering from third parties and clarify that income data for different financial years may be used in a single data-matching program. Section 1307 of the Social Security Act 1991 and section 346 of the Student and Youth Assistance Act 1973 allow the Secretary to the Department of Social Security to require a person-usually employers and other third parties-to give information about a class of persons with a view to: detecting cases in which amounts of pension, benefit or allowance have been paid when they should not have been paid; and verifying the qualification of persons who made claims for those pensions, benefits and allowances. Both sections define the type of information that may be sought. Currently, information about when people start and end their employment may not be sought under sections 1307 or 346. The result is that employers are often faced with having to respond to a request for information under section 1307 or 346 and then having to deal with a follow-up request authorised under another section of those acts if, on the basis of the initial advice provided by them, it appears to the Department of Social Security that there has been an overlap in payment of a social security payment or youth training allowance and employment. The government wishes to reduce the paperwork burden on business. To that end, it would be more efficient if only one request had to be made to employers. It would also be beneficial from an individual's viewpoint. In many cases, the initial provision of more information about a person would confirm that the person was legitimately entitled to a payment and so there would be no need to undertake a follow-up that might, quite unjustifiably, result in employers drawing adverse inferences about a person. The bill also serves to make a minor amendment to the Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Act 1990 so as to put beyond doubt the ability of using Australian Taxation Office income data for different financial years in a single data-matching program cycle. It would ensure, for example, that income data in respect of the 1994-95 financial year could be used so as to review the entitlement of a person to family payment for 1996 even though the person might have already lodged their 1995-96 tax return. It would also ensure that income data in respect of the 1994-95 and 1995-96 financial years could be used in a single matching cycle to enable checking on student and parental personal income details for 1995 and 1996. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Ms Macklin) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1996 First Reading Bill received from the Senate, and read a first time. Ordered that the second reading be made an order of the day for the next sitting. NA Motion (by Mr Ruddock) proposed: That the House do now adjourn. Radio: Religious Vilification",112
145,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,Unknown,"I wish to raise for the attention of the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government (Mr Warwick Smith), representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston), a recent decision of the Australian Broadcasting Authority. In February, the ABA ruled that what is known as The Liars Club program on Radio Station 3RRR had breached radio program standard 3(b) as well as conditions of the station's licence as set out in the Broadcasting Services Act. The decision was the result of a complaint by the Church of Scientology that comments made by the program presenter in September last year constituted religious vilification. The Broadcasting Authority's decision is the first time that a complaint on the basis of religious vilification has succeeded. What should trouble the minister and many Australians, however, is that there is precious little justification for the decision. The Broadcasting Authority's judgment that The Liars Club gratuitously vilified the Church of Scientology on its program is disturbing, firstly, because the decision simply cannot be justified on the facts of the case. In defending the decision, the ABA's Nick Herd said that gratuitous vilification carried with the meaning that comments were unwarranted. The comments were made by a former member of the Church of Scientology which, being based on his own experiences within the church, can scarcely be said to be unwarranted. Secondly, the ABA's decision establishes a precedent which, if not addressed, could effectively shackle broadcasting in this country. Mr Herd claimed that the critical factor in the ABA's deliberation on the matter was the failure of the presenter to offer a countervailing view to that presented by his guest. This is despite the presenter in question having challenged the claim by the interviewee that Nazism and Scientology had a lot in common. Are we now to understand that, for example, all radio presenters, when interviewing former members of religious associations who relate unfavourable experiences about those associations-no matter how justified they may be-will be liable to claims of religious vilification? This decision, as it now stands, strengthens the hand of anyone seeking to silence commentary on contentious issues involving religion. The ABA's decision was a bad decision which confused considered commentary for vilification. If it is not reviewed we will have in Australia a precedent that, rather than complementing this nation's strong tradition of free speech, will in fact restrict it. Professed religious convictions should not become a smokescreen for avoiding criticism or public scrutiny. For example, in my electorate there is a man by the name of Neil Thomas. He has his own church which has been called the Grace Church, Neil Thomas Ministries and other names from time to time. He has set up many companies which have gone into liquidation, leaving a trail of tors. He does not pay his bills and he inveigles people into handing over to him their life savings-in short, he is a crook. He should not be immune from public scrutiny simply because he sets up a church. If this decision is not reconsidered, the ABA may well become a clearing house for ongoing and vexatious religious disputation. The Broadcasting Authority was never estabit lished for this purpose, and I do not believe that it has the administrative capacity to deal with such matters and sort the wheat from the chaff. I urge the minister to use his powers under section 171 of the Broadcasting Services Act, which allow him to direct the ABA to investigate matters in the interests of due administration. I further request that the minister use his power under section 161 of the act to advise the ABA of the government's policy on religious vilification which urgently needs clarification as a result of the Broadcasting Authority's decision. It seems apparent that the judgment and the persecution of this program by scientologists have led to the axing of this program by 3RRR. I am particularly concerned that the Broadcasting Authority refers to 'warranted' and 'unwarranted' criticism; Who determine!!. what is warranted and what is unwarranted? The Broadcasting Authority's view leaves it in the situation of sitting in judgment on what are valid or invalid religious convictions and conduct. Clearly, the responsibility of the media and broadcasters is to offer both sides a go rather than make the decisions themselves. Port of Geelong: Privatisation",113
146,Mr MCARTHUR,Unknown," Mr Speaker, I congratulate you on your elevation to high office, and note the very genuine spirit of debate that now takes place in this House under your speakership. I draw to the attention of the House the historic privatisation of the port of Geelong. This program by the Victorian government means that the port of Portland and the port of Geelong will be in private hands. These very important ports in Victoria will now set credi- a benchmark in the export and import of Australian products. For all other ports around Australia, it will mean there will be a mark for costing, for activity and for the in which a competitive port can operate. The sale price that was achieved by the Victorian government was $50.5 million, and the buyer is a consortium made up broadly of TNT and other investors. The key element of this change in the operation of the Geelong port is that the channel will remain with another authority. This means that, similar to the national Australia. highways and the standard gauge, the channel will remain in public ownership whereas the port itself will be in private hands. We will have a competitive situation where the Geelead long port will be competing with Melbourne, Portland and other ports around Australia. I said, it sets a benchmark for problem. The major imports through the Port of Geelong are: crude oil to the Shell refinery, which represents about 50 per cent of the product that comes through the port; fertiliser raw materials for the Pivot company, with which I had a very good association and which has been a user of the port for years; and the aluminium that Alcoa at Port Henry, again an important user of the port. The Grains Elevator Board, another important user, exports grain. That board has also been privatised, meaning the port authority and the privatised grain handling operation will combine very well provide a first-class operation. Also, Midway products uses the port to export its woodchips to various places around the world. Another port activity is the export of Riverina bagged purposes. rice, another recent technical development. Under the former management of the Geelong Harbour Trust and its more recently changed arrangements as a privati sed operthat ation under the general management of Peter Morgan, the port has reduced its costs and manpower levels. The Port of Geelong was a position to be privati sed and moved more competitive area. The Victorian Treasurer, Mr Stockdale, commented in his news release as follows: The port system is now well on track to deliver more competitive services at a reduced cost for users which will flow into the wider economy. benchAlready, the government's reforms in the way Geelong port, aided very strongly by the  22 per cent drop in port charges. The waterfront is a key part of the Howard government's reform agenda. This afternoon historic changes to the industrial relations legislation were introduced into the parliament, the impact of which will be very much felt on the waterfront in other ports around We have had the two major changes of privatisation and industrial relations. I am very confident that the Port of Geelong will the way to become one of the best ports on the Australian coastline both for imports As and exports and will be a model of competithis waterfront tive efficiency. New Work Opportunities",114
147,Mr JENKINS,Unknown,"Scullin) (5.33 p.m.}-- Mr Speaker, tonight I wish to raise in this adjournment debate what I believe to be the deliberate vandalism of an important labour market program established under the Labor many government's Working Nation policy-new comes into work opportunities. The vandalism to which I refer is the recent decision by the Victorian Workcover authority to bring the landcare and environment action that program and the new work opportunities participants within the scope of the 1985 to Victorian Accident Compensation Act and to determine that new work opportunities host employers and LEAP sponsor organisations are employers for workers compensation This is an appalling and puzzling decision. Because of the training and work experience focus, the long standing precedent has been participants in labour market programs are treated as trainees, not employees. It is the case that as trainees they have been fully in covered by appropriate accident, injury and into a public liability insurance. But the cost of this has not fallen on LEAP sponsors or host employers. I can think of no better way to frighten off potential sponsor organisations and host employers than to port saddle them with a potentially large Workcover liability. How can the participants in training be regarded as employees? The Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs pays these people a training allowance. The sponsor, broker or host employer has little or no capacity to reject participants referred to it by the department. Sponsors are not required to pay superannuation for participants-or is this next on the list of ways in which to reduce the effectiveness of these programs? Already this decision has affected the operation of at least one new work opportunity provider operating in the region I represent. The manager of the Northcote Training Centre, Jan Roberts, raised this problem with my office last month and was quoted in the press recently as saying that up to 80 per cent of host employers had been forced to withdraw their offer of work experience for the unemployed as a result of this decision. Who does this hurt? Of course it hurts the long term unemployed. Under the Working Nation initiatives of the Labor government, the Department of Employment, Education and Training in Melbourne's east strove hard to ensure that the very long-term unemployed were the first to be assisted under the new work opportunities program. The hard line on helping those most disadvantaged was difficult to hold but it was held to the credit of the department. We are talking about providing opportunity to people who have been unemployed for many years. The Northcote example that I referred to earlier meant that 45 people were withdrawn from their programs midstream. Some of the sponsor organisations who reluctantly had to withdraw from the program included: Upper Yarra Community House; the Macleod Nursing Home; and the Brotherhood of St Laurence. It is worth stressing that up to the point this ridiculous decision, the new work opportunities program operated by the Northcote organisation had been highly successful. Some 52 per cent of participants-who have been out of work for between four and 20 yearshave been placed in full-time jobs through their participation in programs organised by the Northcote new work opportunities. This is what Working Nation was all about. Those in academic ivory towers and rightwing think tanks who cast doubt on the macro-effectiveness of labour market programs have obviously never been to a labour market program graduation ceremony. There has been a great deal of speculation about cuts by this government to labour market programs. The oldest trick in the book is surely to change the program and thereby reduce its effectiveness so that it can later be abolished on the grounds that it is not effective. Is that what is happening here? Has the federal minister protested to Jeff Kennett against this nonsensical decision to call trainees employees? Does the government endorse the deliberate vandalism of new work opportunities and LEAP by the Victorian government as a prelude to the abolition of these programs? Child Labour Foreign Aid",115
148,Mr TONY SMITH,Unknown,"Dickson) (5.37 p.m.}-I want to commend the honourable member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson) on thspeech he gave last night during the adjournment debate. He referred to child labour, which is occurring in a number of countries. I wholeheartedly support the efforts of the member for Reid in drawing the .attention of this House to certain practices that are absolutely shocking-for example, children, some as young as three, being chained up and forced to put things in boxes and undergo labour, and children as young as 10 undergoing more difficult labour. So I commend the honourable member for Reid on drawing that matter to my attention and to that of the people of Australia. On a related matter, I would like to talk of about World Vision and foreign aid. I have had an association with World Vision through child sponsorship for about 20 years. Nothing can warm the heart more than sponsoring a child through World Vision, watching that child grow and keeping contact with that child through letters and regular photographs. You feel in a small way that you a,re contributing. Again, I commend the practice of people in wealthier countries-and Australia is in that affluent group-assisting in that very direct and personal way. A delegation from the Australian Council of Overseas Aid recently visited me and drew my attention to the fact that Australia's aid budget has been declining in recent years. It used to be around 0.5 per cent as a percentage of .GNP in 1982-84, and at present it is hovering at about 0.35 per cent. All honourable members should think seriously about this question of foreign aid. There are really desperate situations out there in Third and Fourth World countries, and we must never forget that we· are all part of the global munity. We might say at times that we have problems, but think of a pregnant woman who is working right .up to the moment of delivering a child. She is working in back-breaking work for something like $2 or $3 a day, and the child is born virtually in the midst of her labour. We talk about the benefits of the wonderful health system that we have here. Yet when that child is born the mother uses a piece of grass to tie the umbilical cord. In that grass frequently there are tetanus spores. Looking at the conditions in which those people have to live and how easily diseases can be transmitted reinforces my view that we must give substantial commitment to overseas aid. We must ensure that moneys are channelled through the aid agencies. Aid agencies, particularly aid agencies like World Vision, are closer to the ground. There is less chance of money dissipating and more chance that projects can be developed at a village level. It is of the essence to ensure that individual projects in these villages in Third World are enhanced by the identifiable means which World Vision and other agencies have of picking particular projeCts, channelling the funds and raising the standard of living, even if this means just getting a well sunk or providing a pump, agriculture and seed. Developed at a village level, this is the way we can really help. We must all the time address ourselves to this need to maintain in real terms our foreign aid budget. Export Finance",116
149,Mr SERCOMBE,Unknown,"Like the honourable member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins), I want to bring to the attention of the House the vandalism that this government is perpetrating in a whole range of areas of our life. I wish to refer in particular to the vandalism that arises in important areas of support for both small and large Australian businesses, particularly those seeking to gain access to export markets in our own region. What brought .this issue to my attention was an article in today's Australian Financial Review-an article which has particularly com- unflattering caricatures of the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) and the Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer). The article is headed 'Ministers at odds over budget cuts'. The gist of the story is that there is a dispute between the two ministers and their offices with respectto the future of the development . import finance facility and the export market development grants scheme. These programs are not unknown to the House; they have had very considerable success in promoting Australian business in developing regions of the world. AusAID recently completed a review which found that the $285 million expended under the DIFF program in the last five years gave rise to $1.37 billion of business for Australian companies involved in projects. The review also found non-monetary quantifiable benefits such as the establishment of credibility in international markets, improved trading opportunities with recipient countries, increased investment and a higher degree of export orientation in· Australian firms. Similarly, the export market development grants scheme, the which the government appears to be allowing to bleed to death by the continuing cuts of speculation about its future, has been demonstrated to be a successful program. Even the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Short) is quoted in a recent story in the Financial Review as acknowledging that successful-I emphasise 'successful' - government programs would have to be scrapped. . Talk about shooting yourself in the foot. This approach of the government, particularly in relation to DIFF, has attracted much negative comment. The former head of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Mr W ooIcott, has had some very strong things to say on the matter. The ambassadors from a number of our important trading partnersChina, Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam-are all reported in the financial press over recent days as having made protests to the government about the impact of the abolition of DIFF. The report states: Australian companies already appear to have lost ground in bidding for a $20 billion revamp of the Philippines defence forces, with other significant infrastructure contracts likely to follow. ""This is not only about the projects, but about Asian perceptions of Australia,"" one senior Asian ambassador in Canberra said yesterday. The serious damage to Australia's credibility caused by the abolition of DIFF comes despite a concerted bid by the Coalition to assure Asian leaders that it is committed to . . . the region. Mr Speaker, Transfield, a company in our home town of Melbourne and which plays an important role in the ANZAC frigate project is, according to reports, in some considerable difficulty in relation to a $60 million naval program in the Philippines as a result of the government's decision to scrap the development import finance facility. Transfield can scarcely be terribly impressed. In recent days a company in Queensland headed by Mr Ian Berckelman has been mentioned in the press. The article states: Ian Berckelman has been dOing business with Indonesia since 1974, but he doesn't know if he should bother anymore. ""I will probably close the firm down as a result of DIFF being abolished,"". .. ""This is thoughtless stuff. Australian companies are going to lose the trust of the Indonesian authorities as a this."" There is a small businessman who has been extremely successful in Indonesia in promoting Australian business, Australian know-how, and because of the stupidity of this government in shooting itself and the Australian community in the foot, we will lose these opportunities. I mention also a Western Australian example, a company called Relpar Pty Ltd, which is involved in the provision of training, education material and equipment for handicapped children at 10 special schools. It is also in strife as a result of the government's approach. I call on the government through this forum to urgently review this set of stupid, vandalistic approaches which it is taking and to restore Australia's credibility. (Time expired) Export Finance Sri Lanka",117
150,Mr TAYLOR,Unknown,"I say to the honourable member opposite, the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Sercombe), that this government is not stupid. The government will be taking very objective decisions in the coming months on DIFF and EMDG. You will just have to wait and see what happens on 20 August. To recite some of the stuff you have just recited is simply to indicate there are interests in our community who do not want to stand on their own two feet. Yes, they do need some assistance, but there are other ways and means. I say to you that the government will be looking at these matters in the context of the August budget. I rise this evening to indicate to the House that we have an international tragedy within the Commonwealth of Nations. I am sure many members on both sides of the House share the concerns I have with the sovereign state of Sri Lanka. In fact, that country, over the last 10 or 15 years, has been subjected to a horrendous civil war involving the Sinhalese majority, the Tamil minority and a sma-ler minority group of Muslims. People are being killed and very large injustices are being imposed on that community. I think it is incumbent on Australians, bearing in mind that we have a very large Sri Lankan comresult of munity in Australia, to take more than a casual interest in the needs of that sovereign state. The former Foreign Minister, the honourable member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans), whilst he was very happy to stand in the General Assembly in New York, was less committed to looking after the interests of some of these countries because the profile just was not there. I am delighted that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Andrew Thomson) is at the table because I think it is also incumbent on us as a government to do something about it. I think we can do something about it would hope, an influential country within the Commonwealth of Nations. I say to the goes parliamentary secretary that I hope our tion. Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) will look at ways and means in which we can assist. I know we are dealing with another soverfor eign state. I know we are dealing with another government. If people were wanting to meddle in our internal affairs, they would have some reservations about that. However, I think there is something we can do with the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meetwill ing and at the parliamentary level in conjuncend tion with diplomatic overtures that I hope continue to be made in relation to Sri Lanka. Over the last 10 years something like half a million people have been killed or displaced and there have been lots of injustices on both sides of that conflict in Sri Lanka. I hope can do something about it, that we can get things under way to assist. I am sure I am not the only member on either side of the who has been pressured by the groups representing Sri Lanka here in Australia, be they Sinhalese or Tamil, to do something about I do not intend, and I am sure our government does not intend, to take sides in what is an internal dispute. At the same time, we can do something to reintroduce a very large dose democracy into a country which is staggering and suffering under horrendous conflict. New England lfighway",118
151,Mr FITZGIBBON,Unknown," night. The New England Highway stretches from one end of my electorate to the beyond. The highway is the lifeblood of the Upper Hunter, as it carries most of the duct of the area, including our coal to the of Newcastle, and provides an important link between towns and from towns to places Sydney and Tamworth for the people of my electorate. The New England Highway forms part of the national highway system. Many people, including honourable members of the National Party who represent the electorates on the areas. New South Wales north coast, would like to , see it declassified in order that the Pacific Highway may be reclassified as part of the as, I national highway system and, therefore, attract the sort of government funding which hand-in-glove with such a reclassificaAs the New England Highway goes through my electorate, I would like to hear a clear and unequivocal commitment from the Minister Transport and Regional Development to the ongoing retention of the New England (Mr Sharp) Highway as part of the national highway system. In addition, I would like a commitment from the minister on the funding of the so-called Kurri-Kurri Corridor, which provide an important link between the of the F3 freeway and the beginning of will the Upper Hunter area. I would also like a funding commitment on the tidying up of the mess which exists in the Blackhill, Beresfield, Thornton, Tarro and Woodberry areas as a result of the sudden ending of the F3 freeway we in that area and the spill-off effect we get through those areas. This latter issue goes to public safety and also goes to the amenity of House the residents living in that area. Not only would the Kurri Corridor provide an important economic transport link between it. the Upper Hunter area and Sydney and all of its markets but also it would give Cessnock residents their first great hope of a bypass of the town. Cessnock is a beautiful town full of of wonderful people, but it does have its problems. Chief amongst them are the thousands and thousands of heavy vehicles that boom through both its streets and its CBD day and Its other problem, which it shares with so many country towns, is the decline in its other and central business district. The council at Cessnock, of which I was a promember for some eight years, would like to port address the problem. They would like to beautify the CBD and make it a more friendly like and comfortable environment in which to shop. They want the residents to stay in the town and do their shopping rather than seek a more comfortable form of shopping in the large supermarket and retail complexes which exist in the Newcastle and Lake Macquarie The council is stifled in its endeavours because of this issue of heavy vehicles. It difficult to attract funding for a bypass Cessnock because Cessnock is not situated the national highway. So the Kurri Corridor gives us real hope. The design of the corridor has been funded and it is in place. All we need now is a commitment from this government on the retention of the New England Highway as the national highway and the funding of the Kurri Corridor. If this is not a possibility in the longer term, we have one other opportunity. During the last federal election campaign, the then shadow minister for transport, now the hide Minister for Transport and Regional Developwere ment, indicated to the Australian people that a new form of road funding might come into being. It was called 'Funding for roads of national importance'. The bypass of Cessnock is an issue of very great importance. I suggest that the minister, at the very least, revisit election commitment and investigate the funding of a bypass of Cessnock under that funding program he indicated he would depths commit himself to. (Time expired) Unemployed: Training Courses",119
152,Mr BROUGH,Unknown,"I felt it would be remiss of me not to rise legislation tonight to make some sort of a response to many of the allegations which, over the past week, members of the opposition have and made-and, in particular, in response to rhetoric which has gone on regarding training. It seems that the opposition has an absolute fascination with training. Training for the sake of absolutely pointless exercise. I would challenge any of the opposition members to go and look at anyone of the long-term training courses-for example, the 13-week plusintroduced which just happen to ensure that anybody who has been long-term unemployed and who participates in one of these courses no longer appears as long-term unemployed but then goes onto the merry-go-round and becomes one of the short-term unemployed.

In fact, with this issue, all we have seen over the last 13 years-and, in particular, the last four or five years-has been a complete effort to the figures and to ensure that the public misinformed about the real situation.

Her his 700,000 new jobs after the lowest point that we had been in for many years puts us back almost to the position we were in at the of the recession. What a great achievement of yours! The fact is that now, today, we have seen introduced into this parliament a piece of that will directly affect the impact that the job market is going to have. In my movements throughout the election I heardI am sure every member of this House on the both sides heard repeatedly-that the one piece of legislation that has been so disruptive to business and disruptive to employment . opportunities has been the unfair dismissal laws. We have seen those addressed in this training is an parliament today. It is important that the Australian people understand that the piece of legislation we today is only one small piece of a very large document which will go a long way to addressing the draconian steps that were put in place by Labor supporting nothing but unions and union supporters and, in doing so, to the detriment of both employers and employees. I think it is important for the as opposition to understand at this point that there are no jobs without employers. It is an something which seems to have escaped it We support employers because they, in tum, support employees. That is of importance to the Australian economy if it is to grow.

Quite the contrary: our intention international rules mean for Australia This legislation rectifies a situation in which properly understanding their implications.

In 1992, OECD countries for managing trade in hazardous waste, using red, amber and green categories Under the Basel convention such an agreement such agreements to be given recognition and One of the conditions is that the rules established reduce the level of environment protection provided.

Nevertheless, improved by the discussions that have the most satisfactory reconciliation of NA MC 1348 competing interest that could be arrived at. passage of this bill. All international instruments relating controversy on how to accurately define hazardous waste should be treated as a range are needed. Countries of the OECD solve this and developing a control system with varying hazardous the waste is. The Basel convention set up a somewhat waste streams and contaminates, and a list it did not provide the level of certainty which to give effect to the convention on a case by case basis.

The draft lists drawn up include those agreed not to be subject to the convention, those some which perhaps ought to be subject to as yet have no legal significance and that do provide useful guidance to countries in should not be covered. I would merely note to Australia have now been settled, including provided considerable reassurance to parts of industry. There has been criticism in some quarters law. Most international conventions are compromise amongst countries whose vital international conventions allow a degree of Basel convention will not be resolved by pointing by working within the convention forums are the rules that our trading partners have them in the process of debate and discussion international environment and The debate about trade and the environment is a concrete example of that debate.

The trouble with this system was that countries actually needed when they were trying of the conference of the parties, there was given to reducing the uncertainties surrounding Several meetings have now been held. Progress meeting of the convention's technical working arrived at a provisional listing of wastes, which the certainty that Australia and other countries to be subject to the convention, those agreed on which a decision has yet to be taken, and even the convention but appear not to be.

The bill covers where Australia is certainly lagging behind the Minister for Environment, Sport and Territories, last year when he introduced the bill, 'The our obligations under the Basel convention.' speakers-was adopted in 1989 and ratified a stringent code of conduct in the transportation we have been guilty of neglecting. As a nation NA MC 1350 which prides itself on its integrity in its dealings which regards its diligence in meeting its international others can learn, we cannot afford to drag important issue as the transportation of hazardous waste. Over the last 10 to 20 years, as we environment, we have been led to ask ourselves transportation and disposal of toxic waste have slowly begun to educate ourselves. It order to reverse our environment's dire state learnt too late and too slowly. It is hard not devastation of our environment I suppose only our children will know whether now acting with enough speed to reverse our being glib, that perhaps we would be better enough to answer that question. Depending on whom we talk to, we find environment on both a national and an international contemptible.

However, we are presently viewed with Pacific for not supporting the Association of gas emissions by 20 per cent by 2005.

In the past, under the guise of 'recycling', waste to darken our neighbours' doorsteps, all been done without contravening the 1989 act, the convention. Because waste products intended for recycling was no requirement for companies to report authorities and in tum no prior informed consent Nor was there any inquiry made as to whether environmentally sound manner by the importing Greenpeace has since reported that waste exported treated by importing countries in south-east damages to human health and the environment Australians are aware of this state of affairs? our waste destroying the lives of others?

Some say that these lessons are being to disagree when one can see all around us the continuing, seemingly unabated. we have acted soon enough; whether we are environment's decline. I think I can say, without off to not be around when our children are old that Australia's record on protecting the level is either commendable or way on certain environmental issues. The former attempt, on a vast scale, to begin the process a jaundiced eye by our neighbours in the South Small Island States' proposal to cut greenhouse in regard to setting targets to reduce greenhouse by the western European nations and are in by the United States and Canada. our recent history is similarly chequered. Per three times more hazardous waste than did ourselves in. Those responsible for trading taken advantage of a loophole which exists in the differs from that used by the Basel convention. Australia has sent thousands of tonnes of toxic rather than face the problem ourselves. This has but it is, I believe, still against the spirit of were not covered by the previous act, there the export of such products to the Australian was obtained from the countries of import. these wastes would be managed in an state. The environmental organisation by Australia for recycling has routinely been Asia in an unsafe manner which has resulted in in those countries.

Again, bill will now rectify. Yet as much as I commend the bill, I also to answer.

While I am pleased to see that we are strengthening environmental issue as the transportation of missed another central provision of the Basel convention, shall: minimise the generation of hazardous and other wastes.

Eight years the fact that our nation's population is growing in size to Wollongong's population of 220,000-this improved. Rather, it is one that would have that this figure does not include the 70,000 by Sydney siders in that year. The domestic garbage disposed of by Sydneysiders to the equivalent of one million trees-enough build 40,000 homes; enough glass to make 200 construct 75,000 new cars; and two billion discarded just in Sydney. From these figures, it Sydney, in particular, will run out of landfill In relation to the ecological footprint, or 4.5 hectares of productive land now to consumption. That is 4.5 hectares compared Putting it plainly, every Australian affects Indonesian. Sydneysiders and, I assume, all Australians call the myth of disposal for far too long. we could take out of the earth whatever liked and it would never affect us. Of course, the age of recycling has also well on its own is not going to be enough. What hazardous or otherwise.
