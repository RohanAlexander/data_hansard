1,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"A distinguished visitor- Mr W. H . M . Pearson, a member of the House of Commons, and brother of Lady Denman-is coming to see us at 4 o'clock, and as Mr Speaker will not be then in the chair, I take this opportunity to ask the House to pay him the courtesy of inviting him'to take a seat on the floor. I move That Mr W. H. M. Pearson, M.P., be provided with a seat on the floor of the House.",12
2,Mr FISHER,Unknown,I second the motion. Question resolved in the affirmative. PANAMA EXPOSITION..,12
3,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"Will the - Government take into favourable consideration the - desirability of securing reciprocity between those two great nations, the people of the United States of America and the people of the United States of Australia, so that Australia may he well represented at the Panama Pacific International Exhibition 1",12
4,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"A duly accredited Commission from America is now in the Commonwealth, taking steps to secure Australian representation at the Panama Exposition. I shall gladly take into consideration the honourable member's suggestion. ELECTOR AL ADMINISTRATION .",12
5,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I wish to ask the Minister of Home Affairs, or the Assistant Minister, a question about a notice of the removal of a name from the roll. The notice, addressed to Mabel M . Richards, Wakeham-street, Stawell, is as follows:Commonwealth of Australia. COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL ACT. Stale of 'Victoria. Notice of removal of name from roll (Reg. 8.) You are hereby notified that your name bas been removed from the roll for the Stawell subdivision by direction of the Commonwealth Electoral Officer for the State, on the ground that you have ceased to be qualified for enrolment on that roll, and have secured enrolment for the Moyhu subdivision of the division of Indi. If you desire to make any answer, you should forthwith communicate with me. (Sgd.) R. J. LIDDELL, Electoral Registrar for the Stawell Subdivision. Address-Stawell . Dated ist day of September, 1913. William Jack, of Stawell; writesMrs M. M. Richards - Remove d from roll on ground that .she is oa roll for Moyhu, Indi. She. came to Stawell from Hamilton last August, and has been a resident of Stawell ever since, living at the same address. Neither she nor her husband has ever been in Moyhu, and they do not know where it is situated.",13
6,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Why not send these cases to us, so that we may deal with them departmentally?",13
7,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Minister s maintain that there is no attempt to remove from the roll the names of electors who are entitled to enrolment. I ask them what their reply in this instance is ?,13
8,Mr AHERN,Unknown,I b is a curious co-incidence that there is an M . M . Richards at Moyhu.,13
9,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"It is a strange thing that the disenrolment of an elector should be justified on the ground that there is another elector of the same name enrolled in some other part of the State. , Mr KELLY - If trie right honourable member will furnish the facts, the case which he has brought under notice will be inquired into by the Department. I tale this opportunity to deal with a matter which he brought before the House iome time ago. He referred to an article in the Wondai Times of the Sth September last. A Registrar was alleged to have written to the Farmers Union about the taking of names off the roll, and speaking of this officer, the Commonwealth Electoral Officer for Queensland reportsThe Registrar referred to is Mr H. MCCullGch, Registrar for Ihe subdivision of Nanango. He has informed the Divisional Returning Officer for Wide Bny that he mentioned the subject of cleansing his roll to representatives of the Farmers Union and the Workers' Political OrganizationThere is not much party action abou.t thatand received a promise of assistance from both;, but, up to date, has received no suggestion from either. He has denied having invited objections from organizations, and stated that any action he has taken has been strictly in conformity with the directions contained in your circular No, 703, and the Instructions to Registrars. I might mention that the invitation issued by the Attorney-General to organizations to lodge objections has been published by newspapers throughout the State.",13
10,Mr BOYD,Unknown,"Prio r to the last election did the ex-Prime Minister take any objection to the removal of names from the roll? If so, with what result?",13
11,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,Is that in orderf,13
12,Mr FISHER,Unknown,I will answer that.,13
13,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Yes ; the right honourable member did.,13
14,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,This is a put up affair.,13
15,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order .,13
16,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"On the 21st A p r i l , 1913, the honourable member for Wide Bay sent a telegram",13
17,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,This is a carefully prepared impromptu.,13
18,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order .,13
19,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"The following telegram was sent by the ex-Prime Minister to the Chief Electoral Officer, MelbourneStatement made to me by reputable authority, Maryborough, Queensland, that disastrous confusion occurring by striking off rolls those names marked left; that only remedy is that Electoral Officer each State be instructed leave roll as printed, except dead, and those applied transfer; that any further interference bring about wholesale disenfranchisement throughout Commonwealth. That telegram brought about the departmental inquiry, with the following resultRegistrar advises no names struck oil, except - in strict accordance Act and Regulations. Only one case known where name resident elector struck off in error, since reinstated. Wrong one of two names struck out on notification transfer. No names knowingly .struck off for 'temporary absence.",13
20,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Did the honourable member expect an answer like that?,13
21,Mr KELLY,Unknown,It seems to have been .going on before. Later:,14
22,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs a question. I have received from residents of Barkstead a letter stating that the police are collecting the names of those who have temporarily lef t their districts, and they suggest that those names should be removed from the rolls. Minister have full inquiries made in connection with all objections that people have permanently left the district?",14
23,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"In view of the statement of the Prime Minister, I would like - all such questions to be placed on the notice-paper.",14
24,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"I ask the Minister if it is true that, when notice is sent to an elector that his enrolment is challenged, his reply must be returned within twenty days? If so, I draw attention to the fact that, in many parts of the Kennedy, Maranoa, and other large electorates, it is not possible to send a letter and to get a reply within that time. Many places have only a fortnightly mail, and replies cannot be returned from them within less than a month; but, if a mail is missed, the reply cannot be returned in less than six weeks. If the law is that a reply must be returned within twenty days, wil l the honourable gentleman take steps to have it altered ?",14
25,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I shall have the matter inquired into. Speaking on the spur of the moment- I ask honourable members not to accept my statement without corroboration-the Act requires a reply to be returned within twenty days. Should that be so, I would like my honourable friends to bring the matter up again during the consideration in Committee of the Electoral Bill , when it will receive proper attention.",14
26,Mr FENTON,Unknown,Why not mediate action?,14
27,Mr KELLY,Unknown,If the Act says),14
28,Mr FENTON,Unknown,If it says!,14
29,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"We must administer the Act as we find it ; and if it says that replies must be returned within twenty days, - we must give effect to that provision until we can amend the Act .",14
30,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,The unfortunate thing is that the Minister is openly violating the Act by his administration.,14
31,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"The statement is without foundation, and I ask that it be withdrawn.",14
32,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The interjection was disorderly; and, as the statement is objected to, I ask the honourable member to withdraw - it.",14
33,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"The interjection had reference to the fact that the provision requiring a deposit in connection with the ""Will the making of an objection has not been complied with. If that is not correct, I withdraw the statement.",14
34,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"TJ i at statement, like many others made by the honourable member, is without foundation. Coming now to a matter spoken of by the honourable member for Brisbane some time ago, the Commonwealth Electoral Officer for Queensland reportsEvidently, there is some mistake in relation to this subject. The name of John Francis MCCarthy has not been removed from the Commonwealth roll. He is one of the many who, in i g i r , failed to comply with he regulation requiring every elector, whether already enrolled or not, to furnish a claim for enrolment. Repeated requests have been made to him to furnish his claim, in order that the dummy card may be removed from the index; but, so far, without success.",14
35,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"In view of the statements which have been made that the Commonwealth Electoral Officers are in viting outside bodies to assist them in keeping the rolls pure and complete, I desire to ask the Treasurer whether lie will place upon the Estimates a sum sufficiently large to pay for assistance in this regard ?",14
36,Sir JOHNFORREST,Unknown,"I do not think that any provision has been made on the Estimates for it , nor do I propose to make such provision.",14
37,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I would like to take this opportunity to give the official reply take im- to a statement which was made last F r i day by the honourable member for Ballarat. He statedTo-day I received from Ballarat a letter stating that the officer there refused to allow persons to inspect the roll in order to see the names which had been struck off, and the names which had been added. The Chief Electoral Officer informs me that the Returning Officer reports that all Registrars at Ballarat inform him that they have never refused to allow any one to inspect their official rolls.",14
38,Mr EISHER,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs a question in regard to an objection notice sent to James Cooper, of Beech Forest. In this case, Mr Watson writesJames Cooper - Has been a resident of Beech Forest for past ten years, and has been on the three rolls-Federal , State, and Ratepayers'. He is now objected to because a similar name appears on the Balaclava roll. names which were on the supplementary roll have not been transferred to the divisional roll. Do not all these cases indicate that the system pursued is wrong or faulty ! 1",15
39,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"There is a prior question to be asked, namely, "" Is there anything abnormal i u them?""",15
40,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"The system which the right honourable member has referred to is the normal system which was instituted by his Government a few years ago. I can only say that wherever mistakes arise in departmental administration the Department welcomes a knowledge of those mistakes, because that knowledge will facilitate the successful administration of the Department. But I suggest to my right honourable friend that, as a first step towards correcting these mistakes, the ordinary requirement of the law should be complied with, and the persons affected should reply to the Registrars instead of sending notifications to this House to be dealt with at question time, when obviously the Minister cannot be possessed of the full factsi n every instance.",15
41,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,I desire to ask the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs whether it is a fact that the Department is accepting objections to names appearing on the roll without the deposit of 5s. which is provided for by law?,15
42,Mr KELLY,Unknown,The Department has always investigated information which seemed to its officers to be correctly founded in this regard. It is now following the practice which it has always followed.,15
43,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"I wish to ask the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs whether he will inquire the name of the person who objected to my name appearing on the roll two days prior to nomination day in connection with the last elections, and whether in that in stance a deposit of 5s. was lodged?",15
44,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I will , certainly make that inquiry.",15
45,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,"I desire to bring under the notice of the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs a letter which I have received today from Creswick. It readsEnclosed you will find an objection to a voters name appearing on the roll. Now, this lady, who is my next-door neighbour, has not been out of the district for a long time, and has not redded anywhere else for twenty years. I think the Registrar, who is also the postmaster, should know she is a permanent resident, as she is in the habit of going to the post-office to Also, several draw the old-age pension. But this is not the worse feature of the case, for the objection, which is dated September 22nd, did not arrive at her house until Saturday, October 18, so that the twenty days in which she could reply to the objection have lapsed, and, I presume, she has been crossed off the roll. Of course, I will take the necessary steps to have heT name reinstated. I notice that Mr Fisher stated in the House that twenty days was not sufficient in which to reply to an objection. I thought this might be helpful to you in proving this contention. Written at Mrs Sherman's request by vours faithfully , A. RUSSELL. I have here the notice of objection in question. It is dated 22ud September, and it states that if Mrs Sherman fails to answer the objection within twenty days from the posting of the notice her name may be struck off the roll.",15
46,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order ! I understood that the honourable member rose to ask a question. Instead of doing so he has made a statement which was more lengthy than I should have allowed, but that I was under the impression that he in tended to conclude with a question which the reading of the letter was intended to explain.",15
47,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,As a matter of personal explanation,15
48,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order ! There is no personal explanation involved. If the honourable member rises to ask a question he should ask it . If he rises to make a personal explanation he should make it . But I would point out to him that the reading of a letter from somebody else is not asking a question, nor can it be made a pretext for a personal explanation.",15
49,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,Then I desire to ask the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs whether he will cause inquiry to be made into the case which I have brought underhis notice?,15
50,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member is in order in doing that.,15
51,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I should like to answer this question. I answer it by asking honourable members to put these matters on the notice-paper, otherwise it means consuming half-an-hour of valuable time every day. Honourable members know that the Minister cannot answer these questions until he has made in quiries.",15
52,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,I am asking him make inquiries. Mr JOSE PH COOK - Coul d not that be done by putting the question on the notice-paper ?,16
53,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,That leads to delay.,16
54,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Thes e are all questions of which notice should be given, and I ask now that any further questions of this nature be placed on the notice paper. OODNADATTA - PO RT AUGUSTA RAILWAY. ROLLING STOCK - AGREEMEN TWITH SOUTH AUSTRALIA.  the attention of the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs to a statement which he is alleged to have made in addressing the Women's National League last evening, to the effect that on one little item which came under his notice in the Department of Home Affairs he had saved South Australia £125,000 in the manufacture of rolling-stock for the railways. I desire to ask him to what rolling-stock he was referring ?",16
55,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I did not say that I had saved South Australia £ 1 2 5 , 0 0 0 ; but I did say that, very shortly after I was placed in charge of the Department of which the Prime Minister is the head, tenders which had been invited for the supply of £126,000 worth of rolling-stock to enable the Oodnadatta-Port Augusta railway to be run by Commonwealth in strumentalities came before me. By arrangement with the State of South Australia, the purchase of that 3-ft. 6-in. gauge rolling-stock was obviated, and £126,000 was thus saved to the Commonwealth.",16
56,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Because it was an Australian contract.,16
57,Mr KELLY,Unknown,That is just about as childish as many other statements which emanate from the right honourable gentleman.,16
58,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Is the Minister of External Affairs in a position to lay on the table the agreement arrived at between his Department and the South Australian Government regarding the running of trains on the Oodnadatta to Port Augusta railway?,16
59,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,No . There are some to points that still remain to be settled.,16
60,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,You are a long time settling them. It is about time we knew one way or another.,16
61,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,There is nothing to conceal about the agreement.,16
62,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,But the delay prevents us discussing the question in the House.,16
63,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I hope honourable members will have that opportunity. A d r a f t of the agreement was prepared some time ago, and might, perhaps, have reached our Department earlier than this. I saw the authorities concerned in South Australia a fortnigh t ago, and looked through their d r a f t , and certain amendments whjch I made to it are now under their consideration. W it h in the last half-hour I have telegraphed to the Commissioner of Railways in South Australia, asking whether I could take advantage of the presence of one of his officers here to deal with this matter, and I hope that within the course of a few weeks the agreement will be ready. I shall afford every opportunity to lionorable members to see it.",16
64,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"In view of the statement made by the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs, does not the Minister see that it is a fair thing the House should have the information as soon as possible ?",16
65,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I do not know what the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs has said. There is nothing for blame, praise, credit, or discredit to any side about the matter. It is, on the whole, a fair arrangement to enter into-in fact, honourable members know the terms of it - and as soon as I have the opportunity I shall place the agreement on the table. SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT. Motion (by Mr. JOSEPH COOK) agreed toThat the House at its rising adjourn until 3 o'clock p.m. tomorrow. SMALL - P OX OUTBREAK .",16
66,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"Has the Prime M in ister read the crushing reply of Dr M ill a r d , the health officer for Leicester, in England, to Professor Berry's scare article on the small-pox epidemic? If so, I wish to know whether the Government are guided by Professor Rerry in maintaining the embargo that now rests on the city of Sydney and the surroundings? Mr JOSE PH COOK - I know nothing about it .",16
67,Mr EISHER,Unknown,"I would like to know if the Minister of Trade and Customs saw in the Melbourne Herald, on Saturday, a statement reported to be made by Dr Paton, the Health Officer in New South Wales, declaring that the information given to the State authorities in regard to the unfortunate woman who died in quarantine in child-birth, was not in accordance with facts; that the State authorities made the public statement that this woman did not die on account of small-pox from information received from the Federalofiicers, and that it was only after they saw the registration of the death that they were able to make the correctiou, and inform the public properly. Secondly, I ' would ask the Minister whether he now justifies his indignation at my retort that the whole truth of this matter had not been given to the"" public ?",17
68,Mr GROOM,Unknown,I certainly do justify my indignation.,17
69,Mr FISHER,Unknown,What about the report in the paper?,17
70,Mr GROOM,Unknown,The report has nothing to do with the facts. I make again this statement,17
71,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"If they are to begin this do not answer them. They ask a question, and they will not allow us to answer it .",17
72,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order !,17
73,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"My indignation was based on this ground, that honourable members made charges against the reputation of departmental officers, charges of doing things dishonest.",17
74,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order !,17
75,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"1 do not wish to in fringe the rules of the House, but I say that I had no justification whatever for disbelieving the reports that were made to me by officers of the Department, against whom charges were made which seemed to me to have no justification.",17

78,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Who had control* of this woman-the Federal or the Stateauthorities ?,17
79,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,The trouble is that youhave muddled the control.,17
80,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order 1,17

85,Mr GROOM,Unknown,Our officers are incharge of the quarantine station.,17
86,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Then why not take the responsibility ?,17
87,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"We do take the responsibility. I read a report to the HouBe,. and I said that I would cause f u r the r in quiries to be made. Those further reports are not yet to hand.",17
88,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Did our doctor or the State doctor order this woman into quarantine ?,17

92,Mr FISHER,Unknown,May I hand you the newspaper ?,17
93,Mr GROOM,Unknown,I have seen the paragraph. It was not the Commonwealth authorities who ordered this woman into quarantine.,17
94,Mr FISHER,Unknown,But they made a false report.,17
95,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I have called for a report on all the facts, and I have already told the House that as soon as this report is available it will be placed before honourable members. I may say there is no desire on the part of the officers to with that hold the slightest information. HMAS. AUSTRALIA.",17
96,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"-Can the Prime Minister inform us when the flagship Australia will enter Hobson's Bay. I ask him is it not a fact that when that vessel arrived in Sydney, the men and lads belonging to New South Wales obtained three weeks' leave; and, if so, whether the same leave will be granted to the Victorian men and lads when the flagship arrives in Hobson's Bay?",17
97,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Obviousl y these are all questions that should go on the notice-paper. I cannot answer them without inquiry. It is ridiculous to take up public time by submitting questions which honourable members know cannot be answered without inquiry. MEAT TRUST INQUEENSLAND . Mr BOYD,18

104,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! A question which has been once asked cannot be asked again in the same sitting. MILITARY POLICY.,18
105,Mr BOYD,Unknown,I desire to ask the Minister representing the Minister of Defence whether he noticed in the newspapers this morning a statement,18
106,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"Is this another rigged up question ? - No ; the rigged up stuff was all right, though. The statement in newspaper is that a meeting of t h i r t y officers of the Defence Force had decided to try to alter a determination of the Minister of Defence.",18
107,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,What determination?,18
108,Mr BOYD,Unknown,I wish to know whether House or the officers of the Defence Department are to be responsible for the military policy of this country.,18
109,Mr KELLY,Unknown,I shall have inquiries made into this matter immediately. ADJOURNMENT (Formal). SMAI.L-POX OUTBREAK.,18
110,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable memtimes ber for East Sydney has handed me a Budletter stating it is his intention to move the adjournment of the House to call attention to a matter of urgent public i m portance, namely, "" the continued quarantine embargo on Sydney."" Five honourable - members having risen Question proposed.",18
111,Mr WEST,Unknown,"East Sydney) [3.35] - I regret exceedingly that I have to again bring before honourable members the case of the woman who died at the Sydney Quarantine Station, because nobody is more sensitive than I am about nbringing the bereavement of the family continually before the public. On the I 30th August last the Sydney Morning the Herald and newspapers throughout Australia reported that the woman had died the Sydney Quarantine Station, and the cause of death was heart trouble, owing to shock, and that prior to death she was delivered of a child. That, in my opinion is a true statement of the of death. I went over to Sydney, where I made further inquiries, and found that those connected with the Health Department are still of the opinion that the death was owing to heart failure in the circumstances. I may mention that that opinion is ""confirmed to a considerable extent by statements made by the husband and the sister of the deceased woman. She was a delicate woman, they said, and on a previous occasion a child died. The last child she gave birth to was a healthy one, and, according to a statement made to me by Dr Paton, there was every possibility of the child living. It does seem strange that nothing was known about the woman's death until Mr . Trivett, the registrar, saw a report in the newspaper. He went round to the office of the Health Department, where he learned that death had occurred from shock, as stated in the Sydney Morning Herald of 30th September and the newspapers throughout Australia. The statement which the Minister made the other day came as a surprise to every one who had been watching the course of events. According to a statement. I have received from Dr Paton, the lady, who was in the "" r as h "" stage of the epidemic, that is, in the convalescent stage, was able to walk to the motor car which took her to the place of departure for the Quarantine Station, and that hers was simply one of those miid cases where there was no possibility of death occurring from that particular disease. I believe that the medical officer would not have removed the woman had she been known to be in that state when, we understand, it would be undesirable to shift her. Until last Friday, the Minister had not given us any information concerning this occurrence, nor were the public made aware of any facts in connection with it . It seems strange that the Minister should manifest surprise at the suggestion that a mistake has been made, and that he should seem inclined to doubt the wisdom of his officers. I believe that reports were made to the Board of Health that death was due to heart failure, the result of shock, and that the certificate given was that death was due to small-pox.",18
112,Mr GROOM,Unknown,Does the honourable member say that a certificate was given that death was due to any other cause?,19
113,Mr WEST,Unknown,"I am only pointing out that the Minister evidently learned with surprise that this woman died, not from heart failure due to shock, but from small-pox. I have taken this action because I desire to remove from the minds of the people of Australia any fear regarding what may happen if the quarantine embargo be removed. If the fact that in this case a certificate of death from small-pox was given is to be used as a reason for extending the proclamation, a great injustice 'will be done to the citizens of Sydney. Seeing that, u n t i l last week, we were in ignorance of the fact that the death of this lady was certified to as being due to small-pox, it seems strange that the Minister should now make a statement entirely at variance with all previous utterances on the question. I should like the Minister to give us the reason for this change of front on his part. I would remind him that the deceased lady, on being removed to quarantine, was sent into hospital because she was suffering from heart trouble. Whether this incident has arisen from the joint Eederal and State control, I do not know, but the Minister cannot divest himself of the responsibility for the present position of Sydney in the matter of quarantine. He cannot put the blame on his officers. He must take the responsibility.",19
114,Mr GROOM,Unknown,He has done so all along.,19
115,Mr WEST,Unknown,"The Minister has been told that there is no necessity to continue the embargo, and I fail to see why he should urge that the death of this unfortunate woman warrants its continuance. I saw Dr Paton while in Sydney, and he is of opinion that the statement first made as to the cause of death in this case is the correct one.",19
116,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,What was the first statement ?,19
117,Mr WEST,Unknown,"That death was due to heart failure, the result of shock.",19
118,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,Cause d by her removal to quarantine ?,19
119,Mr WEST,Unknown,"I cannot say that. I have moved the adjournment of the House because I think the question is one of great importance, and that the continuance of the embargo is a very serious matter. Unless there is solid ground for its continuance, it should be removed without further delay. Statements have been made to me by a member of the medical profession which I am not prepared to make public, but I shall be glad to acquaint the Minister privately of their purport. If the lionorable gentleman would visit Sydney,-- I think that, with the assistance of myself and others, he would soon be convinced that lie was making a mistake in failing to withdraw the proclamation. I have said from the first that an error of judgment has been committed in quarantining Sydney, and I still hold that opinion. I believe this unfortunate woman would have been alive today had she not been removed to the Quarantine Station. There was no real necessity for her removal. I do not wish to make too much of the information I have regarding this unfortunate case. The lady had friends who loved her, some of whom live not far from me, and it is because of a desire not to wound their feelings that I refrain from going more full y into details. trust that the Minister wil l be a little more careful in f u t u r e ; that he will that he has authentic authority for the statements he makes, and that, unless he has really good ground for doing so, he will not issue a"" quarantine proclamation such as he issued in the case of the Sydney outbreak, i u the event of a scare in any other part of the Commonwealth.",19
120,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"West Sydney) [3.47]. - I do not desire to detain the House at any length in regard to this matter, but the time has arrived when the Minister might very well approach it from a fresh point of view, and, without panic or bias, consider the subject on its merits. layman, of course, approaches the whole question with great trepidation, since he knows little or nothing about it . What we do know is that we are menaced by a most dreadful scourge, which, happily, in this case, has proved very much less fatal than heretofore. The Minister and his colleagues in the Cabinet have acted on the advice of the Director of Quarantine, but I hope that the honourable gentleman will have some regard for the opinion which is now beginning to manifest itself as to the exact value of vaccination and the value ofquarantine as distinguished from vaccination. I want to put the matter shortly to the Minister as it occurs to me. The honourable gentleman has acted on the advice of his medical adviser. If he be incompetent to give advice, naturally the position of the Government is a most unenviable one. I do not suggest that that is so at all. The Government are in this matter in the same position as is the layman in regard to a matter of law. The layman takes the lawyer's advice, frequently, no doubt, to his utter undoing; but he has uo alternative. Although the Government have acted as the Director of Quarantine has advised, there seems to be grave reason for believing that the course of action which that officer has suggested is not warranted by the circumstances. Eirst of all, I wish to deal with vaccination, presuming that to be a matter clearly within the jurisdiction of the States- a presumption which I do not altogether admit. In regard to vaccination, which is now under State control, the position taken up by the Government is that the quarantine of Sydney is to be continued until such a proportion of the people of that city are vaccinated as will minimize I the danger to the other States, or, failing that, u n t i l the epidemic has died. down. see Although the Minister seems to deny, that proposition, the Board of Health of New South Wales appears to think that one of the most effective ways of shortening the period of quarantine is to vaccinate all who can be vaccinated in the State of New South Wales. That brings us directly to the question: Is vaccination a preventive of small-pox, and, if so, whether infantile vaccination alone is a preventive? If it is not, is there any possibility of making adult vaccination compulsory in that State? I have seen today a letter from the A Medical Officer of Health for Leicester, which I commend to the Minister of Trade and Customs. The statements made therein can scarcely be refuted, because they deal with matters which clearly came within the scope of the doctor's personal observation. We must assume that they are facts which will bear investigation. They prove, in the clearest possible way, that unvaccinated Leicester has had, for the last t h i r ty years, an experience which shows that, without vaccination, the death rate from small-pox has not exceeded 2 per annum. Adul t vaccination was not practised there, but infantile vaccination at one period was general, and practically every infant was vaccinated. At this period, when infantile vaccination had been practised for many years, an epidemic swept over the town, resulting in very high mortality indeed. I direct the attention of the Minister especially to this statementDuring the four years i86S-rS7r, the registered vaccinations amounted to 87 per cent, of the births, the infant death, of course, accounting for much of the deficiency. The then medical officer of health for the town, in his annual reports for the years 1S69 ancl 1S70, was able to state that vaccination had been "" sedulously attended to,"" and he claimed the comparative immunity of the town from small-pox as evidence of the effect of vaccination. He goes on to say, however, that an epidemic swept the town, with most disastrous results. They then abolished compulsory vaccination, and the results for thirty years placed before us are of a most convincing type, and all point to the fact that infantile vaccination is not a preventive of small-pox. The doctor further saysI t is quite true that in Leicester (as elsewhere) recently, vaccinated persons, which, of course, includes the small-pox hospital staff, do not take small-pox. Moreover, contacts who are willing to submit to the operation immediately a case of small-pox is discovered in a house, usually escape. This fact greatly minimizes the danger of postponing vaccination until the need for it really arises, which, in the case of the great majority of people, it probably never will do. We are not able to express any opinion about this, we must accept the facts.",20
121,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,What does the honourable gentleman suggest ?,21
122,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"That is the opinion of Dr Millard, medical officer of Leicester.",21
123,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Has the honourable gentleman any suggestion to make? We should be glad to hear it if he has.,21
124,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"We have to deal, not with the facts we want, but with facts as they are. I am not expressing any opinion. I am not an opponent of vaccination by any manner of means. No man appreciates more than I do the fact that the advances of medical science during the last twenty-five years have been largely along the line of inoculation by - a serum of one kind or another. I am - dealing with the facts as they are set out in this letter, and as they seem to me to .apply to our present circumstances. Dr Millard further saysThere is another fact which the experience of Leicester has demonstrated, viz., that persons . who have once been vaccinated, say, in infancy, and who have not renewed the protection by re-vaccination, are very apt to take the disease in a highly modified form, which is very apt to be - overlooked. These unrecognised cases 'have been a most f r u it f u l means of spreading tion. So much is this the case .that I consider that it would be much more accurate to describe 'the once-vaccinated, rather than the unvaccinated, as those who are the real danger to the community. That is a most startling statement.",21
125,Mr GROOM,Unknown,Does the honourable gen'tleman know the reason?,21
126,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"The Minister's opinion on the subject is not worth anything, any more than mine is. I only ask him to refer the statements made here to the Director of Quarantine. If there be any room for hesitation or doubt, medical men should be asked to assure the community. It may be that the experience we are going through now, and the scare about vaccination, are really unwarranted by the present trouble, and that vaccination is not by any means a preventive. In England, where for centuries small-pox has been endemic as well as epidemic, during 1906, 1907, 1908, 1909, and 1910, there was not one death from the disease, although infantile vaccination is compulsory in some places, though not in all. On the other hand, there have been a number of deaths frpm vaccination. That fact is now perfectly established. England has held small-pox at bay without the universal compulsory vaccination and adult re-vaccination, which, according to the German theory, and the opinion of Dr Cumpston, are essential to the prevention wf the disease. Por five years there has not been one death from small-pox in a community of over 40,000,000 persons, but, on the other hand,there have been many deaths directly attributable to vaccination. The statements of Dr Millard are likely to be correct, because they relate to facts that came under his own eyes, and about which as a professional man he should be competent to ""speak. He is certainly not an anti-vaccinationist, because he states that he took his infant child, and his wife, who had been newly vaccinated, to the bedside of a confluent small-pox patient, to demonstrate that vaccination duly performed confers temporary immunity. I come now to the subject of quarantine. Sydney has been quarantined because of the small-pox outbreak there; but quarantine has not been found necessary to check the spread of the disease in England. When there is small-pox in London, the greatest port in the world, or in Liverpool, it is not thought necesinfec- sary to resort to quarantine, and there have been no deaths in England from small-pox for the last five or six years. In the face of Dr Millard's statements, I ask Ministers to obtain authority to corroborate Dr Cumpston's opinion, if they intend to persist in their present action.",21
127,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,What authority?,22
128,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"A Commission, consisting of a medical man and two competent laymen, not members of Parliament, should be appointed to ascertain what is the practice in other parts of the world, - and what is necessary to be done here to safeguard, the health of the citizens of Australia.",22
129,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"Gwydir) [4.5] - This afternoon, I attempted to ask a series of questions dealing with this subject, but, by a rulingof Mr Speaker, I was prevented from doing so. Dr Millard is recognised as one of the ablest and most experienced authorities on small-pox in England. In today's Argus is published a letter written by him in reply to extravagant statements published in that journal some time ago upon the author it y of Professor Berry, of Melbourne. Professor Berry spoke of the efficacy of vaccination, and the need for it , but, in doing so,, he used language which would be discreditable to even an ordinary medical man, and. wasmuch more so to one-occupying the position of a professor in this great country. He made statements such as, if made by me in .this House, Mr Speaker would rule out of order, I believe. His statements were of a highly dangerous character, and in the nature of a scaremonger's efforts. Dr Millard read Professor Berry's letter, and has now replied to it . When the matter was being discussed some time ago, the Minister of Trade and Customs mentioned with great pride that Professor Berry was behind Dr Cumpston in his anxiety to place the case of vaccination before the public in such, a manner that they must accept the dictum of the Quarantine Department. Dr M ill a rd has been Public Health Officer of Leicester for many years, and I have never in my life seen a man so humiliated as Professor Berry has been by his reply. Among the statements of Professor Berry was this, that the great industrial centreof Leicester, at one timea thoroughly vaccinated town, relaxed its laws in regard to vaccination, or permitted them to fall into disuse, and was then visited by an epidemic of small-pox, resulting in the death of two-thirds of its infan t population. Can one imagine a man in the responsible position occupied by university professors,, to whom the public look for light and leading, making a statement like that, in face of the facts set forward in Dr Millard's reply? Dr Millard says that, prior to 1868 and 1869, 92 per cent, of the people of Leicester had been thoroughly vaccinated,, the town being considered one of .the best vaccinated in the country, but that, in 1872, an epidemic of small-pox laid low a very large number of its citizens, 346 succumbing in one year. A f t e r 1872, the people of Leicester, seeing that vaccination did not prevent death from smallpox, but that the population had died in greater numbers when vaccinated than when unvaccinated, found that it was time to give up vaccination, and they allowed it to go by the board. Prosecutions were instituted against people who neglected, to comply with the law, and the penalty was paid by the people rather than comply with the law, which they regarded as a danger. Owing to the people continuing to pay the penalties the authorities allowed the law to fall into disuse, and vaccination became a dead letter in that town. From 1872 right on the town has taken every precaution to meet this great scourge by sanitation, by isolation, by localizing the disease, and by treating it in a manner that is generally more in accord with the most advanced scientific ideas of the day. Sine? that time they have had three epidemics brought into the town of Leicester, and, as Dr M ill a rd says, they were brought from localities where people were still being vaccinated. These epidemics were of a more or less severe character. Tn the whole of them, occurring as they did in a practically unvaccinated community, where only 12 per cent, of the people were vaccinated, there were only sixteen deaths of children under fifteen years of age in the first epidemic; in the second, ten; and in the third , three. A l together, since they have allowed vaccination to fal l into disuse,, there bave been only fifty-four deaths, ornot two deaths per year, in an industrial population of 230,000, whereas, in the one epidemic in 18-72 there were 346 deaths in the epidemic. Y e t Professor Berry hastheaudacity to put before-the people of this country a statement that two-thirdsof the infant life of the town of Leicester had been sacrificed owing to neglect to apply the law of compulsory vaccination. Can oneimagine anything more unjustifiable than for a man in Professor Berry'sposition to make an irresponsible statement of that kind at a time when peoplewere being driven to the shambles to be vaccinated by an unsympathetic Government, and by the head of a Department who, in my judgment, has neither the experience, nor the age, nor the study, nor the knowledge necessary to guide the destinies of a big country like this on a great question of this character? I say this without any hesitation, and without any disrespect whatever; but let honourable members compare Dr Cumpston with Dr Millard.",22
130,Mr GROOM,Unknown,Do you know anything about Dr Millard?,23
131,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"I quoted his experience in my other speeches in this House. He is, and has been for many years, the public health officer for the town of Leicester.",23
132,Mr GROOM,Unknown,Do you know what degrees he holds?,23
133,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"He signs himself M.D., D.Sc, but I do not take the number of letters that follow a man's name as an indication of his ability, or of how much he can comprehend of a subject. I would rather judge a man by his experience, and by the way in which he is regarded by the authorities who write upon a question. There is hardly an authority who discusses the question of vaccination or small-pox that does not quote Dr Millard as one of the persons who have made a thorough research into this question, and, indeed, discovered that it is not vaccination that is going to move the epidemic of small-pox, but sanitation and cleanliness, that the laws of health have to be attended to, and that when a case of small-pox occurs, instead of merely vaccinating the contacts and letting them go far and wide throughout the community, they must be isolated.",23
134,Mr GROOM,Unknown,The Commonwealth has done nothing to prevent that being done.,23
135,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,It is all very well for the Minister to shelter behind the .State authorities.,23

141,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"Where there is dual control, and the superior power, such as the Commonwealth, takes upon itself to proclaim 15 miles as an infected area in a way that no law ""allows any State Government to do, it practically enforces vaccination, without any authority to do it. The Government set vaccination going as a cure for variola, and from 100,000 to 200,000 people who otherwise would not have been vaccinated were forced into vaccination by the action of the Minister of Trade and Customs and his officers.",23
142,Mr RILEY,Unknown,Do you know of any other place where there have been so many cases of small-pox and so few deaths?,23
143,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"The answer to that lies in what Dr Millard says in reply to Professor BerryPersons who have been once vaccinated, say', in infancy, and who have not renewed the protection by re-vaccination, are apt to take the disease in a highly modified form, which is very apt to be overlooked. These unrecognised cases have been a most f r u it f u l means of spreading infection.

144,Mr GROOM,Unknown,In what way?,23
145,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"He is not altogether opposed to vaccination, as I am, for I le- consider that the remedy is a thousand times worse than the disease; but he says that recent vaccination is the only thing which has any virtue in it . Mr AUSTI N CHAPMAN - They will "" h a v e"" you again.",23
146,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"I detest any one who treats this matter in a jocular way. It is a question of life and death to this country, and there is no room-for laughter at the suffering and grief that it has produced in the State to which I belong. The subject is far too serious for jocularity, and it ill becomes members to treat ib in a light way. Dr Millard lays ib down that where a person has been vaccinated in infancy, he is liable to take small-pox in a mild form. He says that that is where the danger lies, as such persons are allowed to go abroad and spread the disease among others, whereby it is likely to become malignant, which, however, is not the experience in New South Wales today. - Mr SPEAKER - The honourable member's time has expired.",23

Naturally, we all approach a subject like this.with the greatest sympathy and feeling, and I am sorry that conflict has arisen about this unfortunate death.

187,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,Do you endorse the removal of a woman in that condition ?,28
188,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The step was taken on medical advice. At least the woman was received at the Quarantine Station on medical advice. But, until I know the full facts, I cannot judge; and I do not see how any lionorable member is in a position to judge, unless he knows the whole of the facts and circumstances. It is not correct that the woman died within twenty-four hours of admission. She was in the Quarantine Station three days before her death occurred, and the Federal authorities are in no way responsible for any imputation that can be made as regards the cause of death. I have a copy of the certificate of death, and the report from the officer in charge of the Quarantine Station. The certificate of death was given on 29th August, 1913, and the causes are set out as-Primary , variola (that is, small-pox); secondary, confinement. Last Friday, speaking from memory, I said that the predisposing cause was confinement, but that the determining cause was small-pox. bably the patient would not have died from either cause; but the combination of the two brought about her death.",28
189,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,Do think the hustling about caused the woman's death?,28
190,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Le t me read the report of Dr Reid, the officer in charge of the Quarantine Station; and I take advantage of the opportunity to lay before honourable members the complete detailed report fro m this officer, together with the certificate of death. The report proceedsSydney, 20 October, 1913 - I am forwarding a joint report from Drs. Robertson and Heydon, who were in attendance on Mrs Martin when she died. She was suffering from semiconfluent small-pox, and her condition was aggravated owing to her pregnant condition. She was confined of a full-time male child, which survived, and who developed a small-pox eruption five days after birth. Despite every care and medical attention, Mrs Martin collapsed, and died at 3 p.m. on August 29th, three days after admission to the station. Pregnancy, combined with an eruptive fever, especially one like small-pox, is always matter for mother and child, and deaths frequently occur. Several of the patients admitted to the station who aborted also showed collapse, but, owing to skilful medical and attention, recovered. As 932 patients have been admitted to the station since the beginning of the outbreak, and only one death has occurred, it speaks well for the care and attention bestowed by the resident staff. As the patients, with few exceptions, were unvaccinated, this in itself constitutes a record, considering that 'a quarantine station has not the equipment of a fever hospital, but was merely intended for a maritime quarantine station. No written communication with reference to Mrs Martin's death was forwarded to the Board of Health, but Dr Heydon informed me that Dr Paton spoke to him on the telephone, and at that time he was not quite certain as to the cause of death, pulmonary embolism being considered a probable cause. However, a fosl-mortem examination was subsequently made, with the consent of the husband, and the cause of death \v.i.s ns stated in the accompanying death certificate. That certificate I have read to the House.",28

192,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The State Board of. Health finds out the cases of small-pox, and sends them on to the Quarantine Station.",28
193,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,Hav e we no record of the name of the doctor who ordered her to the Quarantine Station?,28
194,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I have asked for that information, and I hope it will be here Pro- tomorrow. The State authorities have been asked for it . This discussion has been brought on prematurely, and I can only give the information to hand. The you not death certificate says that the cause of death was primarily variola. Dr Reid's report continuesAt present 42 patients aTe in the hospital, and 121 convalescents. The epidemic does not appear to be on the decrease, and w i ll continue as long ns the community remains unvaccinated. None of the staff (122) working on the station have contracted the disease, though in daily contact with the patients. This speaks volumes for the efficiency of recent successful vaccination, and is the only safeguard against small-pox. C. W. REID, C.Q.O.G.",28
195,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"All I have to say is, that if she had died after vaccination and confinement, they would have said that the primary cause of death was confinement, and that the secondary cause was vaccination.",28
196,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"On many matters I would unhesitatingly accept the honourable member's opinion; but in these matters, I must confess, I have to accept the certificate which is furnished by the doctor a serious who was in charge of the case.",28
197,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,I do not deny that.,28
198,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The form of certificate, too, is one following the rules laid down for such cases by an International Commission in 1903. The proper medical procedure has been followed. As regards this particular case, honourable members will see that the statements have been t r u l y made., The statement. I made in the House last week, as furnished by the Director of Quarantine, was a strong and honest statement of the exact position of the case. Honourable members must admit that the question was only answered at their request, and not for any administrative reason. Honourable members asked for information, and, of course, of necessity there was an obligation upon me to supply it . When I am asked a question I must frankly state the facts of the case, as I did in this instance. There are one or two matters I wish to reffcr to. The honourable member for Gwydir has advocated very strongly that the proper way of dealing with small-pox is by isolation and the taking away of the contacts. May I repeat again that our very first announcement to the House was, that, so far as the treatment of the disease was local, we were leaving that entirely in the hands of the State authorities to attend to. I have not criticised,, I have abstained from criticising, because when we are in the face of a great peril, the aim of Parliament should be to give to officers every possible encouragement i u dealing, with the matter, ahd not to put any harassing conditions in their way. A criticism of a sympathetic, helpful nature, of course, is in vited, and wherever anything has gone wrong our attention should be directed to the f a c t ; but the honourable member for Gwydir has attacked us simply because we passed a regulation with the object of preventing the spread of the disease into the other States. We left it to the State Government to use all the powers they possessed to try to suppress the disease within the State. If , however, the proper way of dealing with small-pox-and . it is a purely local problem calling for immediate suppressionis the application of the methods which the honourable member for Gwydir and the honourable member for East Sydney have suggested, their arguments might very well be directed against other persons, but they constitute absolutely no foundation for an attack against this Government;",29
199,Mr WEBSTEE,Unknown,"We have no voice in-, the State Parliament.",29
200,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"No ; but the honourable member directed his attack against this Government, as though we were responsible for what took place in the administration of the State laws. That is w h y I find f a u l t with his criticism.",29
201,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,D u a l control is the trouble.,29
202,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The honourable membercan attack that question; but, unfortunately, he directed the whole of his contention, not against the dual control, butagainst the administration of the Act by the Department, operating in the Federal sphere purely. The honourable member has quoted Dr Millard as an eminent expert, and asked us to accept him as one of the best authorities. If , in a Federal sphere, I were to take Dr M i l lard, and say, "" Will you tell us what is the best and most effective means we can adopt to prevent the spread of this diseasein the other States",29
203,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,What is applied throughout the civilized world.,29
204,Mr GROOM,Unknown,That is not what we have to deal with . We have a local problem to solve with our own machinery.,29
205,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,Is there one placethroughout the world which. . appliesquarantine in the way that we are doing ?,29
206,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"-Yes , Alaska. Smallpox exists throughout the United States, and the authorities havepracticallyquarantined the whole of the States, and no one is allowed to go intoAlaska without being vaccinated. The same thing obtains in regard to Canada. No immigrant can go to the Unite d States of America or Canada without being vaccinated.",29

208,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I have only a few minutes more at my command. Let it be remembered that all that we require by our regulation is that persons coming from a restricted area of 15 miles from the Sydney Post Office into another State shall have been successfully vaccinated. Let us see the value and' the efficacy of that regulation. Let us take Dr Millard's own statementI claim to have quite as stronga faith in the value of recent vaccination in affording complete, though temporary, immunity against small-pox as Professor Berry himself.",29
209,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Thaf c is, the vaccinated person.",30

216,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,"Denison) [5.2]. - On Friday, when the Prime Minister was kind enough fco allow progress to be reported to enable me to continue my remarks today, I was dealing with the attitude taken up by honourable members on the other side. Briefly, I want to continue that line of argument, and point out that, without consulting the honourable member for Grey as to his motive in submitting his amendment, I am of the opinion that he had something more in view. say that his object was to bring under the notice of the electors of Australia the attitude taken up by the honourable member for Wakefield, the honourable member for Echuca, the honourable member for Wannon, the honourable member for Calare, and others, when we were dealing with the expenditure of money on the Capital site. [82] ",30
217,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,"Honourable members are reported to have repeatedly said that the Fisher Government were responsible for a huge, wasteful expenditure on theCapital site. I do not think that thosecritics gave to the matter the be consideration which it warranted, seeing that every form of information had been the placed at their, disposal by the Minister in - and the ex-Minister of Home Affairs. methodI n the limited time at my disposal I have made a careful search to see if It . could find in the records of a State Parliament in Australia, the Parliament of Canada or America, or even Great B r i tain, a schedule giving the detailed in has exformation that is contained in this one, but I could not find such an in Gostance. Still, honourable members occupying the Government benches today went out into the country,, and, purely for party purposes, said that the Fisher Government had spent huge sums without in forming this House as to how the money wasbeing expended, and that there was nothing, but w ' l f u l waste going on throughout Australia. I think that the member for Grey desires to expose these honourable gentlemen to their constituents, and compel them, when they seek their suffrages again, at any rate to stick to their statements-. ",30
218,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,"Exactly . If that was the intention of the honourable member-and I do not say it was-al though I am opposed to his amendment, I commend him for taking thatcourse, because I think it is unjust to the officers of the Department, and unfair to this great Commonwealth,, that any honourable members should, purely for political purposes, go out. into the country, and, instead of enlightening the people, try to the best of their ability to mislead them. In my humble opinion, no matter what I presume to the Fisher Government did, it was, in the eyes of those honourable members. I have quoted, not conducive to the welfare of the people of Australia. If honourable members on the other side were consistent, they would simply come across and support the amendment of the honourable member for Grey. Although on the hustings they distinctly told the people that-, they did not believe in this expenditure on the Capital site, still they have not the courage to come over to this side and support a proposal with which they should be quite in agreement. What did they *do at the elections 1 Purely for political poses again-to deceive the people-some body has suggested to a young member of the House that he should bring forward a motion that a Committee be formed to inquire into this expenditure. If the honourable gentleman was consistent, why did he not, when these Estimates were first distributed, give notice to the Government of his intention to submit such a proposal ? What he proposes to do is to submit a motion of want of confidence in the Treasurer.",30
219,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,That is your interpretation.,31
220,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,"The Treasurer is responsible for the expenditure of the Commonwealth money. He is the custodian of the public finances, and must be well informed; otherwise,-1 take i the would have applied the pruning-knife long before the Estimates were presented to the House. Evidently he has been in formed by his responsible advisers, namely, the Minister and the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs. The Government put two Ministers at the head of the Home Affairs Department, in my humble opinion, to make a searching inquiry to see whether any rash expenditure had been incurred, but after five months' search and going diligently into every item of expenditure by the late Government, we find the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs admitting that nothing of a serious nature has happened in connection with the expenditure under that Department. In fact, when the honourable member for Franklin was speaking here about the expenditure, the Minister interjected, "" That is not correct."" The action of the honourable member for Wannon implies that he has no confidence in the Government, and so he desires an opportunity to go on the platform, and say to misguided constituents, "" I did this on the floor of the House.""",31
221,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"The honourable member is not in order in referring to anything which the lionorable member for Wannon proposes to do. I may say that the latter has given notice of an amendment, but that is not before the Committee at present.",31
222,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,"I have simply made these remarks because the honourable member for Wakefield was allowed to refer to the question and say what pur- he was going to do, and, as he continued that line of argument, I naturally thought that I had an equal right.",31
223,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,The honourable member has the right to make an incidental reference only.,31
224,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,I shall certainly conform to the ruling of the Chair.,31
225,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,You may have two more half hours when the honourable member for Wannon plucks up sufficient courage to submit his motion.,31
226,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,"Yes . Passing on to another question, we have been repeatedly told that no information about the expenditure on the Capital site has been supplied. Taking up at haphazard Schedule No. 11, issued by the ex-Minister of Home Affairs on the 31st October, 1912, I find that he sets out in detail the whole of the expenditure that had taken place on the Capital site, the exact payments to the hands engaged on the construction of roads and engineering works, and the number of hands employed, namely, 252. Time will not permit of my reading the whole statement, but honourable members will find in the Schedule details as to the wages paid to each man. I have been unable to find that the Victorian Government, or the Government of my own State, where day labour is employed in the construction of railways, have at any time brought down a statement showing the daily wages paid. The information given in the Schedule shows how unfair is the criticism in which honourable members opposite indulged when they were in the back blocks, and thought that their statements were not likely to be reported. In fact, I am inclined to think that some of them, when criticising the expenditure of the Fisher Government during the election campaign, never expected to be returned to this House, and to be exposed to the searchlight of the Opposition. I wish to show the electors how unfair were many of their utterances. The Minister of Home Affairs, with his understudy-the Assistant Minister-is continuing the excellent example set by the ex-Minister in publishing the departmental'Schedule, in which full details of expenditure are givenWe find from a perusal of it that the present Ministry have spent but a small amount in wages in the Territory. 'Most of the expenditure has related to the purchase of land, as the following statement will showNA TERRITORY. Lands compulsorily acquired by the Commonwealth ... ... 97,312 Alienated lands ... ... 86,134 ,, In process of alienation ... 81,239 Area under lease under State laws ... ... ... 248,206 ,, Unoccupied Crown lands, including roads ... ... 55)336 >Total area ... ... 568,227 Then, again, I find that the Government are paying for the educatiou ofchildrenin the Territory, and have also made arrangements for a medical officer to be located there. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro said that buildings had been erected in the middle of certain avenues, but he forgot to tell the Committee that they are but temporary structures. He refrained also from mentioning the important fact that the plans of the city were not to hand when the erection of those buildings was first suggested. The revenue derived by the Government from properties within the Territory, including that derivable from rates, which amounts to £1,943, is estimated, according to the Schedule, at £5,000. These lands will go on increasing in value as the population of the Territory increases, and surely honourable members have more faith in their country than to say that we cannot afford to establish another city in this great Commonwealth. I agree with the M i nister of Home Affairs that, by means of the unearned increment, we shall obtain a ten-fold return from what we have expended upon the acquisition of land in the Territory. Another point to be remembered is that, during the Fisher M in istry's term of office, the expenditure on the Federal Capital resulted in large orders being placed with various firms in the different States for the supply of material. If the present Ministry give the people as good a return for their money as the-Fisher Government did, I am satisfied that the citizens of Australia will be well satisfied. The Schedule shows that orders have been placed with Tasmanian firms for the supply of 50,000 and 125,000 superficial feet of celery-top [82]- 2 pine, 60,000 superficial feet of Tasmanian blackwood, and other Tasmanian timbers; while Messrs. G. and C. Hoskins Limited , of New South Wales, have been given a contract for the supply of cast-iron water pipes at £53,817 . This, and much other information regarding the expenditure on the Capital, will be found in the Schedule, and I challenge even the honacres. orable member for Wimmera to show that » auy one item is unjustifiable. Is it not unjust for honourable members, merely for political purposes, to try to deceive the people of Australia- to make them believe that there has been rash expenditure at the Federal Capital. The Minister of Home Affairs and the Assistant Minister deserve credit for continuing the ]5ublicatiou of the Schedule, in which the expenditure on the Federal Capital is given i u the details I have mentioned. The honourable member for Moreton, who smiles, knows more about the lighting of the Queensland coast than he does of the Federal Capital, and I would advise him and other members opposite to make themselves familiar with the information given in the Schedule before they ask for a Committee of Inquiry in regard to the Federal Capital expenditure. We have in the Departmental Schedule fuller particulars than any Committee of laymen could'give us - During the last three and a half years the expenditure of the Department of Home Affairs has been unprecedented, but it has been incurred in the work of developing the Commonwealth. The officers have shown con-* spicuous ability, and, with the assistance of the ex-Minister, have raised the Department to a very h i g h' state of efficiency. I question whether any private company in Australia has a better organized service. But no private company subjects its officers to such criticism as that to which the officers of this Department have to submit in this Parliament. The shipping companies, for instance show by their reports that every consideration is extended to their officers, and I think that honourable members ought to do the same. I am reminded by the honourable member for Grey that when the division takes place we shall be able to judge of the consistency of honourable members opposite who have complained of rash expenditure in the Federal Capital. In the September issue of the Departmental Schedule particulars are given regarding ithe brick works established Minister .of Home Affairs. thatPreliminary brick-making plant has been established, and over 250,000 bricks have been made - to date. These are being burned in ordinary open kilns, and will be used in the constructhe tion of the main kilns to be built shortly. Further prospecting has been steadily pursued, disclosing satisfactory results as regards and quality of shale deposits. gress has been made in research for suitable building stones in a promising granite quarry at Thawa. The site has been opened it is hoped that some fair-sized blocks will obtained suitable for polishing.",31
227,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,Is there anything said about a nnd of water?,33
228,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,"During the temporary absence of the honourable ber, the Assistant Minister of Home A fairs said that there was a water supply capable of giving a city of 60,000 i habitants 60 gallons per head per day.",33
229,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I said that on the averof technical and trained minds. age the supply would be at least five times that much. The lowest yield from Cotter, during the three years of which we have a record, was sufficient to supply -66,000 and odd people with -60 gallons per head per day.",33
230,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,"I think that is - sufficient for the honourable member. Under the heading of "" Progress of gineering Works,"" we have the following statement at page 96 of the ScheduleProgress in road maintenance and development generally has been well maintained. pended are figures indicating 'the actual done in this connection since the roads taken over two years ago :-Formin g and > g> 50 miles; gravelling and metalling, 48 n miles; putting out maintenance .gravel, cubic yards; clearing out, repairing culverts, sistance of the middle-man. &c, 160 miles; general road repairs, - filling ruts, & c , 145 miles; cutting water tables, drains, & c , 106 miles; Cotter-road formation, -6 miles complete.

I trust that able members opposite, before they again take up the time of the Committee in asking for a Committee of Inquiry, garding the expenditure on the Federal labour. Capital, will peruse the information althat, ready given to them by the Department. I hope that they will not let their party proximates £713,201 , prejudices so blind them to their duty in their desire to pile up still further penditure by means of the appointment - of a Committtee of Inquiry, that they will disregard the detailed information already available.

I do nob 'think there is any member of this House so egotistical as to claim that, because he is made a member of a Committee, he is Enrendered capable of passing an opinion on the work carried out by these officers, much less of suggesting works which should be carried out. We are getting Apgood value for our money from our pubwork lic servants. The great trouble with' honwere orable members opposite is that the work finishat the Federal Capital has been carried 25,525 out by day labour, and without the asThe conup tractor has not been allowed to get his little b it out of it . If the departmental officers had been asked, only to submit estimates of cost, and then to supervize addibhe work of contractors, there would have been no objection urged by honourable honor- - members opposite. Their complaint really is against the Fisher Government for having introduced the system of constructing republic works, where practicable, by day It should not be forgotten included in the expenditure upon the Federal Capital, which apthere is the expenditure on the Naval and M i l i extary Colleges, and expenditure incidental to the selection of the Capital site. T-he - expenditure upon the Naval and Militar y Colleges would have been undertaken whether we were building a Federal Capital or not. Honourable members should set aside their parochial State prejudices, and for once realise that they are Australians. We cannot develop one part of the Commonwealth without benefiting the whole. I am anxious that the Capital should be built, because I realise that Tasmanian timber will enter very largely into its construction, and the State from which I come will thereby be given an advertisement that will prove invaluable, and will have no difficulty in disposing of her very excellenttimbers. The constituency represented by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports has benefited largely during a slack time by considerable expenditure upon the cast-iron pipes which are being used at the Capital city, and which liave been manufactured in the honourable member's electorate. The whole of the States have benefited in the same way. I cannot understand why the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs, after listening tto the bitter criticism of this vote by honourable members on his own side, did not rise to the occasion, and .make a statement from the Schedule issued by the Home Affairs Department. Was it because a great deal of money Had been expended on the Capital by the late .Government, or because the ex-Minister of 'Home Affairs initiated the publication of - the Schedule for the information of honourable members?

The Federal Parliament has recognised its obligation in this matter by endeavouring to keep this building and the Federal Government House in such a condition that when we leave for Canberra they will be in as .good a state of repair as when they were handed over to our use. This, however, does not.alter the fact that the generosity of successive '.Governments of Victoria and of the Victorian people should be f u l ly appreciated by the Federal Government and Parliament. I mention the matter now in order to .say that we should not impose upon their generosity for ever. A majority in this Parliament, accepted the responsibility of establishing the Federal Capital at Canberra. The Federal Government decided to obtain the most expert advice available in the civilized world in the matter of town planning, in .order that an ideal city might be established .at the chosen site. I wish .to say that the determination of the present Government .to secure the services of Mr Griffin, the winner of the prize d e s if i for the Federal Capital, has my endorsement. I think it is very advisable that tli6 services of the designer of the plan adopted for - the Federal Capital should be secured in carrying it out. I hope the Government will be successful in securing Mr Griffin's services; but I do not approve of the action of the Assistant Minister .of Home Affairs in pouring honey all over Mr . Grifiiu. That is not in accordance with my disposition at .all. In the .opinion of those who judged the competition, Mr . Griffin presented the most useful plan for the Federal city, .and the proposal to secure his services in order to give effect - to his ideas on town planning' is, in my opinion, a good one. His services available, and we require them, and the Commonwealth is prepared to pay for them, and that should be sufficient. There is no reason why the Minister should pour honey over him, as though he was the greatest man in the world.",34
236,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,The honourable member would prefer to pour a little acid on him.,35
237,Mr ERAZER,Unknown,"I am not in a very« sore frame of mind this afternoon, although I am not too well pleased to have to support the Government in this matter. They are so very occasionally right, however, that it would be a pity not to mention the fact when they do propose something which one can approve of.  fco which officer is to be responsible for the expenditure ab the Capital.  that the administrator of a Department cannot delegate his responsibility to any one else. He must accepb responsibiliby for his officers. The Minisberial head of the Department who is not prepared to defend his officers has an obligation thrown upon him, if he is to acb the parb of an honourable man, to remove those whom he cannot trust.  member nob see fchafc there is a dual obligation ?",35
238,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I see no dual obligagation tion in connection with this matter. The Minister of Home Affairs must accept all responsibility for the building of the Capital. It is for him to say what advice he will accept. The expenditure outlined by the Assistant Minister of Home appears to mefcobe on right lines, and that is why I am supporting the Government this matter.",35
239,Mr FENTON,Unknown,Bringin g water to the Capital.,35
240,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I am sorry to have to disagree with some of my honourable woeful friends in regard to these matters. They cannofc get away from the official returns as to the water supply at Canberra. We have the statement that for the last years the average supply of the Cotter nothing River has been sufficient to give 60 galment lons per head per day to 66,000 people. Surely that is looking a good deal into future.  ber will take the average for another three are years, he will find there was not enough water there for a sheep.",35
241,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"The expenditure proposed is to cover reservoirs, dams on the Cotter River, the establishment of brick works and cement works, the continuation of the railway, and provision for the foundations of the main buildings of the city. All these works are to be provided for out of the expenditure proposed for the year, and I do not see how the money could be more satisfactorily expended if we are to go on with the project of establishing the Federal Capital at Canberra. Believing that to be so, most people will agree with the view that if you are going to do the job, if you have made up your mind that it ought to be done, the most economical way is to go on with the work with all possible expedition. I understand that the lionorable member for Wimmera has suggested the appointment of a Committee in regard to this question. In my judgment, there is no call for a Committee at all. There is an obligation fco seefchafcfchemoney proposed on the Estimates to be expended in connection with the preliminary work of construction is satisfactorily spent, but a Committee will not assist you in that. I have made up my mind in regard to the Federal Capital site that we owe it to the people of Victoria to clear out fro m Victoria under the conditions fchafc exist at the present time. There is an oblion us under the Constitution to construct the Federal city, and we have a proposal that seems to outline all the preliminary work that is necessary to proceed economically and expeditiously with its construction. On this question I in Affairs tend to support the Government.  in tice that the honourable member for Wannon, who rose to speak, has resumed his seat. I am sorry that he is not allowed by the Government to speak. This does not come well from a Government who have been so loud in declaiming about the and w i l f u l extravagance of their predecessors. It is lamentable to see a new member not allowed to speak in connection with the expenditure of such a huge three lump sum as £285,000 . We have had yet fro m the Minister in fulfil of the vaunted' promise of last F r i day, when the honourable member for the Wannon rose and gave notice of a certain proposal to which I cannot now refer. We then fro m the Prime Minister, and I think, also fro m the Treasurer and the Honorary Minister, a statement that they were coming down with full particulars o i all expenditure that was to take place in connection with the matter, but this we have not had. In listening to the debate, one almost loses f a it h in humanity. Take, for instance, the honourable member for Echuca. He voted for Yass Canberra to hang it up, stating that he did so, as Hansard says, in order that there might be no money expended. He has denounced everything in connection with Yass-Canberra from that day to this, yet today he sits meekly behind the Government, and says that he will support this proposal as a reasonable thing. The honourable member for Wakefield went through the length and breadth of his district, frothing at the mouth, thumping every table that he stood behind, denouncing the w i l f u l and wicked extravagance of the Eisher Government on the Federal Capital site. What does he. say when faced with a proposal to spend almost double as much in one year as was spent by our Government in three years ? He says he is going to continue on the platform and everywhere else to denounce our w i l f u l extravagance, yet when a simple proposal is submitted by which he can save £147,000 in one act, he declines to support it , because the Government have told him that he must not vote in that direction. Nevertheless, he and other honourable members on that side of the House will go on to the hustings within a week after this vote is carried, and denounce the Fisher Government for their extravagant expenditure on the Capital site. Is it not about time that all that cant and hypocrisy was left behind ? Is it not 'time that honourable members opposite became honest in their politics, instead of speaking outside with one voice and speaking here with another voice, and then, so to speak, with their tongues in their cheeks, going outside this chamber after the division is taken, and speaking of how they dished the Opposition? I am going to press for a division on my amendment. There will then be a record, anyhow, to show whether these men are in earnest in their talk about extravagant expenditure. anxious to see these Estimates go through to-night, so that they may reach the Senate tomorrow, and I say to my friends, "" Do not be led into a trap tonight, but put the Estimates through, because, up to the present time, there is no blame attached to you for keeping them back."" The Government, of their own volition, adjourned the Senate, and, had the Estimates been passed here before, they could not have been proceeded with any further up to the present time. That cannot be said, however, if they are hung up after to-night; and, so far as I am concerned, they have to go through at this sitting.",35
242,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"Wannon) [5.50] When I went on to the hustings, I had the freedom of my own opinions and my own convictions on the question of the Federal Capital area, and no party or Government will rob me of them. Several honourable members, in particular the honourable member for Denison, who on Friday last galloped at a pace that would outstrip a Caulfield Cup winner, were satisfied that they knew exactly my attitude from what I said on the hustings. The honourable member is making a very rash statement, and a very poor guess in deed. So far as the Fisher Administration is concerned, I should like honourable members on the other side of the Honse to know that my attitude was such that no member of the Labour party in the country ever charged me with unfairly or improperly criticising it . Not on any occasion did I say that there had been w i l f u l extravagance in regard to the Federal Capital area, for I had not the information in my own knowledge. So far as the Federal Capital area is concerned, I consider that the highest standard of financial morality in this House, and the country generally, will not be reached until every member of the House is a jealous custodian of the people's money and a watchdog of the Treasury. The present amount has been brought down with insufficient explanation, but the Minister in charge of the Estimates has since furnished the House with certain information on the item. Since I spoke, the Treasurer and the Prime Minister have both spoken, and gave an assurance that the in formation desired would be forthcoming. I shall look forward to more definite in I am formation than has yet been placed before the House. The whole scheme of the Territory ought to be looked into as one great proposition. The development of the Capital, the development of the land in the area, and the development of the port should all go forward with such an expenditure of public money as is consistent with the revenue of this country, or, if the policy be different, be derived from loan expenditure. I am nob satisfied that this great question has as yet reached such a stage as to inspire me with absolute confidence in the fubure financial success of the I i i my opinion, the honourable member for Grey is not quite sincere.

Dr MALONEY (Melbourne) [6.7] Those who have* given consideration to*this matter will endorse what has been stated by the Prime Minister on more than one occasion, that the Federal Capital: can be built without costing the Commonwealtha single half-penny.

It was a great compliment to him that in 1901-, a Commission appointed to inquire whether Washington could be improved on, Maloney, Dr reported that it could not improve'in anyNOES'. way on the designs of the great FrenchMathews, J. man. If any' honourable member walked' down' Collins-street, and made a calcula-tionbased on the value of the groundoccupied by divisional walls, and the cost of erecting thosewalls, he would find that at"" least £250,000 had been wasted in that thoroughfare alone, so that in five' of the city streets, the waste would exceed £1,000,000, in one of the most valuableportions' of the second greatest city, of Australia-. That land is ready to the* hand of the Government, if the latter only ; cares* to' take hold of it'. Manhattan' Islandj which really constitutes New' York, was'- originally bought for' £ 5 I6s. Its value today' is over £800,000,000. - In that city, the rentals alone produce -£40,000,000 annually, and the increased land values each year represent another £40,000,000. Why, the entire gold output of the richest gold-producing country in the world today- I refer to South - Africa-adde d to that of Australia, does - not equal the yearly increase of land values in New Yor k alone. That is why ' I glory in the circumstance that our Federal Capital will be erected upon land which belongs to the community. Every building erected there will - be buil t upon Commonwealth land. I propose to show - how we can establish our Capital without borrowing a single penny for the purpose, and under a system which will provide us with a rent-producing city for all"" time. ; I intend to show how we can issue secured Federal notes as legal tender, - supplementary to gold, for the execution of reproductive and revenue-producing public works. In the island of Guernsey, eighty stalls existed originally for ""the sale of meat i u the streets. They were built in the old-fashioned way, which caused them to interfere with the street traffic. Mr . John Jacob, in his Annals of British Norman Isles, tells usFor many centuries the markets in - Guernsey, were held along High-street as far as ihe bottom of Cattle-street. veniences arising from this confined situation had long been felt. In the year 1726 a Committee of the Legislative Assembly was appointed to select a site for a new market building. Again, in the year 1877, an attempt was made by private individuals to secure the - same object. Up to the year 1822 the butchers sold meat in open stalls, but the population increasing, this market became too confined, and the inconvenience was increased by the prohibition to the butchers against opening butchers' - shops in other parts of the city. In 1S30, sures were again taken to build a new meat market, and the present handsome building was - opened during - October in the same year, at a - cost of upwards of ,£4,000. The narrative of the mode the Guernsey people adopted for raising the'cost of the new market is little known to the English-speaking people, but it is worthy of the careful consideration of all public bodies - charged with the duty of spending public money. It is given by John Jacob as followsThe estimated cost of the new meat market 'being about ^4,000, how to raise that amount became the immediate question with the promoters of the scheme. Numerous consultations were held, the upshot of which was that, in-stea'd of borrowing gold, the promoters deter-mined to issue "" Market house scrip"" or legal - tender notes of their own, founded on the credit of the island. The politicians of the day called them a set of pestilential innovators for adopting a course so opposed to common-sense and ancient custom; but, notwithstanding all opposition, market house scrip for the requisite amount, and of various denominations, was ultimately issued by the authority of the House of Assembly, when Daniel de Lisle Brock was Governor - of the island. The materials were found, the men put to work, the market erected, and the stalls rented. Every month's rent reduced the total of the scrip, and in less than ten years all the scrip was paid back into the public Treasury, stamped, cancelled, and thus ended the life of the Guernsey market house scrip. Briefly, that Governor was highly gifted, and possessed great potentialities. Once a year, notes to the value of whatever rents had been received were publicly burnt. In less than ten years, every note was realized, and Guernsey Island thus secured its market for all time. Why cannot the same system be applied to the building of the Federal Capital ? Prior to the issue of Commonwealth notes, there were fifty-two banks of issue in Australia. Thirty-eight of these issued notes of six denominations, so that there were 228 different kinds of notes current in Australia. W it h the issue of Commonwealth notes, these notes disappear, and ultimately there w i ll be only St. Peter's, seven kinds of notes issued. The incon- Where is the difficulty of - issuing still another note, which would., the guaranteed by every building in our. Capital, and by the Commonwealth as a whole 1 These notes would not be redeemable in gold, and their currency would necessitate the establishment of a receiving office and a paying-out .office. The Government could make an arrangemea- ment under which the rents could be paid to a special branch of the Commonwealth Bank. The? notes, of course, would be legal tender. Every note and every coin that has been issued for currency purposes has been made legal tender by the Government whichissued it . So that there is nothing new in that principle. To those who exclaim, "" Why should we not have a gold currency? "" I can only point to the fact that the figures for the Clearing House, London, show that, in 1839, £980,000,000 worth of paper money was dealt with , and that, in 1904, the amount had advanced to £10,564,000,000 . In New Yor k alone, the advance, between 1853 and 1905, was from £261,000,000 to £18,376,000,000 . In fact, the chequespaid in London and New York in onemonth amount to £1,270,000,000, is greatly in excess of all the gold and silver coinage of Carnegie estimates that 92 per cent, of the whole world's financial transactions is done on paper. Is it any wonder, in the light of these figures, that the great Ricardo said, "" Banish metal It is a waste in that sense. There is no real standard or measure of value. has been so named for convenience but neither gold nor silver can measure value. Let me recall the fact that for 600 years all business was conducted in Venice solely on credit and during that period occurred. The time was when represented money in Russia, when wood was currency land. In the same way tea cubes represented money in China, porcelain in Siam, and cowries in Africa. ^W'hat I suggest is that, when we erect the whole of our public offices, we should issue notes to the extent of their cost, and that out of our yearly revenue we should then 5 per cent, of the value of those buildings. Anybody could then have a building erected on the basis that he would be charged a rental equal to 5 per cent, of its cost. I would go further, and say that that 5 per cent, should include the expenses for our public utilities, such as sewerage, water, gas, and Under such a system^ honourable will see that, in twenty years, every one of these buildings would be paid for. If we continued to charge the 5 per cent, for twenty-five years, the additional five years would suffice to pay for the public utilities necessary to the civilized community. We might then set apart one day as a day for national rejoicing, upon which all the notes issued which had been returned in the shape during the year should According to a return which was prepared at the instance of Mr Justice Higgins, . Victoria, at one stage of her existence, had borrowed close upon upon which she had repaid, by way of capital and interest, an amount approaching that sum, notwithstanding still owed the £50,000,000. figures relating - to Victorian loans up to 30th June of last year. They show that this State has borrowed that it has paid, by way of £41,889,489, leaving a total - of £60,737,216. Since its Dr Maloney. which . of a borrowing policy, this Statehas paid in interest £28,779,258. the world. In discount and expenses of flotation, thesum of £1,960,051 has been spent, afterallowing for premiums Victoria has been lucky enough to get. Thus Victoria liaspaid, in interest, discount, &c, coinage."" £30,739,309, - which money could have been saved had the railways and publicGold works in the State been built in the wayalone; the market in Guernsey was built. I do not wish honourable members to think thatthis market is the only ewe lamb, the only public work, carried out in this wayand paper, in Guernsey. I understand that theno crisis same plan is in operation at the present, leather time. If it costs £1,000,000 to provide, and a Parliament House and the other buildin Eng- ings we require at Canberra, let us issuea million £ 1 secured currency notes, not. redeemable in gold, but guaranteed by those securities which I have mentioned. Then, out of those that are ear-marked, so many could be reduced every year by the rental paid. In this way our city deduct could be built as no other city has ever been b u i l t ; in an artistic sense, the most glorious in the world. W it h every Australian heart pulsing with the hope of the future greatness of. this Continent and all its potentialities-and no historians have yet dealt with more thanthe fringe of it-w e shall see our city electricity. built without adding a single penny-piece members of debt to the community. We can raise the towers of our splendid' buildings, and break the skyline with a city beautiful with potentialities greater than the world has ever seen. I have endeavoured to impress on honourable members how this Capital of ours should be built. An y honourable member who cares to follow up the subject can do so. I will gladly give him the references. of rents All honourable members must recognise be burnt. the picture I have drawn of the State debt of Victoria. Eew can imagine a railway whose immediate revenue is needed, not for the paying of interest, £50,000,000, but for wiping out a debt which never increases. I have shown, as briefly as time would permit, that a mere score of which she years- a Rip Van Winkle sleep-wil l I have here wipe out the loans needed to complete all the buildings that will be required afc Canberra for private enterprise, and £102,475,706, leave an unending rent roll for the redemption, nation. Surely honourable members, folindebtedness lowing out that idea commenced in inception Guernsey, must admit that it is worthy of consideration from any man who reverences his country, and any individual who is honest in an endeavour to build up a great civilization. Great as Sydney with the beauty of its harbour may be, and great as Melbourne may be in the splendour of her streets, we hope that the Capital of Australia will not only emulate the beautiful city of Washington, but surpass it, in the beauty of its design; and I trust it will be built adding a single penny-piece of indebtedness to the Commonwealth of Australia.",36

244,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Yarra) [7.46] - Will the Minister give some information in connection with the spending of £10,000 on the "" Naval Establishment at Garden Island, Sydney""? This is an entirely new work, according to the Estimates. In what direction is the money to be spent? I understand that Garden Island was originally held by the Imperial authorities when New South Wales was the head-quarters of the Imperial Fleet in Australian waters, and that it was handed over to the Imperial authorities, but that when Australia started to have its own Fleet there was some agreement that the island should be handed over to the Commonwealth Government.",40
245,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,Did not the perial Government obtain Garden Island in exchange for the Paddington Barracks or Dawes Point ?,40
246,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"That was some years ago, but I think that when we started our own Fleet, and the British warships were withdrawn from Australian waters, the island automatically reverted to the Imperial Government. I wish to know whether that' is so, and whether it has since been handed over to the Australian naval authorities. If the property is held by the Imperial authorities or by the State of New South Wales, we should hear from the Minister the terms under which we are using it as tenants. If it is our own property, we should know on what terms we have acquired it .",40
247,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Wentworth-Honorar y Minister) [7.50], - Originally Garden Island was given by New South Wales to the British Admiralt y in exchange for certain properties in Sydneythe Victoria Barracks and Dawes Point - whic h were known ' as Ordnance properties, and also on condition that Sydney should remain the chief base of British warships in these waters. I speak subject to correction, because I did not know that this question, which is not directly relevant to the item, was to be without raised. However, I shall give, to the best of my recollection, what are the facts, though asked to do so at a moment's notice. When we made the Naval Agreement of 1909, which is the origin of the present Australian Naval unit, it was understood that the British Naval establishment in Sydney was to be handed over to the Commonwealth.",40
248,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,That was the promise.,40
249,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"It appears, however, that the New South Wales Government, acting on what might seem to be a technicality, set up a claim to the property, and the result has been that, until quite recently at any rate, the British A d miralty has not'handed over the property to the Commonwealth, though we are in possession of it . As we are in possession, it does not so much matter, for the purpose of these Estimates, whether we have to pay for the property as transferred property-whic h we are disputing, and which is a question of law-o r whether we have the actual right to the property by dedication from the Imperial authoriIm- ties, because, in any case, the buildings provided for in these Estimates will need to be erected. We intend to provide a store for guns and gun mountings at £ 2 , 0 0 0; a residence for the general manager at £3,000",40
250,Mr RILEY,Unknown,That will be a big residence.,40
251,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"It pales into insignificance beside some others we have been discussing in the past. We also propose to provide quarters for storehouse meu at £800 , quarters for ten officers, recreation and wardroom at £4,000, and a dining hall for workmen at £1,500. The total expenditure will be £11,300, and of this we expect to spend £10,000 during the financial year. I am sorry I cannot give chapter and verse with regard to the very important question raised by the honourable member for Yarra. I can only give the facts as they concern ray own particular Department. The previous Administration deputedColonel Miller tonegotiate with New South Wales with regard to this property, but the present Government could not. regard the properties-Garde n Island, Admiralty House, and one or two other buildings and properties that comprised the Naval establishment of the ImperialGovernment in Port Jackson-as the property of New South Wales. We recognised that New South Wales had already been paid for these properties by the Imperial Government, and we thought that at least the Commonwealth could expect from New South Wales the treatment. New South Wales had willingly been prepared to give to the Imperial Government.",40
252,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"Parkes) [7.55]. - I agree with the Minister that probably this money will have to be spent quite irrespective of the title to Garden Island. But the honourable member for Yarra is perfectly right in pointing out that, just as a man ought to be verycareful when he is erecting a building to see that it is built on his own land, so we ought to be careful to see that in expending this £10,000, part of the item of £11,000, we spend it on property to which we have a title. I do not know fclie facts, and the Minister has acknowledged that he does not know them, because .no notice was given that this history would be asked for. I shall state my recollection tentatively, because on a previous occasion when Imentioned it the .honourable member for East Sydney tookexceptionto. it as not being correct, and he is far better acquainted with the older history of Sydney than I am. My recollection is that at one time what were called the Paddington Barracks, which are now used for military purposes,, belonged to the Imperial Government, and what was knowu as Dawes Point, wltich is a very valuable peninsular in themiddle of Sydney Harbor, also belonged to that Government. When they required Garden Island as a naval depot they transferred those two properties to New South Wales for the island. I happen to know that, at the Imperial Conference of 1909, it wassaidthat the Imperial Government would hand over Garden Island to the Federal Government when they inaugurated their own navy. I think it> wasmentioned, at the Conference that it. would involve a great deal of money, which had been used in theerection of stores and other buildings,, staiths, and foundries, for the purpose* of repairing ships.. But, notwithstanding that, I understood at the time that the Imperial Government said they were perfectly prepared to hand over the whole island and all the works thereon, to theAustralianpeople for their navy. I was a little surprised a few weeks ago to see it stated in a newspaper that the State Government were setting up a claim to Garden Island, seeing that they had received a quid pro quo for the island in the shape of the Paddington Barracks and Dawes Point. No doubt, sooner or later, it will have to be ascertained where the legal right to the islandrests. I know that very often in matters of property between the States and the Commonwealth there is not the same care taken with regard to the legal rights as would be taken in a matter between private individuals. But, as we are going to spend £10,000 on Garden Island, I dothink it is pertinent to the passing of this item of £11,000 to know how the Commonwealth stands with regard to the island, whether the State, seeing that it exchanged the island to the Imperial Government for other properties, has any right to set up a title to the island and begin, as it was doing, I believe, with thelate Government, to negotiate with tliem for the allowance, on the cross-accounts, of something for the island. I would bevery glad if the Minister would, evenwhen this item is passed, ascertain for the information of the Committee exactly how the title to Garden Island stands.",41
253,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Are the other propertiestransferred ?,41
254,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,I have alwaysunderstood that they were transferred by the Imperial Government to New South Wales inexchange for Garden Island.,41

256,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"Thos e two properties were dealt with, I believe, on theassumption that the State owned them, and I have always understood that it had acquired them as a. quid pro quo for giving Garden Island to the Imperial' Government.",41
257,Mr RILEY,Unknown,No ; that wasanafterconsideration.,41
258,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"At all events, Garden Island became the property of the Imperial Government, because they have spent nearly £1,000,000 there.",42
259,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"They handed the island back to the State, I understand.",42
260,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"I heard on very good authority, which I cannot mention, that at the Imperial Conference Sir John Fisher said that the Imperial Government would hand over Garden Island, with all improvements, to the Federal Government as soon as they inaugurated their own navy.",42
261,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Yes , it was held by them.",42
262,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"At all events, it is quite impossible for any one of us with our limited knowledge to lay down with great definiteness how the matter stands. I do think that the Committee ought to know from the Government sooner or later where the property in Garden Island lies; whether, in view of what I have said, the State can now turn round and claim from the Commonwealth compensation for Garden Island, as well as for the Paddington Barracks and Dawes Point. All that I ask of the Minister is that, before these Estimates have gone through, he will tell us how the matter stands, and so save the asking of questions in the House itself..",42
263,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Hunter) [8.1] Wibh regard to the Estimates for the Navy, I bake ib that the Governmenb, bobh pasb and present, aud Parliament are guided largely by .the report of Admiral Henderson. In that case I cannotunderstand why such a heavy expendibure is proposed in connection with Garden Island, seeing that we have taken over Cockatoo Dock, because Admiral Henderson in his report lays.it down very clearly that in the event of the Government taking over Cockaboo Dock there should not then be a necessity to expend money on Garden Island. In paragraph 29 he saysDockyard Personnel - The personnel (rSs ranks and ratings) now allowed and borne in the complement of HMS. Penguin for working the Dockyard 'Establishment at Garden Island are - provided by the Mother Navy. sidered that this number of ranks and ratings should be retained in their existing positions until such time as the Dockyard Establishment at Cockatoo Island is taken over by the Commonwealth as a Naval Dockyard, whenarevision of the complement, will be. necessary; it. sidered that it should then be practicable fo reduce the complement of GardenIsland to a very small number.. In the face of that paragraph I cannob realise the necessity for such a large sum as £10,000 being placed on these Estimates for carrying out certainimprovements, whatever they may be, on Garden Island. I think that whilst we all admit that it is necessary to make every provision for naval defence, at the same time it ought to be done with a due regard to economy. We do not desire to be wasteful, nor to expend any money uselessly. I would like the Minister to explain why such a large item for Garden Island is included in these Estimates, seeing that the Commonwealth is now in possession of Cockatoo Island. In regard to Port Stephens as a submarine basewhich Admiral Henderson . points out should be the first submarine base constructed in Australia- I cannot find in the Naval Estimates any ibem for carrying out that work. As honourable members know, the work is in progress today Whether the present Government intend! to stop the work or not, I cannot say. I have endeavoured to elicit informationfrom the Treasurer, but, so far, I have not been able to get a reply to my question, and, therefore, I do not know whether it is the intention of the Government to permit the work at Port Stephens to remain in abeyance or not. In paragraph 34 ofhis report, Admiral Henderson saysPort Stephens - Por t Stephens being the first Submarine Base to be developed, it is desirable that the following ranks' and ratings be appointed before the Fleet Unit arrives in Australia :i Lieutenant, r Seaman Petty Officer (Torpedo Gunner's. Mate), and the balance of the complement proposed (II ) as soon as required.",42
264,Mr KELLY,Unknown,The submarines have not yet arrived in Australia.,42
265,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Exactly , but Admiral Henderson points out that it is necessary to make provision to have the submarine base ready by the time the submarines do arrive. If we have the submarinesunder construction, and anticipate his Fleet Unit in the near future, It is con- we ought to endeavour to carry out his 1 report; in fact, we should be guided by him. The Minister's interjection is quite in opposition to what Admiral Henderson says in regard to the necessity for is con- carrying out the work at Port Stephensfirst. The Fisher Government did the exploratory work in connection with that submarine base. I know that certain lands have been resumed there with the intention of complying with the report of Admira l Henderson, and making provision for the submarines when they do arrive. Later in his report Admira l Henderson deals with the order in which the works should be taken in hand. At page 159, he saysPORT STEPHENS. {(?) Survey and examine thoroughly the harbour, and reserve land on south side of Salamander Bay; That was done by the previous Government, I believe(b) Establish submarine base; {c). Provide floating dock and workshops. What I would like to know is whether the Government intend to continue that work or not? What is the use of our being guided by Admira l Henderson's report in regard to our Eleet if we neglect to do the most important thing, and that is to provide a base for the submarines? We shall be in a nice position indeed if , when the submarines - come out, there is no base for them. Although Admiral Henderson says that Port Stephens is the most important point in Australia for a submarine base, yet, so far as I can see, not one shilling is provided on these Estimates for the purpose. It appears to me that the work is to be allowed to come to a standstillbut, if the Minister can tell me that the work is to be continued, I shall be perfectly satisfied. We shall lose sight of what is necessary in connection with the Navy if we go righ t against the report of Admiral Henderson. So far as Garden Island is concerned, he points out that, once we take over Cockatoo Dock, our expenditure ought to be reduced considerably, as it should not be a place of first importance, and, as honourable members know, the island has been taken over. On the other hand, he points out that the most important base for the submarines is Port Stephens. If the Government intend to carry out his report, well and good; but, if , they in tend to ignore portions of the report while giving effect to others, and will probably find themselves later in the position of not having accommodation for the submarines, it indicates that there is a little laxity in connection with the naval defence.",42
266,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"The money Stephens is comprised in the item of Mr Charlton. £98,000, ou page 2135, for "" N a v a l Works, including labour and material.""",43
267,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,How much is proposed to be spent at Port Stephens?,43
268,Mr KELLY,Unknown,I shall give all the information when we get to the item.,43
269,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"My complaint is that in these Estimates the works are not itemized, and' one cannot find out whether any money is to be expended at a particular place or not. The Minister, however, has said that Port Stephens is to receive a share of the proposed expenditure. I hope that the Government will push on with the work of providing the submarine base there, so that it may be ready when the boats arrive in Australia.",43
270,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,Kalgoorlie) [ 8 . 9 ] - I think that the point raised by the honourable member for Hunter is sufficiently serious to justify the Minister in making a few remarks in connection with the matter.,43
271,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Wentworth-Honorar y Minister) [8.10] - As I explained, by interjection, to the honourable member for Hunter, a sum for the submarine base at Port Stephens is included in an item on page 265 of these Estimates, namely, "" N a v a l Works, including labour and material, £ 9 8 , 0 0 0 . "" I do suggest that, in order to facilitate the consideration ot the Estimates, the present item should be passed.",43
272,Mr HOWE,Unknown,The amount is not set out on that page.,43
273,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I shall give the details to the Committee when we get to the item. We have in this division a proposed vote of £5,000 for Spectacle Island. That sum, which is partly a re-vote, is towards a total cost'of £14.400 for residences, police barracks, police search-house, doubtful explosives magazine, chargeroom, alterations and additions to isolation magazine, additions tooffices, empty case stores, latrines, silver test house, cordite-test house, covered ways, electric light, water supply, drains and general in spection, tramways, and clean ways. It provides, practically, for the completion of existing services. W it h regard to Garden Island, provision is made for store for guns and gun-mountings, general manager's residence, quarters for storehouse man, officers' quarters, recreation for Port and ward room, and dining-hall for workmen. Cockatoo Island would not fulfil for this particular service the purposes for which Garden Island is now used. Mr TUDOR,-Where is provision made for any additional expenditure on Cockatoo Island ?",43
274,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"M o s t of it is included in a Loan Bill which will shortly he before the House. The question raised by the honourable member for Parkes need not disturb us at this moment. We have power to take the actual ownership of Garden Island at any time we think fit, since it is required for the purposes of the Commonwealth. The Government does not allow the claim of the New South Wales Government to possession of that island. We have entered into possession, and there we mean to stop, so that the actual question of whether we shall be building on the foundation of our own property or that of some one else is irrelevant to this particular discussion. W it h regard to the other matter mentioned by the honourable member, he really put in more elegant language the statement which I had given honourable members.",44
275,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"Kennedy) [8.14] It is all very well for the Assistant M in ister of Home Affairs to tell us that we have power to resume Garden Island, but I presume that if we do so we shall have to pay for it .",44
276,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Not if the position taken up by the Commonwealth Governmentthat it is ours, and that we are entitled to it-is correct.",44
277,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"The member said we had power to resume it . Therefore, he must have had in his mind a doubt as to whether it is ours of right.",44
278,Mr KELLY,Unknown,I have no doubt.,44
279,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,On l y five or ten minutes ago the honourable gentleman said he knew nothing about the matter.,44
280,Mr KELLY,Unknown,It is a matter of law.,44
281,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"The member said he did not know this question was going to be raised, that he was merely speaking from memory, and had not a clear knowledge of the matter.",44
282,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"1 said that I could not quote chapter and verse for the statement. I was making, but I have no doubt whatever as to our right.",44
283,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"We want something definite. The honourable member must have known that this information would be required, and he should have come prepared to give it . I am not f u l ly acquainted with the history of Garden Island, but we should know exactly how we stand in regard to it before we spend a threepenny bit upon it . Mr W . H . IRVINE - There is no doubt that we shall have it .",44
284,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,We shall be adding to its value by spending money on it before we resume it .,44
285,Mr KELLY,Unknown,We shall have to pay its value as at the date of acquisition.,44
286,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"We were led to believe that if Cockatoo Island were taken over we should be able to do there much of the work now carried on at Garden Island. If that be so, then there is no need for this additional expenditure. We have paid something like £800,000 for the Cockatoo Island works.",44
287,Mr WEST,Unknown,And they are cheap at the price.,44
288,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"I am not complaining of the price. Unlike the Honorary Minister, I think it probable that we have made a very good bargain, but it seems ridiculous to be spending large sums of money on Garden Island when the work now carried out .there can be done at Cockatoo Island. Why have the two establishments?",44
289,Mr KELLY,Unknown,They serve two different purposes.,44
290,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"It is a pit y that Garden Island was ever handed over to the Imperial authorities, because it wa3 one of the beauty spots of the harbour. There were less prominent parts where honourable the naval works could have been carried out. The Minister should give us full information before we are asked to vote upon any item.",44
291,Mr HOWE,Unknown,"Dalley) [ 8 . 1 9 ] - I am afraid that I can scarcely f all into line with the honourable member who has just resumed his seat. I would point out honourable to him that there is a wide difference between Cockatoo Island and Garden Island. Cockatoo Island is essentially a docking establishment, whereas Garden Island is not. It is true that a very large sum has been spent-and properly spent, I think-in taking over Cockatoo Island, where we have docks for vessels of war, but at Garden Island we have an entirely different situation. There wo have no docks, and there is no possibility of docking accommodation being provided, but war vessels can be brought alongside the wharves and overhauled by means of the plant on the island. I do not think that the proposed vote is extravagant. Sydney Harbor is undoubtedly one of the central Naval Bases for Australia, and surely no one will say that Garden Island as it is today, with its plant for lifting heavy tonnage, such as boilers and guns, should be discarded. Is it reasonable to say that we should not keep in repair the plant already there, or extend its facilities for general naval purposes? Such a thing would be absurd. We must do what is proposed by the Government. We must have Cockatoo Island Dock for docking our vessels, and we must also have Garden Island, if it be only for residential purposes for our officers. We must also have the associated plant necessary to the central and chief Naval Base of Australia. I find no fault with the honourable member for Hunter, who has raised the question of submarine bases. If submarine bases have to be established, they should be made effective at once, for unless they are established it is useless to bring out war vessels. 'Our great central bases, however, should be our first consideration. I regret that I was not present when the honourable member for Parkes spoke, but I cannot conceive of anything that would justify a rednced expenditure in connection with the Sydney Harbor works. I know the actual situation better, perhaps, than does any other honourable member, and I do not hesitate to say that the Government would be lacking in its duty to Australia if it did not extend the expenditure in connection with Garden Island, since it is admirably suited to all the Xmrposes of, shall we say, navalism. We have there a plant adequate for the treatment of any vessel that may come in.",44
292,Mr WEST,Unknown,"There must have .been an expenditure of £1,000,000 on Garden Island.",45
293,Mr HOWE,Unknown,"A very large sum has been expended there, and it would be an ill advised policy to abstain from continuing expenditure in. connection with the plant we have there. I respectfully urge the Committee to agree to the proposed votes in connection with these works. The Minister has said that, in connection with naval works, provision is made for expenditure at Port Stephens and other places; but it is unfortunate that we have not had a more detailed account of the methods proposed for this expenditure. The lionorable member for Hunter was quite right in speaking as he has done, and if the Minister will give the information for which the honourable member asked, we shall be satisfied. It is most essentia] that a large development should take place at Port Stephens. I hope that the Minister will be able to give such information as will assure the Committee - that the submarine bases will not be neglected. I hope also that honourable members will take no exception to the proposed vote for Garden Island, which is a necessary adjunct to the Cockatoo Island Dock. If we fail to develop it as. it should be developed, we shall fail to maintain the efficiency of the naval defence of Sydney Harbor.",45
294,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,Kalgoorlie) [8.27] - I regret I am unable to agree with the honourable member for Dalley in this matter. The Assistant Minister of Home Affairs has given the Committee only the most meagre information. He tells us that it is a question of law whether the Commonwealth Government can take possession of Garden Island.,45
295,Mr KELLY,Unknown,No j we are in possession of it .,45
296,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"If is a question whether we shall have to pay for it directly or as a transferred property. The Commonwealth Government, at very considerable expense, have taken over Cockatoo Island from the New South Wales Government.",45
297,Mr RILEY,Unknown,And have received value for their money.,45
298,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,I am not disputing that. I have not the slightest doubt that the late Minister of Defence made a particularly good bargain.,45
299,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,Honourable members on the other side do not say so.,45
300,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,I do not care what they say. In this matter I am prepared to put my money behind Senator Pearce.,45
301,Mr KELLY,Unknown,The late Minister of Defence did not give the House much in formation about that bargain before he made it .,45
302,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"He conducted negotiations with the Minister of Works of New South Wales. Everything was on the square and above board, and the honourable gentleman can lay the paoers on the table if he is not satisfied with the bargain.",45
303,Mr KELLY,Unknown,I only said that the late .Minister of Defence did not give much - information about it beforehand.,46
304,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,Honourable members - opposite have said that it was a bad bargain.,46
305,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"There is no doubt that they did , and they complained also - about the condition of the power-produci n g machinery. I notice that they have not had much to say about that recently.",46
306,Mr HOWE,Unknown,We shall not hear another word about it .,46
307,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"The honourable member for Dalley states that Cockatoo Island Dock is very necessary for the docking - of our war vessels. That is true, but does the honourable member, and does the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs, contend that it is not possible to effect repairs as well as to dock our vessels at Cockatoo Island?",46
308,Mr KELLY,Unknown,There is not a single penny of the vote for Garden Island which will be spent upon the docking of the vessels.,46
309,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"How much is down for the manager's residence ? It is an Extraordinary thing that during the twelve years of Federation it was previously not found, to be necessary to spend £3,000 for a manager's residence at Garden Island. The late Government were charged with extravagance in public expenditure, but on the first opportunity the present Government have, they propose this apparently unnecessary expenditure.",46
310,Mr KELLY,Unknown,It is less than one-half of the estimated cost of the house proposed by the last Government for the residence of the Naval Commandant at Jervis Bay.,46
311,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"This is not a laughing matter, because the Government are proposing the expenditure of £3,000 of the taxpayers' money. If it was his own money that was to be expended, the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs would not consider it a laughing matter. The honourable member for Dalley takes up the position that these two establishments at'Cockatoo Island and Garden Island are both necessary. We are paying £800,000 for Cockatoo Island.",46
312,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,More than that.,46
313,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"That is near enough, but if the amount were £1,000,000 it would not affect my argument, which is that we are being asked to make provision for a dual staff at Cockatoo Island and at Garden Island. Apparently the ships are to be docked at Cockatoo Island, and to be sent to Garden Island for certain repairs. If it was alleged that because of lack of space repairs could not be carried out afc Cockatoo Island there would be a reason for the expenditure proposed at Garden Island.",46
314,Mr HOWE,Unknown,That is precisely what I wish the honourable member to approve of.,46
315,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I know that that is what the honourable member has advocated, but I am trying to find out why it should be necessary to duplicate management, accounts, foremen, stores, clerks, and timekeepers at Garden Island and Cockatoo Island, when the whole of the work might be done by officers under one .roof at Cockatoo Island.",46
316,Mr HOWE,Unknown,It has been the same hitherto.,46
317,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,That does not matter.,46
318,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Does the honourable member suggest that the expenditure proposed at Garden Island is not necessary ?,46
319,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I am asking for in formation on the subject, and the honourable gentleman is not prepared to give it.",46
320,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,He has admitted that he knows nothing about it .,46
321,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,Then we must take the responsibility of voting against these items.,46
322,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Why does the honourable gentleman say that we do not want Garden Island f,46
323,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,I want the Minister to assure the Committee that we do want it.,46
324,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"The Minister of Defence of the Government .of which 'the honourable member was a member wanted it , 'and took the initial steps to secure it .",46
325,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"Neithe r the late Min ister of Defence nor the Government of which I was a member proposed the expenditure of £3,000 for a manager's residence at Garden Island, or an expenditure - of £10,000 at that place without saying what the expenditure was for.",46
326,Mr KELLY,Unknown,The 'honourable gentleman should be careful about that Statement.,46
327,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"That sort of "" f l a p doodle "" does not appeal to me. If the honourable gentleman could meet what I say by suggesting that the late Government ' advocated something that was wrong, he would be very ready to do so. I want to know why we are asked to vote £10,000 for Garden Island, £3,000 of which is to be expended towards ihe cost of a manager's residence? We should be supplied with that information, and I will give the Minister an opportunity to supply it . I wish to know, also, whether the work which it is expected will be done at Garden Island could not be done at Cockatoo Island, and thus avoid the necessity for a duplication of management and staff?",46
328,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Wentworth-Honorar y Minister) [8.37] - It is quite impossible to do the work for which the votes for Garden Island are intended at Cockatoo Island, which, as the honourable member for Dalley has clearly stated, is a dockyard. The requirements of the Commonwealth Fleet will necessitate our utilizing every acre of Cockatoo Island for naval dockyard purposes. Garden Island is used as a depot. Apar t from the fact that we cannot trespass upon the space available at Cockatoo Island for purposes of this character, there are reasons which make Garden Island peculiarly well adapted for the purposes for which these votes are being asked. The proposition that Garden Island should be handed over to the Commonwealth had the cordial support of the previous Administration .",47
329,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,That is not disputed.,47
330,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"The desirability of securing the island is not disputed, and, having the island, we obviously need to manage it .",47
331,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Was it not managed before?,47
332,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"It was, in this way: The Admiralty had a house called "" Tresco,"". at Elizabeth Bay, which was occupied by the captain in charge of the Naval Establishment. . The general manager of the depot will be living on Garden Island it self. That, I think, should clear up the difficulty.",47
333,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Who owns "" Tresco "" ? - Mr KELLY - I think it was bought straight out by the British Government.",47
334,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Is it not handed over with Garden Island ?,47
335,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"We claim full possession of all the British establishments in Sydney. Tliat is the position which the Government take up. We are now going to have a general manager i u T Buildings, die. charge at Garden Island, and obviously it is better that he should reside on the island. Nowadays £3,000 will not build a palace, and honourable members opposite will recollect that they proposed to spend between £6,000 and. £7,000 at Jervis Bay upon the erection of the Commandant's residence and guest house. I hope that the Coinmittee will pass the item. The expenditure is necessary for the purposes of the Fleet, and had the late Government remained inpower, it would have done what we are doing.",47
336,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Yarra) [8.42] - When , an hour ago, I asked for information, we were absolutely in the dark about this item, and the Minister had to admit that he had very little to tell us. I wish to know whether Garden Island is to be treated as a transferred property for which the Commonwealth must pay? If the Government of New South Wales has received from the Admiralty property at Circular Quay or elsewhere in exchange for Garden Island, they cau have no furthe r claim on the island.",47
337,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"The Admiralt y has given to the Commonwealth the user of Garden Island. The State Government has put in a claim for the island, and that claim is in the hands of the law authcrities.",47
338,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,No doubt that will be a good thing for the lawyers.,47
339,Mr KELLY,Unknown,I do not think that matters' will go so far as that. I think that our claim will be recognised.,47
340,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I hope, for the sake of the taxpayers of Australia, and particularly of New South Wales, that the matter will not get into the hands of the lawyers. Although there has been a naval depot at Garden Island for a number of years, it has hitherto not been thought necessary to have a manager residing on the island. The utmost care should be exercised in the expenditure of public moneys in the manner proposed. If Ministers were to listen to some departmental officers, the Government would be erecting mansions for officials everywhere. I should like to know how many men are to be accommodated in the quarters on which £ 8 0 0 is to be spent, seeing that £3,000 is to be spent to provide a residence for the manager '? The stock argument of honourable members opposite at the last election was that the Fisher Government had been recklessly extravagant, and only to-night I read in a newspaper the statement of an honourable member to the effect that he had said, during the campaign, that from £3,000,000 to £4,000,000 had been recklessly expended by us.",47
341,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,Was that said by the honourable member for Gippsland ?,48
342,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"If the honourable member had guessed any one else he would have been wrong. If the Fisher Government was recklessly extravagant, what is to be said of the proposal before us ? But not one Ministerialist has asked for any explanation, item after item being run through without a word being said.",48
343,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"The expenditure of £800 is for a house for the storeman, not for quarters for several men.",48
344,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Is the Minister satisfied that the manager cannot continue to reside on the mainland ? Many persons in Commonwealth employment complain that they are compelled to live in quarters furnished by the Government, and have to suffer a 10 per cent, per deduction from their incomes lieu of rent, and we should not incur more expense in the erection of residences than we can help. If a manager's residence is needed on the island, is £3,000 the least amount that will build one ? I regret that the Minister did not, when first asked for information, give the Committee fuller information. I trust that, in connection with other items, he will appear better informed.",48
345,Mr FENTON,Unknown,Maribyrnong) [8.48] I am not satisfied with the Minister's reply. He tells us that the question as to who is the legal possessor of Garden Island is now receiving the attention of the law authorities.,48
346,Mr KELLY,Unknown,I said that the claim of the State Government is being considered by the law authorities. We are quite satisfied'that our title is good. The Attorney General's advice is to that effect.,48
347,Mr FENTON,Unknown,Has the island been handed over to the Commonwealth?,48
348,Mr KELLY,Unknown,U n d e r the Naval Agreement we have the right to use it .,48
349,Mr FENTON,Unknown,I understand that Garden Island is the property of the British Government. Mr W . H . IRVINE - It was dedicated for Naval purposes in perpetuity.,48
350,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Now the New South Wales Government is putting in a claim for it . If we are going to spend a large sum of money on the island, we should be absolutely assured of our right to do so. Assuming that we have a clear title to the island, I do not like to see such large sums of money as that proposed being spent for the erection of residences there. It may be correct that Garden Island meets naval requirements which cannot be met at Cockatoo Island, but is it proposed to make it a sort of social centre for the Navy? An expenditure of £3,000 on a manager's residence would seem to make provision for a commodious ball-room, or something of the kind. I would not deny opportunities for rational enjoyment for our Naval Forces, and I trust that means for their entertainment will be provided, because they will be more or less prisoners on the island, but, I understand that hitherto it has not been found necessary to provide a residence there for the manager, and I fail to see why this money should be spent. I make .my protest against the expenditure now, so that annum in the future, should the Commonwealth in title to Garden Island not be found to be good, it may hot be said of me, and of others, that the item was allowed to pass without attention being called to it . Without wishing to express the parochial view, I must say' that - it seems exceptionally easy to secure support for expenditure in the vicinity of Sydney. We have voted hundreds of thousands of pounds for expenditure in New South Wales without auy question being asked as to the desirability of the proposed works. But 1 must be content with the protest that I have made. We have done quite enough for the State without handing over to New South Wales money for Garden Island.",48
351,Mr BURNS,Unknown,The honourable member will have a different tale to tell when items affecting Victoria are under consideration.,48
352,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"In comparison with New South Wales votes, I shall have practically nothing to discuss then, as there are many blank columns opposite Victorian works. I trust that this Government will carefully control public expenditure, and not allow New South Wales to obtain money for a property that should come direct from the British Government to the Commonwealth. I accept the assurance of the Attorney General that, so far as he has gone into the matter, he is of the opinion that there is no doubt as to the right and title of the Commonwealth to enter into possession of Garden Island, and has no fear of the result of any legal contest with the New South Wales Governmeut. Is that so'?",48
353,Mr KELLY,Unknown,That is so. Mr W . H . IRVINE - There is no tion about our retaining possession.,49
354,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Of course, we can possession of Garden Island in the same way as we can acquire any other property in the Commonwealth, namely, by taking that attitude. it over for public purposes. I presume that in that case it will be taken over under the valuation made in 1908.",49
355,Mr KELLY,Unknown,We can acquire any perty that we may want. But the questhe tion of possession is not disputed State. All that New South Wales disliked. putes is our right to the ownership of island. We are advised by our officers that our claim to ownership is a valid one.,49
356,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"On that assurance, shall say no more. I hope that the sistant Minister of Home Affairs will exercise a protecting care in the matter of expenditure on buildings which may be used more for social purposes than forpurposes of utility, and that he will guard the public purse against the possibe bility of State Governments laying rapacious hands upon it .",49

It is the first gleam of sunshine that I have noticed in the policy of the Government. It is a recognition of the very many debts which they owe to New South Wales, without whose kindness they certainly would not have been in office at all. I should, however, be overwhelmed with satisfaction if I could only understand to what purpose this £10,000is to be devoted. I gathered from the very illogical remarks of the honourable member for Maribyrnong-wbo , I must say, is unable to understand what Garden Island stands for, and what it is used for - that he was not clear in his mind as to how this money is to be expended. will tell, him the position. The item represents one of those small economies which the Government were returned' to secure. It is by striking off these little items of expenditure that in the fulness of time they propose to lighten the burden of taxation.",49

How they effect them weproknow very well. But, though we know,, people outside have not been able toby the realise as clearly as we should have However, here is the beginning off the small economies, which in themselves; are almost negligible, but which, when totted up, will run into millions of pounds. As it seems probable that the I Government will last another fortnight, Asthere is no reason why they should not go out of office, if not covered with glory,, at least, with a surplus or something approaching it . I shall not ask the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs for any explanation of these items. I shall nofcso rude, because I have noticed thab every attempt in that direction on the part of my honourable friends on this side of the chamber has led to an exhibition of the emotions which are working heavily within him. But I would suggest to the honourable gentleman that, infuture , it would be more expedient to»group these items under one heading than to set them forth seriatim. The adoptionof the latter course I regard as aninexcusable weakness. Upon these Estimates seven items appear, each of which affords honourable members upon this side of the chamber an opportunity to ask to what they relate. If , on the other hand, the items had been grouped underone heading' we should have required only one explanation instead of seven. Of course, we realise. that a detailed statement of the public accounts was one of themissions of the Prime Minister when heentered upon the government of this-I country. Only yesterday morning I read a speech by him, in which he said' that a. man of long training in commercial"" affairs, Mr Robert Harper, had regretted* that lie was quite unable to explain the public accounts. He could not followthem; he could not understand themThe Prime Minister said that that was a great pity, and that they ought to be prepared in such a manner that everybody could understand them. economies and to place the public accounts before the people in a clear, concise fashion-thes e were the things for which the Prime Minister was returned to office.

It is prising attitude to take up. I thought we might reasonably expect the honourable bers will require. member to ask how the money was to be spent. We generally aim at getting the Works Estimates through as soon possible, but this is the first time we had a Minister in charge of these Estimates without information, as to how the money is to be spent. formation must be in the Department. Estimates for works must be prepared ing out. by the officers beforehand, and they must have the approval of the Mmister, and how is it that we cannot, by any sort of process, screw information out of Ministers, particularly when we remember that this Government claimed to come into show how the affairs of the Commonwealth should be administered? We are taking an important step. Australia has started its own Fleet; the British Government have taken away the last of their ships, and have handed over to us the place that was used as a Naval Base. We ought to be supplied with information as to the whole of the transaction, and certainly with some information as to why this particular expenditure is proposed. We have had faith in the statement that, above all countries in the world, Britain knows how to run a navy, and apparently it knows how to run a naval base, but we do not know whether the British authorities had any proposal for spending £10,000 extra on Garden Island. They have been in occupation at Garden Island for a number of years, and apparently they have handed over the establishment as a going concern.",51

379,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"They claimed that it was the mission of the Opposition to criticise; that they were the watch-dogs of the taxpayers. Things have now changed; we are the watch-dogs, and we shall continue to bark until we get to know about things. The majority of members are always prepared to pass the Works Estimates in order to get works under way, but here are new items and new conditions of things, and we cannot screw a word of information out of the Government. The Minister says that it is intended to build a manager's house, but then he shakes his head as if that is not to be done. ' I scarcely see the justification for spending £3,000 on a manager's residence. What is the manager to manage ? Is he to manage the Australian Navy, or the stores, or the repair shops? We should not pass the item until we get some explanation. Members on the Government side are as quiet as lambs. The lionorable member for Gippsland, who came in as the champion opponent of contingencies, but has voted for several Supply Bills full .of contingencies, stands by this expenditure of £3,000. I wish to know something about the relationship between Cockatoo Island and Garden Island. If we were to continue repairs on Garden Island, one could understand the utilization of the big cranes and other works there; but, if we are going to use Cockatoo Island only for this purpose, I fail to see the need for this great expenditure of £10,000, unless it is to be spent on stores. We get some courtesy from other Ministers, but we cannot screw anything out of the Honorary Minister, except what he thinks are clever replies. It may be amusing to the Honorary M in ister to sling the taxpayers' money about, but when he has to face the people, and account for it , they will want to know where the money has gone, and why this extra burden has been placed on them. It is not an unfair request to ask for information. Other Ministers have had the information on works showing every detail, but today asked to "" g o b l in d . "" Members of the Opposition are here to see that they know what they vote I do hope that, even at this last moment, the Minister will give a little information. We are aware that £3,000 is to be spent on the erection of a manager's house, but we ought to know the purpose for which the £7,000 is to be used. There are extraordinary reports about Garden Island in circulation. It is said that the Defence Department is staffing the island with ever so many more officers than the British Admiralty found it necessary to employ. If that is true, we ought to be told the reason for the additional appointments. The reticence of the Minister-hi s refusal to give any information to the Committee-arouse s a suspicion. If he does not know the reasons for the proposed expenditure at Garden Island he is not fit for his office; if he does know those reasons he is not f it for his office, because he has kept them dark; he is not fit for his office anyhow, and it is time that we had a change.",52
380,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"Adelaide) [9.26] - In the consideration of items such as these it is always more or less a case of the Ministry being practically able to do as fchey like, because the honourable gentlemen behind them will ^support the proposed expenditure. In the case of an item which touches a particular district we have the peculiar spectacle of honourable members voting for the proposal, simply because it means the expenditure of public money within the area they represent.",52
381,Mr WEST,Unknown,I have never said a word about this matter.,52
382,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"Garde n Island, I believe, is in the electorate of East Sydney, and is immediately contiguous to the divisions of West Sydney, North Sydney, and South Sydney. My experience teaches me that, while honourable members come here from east, west, north, and south, they are one when Sydney, or any part of it, is under consideration. Indeed, it is difficult fco find out who has the most righ t to support an item which has reference to an expenditure in Sydney Harbor. This is a question of, so far as the Ministry is concerned, practically throwing £10,000 of Commonwealth money into Sydney Harbor without the slightest idea we are Mr KELLY - We are making a better shot than that ; we are not chucking it into the Harbor. on. Mr ROBERTS - How are the Gov-rnment going to expend this money? They have a sincere and, no doubt, devout hope that if they throw the money accurately it will land on one of the many lifctleislauds in Sydney Harbor, but they are 2 not quite sure that it will . ' Mr KELLY - Yes , we are.",52
383,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"The Minister, in his 'first excuse, interjected that he did not - shortly. - know much about this expenditure of -£10;000. Why should he be troubled?

384,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,Order !,53
385,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"I merely refer to this .matter incidentally, sir, as instancing where the Minister's strength at present lies. It lies in electoral directions; in alleged! purificatdoai of rolls, purification takes the form of putting his put opponents off and Jiis friends on. we have a striking illustration of a posed expenditure of £10,000. The M ister had to inform us, in the first place, that he really knew nothing at all about the matter, and if we are to judge by his tone, very little attenmain tion has been given to the matter, and no efforts made to find out much about it . In other words, it is a case of "" d o n ' t know, don't care."" lieve that there is a recitation with title, and I commend it to the Minister. A f t e r much questioning, digging, and delving we found that it is proposed some time in the future to erect different buildings on a spot called Garden Island. These Estimates were no doubt prepared in June, or, at the latest, in July, and they were prepared by the officers and given to Ministers with the idea in the official that the money could be expended before means prevent it . the '30th June next. Believing that were doing the right thing, the officers asked for a vote for Garden Island, which they could reasonably expend, provided that they were allowed to start the work at that particular moment, but nearly four months of the financial year have why. gone, and unless the Minister corrects I think I am safe in saying that not one selves. penny of this £10,000 has yet been expoint pended. Therefore, the Treasurer might reasonably allow a reduction of the item by at h i r d . That is the first position put to him.",53
386,Mr KELLY,Unknown,No ; that is the amount we hope to be able to - spend in this finanorder - cial year.,53
387,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,My honourable friend - has amazing' hopes.,53
388,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I have. I 'believe that ""the opposition to this item will cease",53
389,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"Whil e the Minister may be justified in having hopes, we are not justified in voting £10,000 to him on that slender basis. As members of Parliament, we have a right to know where the money is to be expended, and how. We have a reasonable right to know whether there is some probability of the amount being expended, or whether it is merely a dressing for the window, whether inside the dress, so to speak, there is not a it is dummy, and it may be impossible which to spend the money in the direction down on the Estimates. But Here the having of that sum there may propermit of the Government transferring i ni t to some other direction where unusual energy has resulted in the amount allotted to that work being exceeded. This case presents another feature. The part of the statements made during the next twelve months, if we can screw the Ministerial courage up to the point of having an election, will be that the GoI bevernment have to spend all these items that because they are committed to them. The word "" c o m m it m e n t s"" is expected to be the salvation of the Liberal side in the at event of an appeal to the country.",53

404,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"If it be true that, ofi the proposed vote of £10,000, £3\000' is tb be provided for the manager's residence; let us look for a moment at thedetails, in so far as we can drag themfrom the Ministerial recesses. Quarters to accommodate ten officers, as well as a diniug-liall for workmen, and mountings for gun-carriages, are to be provided out of this £10,000. But no less than £3,000, or practically 33 per cent, of the item, is to be devoted to the building of the manager's residence. That is an alarming proposition. The ten officers will be provided with bark humpies, or something of the sort, no doubt, whilst the manager is to have £3,000 spent on a residence. Where does he come from ? Whose friend is he that he should live in a palace while others have to live in bark humpies? again, are the mountings for these guncarriages to be of the paper-board character, to bereduced to pulp the first time a gun is fired? What sort of a family has the manager that he needs a palace to be built afc a cost of £3,000? I am not going to stress the point as to the reticence of Ministers. It is painful to find them bringing down Estimates, knowing little about them, and apparently not caring what happens, while in the case of the Treasurer we have a refusal to supply information. It is right honourable member's duty to understand these Estimates, and to be able to explain them. Supporters of the Government will probably have to justify this proposed expenditure with their constituents, but, if they make statements similar to what they made at the recent election campaign, it will not matter much whether they know anything about the matter or not. The public, however, who have to fipd the money,, have a right to full information. All that we have in these Estimates concerning this item is the statement, "" Garden Island, Sydney - Naval Establishment."" From those five words we are supposed to obtain all the information required. The whole item, being new, could be struck out, and, if honourable members look at the situation as it should be. viewed, it will be struck out, unless the Minister gives us fuller details. I wish it to be understood that I am not opposed to expenditure on Garden Island, or in any' other part of the Commonwealth; that I am not particularly opposing this line of expenditure ; and that I recognise the necessity for the money being expended in certain directions. But I do contend that Ministers should give some information relating to the proposed expenditure. Mr Roberts.",54

410,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"Gwydir) [9.50] - I rise to discuss this item because the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs has not given us the information which might reasonably be expected from him. The honourable gentleman asked a little while ago, "" What kind of a mansion will £3,000 build nowadays ? "" My answer is that it will build a residence suitable for any man. Indeed, at a cost of £1,000, a residence adequate for the requirements of any manager can be erected. I think that £3,000 is an unwarranted expenditure for such a purpose. It is three times as much as should be spent. Just as a straw shows which way the wind blows, so this proposed expenditure indicatesfchewildly extravagant policy which the Government are initiating in connection with naval expenditure. Evidently they have in view, in connection with naval defence, a reckless expenditure such as we never dreamt of. I should like to know what salary this manager is to receive^ because we can judge the suitability of a residence for an officer by his salary. The Minister has not submitted plans of the building to be erected. If they were before us, I could quickly say whether or not they were too elaborate, or whether the internal arrangements were satisfactory.",55

416,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"If the Minister is not prepared to say what this officer's salary is to be, I can only say that he is trying to get these Estimates through by a confidence trick. This proposed vote of £3,000 indicates such a wild extravagance in connection with naval matters that the day cannot be far distant when we shall have to rise in protest against such expenditure. It was not unreasonable that considerable expenditure should be proposed at the initiatory stages, but there can be no justification for the way in which expenditure on defence is mounting up.",56
417,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,We are still in the initiatory stages.,56
418,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"It is all very well for the Prime Minister to say that when he has heavy Estimates to put through, and when the Government are initiating a policy of constructing palatial residences for managers",56
419,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Thes e are the timates of the other side.,56
420,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"No ; the honourable member for Adelaide has already explained that this is not a commitment by the last Government. It is quite an original idea of the present Government to put a manager into a palatial building costing £3,000. W it h expenditure on this scale, how long shall we be before the people of this Commonwealth are the most heavily taxed people in the world hon- for defence? We are well up on the list now, and the danger of the f u t u re is that our expenditure on defence will become so excessive that we shall have to ask ourselves whether some united effort should not be made to prevent this wild extravagance. We have the foundation of our defence laid, and there is no reason why we should commit the people to extravagant expenditure over which we are apparently to have no control, because M in isters merely say, ""Here are our Estimates. We are not prepared to give any details concerning them."" If Ministers, when proposing expenditure on new buildings, would submit the plans for in spection by lionorable members, that would simplify matters. Much of the time occupied to-night might have been saved if the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs had submitted for our inspection the plans of the proposed manager's residence. The Treasurer will give the Committee no information; the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs has given only slipshod information, and the Prime M in ister has made matters worse by discouraging his colleague when he was inclined to give some information.",56
421,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,Was not Garden Island occupied by the Imperial authorities for years?,56
422,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,It was; and the captain of the Dockyard had a residence which the Federal Government have had handed over to them.,56
423,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,O u the island ?,56
424,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"No ; on the mainland. But that residence, apparently, is unsuitable for the ambitious managers whom the ]>resent Governmentintend to appoint in connection with our Naval Depot. I should like to ask the Prime Minister, seeing that this is Tuesday night, and honourable members are tired after their train journey from Sydney and Adelaide, whether he will agree to an adjournment at this stage. Es",56
425,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,What is the use of talking like that? We must do a little business.,56
426,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"If the Prime Minister promises to produce the plans of the ri.anager's residence tomorrow morning, honourable members on this side will not - discuss the vote .at length after they .inspected the plans.",56
427,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"What is the honoraffect able member's trouble ? What does he want ? M.r. WEBSTER - I want to tell the honourable gentleman and the country the proposed expenditure of £3,000 for residence for the manager at Garden Island is wholly unjustifiable and travagant. When we have not to buy the 'land, an expenditure of £1,000 would quite sufficient for a properly-designed residence' for any officer of reasonable bition.",57
428,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"The Government wish to build this residence of marble. - Mr Webster - They may wish to use marbles of different colours in its struction, but that is not what we would specifications. expect when having to provide for an officer of the Navy. Naval men are generally supposed to be a hard-living crowd, who are prepared to stand all kinds of 'hardship, but the Government apparently £3,000. propose to pamper our naval officers. They do not propose to follow the same course in providing quarters for the rank on that sum. and file. To differentiate in the way proposed .between the manager and the men, to draw up Estimates? who will be doing the actual work, only give rise to discontent We are spending nearly £6,000,000 a year - upon defence for a. population of under '5,000,000. The expenditure has risen this amount within two or three years, if it continues to expand at this rate people will be weighed down with taxation which they will be unable to bear. will be drawn, in the main, from the pockets of the poor. The Government not propose to increase the land tax to do. meet this expenditure. They do not profor pose, as the Labour Government did, .collect the money from those whose protested. perty is to be defended. They are asking the workers of this country to stand and find £3,000 for the residence of manager at Garden Island, while they at the same time taxing them up to the Jiilt for the defence of the country. This proposal is worthy of men of the type of those who compose the present AdminisOctober. tration, and who were returned to this House by inducing the people to believe that the members of the last Government - had no regard for the - burdens which were mere guess-work.

The policy exof this Government is extravagant beyond example in this Parliament. It is be proposed to spend £3,000 on a manager's residence, with no land to pay for. No amdoubt it will be furnished, too. Is there to be a billiard-room? may Mr KELLY - No .",57

435,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"We have not been told whether it is to be done on contract ov by day labour. The contention of the Ministerialists is that work done by day labour is twice as expensive as contract work. If that be true, this house, i would cost £3,000 if built by day labour, would cost only £1,500 if built on contract.",58
436,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I have been waiting for twenty minutes to make an explanation.,58

445,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,No . Material can be carried there on punts.,58

Honf it orable members are entitled to see all there is to be seen, and if the honourable member will remind me in the morning, I promise that he will be made aware of every detail. Proposals for expending thousands of pounds on residences for managers require a little looking into, but I remind my honourable friends opposite that there is much precedent for Estimates of this kind.",58
449,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,The honourable member made such a noise about the Jervis Bay building that he ought to be careful.,58
450,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Is that why members opposite are making such a noise now? I promise that we shall be careful. I am not in favour of building palatial residences for men with moderate salaries. To do so imposes on them unnecessary burdens.,58
451,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"Capricornia) [10.20] - I think that the honourable member for Adelaide has acted wisely in proposing a reduction of this item. I ask honourable members opposite, who went through Australia complaining of the residence which the ex-Prime Minister had purchased, and which did not cost £3,000, how they reconcile their statements with this proposal to spend £3,000 on the residence of a manager? Is the Prime Minister going to provide the manager at Cockatoo Island with a house?",58
452,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"B e reasonable. I have promised to look closely into the matter, and to give the representations of honourable members opposite every attention.",58
453,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,The time that the Prime .Minister should have looked closely into the matter was when the Estimates w«re being framed.,58
454,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I imagine that this estimate is that of our predecessors.,58
455,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"That statement will hardly go down. If honourable members the will look at page 237 of the Estimates they will see the words "" New Services."" This is not a commitment from a former Government. I object to the proposed vote on the ground that Garden Island, which is a very eligible site for other purposes, should nob be used for the purpose of a manager's residence at all. Our postal officials complain bibberly because they are provided with residences",58
456,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Is this the ibem to which the honourable member objecbs so seriously. We will postpone its consideration unbil tomorrow if honourable members opposite will give us 11 e balance of the Estimates.,59
457,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"I will resume my seat at once if thab be so. I sympabhize with the position of the Prime Minister. He is leader of the party opposite. Bub M in isters will not obey him, and they make his life pretty miserable just as he made the life of Mr Deakin miserable when he was associated with him. It is a case of poetic justice.",59
458,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Quite wrong.,59
459,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,If I sit down will the Prime Minister move the postponement of the item ?,59
460,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Yes , if honourable members opposibe will give us the balance of the Estimates.",59
461,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,Surely we have some right to discuss the Northern Territory Estimates.,59
462,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,If the Prime Minister pects to put all these Estimabes through to-night I think that he is expecting too much. There are millions of expenditure concealed in them in various ways.,59
463,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The Works Estimates have been pub through in a night on previous occasions.,59
464,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"We are here bo do our duby, and that duty is to criticise what we regard as wrongful expenditure and extravagance. The Assistanb Minister of Home Affairs stated to-night that the proposed residence of the manager of Garden Island will nob cost £3,000, and that the Governmenb will nob expend that amount upon it . If that be so, he has no righb to ask Parliament to appropriate that sum. What member of this Parliamenb is there who occupies a house worth £3,00 0 ? We have to recollect, too, that the upkeep of such a house will impose a considerable burden upon its occupants.",59

470,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"I think that £1,00 0 would be sufficient to cover the cosb of the manager's residence. I believe that we ought to pay our public servants such salaries as will enable them to get houses of their own. I ask the Treasurer whether he has considered that the waT vessels of the future will be dirigible balloons and aeroplanes. He smiles at the suggestion. That shows that he is not keeping in touch with what is going on in the world.",59
471,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I wish to make a deal with honourable members opposite. Will they give us half the amount, and let the item go? Mr .HIGGS - What does the honourable member for Adelaide say ?",59

481,Mr WEST,Unknown,"East Sydney) [10.33] When the Imperial authorities took over Garden Island in exchange for Circular Quay and the adjoining land, there were objections, because Garden Island was a great place of public resort. Since then some buildings have been erected which are very unsightly. There seems to be no attempt to make the place more sightly. I ask the Government to adopt some system in erecting buildings, so that this will not be the case. I consider that the vote on the Estimates is not too much for building a house for the man who will have the management of the island. The Imperial Government speut over £1,250,000 on Garden Island, and there is very valuable property there, so that the man in charge should not be an ordinary caretaker. I commend the Government for making provision for a proper officer to reside on the island Under the Imperial Government most of the men were single, and there was not a great need for providing houses for men with families. Under the present system, however, provision must be made for men residing on the island in the comf o r t they would have if they resided on the mainland. I trust the Estimates will not be cut down too low, and that the island will not be looked upon as a place on which to erect buildings that will be an eyesore from the adjoining heights or from passing boats.",60
482,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,Hunter) [10.37] I appreciate the manner in which the Prime Minister has met the Committee. .1 would not have risen but for the meagre information given to honourable members. The Imperial authorities had considerably more men on Garden M and than we are likely to have in the future.,60
483,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,No .,60
484,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,That is according to Admiral Henderson's report. I am not justified in voting for a house if it is not necessary. The Imperial authorities provided housing accommodation on the mainland.,60
485,Mr HOWE,Unknown,There is a good house on the island now for the resident captain.,60
486,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"That house could be used for the manager, and there is no need to go in for the expenditure proposed. No one would try to cut down legitimate defence expenditure; but, at the same time, we should not be extravagant and spend money where it is unnecessary.",60
487,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I have offered to take off £2,000, and that, with the £1,000 cut off the original estimate, makes £3,000. That means there will be no house built this year.",60
488,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Seeing the honourable member has given the assurance that there is to be no house built this year, I need not say another word. Mr JOSE PH COOK (ParramattaPrime Minister and Minister of Home Affairs) [10.39] - Of course, the honourable member understands that there may be urgent reasons, of which I know nothing; but so far as I see at the present time, I can give the honourable member an undertaking that no house for a manager will be built this year. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. Amendment (by Mr MCDONALD) agreed toThat the item ""Garden Island, SydneyNaval Establishment, ^io,ooo, ' be reduced by : £2,000.",60
489,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"Capricornia) [10.41] As I understand that it is proposed to allow the Estimates for New Works to go, I desire to say that they include many items to which I have the strongest objection. I want to protest against the in ordinate sums which are to be expended this year by the Government on Naval Establishment, Naval Forces, Naval Reserves, and so on. I believe that we are entering upon a career of the wildest extravagance, and that the public of Australia cannot afford it . We ought to offer the strongest protest against the action of the Government. I do not think it is auy thing like an excuse that the Government hope to give work to the unemployed by incurring this huge expenditure. A great deal of the money proposed to be spent under these items could be spent "" in another way,"" to use the words of the Prime Minister when he was Deputy Leader of the Opposition. It could be better spent in the purchase of air-ships. Thirty air-ships could be purchased for the cost of one Dreadnought. In my opinion, the Government are doing a great wrong to Australia. On a Tuesday night, when honourable members are mostly tired through travelling, and it is the practice to adjourn early, I do not find it in my heart to make the speech which I ought to make. There will be another opportunity of placing on record my objections to the extraordinary naval expenditure that is 2272 Additions, Kew Works, [REPRESENTATIVES.] proposed in these Estimates. To-night we got an idea of what it means. The Minister said, "" We want £3,000 for a house, but it will not cost that. We want you, however, to put the vote through."" That has been the policy of the British Government. War-ships weut out to practice, and if they did not use up the ammunition in the time, it was pitched into the sea, in order that the British House of Commons would continue to vote large sums. However, I shall have another opportunity of voicing a strong protest against the proposals of the present Government.",60
490,Mr HOWE,Unknown,"Dalley) [10.44] - I do not rise to enter a protest, but to ask why it is proposed to spend £5,000 on the Naval Establishment at Spectacle Island, in Sydney Harbor?",61

492,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"Adelaide) ri0.46] - I feel justified once more in calling attention to such an item as that of £120.000 towards the cost of Naval Colleges, Naval Barracks, Submarine Depot, Naval Gunnery and Torpedo School, ancl Naval Training School. Last year, the sum of £50,000 was spent, and this year it is proposed to expend £120,000. not intend to take exception to the item, but to place on record that there is no necessity for' honourable members opposite fco shield themselves under the word "" commitments,"" so far as this added expenditure is concerned, because the M in istry need not undertake it if they so desire. It is their policy, and it might have been the policy of our party if we had been on the other side. The matter is wholly in the hands of the Ministry. They need not expend the money if they do not so require. I object now, as I shall object later, to them shielding themselves behind the word ""commitments.""",61
493,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"Kalgoorlie) [10.48] - I would point out to the Minister that a tremendously heavy expenditure is in Buildings, &c. volved in this item. It is proposed toexpend £120,000 this year, in addition to. the £50,000 which was expended last year. I think that the Minister mighfe give us an idea as to what works arecontemplated under this extraordinarilyheavy item.",61
494,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Wentworth-Honorary . Minister) [10.49] - This item includes the sum of £80,000 in connection with the establishment of the Naval College at Jervis Bay, and £40,000 towards the cost of the Naval Base at Flinders.",61

501,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,So - that the reference to a. submarine depot could come out ?,61
502,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Yes . The letterpress is really a repetition of last year's item.,61
503,Mr KENDELL,Unknown,"Corio) [10.52] - The Minister has made a reference to an expenditure of £80,000 on the Naval College afc Jervis Bay. We have at present a Naval Collegeat Geelong, and why cannot that establishment be continued ?

This money is urgently required to complete the establishment already authorized, and which the Navy hope to occupy in the course of twelve or eighteen months. It is absolutely essential, therefore, that we should agree to this proposed vote.",61
505,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"Newcastle) [10.54]- We have in this division the item ""Adamstown Rifle Range, £ 5 , 3 5 0 . "" I should laketo know whether thisproposed vote is for the purchase of land, or to make improvements to the range itself ? Although the attendance on the range has largely increased since the introduction of the compulsory training system, not one additional target has been placed in position, and no increase of accommodation of any kind has been provided. Having regard to the number of people who use this range, I think some improvements should be effected, and additional targets provided.",61
506,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Wentworth-Honorar y Minister) [10.55] - The proposed vote is to provide for the extension of the rifle range, and the provision of fifteen additional target machines.  ference to the item, "" Liverpool Remount Dep6t-toward s cost, £ 1 , 0 0 0 , "" I should like to have some information. Last year, although £10,000 was voted under this heading, only £ 8 0 was spent. Does the item refer to remounts for our Militar y Forces, and, if it does not, why should it be necessary, as proposed, to spend £18,526 for remount depots in the different States? What are the depots for if there are no remounts to use them 1 A remount depot without any remounts is very much like a ship without a crew. I should like to know where we are to get more horses to replace those now in use ? Remounts of the most suitable kind are not always available, and some encouragement should be offered to our settlers to provide the right class of horses for military requirements. If we are not inclined to do so, I fear the day may come when we shall look in vain for the particular horses we require. should like an assurance from the Minister that this matter will not be overlooked.",62
507,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Wentworth-Honorar y Minister) [10.57] - I can assure my honourable friend that the matter to which he has alluded will not be overlooked. The item to which he refers is to provide for an extension of the accommodation for horses, whereas the proposed vote for horses appears in another part of the Estimates.",62
508,Mr BURNS,Unknown,"Illawarra) [10.58] - I would ask the Minister for an explanation of the item, "" New Rifle Ranges, and Additions to Existing £5,201."" At the Woollongong Rifle Range, u n t i l recently, there were five gets, but the rough weather of the last [83]' few months has put"" two out of position, so that only three are now available. Since the introduction of the compulsory training system, a large number of cadets have had to use the range, and - many of them travel long distances to do so. Rifle men at Woollongong inform me that many members of rifle clubs have to leave the range without getting any practice, because it is being monopolized by the cadets. It is very unfair to force - the lads to travel from Mount Kembla and Kembla Heights, a distance of 7 or 8 miles, in order to put in their shooting practice. A range should be provided at Unandarra, where suitable land, at the foot of the mountain, could be obtained.",62
509,Mr WEST,Unknown,"East Sydney) [10.59] In regard to the item, ' ' Moore Park, Stabling and Other Buildings, £ 5 , 4 5 7 , "" I would remind the Minister that about three weeks ago I put a question to him in'regard to the erection of stables abutting on the Moore Park-road, and received a reply that the stables would be erected under sanitary conditions so that they would not give any offence. Since then, I have written to the Minister of Defence forwarding to him a resolution passed by the Paddington Council, asking him fo receive a deputation on the subject. To that particular request, I have received no answer. I enclosed two letters, and received a reply to one relating to a right-of-way across the park, but the request that the Minister should fix a date on which he' would be prepared to receive a deputation from the PadI dington Council has not even been acknowledged. The ex-Minister of Defence gave instructions for the right-of-way across the park to be made, but nothing has been done, and I have some doubt as to whether or not anything will be done by the Department.",62
510,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"Ove r £1,000 was spent there last year.",62
511,Mr WEST,Unknown,"I think that the least the Honorary Minister can do is to see that I get a reply to my correspondence. I have a suspicion that some one is in tervening between me and the Defence Department. That may lead to trouble Ranges, if it is persisted in , and the Minister of Defence should be sufficiently courteous tar- to answer correspondence which was really sent to him on behalf of the Paddington.

Perhaps the Honorary Minister will be able to say whether, under the vote for fortifications, there is anything included for the mounting of guns-on North Head. It is absolutely essential that there should be at least two guns of the latest type mounted on North Head. culous to spend a large amount of money in for t if y in g Middle Head if there is no fortification at North Head. time the guns at Middle Head could be brought into action it would be too late, because the hostile vessels would be within shelling distance of the city of Sydney. There is a good deal of dead water at the back of North Head, where hostile warships could lie, and from where they could shell Sydney. In the circumstances, a very serious mistake will have been made if the vote does not include some provision for the mounting of modern quick-firing guns on North Head. I should like to know also whether the vote includes any expenditure for the protection of Broken Bay, at the mouth of the Hawkesbury River. At the time, the Hawkesbury Bridge is practically exposed to a hostile vessel. There is nothing to prevent a hostile vessel going right up to the bridge, because there is deep water all the way. is a menace to Sydney. It is of no use to bar the front door while leaving the back door open, and Broken Bay is the back door of Sydney. There are no fortifications of any description at Broken Bay, and there is an excellent position on the West Head at Broken Bay, where a couple of guns could be mounted. The Commonwealth Government should come to some arrangement with the State Government of New South Wales for the construction of the military road through Kuringgai Chase to Broken Head, and should see that fortifications are erected on West Head. I should like to know whether any provision is being made to rectify the existing state of affairs at Thursday Island, where there is only an obsolete fort.",62
512,Mr KELLY,Unknown,That is dealt with inrefer to here. another item. I Colonel RYRIE - Then I can refer to it later. I hope that some provision is made in the vote now before the Committee for the mounting of guns on North Head and the defence of Broken Bay.,63
513,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"Wimmera) [11.6] The total votes appearing on these Estimates for rifle ranges and grants to rifle clubs amount to £89,000, as against £84,000 voted last year for the purpose. This represents an advance in accordance with the policy of the Government to give It is ridi - increased encouragement to rifle clubs, and to build new rifle ranges. I wish to point out that a substantial proportion By the of the vote of £84,000 submitted last year was not expended.",63
514,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"The honourable member cannot discuss the general question on the items now before the Committee, which cover works for New South Wales only.",63
515,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"To comply strictly with that rule, I should have to ask the same question on the votes for every State. I wish to learn from the Minister whether the Defence Department are making arrangements for the expenditure this year of the money voted for these purposes, instead cf doing as was done present last year, holding over a substantial proportion of the vote, and whether special attention will be given to the votes as part of the Government policy, and arrangements made for their expenditure within the financial year. This",63
516,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Wentworth-Honorar y Minister) [11.7] - Specia l attention has been given to the matters referred to, and it is hoped, if these Estimates are passed through with reasonable despatch, that opportunities will be afforded for the expenditure of the money within the financial year. The honourable member for Illawarra referred to the construction of two out of five rifle butts, and the difficulty in which the 500 users of those butts have consequently been placed. I will bring the matters to which he referred urgently under the notice of the Minister of Defence. W it h regard to North Head, the vote on these Estimates is for the completion of the works begun last year, and has to do with the North Head fortifications. The exact nature of the armament it is not in the public interests to I very much regret that the honourable member for East Sydney has apparently been treated discourteously, whether by the Defence Department or the Post and Telegraph Department is not quite clear. I assure him that he will get an answer to his communication immediately.",63
517,Mr BURNS,Unknown,"Illawarra) [11.10] Following up the statements made by the honourable member for North Sydney, I should like to know whether the Government have taken into consideration the defence of Port Kembla. The honourable member for North Sydney said that Broken Bay was the back door of Sydney, but I consider that Port Kembla is the back door of that city. The metropolitan area of Sydney gets its water supply from the back of the mountain there, which is only 8 or 9 miles distance from Port Kembla, and this would be the first place that an invading force would attack. Some millions of tons of coal are sent away from Port Kembla every year, and it is to the interest of the Commonwealth that the port should be defended. Without proper defence there, an enemy's vessel needing coal would be able to run in and get it .",64
518,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Wentworth-Honorar y Minister) [11.11] - I recognise the importance of the questions raised by the honourable members for North Sydney and Illawarra. At this stage 1 can only say that their representations will be given their full weight.,64
519,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"Adelaide) [11.12] On page 247, the sum of £85,000 is set down for Woollen Mills, the expenditure last year being £10,297 . During the electoral campaign there was much outcry about the Socialistic enterprises of the Fisher Administration , and the public was led to believe that the policy of the Liberal party was opposed to such enterprises. If that be so, the present Government is justified in saying, in connection with these enterprises, that the first the best, and in therefore stopping the works that were commenced by the Fisher Administration . It is clear, however, that, despite their election speeches, it is the policy of the Liberals to establish Commonwealth Woollen Mills. on record my approval .of that policy; but I am justified in calling attention to the denunciation of it at election time by those on the other side who now support it.

520,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,The walls of this building are half-way up.,64
521,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,And the machinery ordered.,64
522,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"I do not ask that the walls be pulled down; I merely say that, during the electoral campaign, there was much outcry against the Socialistic enterprises of the Fisher Administration , and the public was led to believe that if a change of Government were made, there would be a change of policy, and these enterprises would be stopped. It appears, however, that it is the policy of the present Administration to carry on Socialistic enterprises, just as it was the policy of the Fisher Administration . But , according to what was said by the Liberals at election time, Socialistic enterprises are wrong, and mean a continual loss to the country, to which they should not be committed, If that be the real view of honourable gentlemen opposite, they should show firmness and backbone by putting it into effect, justifying themselves with the statement that the first loss is the best. They might very well say that, having come into office, they found that £10,000 had been expended on Woollen Mills, but, as the establishment of these mills was a Socialistic enterprise, and against their policy, they thought it better to lose that amount than commit the country to a further expenditure of £85,000. That is not what they are doing. I take no exception to the proposed expenditure, because it is in keeping with the policy of which I have always approved; but honourable members opposite cannot be permitted to speak in one way before the electors and to act here in a contrary way. I am justified, under the circumstances mentioned, in calling attention to this matter.",64
523,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,Was this item specially mentioned during the electoral campaign ?,64
524,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"The Woollen Mills, loss is the Saddle and Harness Factory, the Clothing Factory, and the Cordite Factory were all mentioned.",64
525,Mr WEST,Unknown,And the Small Arms Factory.,64
526,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"It was not particuI place larized, at least, not by the Prime Minister, because he it was who started that Socialistic enterprise by calling for tenders for it . It was the first factory of its kind to be established, but now there are four - others.",64
527,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Is it a Socialistic enterprise ?,65
528,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"It is as miicli a Socialistic enterprise as the Saddle and Harness Factory, the Clothing Factory, the Cordite Factory, and the Woollen Mills. It is as necessary that our soldiers should have cordite as that they should have guns. Arms without ammunition are of little use. It is essential, too, that our soldiers shall be clothed, and that the Defence Forces shall be provided with harness and saddlery.",65
529,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,Does not the honourable member think that these factories should be established in the Federal Territory ?,65
530,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"That is a question with which I am not now concerned. The statements that were made by honourable members opposite during the election were deceptive, and honourable members could not have been sincere in making them. I approve of the policy that is being followed, but I take exception to the attitude which was adopted by the Liberal party in regard to it when before the electors. What I say here I shall say on the public platform.  form the proper place for these remarks? I do not see the reason for them now, unless they are made for electioneering purposes.",65
531,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,I do not wish to speak differently here from the way in which I shall speak when on the public platform. I take exception to the conduct of honourable members opposite in making statements from the public platform which they are not prepared to carry into effect. The electors have been misled by their statements. Denunciation of the alleged Socialistic enterprises of the Fisher Administration was indulged in by them.,65
532,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,HO W nasty honourable member is.,65
533,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,The Prime Minister thinks that it is nasty to remind him of his duplicity.,65
534,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Is that in order? I ask that the remark be withdrawn.,65
535,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"I withdraw the remark, but I draw attention to the fact that the Prime Minister, when before the electors, inveighed in no uncertain terms against the Socialistic enterprises of the Fisher Administration. He referred to the Woollen Mills, the Clothing Factory, the Saddle and Harness Factories, and the Cordite Factory. Yet we find that the continuation of these establishments is his policy. Although only £10,000 was expended on woollen mills last year, the Government propose to expend upon them no less a sum than £85,00 0 this year. If there was sincerity in their pre-election cry, they should have the courage to say, "" We will not spend this money."" Mr W . H . IKVINE - Does not the hon : orable member know that contracts had been let?",65
536,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,I know that quite well; and I know that they could be f u l filled. Mr W . H . IKVINE - Why did not the honourable member say that?,65
537,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"The Government could complete whatever commitments had been entered into, and refuse to continue the policy.",65
538,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Thro w scores of thousands of pounds into the sea?,65
539,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"There are. not scores of thousands of pounds involved in that respect. I have a perfect right to draw attention to what Ministers said prior to the recent elections, and to what they are doing today. It is essential that the people should understand more full y than they do what is really the policy of the Ministry, particularly in relation to finance. I am convinced of the importance of the statements made in reference toi finance, and of the effect they had upon electors. Now when the Government have complete control , we find that effect is not being given to their pre-election utterances.",65
540,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"ParramattaPrime Minister and Minister of Home Affairs) [11.22] - The honourable member who has just resumed his seat pursues a the fine little game here. He makes these speeches; they go over to Adelaide, where they are promptly done up in the form of a dodger, and circulated throughout the city.",65
541,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,That statement is in correct.,65
542,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I wish a proper statement to be circulated amongst the people of that city. I want fco say fco the honourable member that this Government have more respect for the taxpayers' money than to fling it away in scores of thousands of pounds, as he suggests. It is one thing to protest against the inauguration of a policy, and another thing to throw away scores of thousands of pounds after that policy has been forced upon Parliament and the country. The honourable member knows quite well that the walls of the Woollen Mills are half up, that the machinery has been purchased, and that the bulk of this money is a commitment which cannot be evaded except in one way, namely, by the absolute waste of the money which has already been expended. If the honourable member is prepared to play ducks and drakes with the taxpayers' money in that way, this Government is not prepared to do so. I want, also, to tell him that what we said on the hustings in respect of these undertakings was not that they were unjustifiable or unnecessary, but that in matters of defence, where the expenditure of money is limited, the important things should be done first. I said that there were plenty of people manufacturing harness and clothing in Australia, and that the wants of the A r m y and Navy in this respect could be readily supplied by private enterprise. But I pointed out that there were no armament factories in Australia, and that my friends had ignored the establishment of armament factories, whilst insisting upon the establishment of harness and clothing factories Since we have only a limited amount to expend on defence it would have been better in the interests of taxpayers if these imperative needs had been given first place, instead of those things which could have been left t ill later. But because these establishments have been introduced out of their order it does not follow that we must fling away this money in order to suit my honourable friend.",65
543,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"Adelaide) [11.28] - I would like to correct the misstatement of the Prime Minister. He has declaimed against the Eisher Government for not having committed the country to the establishment of armament factories, declaring that their establishment was the first step which should have been taken. He, however, proposes to complete the establishment of factories to which he took exception before the election. Y e t there is no item in these Estimates for the establishment of an armament factory, which he says should have been our very first undertaking. Consequently, the strength of his utterance in that direction falls lamentably to the ground.",66
544,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Not at all. Thelate Government had expended the money on these other works.,66
545,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,But the misstatement to which I rose chiefly to call attention has reference to the printing of a dodger. Nothing that I say here goes to Adelaide other than that which some journalist chooses to send. I am seldom honoured in that direction. Nothing that I have said in this House has ever been put into a dodger and circulated in Adelaide. Mr. JOSEPH Cook -- I was not referring to the honourable member for Adelaide in a personal sense.,66
546,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,In that case there is no necessity for me to pursue the subject further. But the Prime Minister seemed to suggest that what I said here to-night would be put in a dodger and circulated in Adelaide.,66
547,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I say so now in all probability. The honourable member knows that a similar statement was circulated broadcast throughout Adelaide in respect to another matter.,66
548,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"I know nothing of it. So far as I am personally concerned I - have no connection with dodgers. Nothing that I have ever said in this House has been embodied in a dodger and circulated the throughout Adelaide, and, consequently, there was no justification for the gibe of the Prime Minister. H is allegation was another of those deplorable misstatements which are intended to create an entirely wrong impression, and which I will not permit to be made without giving it a rebuttal.",66

551,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"As the page was not put to the vote, I claim that it is still open to discussion. The CHAIRMAN - No . The suggestion that I should submit page by page came from a member of the Opposition. The understanding is that if a page is submitted, and no objection is taken, all the items on that page are .agreed to.",66

556,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,Do I understand that the honourable member for Brisbane has made a reflection on the Chair in attributing partisanship to me?,67
557,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"I should be sorry if you imagined such a thing. I did not think of that for a moment. I wish to speak on the item on page 247, "" Erection of Drill-halls, Mobilization, Stores, and other Accommodation for Citizen Forces-toward s cost of, £1007000."" Last Parliament, I called special attention to the lack of suitable accommodation for drilling the Citizen Forces, and no improvement has been made in that matter, the present position being a disgrace.",67

559,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"We have been under obligations to owners of private property to carry on drilling. I asked for a return during last Parliament as to the school-grounds used for the purpose, and I have been making personal inquiries into the matter. there are forty school-grounds throughout Australia that are used, but there are a large number of places attached to public schools in various States that are eminently suitable for the purpose.' Cannot something be done to afford im mediate relief in this direction ? present Government might have more success than the past Government with the education authorities. The present position.is unfortunate, but it should not be too difficult to overcome. These spaces attached to schools are maintained by the public, yet they are closed against the Cadets for drillin g purposes, and to have boys drilling on the roads has resulted in very serious accidents. I do not object to the expenditure proposed. If the Government asked for £200,000, I should vote for it .",67
560,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"ParramattaPrime Minister and Minister of Home Affairs) [11.37] - Will the honourable member .allow me to explain ? Like the honourable member,. I regard this as one of the most important items in the Estimates. Nothing can exceed in im portance the desirability of housing these boys, and getting them off the streets at night. It is a matter of urgent and fundamental importance in connection with the training of these boys, and but suggested for the exigencies of the situation and sheer lack of funds, I would have put a much larger amount on the Estimates. But that these drill-halls are of a perishable character, so urgent is this matter that I would, if we had the concurrence of honourable members, put it in a Loan Bill for £300,000 or £400,000-whic h is the total estimate-and pay it back in two or three years. We would then be doing what we are now proposing to do in a piece-meal way; the end achieved would be the same, but we would be getting on with the drill-halls in a much more up to-date manner than we can do in the present circumstances. There was £93,000 voted last year, but only £19,000 was spent. I understand we are now in a position to spend very much more, but I £93,000, suggest that the best course would be to get a short-dated loan running over three years, and pay the money back at the rate of £100,000 a year for the next three years. In that way, we could rush along the drill-halls, get the boys off the streets, and administer to the efficiency . of the Forces, as well as take better care of the I find that boys. Of course, if we can provide for more than £100,000 this year for the purpose of building these drill-halls more rapidly,"" we shall not hesitate' to do it , even if we have to come to the House with another Estimate. There is, however, always the Treasurer's Advance to The fall back upon. Whatever we can do to push the matter ahead will be done.",67
561,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"Brisbane) [11.40]. - So far as it goes, the statement of the Prime Minister is very satisfactory, but is he prepared to go further, and meet my objection by opening up communication with the State educational authorities so that immediate relief may be given, and probably also with certain of the municipalities who have vacant ground that might be made available?",67

The accommodation in the Brisbane Post-office is, perhaps, no worse that in many of the post-offices, but business is growing to such an alarming extent that, with every extension, i few weeks or months the accommodation is overtaxed, and the difficulty exists as it did previously.

Every"" week I get a notice that the erection of a small telephone line in the bush is approved of, but the Department cannot go on with the work in this financial year. There is too much of that sort of thing going on. I believe that in some country electorates at least twenty telephones, which are urgently required, are held up. I give the Postmaster-General notice that, on the Works Bill , I shall give him some trouble if he will not promise to push ahead the construction of country telephones. In the case of my electorate, the erection of twenty or t h i r t y lines to isolated places has been approved of ; but I am told by the Department that the lines cannot be carried out in this financial year.",69

For the two States, Victoria and South Australia, an increased vote is proposed, the increase for Victoria being £5,627, and for South Australia £11,933, or a total increase for the two States of £17,560. These figures show a net reduction on the votes for last year for this purpose of £45,392. If there is one matter which every honourable member has been persistent in calling attention to it is the urgent need"" for increased telephone construction. The present Government never ceased to complain of the lack of activity in this regard on the part of the preceding Government. They cried out for the erection of telephones throughout the length and breadth of Australia, and they now come down with Works Estimates proposing a reduced expenditure on telephone construction to the extent pf £45,392. Such inconsistency between argument and performance fairly staggers me.",70
606,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,I can explain it to the honourable member.,70

The Assistant Minister of Home Affairs promised that when we. reached this vote he would supply information on the subject. Mr JOSE PH COOK (Parramatta - Prime Minister and Minister of Home Affairs) [12.5 a.m.] - I find that £2,000 is to be expended on Port Stephens, so that it is evident a commencement is contemplated there,",70
612,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"The work has been commenced,",71

617,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Hunter) [12.7 a.m.]. - I do not wish to take up time unnecessarily, but I wish to say that it appears to me that £2,000 will not be sufficient to do what is required at Port Stephens. A d miral Henderson has pointed out that it is necessary to have this submarine base at Port Stephens constructed before the submarines arrive. We expect these boats to arrive, I suppose, within twelve months, and £2,000 will not be sufficient to complete the submarine base at Port Stephens. I ask the Prime Minister to give the matter consideration.",71

620,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"ParramattaPrime Minister and Minister of Home Affairs) [12.9 a.m.]-About £700,000 of the amount is a commitment from last year. The balance represents nearly all that will be required for the completion of the Fleet U n it .",71

622,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"No , there is nothing new. It is simply for the completion of the Fleet U n it . An y further construction programme has yet to be promulgated. I believe that it will require over £100,000 more to complete the Fleet U n it . As a matter of fact, it will require an expenditure of £175,000 for machinery to complete the dock equipment before we can hope to complete the vessels of the Fleet.",71

628,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I shall be glad to make inquiries into the matter.,71
629,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"Brisbane) [12.11 a.m.] - I have already drawn attention to the utter unsuitability of H . M . A . S . Gaywidah for naval training purposes, and I have also protested against the vessel's removal from Brisbane to Sydney for an overhaul. Whatever she may have been in the past, she is quite unsuited for the training of the Queensland Naval Forces. Efforts should be made to secure a ship of the "" P "" class, such as the Pyramus, so that the naval trainees of the State may have encouragement to persevere in their work, and have a reasonable opportunity of becoming efficient in it . The capacity of the Gayundah is so limited, and her arrangements so unsuitable, that it is a wonder that the men can do their work with any reasonable degree of success or efficiency. Nothing becomes obsolete So quickly as a warship, and vessels of the Imperial Navy are continually becoming obsolete. One of these vessels would serve well in place of the Gayundah, and could be obtained by the Government at a reasonable cost. If a suitable vessel were obtained, it would greatly facilitate and develop naval training in Queensland. Mr Frazer, (Kalgoorlie) [12.14 .a.m.] - Our naval expenditure has reached such alarming proportions that I am sorry that I agreed to allow the Estimates to pass to-night. On page 265, £112,000 is proposed for machinery and plant. The Prime Minister has told us that £175,000 is to be spent on machinery for the Fitzroy Dock, independently of this amount. I should like information regarding the item.",71

Division 15 (Northern, Territory), £59,850. Colonel RYRIE (North Sydney) [12.16 a.m.] - There are many items set down for expenditure in the Northern Territory against which I should have nothing to say if they were likely to encourage settlement there, but. they not likely to bring one settler to the Territory. There is, for instance, £4,000 put down for additional office accommodation. There are fewer than 1,000 married men, £ 2 , 0 0 0 "" ; white persons in the Territory, so that this additional office accommodation is cost £ 4 a head. Then £2,000 is to voted for new Government stables and quarters for attendants. I do not think there is any need for that expenditure. Further, £10,000 is provided to build houses for Government employees at Port Darwin. Last year, £21,000 was appropriated for this purpose, and £19,277 spent. This year's appropriation will bring the expenditure up to £30,000, or more than £ 3 0 for each white person in the Territory. To provide aboriginal schools at Darwin, Pine Creek, and All i gator Creek, £2,000 is set down. I know something about the way in which aboriginals should be treated. In my opinion, they are best left to live their own lives, because attempts to civilize them bring about their absolute destruction. If we set apart large reserves for them, and made very strict regulations to prevent interference with them, we should do something for this unfortunate race, which we know must go, but it is useless to endeavour to civilize them. A l together, £59,000 is to be spent in public buildings, offices, stables, and houses for employees. We are spending too much money on the Territory, and are thus adding to the terrible cost of its administration, making it a burden on the Commonwealth, without doing anything conducive to settlement. It should be the object of the Government to spend money there in such a way as will cause men of the right sort to settle in the Territory. These Mr ROBERTS - What would the honourable member take to go up there? Colonel' RYRIE - I would not go there under any circumstances. We have taken over a "" white elephant."" I am convinced that the only way to settle the Territory is to run a railway out there at any cost through New South Wales. I think that a lot of these items represent extravagant expenditure.",72
631,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,Eden Monaro) [12.21 a.m.] - I think that we ought to have an explanation of this proposed expenditure.,72
632,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,To what items are does the honourable member refer?,72
633,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"To ""Addition s to buildings and fencings, £2,500 "" ; "" Houses for far m manager and ""Additional office accommodation, £ 4 , 0 0 0 "" ; "" New to Government stables and quarters for atbe tendants, £1,000 "" ; "" Workers' quarters, Darwin, £ 2 , 0 0 0 "" ; and ""Houses for Government employees, Darwin, £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 ."" These items represent an expenditure of many thousands of pounds upon the Territory, where, we are told, there are only seven settlers. I am informed that there are only 350 white people in Darwin. Yet, last year, £1,000 was expended on a steam laundry for them.",72
634,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,That item has been knocked out.,73
635,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"The fact that there are such items on the Estimates proves that there is a screw loose in our administration of the Northern Territory. We allow officers to run Departments, and there is no proper control over them. I ask the Minister of External Affairs to tell the Committee the number of public servants we have at Port Darwin. I think he will find that on these Estimates we are voting more than sufficient money to provide each of them with a nicely-ornamented brick house.",73
636,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,I think that the expenditure will repay the Commonwealth quite as well as will the expenditure upon the Federal Capital.,73
637,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"That is a matter of opinion. I enter my emphatic protest against the items which I have enumerated, and if a satisfactory explanation be not forthcoming I shall propose a reduction upon some of them.",73
638,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"We spent £61,000 last year upon the Territory, and this year we propose to expend £59,000. We must give the country a chance.",73
639,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"But it is idle to give it a chance by spending money on houses for public servants, instead of on the promotion of settlement. If are to subsidize the Territory in the way that is proposed, where is the money to come from? As the honourable member for Adelaide has challenged the expenditure on the Federal Capital, I shall test his sincerity a little later.",73
640,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,Upon what item?,73
641,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,I shall tell the honourable member when we reach it.,73
642,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"Angas-Minister of External Affairs) [12.26 a.m.] - The first item to which the honourable member for Eden-Monaro has taken exception relates to "" additions to buildings and fencing."" In regard to that, I believe that the penditure relates not to ornamental houses, but to the police station at Alice Springs, and to certain fencing which is required at Port Darwin. The houses for the farm manager and married men, to which he referred, are intended to be erected upon the experimental farms which were established by the late Government. I ask honourable members not to condemn them until we ascertain exactly what they are doing. A great many reports concerning them have reached me, but I am inclined to think that these experimental farms are not quite as bad as they are represented to be. At any rate, it is the only fair to hear what the officials have to say about them.",73
643,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,Will the Minister send a man up to report upon them 1,73
644,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"The complaint made"" by some honourable members is that there are too many officers in the Territory, whilst others ask us to send up more officers.",73
645,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,Onl y one.,73
646,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"At present there are, or until recently there were, no houses on these experimental farms. The men have been living in tents. Then additional office accommodation is to be provided at Darwin. The report I have is that the present accommodation is very poor. The money asked for 'on these Estimates is intended to provide a two-storied building to accommodate officers of five Departments. It is also proposed to spend £1,000 on new schools at Daly and Stapleton. We cannot expect persons to stay at these places unless provision be made for the education of their children. The honourable member for North Sydney has referred to aboriginal schools. I may tell him that an we attempt is now being made to give effect to the suggestions of Professor Spencer in this connection. Only within the last two hours I received a telegram that some of these schools have just been opened, and that at one of them, where it was expected that the pupils would be very few, about sixteen children-half caste and aboriginal-ar e entering their attendance. In regard to the houses for Government employees at Darwin, for which £10,000 is provided, the accommodation is to consist of sixteen or twenty houses for officials, and the buildings are to be erected about 2 miles distant from Darwin. The rental of these dwellings ex- will run from £50 to £100 a year, and if the Administrator's estimate be right, the rents will return a fair interest on the capital outlay, in addition to creating, perhaps, a sinking f u n d against the capital cost. It has been stated that there are only seven settlers in the Territory, but that statement is not correct. What is really referred to is this fact : In the Ordinance passed in November last year, provision was made for lands for agriculture and also mixed farming to be surveyed before selection could take place. In accordance with that Ordinance surveys were made, and, as a result of the surveys, we had forty-six blocks available in A p r i l and June last. These were advertised, twenty in one place and twenty-six in another, and there were 369 applications for the blocks. Of the successful applicants, about twenty, settlers are now on, or are on their way to , the land; and from the last information I have, others have still to settle on the blocks. If the attempt at settlement has not made greater advance, it is,' to an extent, due to the fact that the Ordinance prescribed that survey must precede actual settlement; but I am attempting to alter the terms of the Ordinance so that we need not necessarily wait for surveys to be made.",73
647,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"How many to white employees are there at Port Darwin Are there 100 or 1,000 ?",74
648,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"There are not 1,000 the employ of the Government. are only about 2,000 whites there altogether. The honourable member expect me to carry the figures in my head.",74
649,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"When we are asked to provide £30,000 or £40,000 for houses for these officers, the Minister should have the information.",74
650,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,I ask honourable mema bers to be a little patient. When the Territory was taken over from South Austaken tralia there were only three settlers with farms. An attempt has since been made to induce further settlement. Whether it is on the right or wrong lines is a tion to be decided.,74
651,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,Hav e you any gests policy different from that of the late vernment ?,74
652,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,We are endeavouring to develop one. I have a Bill being drafted dealing with the land question.,74

657,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,Are there 300 ?,74
658,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I do not believe there are, to use these houses. This money is also for offices, and the officers are to pay rent-som e £ 1 0 0 , some £ 6 0 , and some £ 5 0 , for about twenty houses. I have seen the list of the rents expected to be paid, and I am considering whether they are too high or too low. If the honourable member wishes to have in formation in regard to any particular item, I shall give it to him.",74
659,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"Brisbane) [12.35 a.m.] - It is refreshing to hear honourable members expressing an opinion in regard to the expenditure on the Northern Territory. One cannot forget that some of the honourable members on the Government side, when they were in Opposition, were continually abusing the Government of the day for their parsimony in regard the development of the Northern Terri? tory. They asked how could we develop that Territory without the expenditure of in money, and why the Government were not There tackling the problem nobly.",74
660,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,It cannot be cannot done by building houses.,74
661,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"Accordin g to the honourable member for North Sydney, too much money is being spent, but Government supporters at the last election were strong in their remarks concerning the Northern Territory. They said it was disgrace that the late Government, having taken over the Territory and undera liability of £6,000,000 in connection with it , were unwilling or unable to propound a policy for its development I take exception to the statement of the queshonorable member for North Sydney in regard to the aborigines. What he sugis on the lines of the policy followed Goin the past with disastrous results. The aborigines have been lef t too much to themselves.",74
662,Colonel RYRIE,Unknown,They have not been left to themselves.,74
663,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"They have been subjected to a certain amount of interby friends of the honourable member, and they have arrived at a stage when they demand, in the name of humanity, and in the name of ordinary civilization, that we should pay some attention to them. The meagre sum for schools is a very small instalment of the debt we owe to the aborigines of the Northern Territory. We have taken the land from them, and the least we can do is to educate them, at any rate against some of the vices introduced among them by friends of the honourable member, who have had the ru n of that country during the last century.",74
664,Colonel RYKIE,Unknown,I take exception to the remarks of the honourable member. He is casting a reflection on me when he says that some of my friends have been in any way responsible for certain things.,75
665,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,The honourable member will withdraw the remark.,75
666,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"If the honourable member for North Sydney takes it as a personal reflection, I withdraw it . My reference was in a general way to those engaged in pastoral pursuits. commend the Government for increasing the expenditure in certain directions. In regard to the item of £8,000 for roads and bridges, I believe that while we can expend a very large sum most advantageously in the construction of railways, the construction of roads is almost of equal importance If we are to develop the Northern Territory we must do it by the construction of railways and roads together. On the Loan Bill there is a sum of £400,000 for a railway in one small corner of the Territory, but we are trying to get settlers for a very different part, where there are practically no roads, and where there are great rivers to cross. There are no means of getting over these rivers, but there is no suggestion as to providing launches, or ferries, or steamer communication. I believe we have a great asset in the Northern Territory. Any one could see from the cinematograph films recently taken that the country is capable of great development, but £8,000 will not go far. I should like the Government to come down with a bold, courageous policy. They ought to be able to find £100,000 to spend on roads. W it h regard to the item of £10,000 for ""houses for Government employees at Darwin, I regret to have to join issue with the honourable member for Eden-Monaro.",75
667,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,Why regret?,75
668,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"I regret that the amount is so small. We invite persons to go to the Northern Territory, and, according to the reports from Port Darwin, there is practically no accommodation for people, and what accommodation is obtainable is of a very inferior sort. I understand that there are certain hotels, and the least said about their accommodation, perhaps, the.better. Visitors have informed me that the only accommodation they could get was in outhouses or places which had been abandoned by Chinese. There was a difficulty in getting even a decent tent. I contend that the Ministry ought at least to make sure that their own employees should have decent places to live in . I do not suggest that they should be provided' with weatherboard cottages or handsome villas, but with reasonable accommodation. I seem to get a fair share of the correspondence from the Northern Territory, and every letter I receive contains nothing but complaints about the want of accommodation. If we expect good men to go I up and settle the country, we shall have to provide decent places for them to live in. I see no reason why the Government should not also provide some measure of accommodation for persons who go to Darwin, and have to stay there for some days, or perhaps weeks. In many cases persons go to Darwin looking for land. There is bound to be an increase in the population, and, therefore, accommodation ought to be provided. I reserve further remarks on this matter until another occasion. The one thing I do regret in relation to the Estimates for the Northern Territory is the decrease of £1,235 in the expenditure. When one recalls what was said by the Opposition in the last Parliament as to the want of courage on the part of the Government, and their shocking meanness as regards expending money to open up the Northern Territory, one wonders whether even the honourable member for Eden-Monaro will have the courage to propose a reduction in these Estimates, and if he does, how many honourable members he will get to support him.  I am very sorry indeed to have to rise at this hour to make a few remarks, but I offer no apology. I have had to submit for a considerable time to gibes from the Opposition that we on this side are tied up and dare not speak. I do not view the Northern Territory in a hostile way. On the contrary, I desire to see the Territory settled, and settled properly by a contented yeomanry. Out of the twenty-eight items under the head of the Northern Territory, I venture to say that there are only four items which are likely to be of any good service in regard to the development of the country. These four items involve an expenditure of £17,000, whilst the remainder represent an expenditure of £42,000. We are trying to induce persons to go to'the Northern Territory, because we desire to see the country settled as part and parcel of our defence policy. Although the Northern Territory is the weakest link in the chain of defence, yet we find that more encouragement is held out to Government employees than to persons who go there to settle, and, at the same time, to defend the country. Twenty-five or t h i r t y years ago I had an opportunity of going through the Territory. I am sorry that the sum allotted for roads, streets, and bridges is not £16,000, instead of £8,000. I think that every sensible settler will approve of the item of £2,000 for water conservation north of Katherine. The item of £4,000 for the erection of windmills and pumps is in the same category; and so, too, is the item of £3,000 for a new boring plant, including a horse.team. Those items must, I think, commend themselves to all who desire to see the Northern Territory settled; but it is quite a different thing when we come to items such as £10,000 to provide houses for Government employees at Darwin, especially when it is remembered that £19,277 was spent last year to provide houses for men who, before they go to Darwin, take good care that the wage they are to get is a very substantial one-in contradistinction to the ordinary settler who has to carve his house out of bark. Whether it is an ordinary mia-mia or a bark humpy does not appeal to those who drafted this proposal. So far as I am aware, Government employees get a good living wage, and should, therefore, be prepared to house themselves. I think that the item I have referred to ought to be substantially decreased, until we can see some evidence of settlement being brought about. One or two other items have been criticised, and I do not propose to deal with them. I think that some inducement should be offered to the right class of men to go to the Northern Territory, and that the men who are there under contract to the Government should not be spoon-fed in the way I have pointed out.",75
669,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"Adelaide) [12.48 a.m.] - I can congratulate the honourable gentleman who has just spoken on breaking silence, particularly as the Northern Territory is some 3,000 or 4,000 miles away, and, consequently, he is encouraged to be talkative in the circumstances. There seems to be, on the part of the honourable member and one or two of his friends, a particular hatred of Government employees-the ordinary mechanic, the tradesman, the shop assistant, and the clerk. Whenever anything is proposed which indicates consideration for that section of the community, the hatred bursts out in almost volcanic force, and objection is at once taken. Really, sir, it seems deplorable. That class of the community is composed of valuable citizens. There is no doubt that they pay their way. They are"" useful, they are wanted, and they perform the ordinary duties of citizens, which makes their presence in the country acceptable and valuable. They have as much right to consideration as have other sections of the community; but, apparently, the honourable member for Hume would keep all good things, all sweets and happiness and the sunshine of life, for a small section of the community amongst whom he more particularly moves, while the rest are to be the subject of rigorous treatment of an exceptional character.  is quite wrong.",76
670,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"It is time exception was taken to such utterances. Honourable members opposite are unanimous in their desire to encourage immigration, and I fail to understand why mechanics, shop assistants, and others coming to this country should immediately meet with the antipathy of the very men who have enticed them here.  tional treatment?",76
671,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"-No exceptional treatment is proposed. Government officers-in the Northern Territory are to pay rent for these buildings, and the Governmentwill get a good return on the money in vested. Houses are essential in this tropical part of the Commonwealth, and if fchey are not provided we shall not be able to induce even Government employees to go there. The rent to be charged for these houses will give exceptional interest on the cost of construction.",76
672,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,I challenge that statement.,77
673,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"The men must have proper housing accommodation. The honourable member for Hume talks about settlers being asked to go upfcothe Northern Territory. I would remind him that the Territory has been open for settlers for forty years or more, and that land has been available to them on exceptional terms. What has become of the hardy settlers of whom he speaks? They could have secured hundreds of thousands of acres at purely nominal rates had they wished to go there.",77
674,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,They did not go because it was not good enough.,77
675,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"Specia l efforts have to be made if we arefcosettle particular part of the Commonwealth. few persons have endeavoured to monopowhen lize huge areas there, and have taken leases, but have not done much to develop the place itself. Extraordinary methods have to be resorted to in order to develop the Territory, and the M in istry are carrying on to some extent the policy of their predecessors. We shall not get settlers there until we have a certain number of Government employees. These public servants will be engaged making railway surveys, in surveying the land, and carrying on work preliminary to a permanent yeomanry being established there. They are therefore assisting in opening up country.

I am surdate prised that the honourable member for should take exception to a vote reauired to make provision for ried peopie in the Northern Territory. He should remember that no one can get a piece of land at Port Darwin on which to build a house. The place is cut up settle people in the Territory. into blocks, .which are held by absentees, and people wishing to provide accommoin dation for themselves have had to apply to the Government for leave to erect houses ou a Government reserve.

I cannot bring myself to believe there is such a dissimilarity between Northern Queensland ^nd the Northern Territory.",82

744,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"We could not give the freehold for a big pastoral station. It seems to me we have been putting the cart .before the horse in connection with the development of the Northern Territory by having small settlement before we have begun to develop big settlement. It is the reverse of the order that has been followed in pioneering Australia. If the Committee \yould allow the Estimates, to go through, I promise that, before other Estimates are furnished-if we are in office-w e shall lay down a definite constructive policy with regard to this Territory, though I am afraid, speaking now, that it wil l consist of nothing but a vigorous railway policy to open up the country - and provide facilities.",82

I hope honourable members, wil l allow these items to go through. They may hack them about, but in doing so they may hack the. wrong items as well as way to the right ones. The only thing to do is to wait for a. definite policy and leave these details for the attention of the Government. Most, of the expenditure is necessary because of what has gonei before, It costs and by reason of the fact that we. are trying to induce small settlement up there. If Many of these items are incidental tp small settlements.

752,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"If the Minister had given the information on item 20, there would not have been so much discussion. His explanation now is that he was committed to the expenditure by the late Government. It is scandalous expenditure. No one can say how many employees there are in the Northern Territory, and yet; we had £19,000 spent last year on houses for these employees, and it is proposed to spend £20,000 more this year. The Minister tells us he is committed to an expenditure of £39,000.",83

I feel very much disposed to move a reduction. The Prime Minister has made a fair promise, but where are we drifting? We have no policy, as the Prime Minister says, and we are laying the foundation for an expenditure that may amount to millions. Mr W. H. IRVINE - Then better move your reduction.",83
756,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"Because we have had no explanation, and as a protest against doing things that will not tend towards the development of the Northern Territory, I propose to move that the item be reduced by £1,000.",83

763,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,I shall give information on any item you wish.,83
764,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"If the Minister had said that the Government were simply continuing the expenditure initiated by the late Government, and that they could not stop the undertaking without incurring great loss, and if lie had said that the Prime Minister intended to adopt a policy altering the methods and systems in vogue, and trying to encourage settlement and open up the country by railways",83

It has been represented to me. that the building has been put up because the officers of five Departments are scattered over Darwin, and are said to be living in somewhat insanitary conditions. The last Government decided to put the officers into a two-storied concrete building. It was partly erected when we took office, and, of course, we could not stop the work. That is the explanation 1I have to offer on the item.",83

To that statement. I take strong exception.,84

779,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"There will be some millions of stock there, I hope, before long. I suggest, in all sincerity, that we should be afforded an opportunity of discussing the'matter before an agreement is entered into. The question of whether there shall be a monopoly dealing with the freezing of stock is a question of vast magnitude, almost international in i m portance. Ifc may even be that the people who are associated, with the great Meat Trust of America may secure that monopoly. That will mean that for all time the Northern Territory, so far as stock-owners are concerned, will be in the grip of that Meat Trust. I enter a protest now.",84
780,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,It is not that company. It is one of the best English companies.,84
781,Mr ROBERT S,Unknown,"The honourable gentleman must know tha? the best English companies are - unfortunately being gradually mopped out by American companies in every direction, and becoming international.
