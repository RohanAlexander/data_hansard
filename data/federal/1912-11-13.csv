Mr KING O'MALLEY - Yesterday the honourable member for South Sydney asked a question, regarding the printing of the Commonwealth electoral rolls in New South Wales, to which I promised to reply today.

Mr KING O'MALLEY - The answers to the honourable member's questions are1. Yes. 2. There was no delay.

1,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Yesterday the honourable members for Maribyrnong and Melbourne Government asked questions regarding the outbreak of ment meascles on board the IrisJiman. In reply to the honourable member for Maribyrnong, provide I have been informed that the first case of measles was in a passenger who, judging by month the date of the onset of the disease, have been infected before leaving England. Measles is, I am, informed, a very infecof tious disease, and is infectious from the penalty? - earliest stage of the disease. The other cases were apparently due to infection from contract this case and from subsequent cases. I am informed the only way to curb such an break is(a) For the medical officer to make routine is signed. - thorough inspections of all passengers daily during the voyage. (i) To provide sufficient proper observation and isolation hospital accommodation. (c) To remove to hospital any passenger showing the least suspicion of communicable disease.

As to the question asked by the honourable the member for Melbourne, I am informed The total number of baths on board for paswas six, a wholly inadequate provision for 1,300 persons.

52,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Order ! The honourable member is now discussing something; which is not before the Chair.

57,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Yes .,17
58,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"When the Prime Minasked in the first instance for leave to make the second reading of the Bill an Order of the Day for a later hour, he stated that the idea was to have a discussion on the whole of the Bills, as we hadI asked him. whether the time limit would apply to the second-reading debate on the first measure,, he said that it would, except in the. case of the Leader of the Opposition. On' but that understanding, I immediately objected, because it is impossible, I take it,, a number of honourable members to give. can due weight to these large proposals",17

66,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That is not a point of order at all. It has nothing to the question.,18

70,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Will the honourable . member wait a moment until we get this matter settled ? Question resolved in the affirmative. NA (NATIONALIZATIO N OF MONOPOLIES) BILL.,18
71,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Wide Bay-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [10.49] - I move That leave be given to bring in a Bill for an - Act to alter the Constitution by empowering the - Parliament to make laws with respect to industries and' businesses declared to be the subject of a' monopoly. Last night I understood the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to agree - with me that the same course should 'be adopted on this occasion as was .adopted on the last occasion when - similar measures were before the House, and that is, that a general discussion should take place on one Bill, and that the other measures should be debated according to the rights of honourable members under the - Standing Orders, neither extending nor limiting them. That is the position which nve take up. I think it is a course which - is convenient both to honourable members and the people of the country. 1",18
72,Mr GLYNN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We can speak to all and speak to each.,18
73,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yes . The honourable member can exercise his undoubted right's when the other measures are brought on. With the consent of Mr Speaker, a general - discussion can ensue. The intervention of the honourable member for Richmond, and the reason he gave, do not affect the position at all. We propose to ask that the opener of the debate, namely, the Attorney-' General', and the Leader of the Opposition, - may have unlimited time, and that honour the rest of the members shall cona fine themselves to one.hour, and five minutes.",18
74,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The right honourable member does not propose that we should confine ourselves to one hour and do with five minutes on the general question?,18
75,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yes . Mr W. H . . IRVINE - That will be quite insufficient. When the Mr. JOSEPH COOK (Parramatta) time [10.50] - The Prime Minister proposes an few arrangement, which, in his own words, is precisely the same as that adopted on the last occasion. But the rignt honourable gentleman forgets that on this occasion there is a difference, that we are tied down to one hour and five minutes in the general discussion on the second reading of six separate Bills. My own impression is that time would be saved by removing the limit so far as the'preliminary discussion is concerned-that if the general discussion on the second reading of the first Bill were without limitation, an immense amount of time would be. saved at subsequent stages.",18
76,Mr MATHEWS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"We have had strong indications from the Opposition that that would not be so, but that they would fight each Bill. 6",18
77,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Without consulting my leader, or any other members of my party, my impression is that if there were unlimited discussion on the second reading of the first Bill, we need not all discuss every Bill separately, except,- of course, in Committee. If only one hour and five minutes is fo be allowed to each member on the general discussion, the arrangement will be more or less of a farce, for it will meannothing. If the Prime Minister and the party behind him are going to stand on their rights, and enforce the new Standing Orders strictly, I am not sure that we on this side ought not to stand on our rights, and prevent the Attorney-General from roaming all oyer the Bills .in a way that we are not permitted to do.",18
78,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Honourable members opposite cannot do that, because the Attorney-General has the full right of speech",18
79,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It is a matter of the rights of the House, and it does not"" rest on the ipse dixit, of any honourable member, not even the Speaker,- who, I take it, is bound by the rules of this Chamber. If honourable members opposite are going to take this lofty attitude, they will find that two can play at that game That is all I have to say at present. Mr W. H . IRVIN E (Flinders) [10.54]. - I first heard of some arrangement a few minutes ago, and it is very important to honourable members on both sides to know what the terms are. I agree absolutely with the view now made clear by the Prime Minister. I must confess I did not quite catch the meaning of his earlier statements, though that, of course, may have been due to the noise in the chamber. As I understand the position, however, it is desired to do what was done on the previous occasion, namely, to have a general discussion on the first Bill in relation to all the other Bills and to the Constitution. - Mr FISHER - Yes . Mr \V. H . IRVINE - And subsequently to give an opportunity, as the Standing Orders require, to discuss each of the Bills separately. With that I am entirely in accord, and there can, I think, be no dispute in this connection. speaking now as one who supported, and who still supports, the general application of the time limit. But it would be unfortunate, no matter what the views of either party may be, if any member who desired to express his views on a fundamental change in the Constitution were prevented from doing so by any time limit. This is one case in which it is absolutely essential that the time limit should not be applied. For my own part, it would be quite impossible for me to state at all fairly and effectively, with the utmost attempt at conciseness of which I am capable-and I think I am capable of some attempt at conciseness-m y views on the relation of these proposed amendments to the Constitution and to one another. hope I may not be regarded as egotistical in saying this, because I fancy I am merely expressing the position in which other honourable members find themselves. No doubt some arrangement is necessary, but if the arrangement implies that there is to be a limit on the general discussion",18
80,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member has heard the statement of the Prime Minister.,19
81,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Wit h that I am entirely in accord, with the exception I have indicated. I do not think that the Postmaster-General quite understands the position. I quite agree that there should be a general discussion, and a separate discussion on each Bill, but it is quite impossible for the general discussion to be effectively carried out with a limit of one hour and five minutes on each member. Any one who has really studied this subject carefully ought to'have an opportunity to cover the whole ground; and it would be a dangerous and bad thing if , with regard to proposed changes in the Constitution, a time limit were imposed. I am entirely in favour of the general and rigid application of the time limit in most matters, but on a question of this sort it ought not to be applied.",19
82,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I desire to make a personal explanation. There seems 'to be an impression abroad that the Prime Minister last night made an arrangement with me as to the course to be followed in connection with these Bills. The Prime Minister is frequently doing that sort of thing.,19
83,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Order ! The honourable member is going beyond a personal exI am planation.,19
84,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I submit that I did not; I desire to say, if I may, that I made no agreement.",19
85,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member is quite in order in doing that, blithe was going quite beyond a personal explanation.",19
86,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I have no intention of doing so. All that occurred was that the Prime Minister met me in the lobby and told me what he had decided to do. If that is an'"" arrangement "" I do not know the meaning of the word. I understand an arrangement to be something; concurred in on both sides.",19
87,Mr WEBSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Did the honourable memI ber object when the Prime Minister stated? what he intended to do?,19
88,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I told the Prime Minister that I thought the time allowed* for the general discussion was not enough ;, it is absurd on the face of it, and will not save time in any way.",19
89,Mr MATHEWS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Melbourne Ports> [10.57] - This is a question that I should* like to see debated exhaustively, but a simple sum in arithmetic shows that, if each member occupies the full time allowed, six and a half weeks will be occupied in the discussions on the secondreadings.",19
90,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Suppose that is. so?,19
91,Mr GLYNN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Angas) [10.58] - It is a-, good arrangement to have a general discussion on all the Bills when the second reading of the first is proposed. This, I take? it, will have to be done with the permis-sion of the House, and whatever privilege - attaches to the Attorney-General will be conceded to every other honourable member; that is, it will not interfere with the right of each honourable member to take his full hour and five minutes in connection with each specific Bill.",19
92,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,No .,20
93,Mr GLYNN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yesterdav morning a suggestion of the sort, I understand, made by the Attorney-General, heard of it when the House met in the afternoon. I suggest that in the run it would lead to conciseness on ' particular Bill if the time limit in general discussion were extended from (hour and five minutes to one hour 4hirty-five minutes. I do not believe ihonorable members will wander unnecesChristmas sarily in dealing with these amendments; tout if there is to be a general discussion - some suggestion of the kind I have - ought to be adopted.",20
94,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That would prolong - session until after Christmas.,20
95,Mr GLYNN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am suggesting what 'believe in the long run would lead to .ciseness; and it is a suggestion I made 'last night when I was spoken to on - subject by one or two honourable members - on this side. The full time may not be taken up by all honourable members, and 1 believe that an extension to one hour - thirty-five minutes for the purposes of general discussion would have an effect the discussion on each particular Bill - sequently. I merely make the suggestion. 'It is for the Government to say what can 'be done.",20
96,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Maribyrnong) [n.o] ' I understood that the arrangement was that the Attorney-General was troduce the first Bill this afternoon, that the debate was then to be adjourned until Friday, when the Leader of the position was to reply. I understood that both the Attorney-General and the Leader of the Opposition were to be allowed unam limited time to discuss the general prinpermitted, ciples of the Bills, after which each ' nary member was to be entitled, Standing Orders, to one hour and five minutes.",20
97,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Eac h subsequent speaker. the Prime,20
98,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member one who has for Flinders and others seem to think that ever since 1891, the subjects which we are about to discuss limited to an hour are entirely new. But every one knows that see - She session before last",20
99,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Order ! The honourable member must not refer to the merits of the question.,20
100,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"We are conversant with the matters to be discussed upon the Bills. To ask that each honourable member shall be allowed to speak for more than an hour and five minutes is, in my humble judgment, to ask for too much.",20
101,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Is the honourable was member quite sure that he is conversant but I only with the subject?,20
102,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I know the honourable long gentleman's logical power and his capacity each for condensation. I am prepared to listen the to him. As he is particularly concise, I one feel sure that he will be able to give us his and views fully in an hour and five minutes. that Personally, being desirous of eating my dinner at home, I am of opinion that the Standing Orders should be adhered to strictly, so that the business mav made be transacted as rapidly as possible.",20
103,Mr ATKINSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Wilmot) [11.3] - I the feel sure that the Prime Minister will shorten the debate if Ke will allow every I honourable member who desires to speak on conthe second reading of the first constitutional measure to take his time. If every the honourable member is to occupy an hour and five minutes on each of the Bills, far more time will be occupied than if a fair amount of time were allowed on the first measure. and There would then be little need to occupy the much time with the second reading of the on subsequent Bills. I take it that the subsubject is one to which each honourable member desires to address himself seriously. I am satisfied that there will be no unnecessary padding in speeches. There certainly is no reason for ""stone-walling."" ' If made the Prime Minister wishes to afford to in the House the best opportunity of and discussing the question, he should realise that each Bill is so intimately connected Opwith every other that, to make the debate intelligible, an honourable member must be allowed to roam over the whole field. I sure that time will be saved if that is because then there will be no ordineed to make long second-reading speeches under the on the whole of the Bills.",20
104,Dr MALONEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Melbourne) [11.5] I hope that the arrangement indicated by Minister will be adhered to. As lectured on the referendum and whose lectures were and a half, I cannot why any honourable member should require more than an hour to speak on the subject. We know that not a single vote will be changed by any speech made on either side of the House.",20
105,Mr WEBSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Gwydir) [n.6] - My first impression was that it would be wise to adhere strictly to the standing order in the discussion of the Constitutional Bills. But on reflection I am bound to admit that the question is a very grave one indeed. It is one of the most important questions that has ever been discussed in this Parliament; one of the most important that may ever be discussed, taking into account the width of its application and the far-reaching character of the proposals of the Government. Therefore, I have come to the conclusion that, whether votes are changed by speeches or not, honourable members have a right to express their opinions for the benefit of their fellow members and for the benefit of the people outside who will read our speeches. I think that nothing will be gained by restricting honourable members from stating their case in the most convenient, clear, and expressive way, so that the whole ground may be covered. On reflection I also disagree with the proposal to give preferential treatment to the Minister in charge of this business and to the Leader of the Opposition. Other honourable members have the same rights as they. No two men in this House monopolize all the wisdom. There are others who are able to express themselves in as concise and clear a way as those two gentlemen may be. I realise that much time cannot be saved by severe restriction. I am also of opinion that if the restriction is imposed' there will be a long, and possibly acrimonious, debate on each subsequent Constitution Bill, instead of a good-tempered discussion on the first Bill. A ll the questions covered by the Bills are interlaced and inter-related. They all affect social, commercial, and industrial aspects of the life of this country. It is necessary to show the public how the various links in the chain affect the policy of the Commonwealth, and how the chain, as a whole, is strengthened by each link in regard to carrying out the policy which the Government and their party desire to pursue. I do not know that it will be necessary for any speaker to enter into details in the discussion of each Bill. The essence of each proposal should 'be indicated pretty clearly in the general debate. Every honourable member should have an opportunity of making his views intelligible to the people who will read his speech for their own enlightenment in the future. I think it should be left to the good sense ofi honourable members not to introduce unnecessary matter, but to restrict themselves asclosely as possible to the subjects to be brought before the House.",21
106,Mr GORDON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Boothby) [11.9] - Ne w standing order 257A, which imposes the time limit on speeches, makes an exception in regard to debates on the Address-in-Reply and no-confidence motions. Surely_ it cannot be asserted that the subjects which we are about to discuss are of far moreimportance to the country than such debates. I think that the Prime Minister would be conducing to the saving of time if he allowed an exception in the case of the Bills seeking to alter the Constitution. There will be no saving of time if honourable members are strictly limited. If a time limit is to be imposed on ordinary members of the House, then let it be applied all round. Do not let us have any preferential treatment in respect of either the Minister moving the second reading of any Bill or the honourable member who happens for the 'time being to be the Leader of the Opposition. We are all equally interested in a proposal for the amendment of the Constitution, and therefore I put it to the Prime Minister that if any exception, be contemplated he should consider the advisableness of allowing us all to come under the operation of the Standing Orders upon equal terms.",21
107,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,There is a proviso to the time limit fixed by the Standing Orders.,21
108,Mr GORDON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Unde r the Standing Orders there is no exception, so far as a Bill of this character is concerned, even in favour of the Minister charged with the duty of moving that it be read a second time.",21
109,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Richmond) [11.12] - I E the desire of the Prime Minister in proposing that we shall adhere strictly to the time limit imposed by the Standing Orders is to save time. I am confident that he will, 1 not achieve his object. Such a course of action would really involve the waste of a great deal of time. Personally, I do not anticipate that I shall desire to exceed the limit imposed by the Standing Orders, but there are many important aspects of the question involved to which other honourable members are much better able to address themselves than I am. If it be the desire of the Government to dispose of the debate on these Bills in a reasonable time, then I think that they should agree to allow the fullest possible discussion on the motion for the second reading of the first Bill- a discussion covering the whole of the groundtraversed by the remaining measures. If. that be done I"" shall be prepared to sacrifice my right to speak on the motion for the second leading of the remaining Bills and to deal with them only in Committee.",21
110,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Why not let this matter go, and in the interval we shall surely be - able to come to an understanding?",22
111,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,If the Prime Minister - will give us some assurance of what he is going to do,22
112,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member ahot out his gun right away.,22
113,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I wished to preserve the rights of honourable members. I was - under the impression that the right honourable gentleman contemplated what would amount to a very serious inroad on our fights. Mr W. H. IRVINE - We were placed in possession of the proposed arrangement before we came into the House.,22
114,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"-Quite so, and I objected because I recognised that once the desired leave was given there would be no going back.",22
115,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member objected later on.,22
116,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The position was not explained until I did object. I submit - that, in the circumstances, it would be reasonable to allow the debate on' the motion for the second reading of the first Bill to - cover the whole scope of the six measures.",22
117,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That is what I am proposing, and that is what the honourable member is objecting to.",22
118,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I repeat that I am - not speaking for myself in asking that honourable members be allowed to speak for an unlimited time on the motion for the second reading of the first Bill. I do tiot anticipate that I shall require to ex-' - ceed the time limit of one hour and five minutes, but there are honourable members - who are specially competent to throw a - great deal of light upon important phases - of this proposal which the House and - country should fully understand. I hope, therefore, that my suggestion will be adopted.",22
119,Mr RILEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"South Sydney) [11.16] I desire to fall in with the suggestion - made, I understand, by the Acting Leader of the Opposition, that a general discussion, without any time limit, should take place on the motion for the second reading of the first Bill on the understanding that honourable members agree not to repeat the second-reading, debate on each measure.",22
120,Mr MATHEWS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Any individual member could break that arrangement.,22
121,Mr RILEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I think, at all events, that it would lead to a great saving of time without actually imposing any time limit on honourable members who wish to speak for more than an hour and five minutes.",22
122,Mr FINLAYSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"On a point of order, Mr Speaker, I desire to know whether this question can be discussed when there is no motion covering it before the House?",22
123,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I said at the outset that I understood that a motion was to be submitted, and that as an effort was being made to arrive at an agreement I should allow a certain amount of latitude.",22
124,Mr RILEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"My desire is really to save time, and I think that an arrangement between the Prime Minister and the not Leader of the Opposition to have a general discussion on the motion for the. second reading of the first Bill, and not to repeat it on the remaining measures would be beneficial to the House and the country.",22
125,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We cannot bind ourselves to that.,22
126,Mr WEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"East Sydney), [ n . 18] - I am strongly of opinion that if these measures are to be disposed of within a reasonable time, and every honourable member is to be given an opportunity to express his views respecting them, the Standing Orders should be strictly adhered to. When we have made a departure from the Standing Orders we have had occasion sometimes to regret our action, and if they be suspended on this occasion no one can tell where the debate will end. Under the Standing Orders each member may speak for an hour and five minutes on the motion for the second read : ing of a Bill, and if further discussion be desired an amendment can be moved on which every honourable member would be allowed' to make a second speech. We have been threatened with something of the kind by the; Opposition this morning. Then again, when we went into Committee, every honourable member would have the right to make two speeches of. half-an-hbur each on each clause* and if an amendment were moved there would be an opportunity to make yet another speech. It will, therefore, be seen that if the Standing Orders are strictly adhered to each honourable member may occupy at least two hours and five minutes in the discussion of each of .these Bills. We can with very good reason assume that honourable members opposite will take full advantage of every opportunity afforded by .the Standing Orders to occupy time in discussing these measures.",22
127,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member is now going beyond the question.,23
128,Mr WEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I should like to remind honourable members that in the Imperial Parliament the Minister in charge, in bringing under the notice of the House of Commons a question of such magnitude as the naval expenditure of the Empire, did not occupy more than an hour and five minutes in explaining the Government proposals. And Mr LLOYD - George made his Budget speech, in which reference was made to the Government proposals for insurance, and other matters of vital importance to the people of the United Kingdom, in an hour and thirty minutes. The time is coming when members of this House should marshal their facts, and when speaking avoid the introduction of extraneous matter which has no earthly connection with the question before the House. It is hard upon honourable members who wish to carry on the business of the country expeditiously to have to sit here and listen to speakers who do not confine themselves to the subject-matter of the measure before the House as they a night do without any necessity for the extension of the time limit. Every representative of the people in this House is entitled to discuss these measures, but it should not be difficult for honourable members to say what they wish to say in connection with them> within the time prescribed by the Standing Orders if they will only marshal their facts, and not introduce a lot of irrelevant matter, a practice which ' only makes honourable members ridiculous in the eyes of the people.",23
129,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Wakefield) [11.24] - I join with other honourable members in urging upon the Prime Minister the desirability of asking the House to consent to the suspension of the time limit to speeches, so far as the debate on the second reading of the first of these Bills is concerned. Honourable members on this side are earnest in their desire to get through the work as expeditiously as possible, consistently with efficiency. We are as earnest in our desire to bring the session to an early close, consistently with doing, justice to the important matters which haveyet to be discussed. I believe that if the time limit is not insisted upon in the discussion of the first of these Bills a great deal of time will ultimately be saved. This is the most important business we have had to deal with this session. It is the question of all questions which the people of the Commonwealth are waiting for. I protest as strongly as I know how against any curtailment of absolute freedom of speech in dealing thoroughly with the question involved in these Bills. I imagine that the majority of honourable members in discussing the second reading of the first of these measures,, should the proposal be accepted, will not exceed the time limit of an hour and five minutes; but there are some honourable members who will require to exceed that limit considerably, and we should be acting against the best interests of the country if we sought, in any way to curtail freedom of speech* in discussing these measures. It is highly 1 necessary in the interests of the people that a full opportunity should be afforded for the expression of all the facts and arguments for and against the great principles involved in these Bills. If there is to be a limit of speech in dealing withthese measures, it must apply all round.",23
130,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It is going to.,23
131,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"There must be no exception in the case of the Attorney-General or the Leader of the Opposition. I wish to remind the Prime Minister that under the standing order applying the time limit it would not be competent to extend the time, for the Attorney-General on one side or the Leader of the Opposition on the other, if a singlehonorable member on either side ^objected.",23
132,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member need not worry; we will stick to the standing order.,23
133,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member should not now discuss the standing order referred to.,23
134,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If I was, not in order in doing so I shall not transgress further, but I ask the Prime Minister whether, in view of the point to which I have directed his attention, he will now reconsider the whole matter in the interests of real expedition, and will ask honourable members to agree not to apply the time limit to the debate on the second reading ofi the first of these Bills.",23
135,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Wide Bay-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [11.2J] - I do not at all regret the debate which has taken place. I thought there would be no opposition at' - all to the proposal that the second reading of these Bills should be made an order of the day for a later hour so that the general principles might be discussed on the - first Bill. The debate has shown that the idea present. is a correct one. The only new feature that has arisen is the question whether we should have one debate on the whole of the Bills in dealing with the first of them and no second-reading debate on the others. If that course were to be followed, it would be necessary to suspend the standing order - imposing a.time limit upon speeches in the - case of the debate on the first measure. Am I to understand that that is the desire of honourable members opposite?",24
136,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"No , it is not. - stand by our rights. All we want is the same right all round.",24
137,Mr RILEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Then we shall adhere to the Standing. Orders.,24
138,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If honourable members will permit me to say so, it will not promote the business of Parliament or the interests of the peopleif in all cases they insist upon standing on their rights. Even you, sir, though you possessed the greatest talent, would be unable to make the business of Parliament run smoothly if you insisted at all times upon a strict observance of the Standing Orders. My suggestion is that honourable members should allow the Bills to come on and be discussed",24
139,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,And each honourable member to be allowed unlimited time for their discussion.,24
140,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable gentleman should have allowed me to complete my sentence. Why should not honourable members allow the Attorney-General to open up the debate on all these Bills? There would then be a day intervening during which we should be able to consult with members of the Opposition as regards terms.,24
141,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable gentleman cannot do that. There is nothing fair about that.,24
142,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am sure that the House will consent to give unlimited time to the Leader of the Opposition, and the Government will ask nothing for themselves that they are not prepared to give to the - Opposition.",24
143,Mr MATHEWS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable gentleman cannot bind the Opposition.,24
144,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I say that the Government will not ask anything for themselves which they are not prepared to concede to the Opposition. The Government have to make the attack in connection with this matter-the y have to prove their case. The Opposition, on the other hand, will probably defend the position which obtains at",24
145,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Will the Government consent to allow honourable members the same time in Committee as the Attorney-General occupies ?,24
146,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If effect were given to the original suggestion, I would even go so far as that.",24
147,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,And give us unlimited time in Committee?,24
148,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Honourable members We have unlimited time in Committee now. It is only necessary to move for the insertion of a word here or there,24
149,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Order ! The honourable member must not discuss that question.,24
150,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Unles s the matter is going to be approached from a very much higher plane, it will be very difficult to proceed with business at all. The Attorney General, for obvious reasons, is not present this morning. He wishes to be allowed to open up the whole case, and I believe that that is the general desire of honourable members.",24
151,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"In putting the motion, I wish honourable members clearly to understand that the debate which has taken place this morning must not be regarded as a precedent. With the consent of .the House, I permitted that discussion, .but, strictly speaking, it was not in order. I may add that the idea has been expressed that if honourable members desired to discuss some Bills, other than that immediately under consideration, that could not be done unless they appeared upon today's business-paper. I wish to point out that it could be done.",24
152,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I take it that no reference to these Bills, save of an incidental character, will be permissible, except by leave of the House?",24

154,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Parramatta) [11.35] - * ' w s n T 0 concerning the attitude of the Government towards the question of immigration. Here again we cannot fail to remark what happens in Committee. We find that, whilst honourable members are tied down in their speeches to a limit of half-an-hour, the Minister is at liberty to occupy as many hours as he chooses. I am glad to see that the honourable gentleman is taking an active interest in advertising the resources of the Commonwealth in London. But I cannot speak too strongly about the condition of affairs which' was revealed by the honourable member for Echuca last night. Government money is being used for the purpose of circulating statements which are a disgrace to the people making them, traducing the public men of this Commonwealth, and broadcasting libellous statements over the length and breadth of the world. This is a new departure in connection with the government of Australia. I have never before known a Government to descend to party tactics of that sort. It has been left to the present Ministry to use public funds for the purpose of circulating, throughout other parts of the world, statements of a purely personal and , derogatory character concerning the public men of Australia. I think that the honourable member for Echuca, who dug out these .facts and published them in Hansard, rendered the community a service by showing the way in which the Government are misusing public funds. It is beyond a joke when we pay money to send such statements across the seas under the specious plea of advertising Australian resources. The statement concerning the Leader of the Opposition will for ever stand as a disgrace to the present Government. We may leave the poet MCDougall, "" in his fine frenzy rolling,"" severely alone. The matter for which he is responsible is impersonal, even if it is silly and untrue. But when it comes to circulating, across the seas, personal attacks on political opponents at the an public expense, it is time to draw the line. Moreover, there is this aspect of the matter : that this thing has been going on out of sight-underground , so to speak. It is only now that we hear of it- a long while after it has taken place. I submit that there ought to be a little more publicity given to the doings of the Department of External Affairs :han is given to them. When these things have been done, we ought make a few remarks to be taken into the confidence of the Government. That is to say, information which has been paid for by public money has as much right to be laid on the table of the House as have documents concerning other public transactions which our statutes require shall be duly tabled. But this kind of thing goes on, and we know nothing of it until it comes to light accidentally. I protest against the precedent which has been established by the Government of spending the taxpayers' money to circulate, overseas, where little is known of what is going on here, scurrilous, personal attacks on political opponents. l t is a pleasure to turn from this kind ofthing to some other publications which the Minister of External Affairs is circulating in other countries ' for the purpose of attracting immigrants to our shores. Nothing can be more urgent, imperative, and serious in its import to the future of Australia than the peopling of this continent. Every public writer, every judge of political affairs, every traveller, observes this anomaly, that we have an immense territory with only a sparse population crowded on the coast-line, immense vacant areas lying behind, and the vulnerable points undefended and without defenders. But I see no prospect of anything being done to alter this state of affairs. This Government has had control of the Northern Territory for two years, but has done nothing to induce population to go there, or to prepare the way for settlement. The place has been filled with highly-paid officials. That is the only result of its expenditure up to date. It is time that a statement was made by the Minister of External Affairs as to the steps to be taken to increase the population of the Territory, and to develop its resources. There are all sorts of anomalies in connection with the appointments which have been made to the Commonwealth Public Service there. The man who is doing important work, and possesses the necessary training and qualifications, gets a lower salary than the man who happens to be a particular friend of Ministers. That is the rule of the appointments there.",25
155,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,What about Professor Gilruth and Mr Bevan?,26
156,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Contras t Mr. Francis and Mr Ryland, who are getting £650 and £800 respectively. I like my honourable friend's mock indignation when any one presumes to criticise his actions. All that is needed to secure immigration is the placing of funds at the disposal of our officers, but the Minister has told us plainly that he has turned down the recommendations of our responsible representative overseas. He will not find the money for an efficient and adequate scheme for peopling Australia, though it passes my comprehension why he should not do this. Ministers say that they are in favour of immigration, and are publishing broadcast in the Old Land statements to the effect that millions of acres of land are to be obtained in Australia for next to nothing, yet they will not move a hand to bring population here. The States have taken action on their own account, and it is a thousand pities that the Commonwealth is not heading and leading the scheme.  trol land settlement.",26
157,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"When the States asked us a little while ago to find money to bring population to Australia, they undertook to look after the immigrants on arrival, and to provide land for them.  not. The Prime Minister asked that he should be allowed a voice in the selection, and that was refused.",26
158,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It was suggested that the Commonwealth should provide £150,000 a year for the payment of passage money. That is all we can do, apart from the States, because the control of the lands is in the hands of the States.",26
159,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The immigrants who come here are not settling on the land; they are crowding into the cities.,26
160,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Are they? This Government put this . statement into the Governor General's Speech delivered at the opening of the present sessionAlthough there has been a very marked increase in the volume of over-sea immigration, to which the Land Tax and general policy of my Advisers has largely contributed, we are unable to regard the rate of natural increase of population in the Commonwealth with other than the deepest concern. Yet the Minister of External Affairs has turned down the practical proposal of the High Commissioner and the practical proposal of the Governments of the States. He is telling people at the other end of the world that we have land on which they can settle, but that is all that he will do.",26
161,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,A fair thing.,26
162,Mr ANSTEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I wish that the honourable member would not shout so much.,26
163,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I can appreciate the attitude of the honourable member for Bourke. He does not believe in immigration. But while he is saying that these hypocritical Ministers here are spending the public money in telling people in the Old Country that they ought to come here where there is an abundance of land available, while the Caucus says, on the other hand, that people are crowding into the cities, and must not be allowed to come here.",26
164,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That is what the Government of Victoria are doing.,26
165,Mr BRENNAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"We are trying to drawsettlers to the Northern Territory, and? these people are crowding them into the cities",26
166,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,How hard are my honourable friends trying to get immigrants to the Northern Territory? They have been in charge of that country for two and a half years.,26
167,Mr BRENNAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We are offering therm good land for nothing.,26
168,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Why say two and a half years? The honourable member might as well stick to the facts.,26
169,Mr FRANK FOSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,In January next it will be two years.,26
170,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Then I air* wrong to that extent. We have had two sets of Estimates for the Northern Territory, and this is, I think, the third set. It seems to me that we shall have a few more sets if the present Government remain in office, before any people go to the Northern' Territory, as immigrants. In the meantime I shall call attention to some statements which the Minister of External Affairs is circulating in the Old Country. It furnishes a fine commentary on the statements made by the poet MCDougall andothers on the platform when they are out on the propaganda. Here is what they say officiallyThere is no land famine in Western Australia. People do not go to the West to seek l and ; they go to get it. And they remain. Think of it ! Western Australia is 624,588,800 acres, of which the total area alienated or in process of alienation is only 20,000,000. In the agricultural division of the State there are 70,000,000 acres, with a rainfall of from 10 to 50 inches. Forty million acres are adapted for wheat and sheep, and 20,000,000 acres for dairying, fruit-growing, and intense culture. This is. the point : The land is good and cheap; there's plenty of it left, and the rainfall is regular. The article is headed, "" A Gargantuan Repast for the Land Hungry.""",26
171,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,In what newspaper does It appear?,27
172,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"In Australia To-Day, which, I understand, the Minister sends Home.",27
173,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Hav e you any objection ?,27
174,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"No , and I gratulate the Minister upon spending money in that way.",27

178,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do not know. I am not concerned as to who wrote the article. But the honourable gentleman ought, to know the name of the writer, since he subsidizes the newspaper. He ought have known, too, who made the slanderous references to the Leader of the Opposition, which he sent across the seas with public money..",27
179,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That I sent across the seas?,27
180,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Of course. . It is the Minister's Department that I am speaking of. Is he responsible for ministration ?,27
181,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Was it sent before I to the Department, or since then ?",27
182,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I think it must or £200. have been sent before the honourable member went there.,27
183,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Oh ! you think so.,27
184,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,What of that?,27
185,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It is the same vernment.,27
186,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yes . The quotralia, tation continues The vacant fertile spaces must be settled. most liberal land conditions in the world that; a steady and profitable local market for tion. agricultural produce invites to the task; and the State's geographical advantages and adjacency to the markets of Europe, South Africa, and the printed ? Orient enhance the opportunity. Money is no object. If the settler is not a - capitalist, the Agricultural Bank will oblige loans of from £25 to £2,000. He can purchase freehold land on twenty years' terms, or take a ninety-nine years' lease. No trouble about getting there. The hand of welcome to the eligible settler is outstretched across the seas. There is a standing invitation to capital, energy, and courage, and there is an assisted passage to the approved immigrant. He or she can get from London to Fremantle for as low as £ 6 , and then by the nomination system, friends and relatives can be invited to follow almost equally as cheaply. The proposition in a nutshell Nature provides the material-soil , sunshine, and rain; the State provides' the means-railways , roads, money, expert advice, free education, storage and export facilities, religious, political, and social freedom; the settler provides the motive powerenergy, enterprise, and hope-and he reaps the benefits. But if he has not those three qualities, there are no benefits.",27

188,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yes . There are other publications of a similar .character which deserve to be read. Here is one, instance. Let me put these things side lie by side as they ought to be put.. The poet MCDougall saysWorker, waif, and landless brother, One of earth's unhappy tribe. That goes across the seas, and the trouble is that the article I am about to quote does to not go with it, because, if it did, it would furnish the antidote.

211,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,What did the honourable member say?,28
212,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,If the Minister keeps his ears open he would hear what I say.,28
213,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,What did the honourable member say?,28
214,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I said that the Minister was responsible for the circulation of this newspaper overseas at public expense.,28
215,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It would be very easy to stop the circulation of it.,28
216,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I do not desire that the circulation should be stopped.,28
217,Mr MATHEWS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It ought to be stopped; it is a waste of money, and leads people astray. The vote ought to be reduced considerably.",28
218,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"In the same publication there are several articles relating to what is called share farming; and people are invited by the Minister to come out and engage in it. We are told in the newspaper that share farming is "" a magnificent stepping stone""-that to the farm labourer it opens a way, and "" perhaps the only way "" for him to become something more than a farm labourer, and "" to be put well on the road of himself becoming a landlord."" I quite agree with those statements, but I am not sure that the Minister, holding - the opinions that he does, is quite the person to invite people to come here in order to become landlords when they have gone through a preliminary process of share farming. There are two or three articles on this subject, and it is quite evident that the Government are entirely in favour of the principle of share farming. Then I observe that there has been issued another edition, I take it, of a book that was published about two years ago by a previous Minister of External Affairs, the late Mr Batchelor. The book may have been revised, though, so far as I can see, it has not been altered in any way; and the first point to observe is that here again people are invited to come to Australia and enter into share dairy farming",28
219,Mr MATHEWS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It is a delusion, and a snare!",29
220,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Shar e wheat farming is also spoken of, and forms the basis of another article j indeed, there are quite a number of articles of the same kind in the book. The question I am concerned about is whether this is a landless country, so far as the settler or the poor man is concerned. We all know how fierce the propaganda of honourable members opposite was when they described the people of this country as being in the 'grip of the land monopolists-as not being able to get land on which to settle on easy terms. That is what they said on the platform, but the book represents what they circulate in the Old Country when in office. The author commences with New South Wales, and the lands there being opened up for settlement. He tells us that on the tablelands, which occupy nearly 26,000,000 acres in the eastern division, over 5,000,000 acres still remain in the possession of the Crown.",29
221,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION," The honourable member's time has expired.  like to know what has been done in the direction of an arrangement with the South Australian Government as to the charge for the handling of material at Port Augusta wharf. Negotiations in this connection have been going on for some time in reference to the handling of material for the transcontinental railway, and I understand that while 9d. per ton is charged to the general public for the shunting of wheat, and so forth, the Commonwealth are being asked to pay is. 9d. per ton. Then, as to the use of South Australian trucks by the Commonwealth Government, which may be necessary in view of the difficulty as to the gauge, what arrangement has been made as to the charges? The Victorian Government, in the case of 10-ton to 15-ton trucks, which they may have occasion to use, pay the South Australian Government [197] 3s. per day, but the Railways Commissioners of South Australia are asking the Commonwealth Government to pay no less than 12s. a day for 5-ton to 8-ton trucks. Information would also be welcomed as to the outcome of the interview with Mr. Francis, the officer who represents the South Australian Railways Commissioners in the Northern Territory; Has it been decided to resume control of the Port Augusta to Oodnadatta railway ? The latest information I have from the press is that no agreement can be arrived at with the South Australian Government; and this means, as the only alternative, that the Commonwealth Government will have to give twelve months' notice of their intention to resume.",29
222,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"We intend to give the necessary notice, but that cannot be done until the ist January.  get over the difficulty. In the meantime, however, the high charges will continue at the Port Augusta wharf; and, under all the circumstances, it occurs to me that there ought to be some policy declared in connection with our railway management. The Government have entered on a railway policy, and have constituted a Department called the Construction Branch. At present we have a sort of divided control. For instance, the survey of the through line to Western Australia was undertaken by the Department, under the control of Mr Deane. At the same time, the proposed surveys for railway construction in the Northern Territory will be under a different Department altogether. Surely that is not an economic method of carrying out public works. The time has arrived when we ought to have a Commonwealth Railway Department, which should be in a position to carry out such undertakings. Js it, for instance, intended that all the plans and drawings for the Northern Territory surveys should be carried out in Melbourne? If so, the system of divided control will not only lead to expense, but also to confusion and discontent. The old saying about "" too many cooks "" will be in evidence. Some time ago I made the suggestion that, as the Commonwealth requires a number of horses for military purposes, we should establish a horse-breeding establishment in the Northern Territory. An arrangement might be made between the Department of Defence, the Post and Telegraph Department, and the Department of External Affairs for regulating a horsebreeding establishment there. Horses are required, not only for Defence purposes, but also by the Post and Telegraph Department in the different States. This would be a very useful way of utilizing a large portion of the Territory, because, whatever may be said against it in some respects, there is general agreement that in the vicinity of the Macdonnell Ranges we have some of the finest horse-breeding country in Australia. The horses sent from there top the market, and a large number of Indian buyers eagerly purchase them. I venture to say that we should do more good in the matter of developing the Northern Territory by adopting that suggestion than by publishing bushels of advertisements in the United Kingdom. The Northern Territory is not going to be developed by immigrants. It will be developed by the sons of pioneers from other parts of Australia. In parts of the country, where subdivision is going on, and there is a tendency to limited sheep-breeding, young men with. Australian experience will be forced into the northern areas, where there is ample scope and the prospects are good. I have all along urged that one of the most important factors in developing the Northern Territory will be a good railway policy. We may spend £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 a year, or even jQi00,000, in advertising, but we shall do very little in the matter of development without railway construction. There is room for many railways in the Territory, and when they are constructed people will go there. Development will follow.",29
223,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"How is it that the part of the Territory already supplied with railways is not developed?  ber is thinking of the tropical portion of the Territory. I hold the opinion that we are making a mistake in trying to develop the Northern Territory from the tropical end.  Oodnadatta ?  Australia, and does not go within nearly 200 miles of the Northern Territory. I am not questioning the quality of the land at tropical end of the Territory, but tropical production is a problem that we have not yet solved. Development there must necessarily be slower than where the climatic conditions approximate to those to which settlers have been accustomed in other States.",30
224,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Does the honourable member contemplate closer settlement and cultivation in the interior of the Northern Territory ?  if the honourable member means by closer settlement small areas and intense culture, I do not contemplate that anything of the kind will happen in the Northern Territory at present. But there is certainly room for the cultivation of cereals and for mixed farming, sheep and cereals, in the MACDonnell ranges and beyond.",30
225,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,What is the rainfall?  14 to 25 inches.,30
226,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The statistics do not show that.  talk of a survey. I hold in my hand a report with plans of surveys of a number of routes, marked A , B, C, D , and E, in the Northern Territory, north of Oodnadatta. ' The work was done by one of the most capable officers we have in South Australia, Mr Graham Stewart, who gives fuller details than we have had in connection with the survey of the route of the Western Australian railway. I propose to place before the Committee a few details as to the character of the country, and the number of points at which a permanent water supply is available. In the first 70 miles of the route of the flying survey the country traversed is similar to that from Hergott Springs to Oodnadatta. Thereafter unt i l Laura Creek- a distance of 284 miles - is reached, the country is well grassed to a large extent, and is capable of carrying both large and small stock, whilst it is also suitable for the growth of cereals if railway communication be established. Mr. Graham Stewart's map shows that at a distance of 23 miles from the starting point of the proposed line a two vears' water supply is available; at the 26-mile point there is a supply sufficient to last some months: at 42 miles & permanent water hole; at 59 miles a soakage giving a considerable volume of water: at 82 miles waterholes containing a supply sufficient to the last twelve months ; at 88 miles permanent water; and at 95 miles a six months' supply in Blood's Creek. At the 106 miles point Mr Stewart found a nine months' supply; whileat the Goyder River, 143 miles from the starting point, there is a twelve months' supply. At 148 miles good water can be obtained in the bed of 'the Finke River, while at the 179 miles point there are wells on the banks of river. The Alice Well is to be found the 202 miles point, and the Oraminna Rock waterhole, 265 miles out, provides constant supply. Passing through the Heavetree Gap over the Macdonnell Ranges we find the Todd River with good supplies in some of the larger waterholes. It be explained that these watercourses ing certain periods of the year are .flooded, and that immense quantities of water down them. During the summer months some of the waterholes dry up, while others there remains a supply sufficient last from six to twelve months. beds of ""these streams good water obtained in almost every case. I cite these facts in order to show the Committee facility with which water can be obtained along the route as compared with the of the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway. At a distance of 295 miles from the startthere, ing point the Duck Ponds and Allan's Waterhole are tq be found, and 327 miles out Burt Creek is encountered, vides a good supply. There would be no difficulty in obtaining supplies of water for large bodies of men along the whole route nearly of this survey, and with the exception of sleepers everything required for the line can be obtained at convenient distances along the route. Such a railway would - rich tap some of the best country in the Macabundance donnell Ranges. Mr Allan Davidson, who was prospecting in the central region, has furnished some interesting particulars. few On the Macdonnell Ranges route three belts of auriferous country are passed through, and from a mining stand-point had there are great possibilities of development. which Mr Davidson, who spent three years in the central regions, reported that there were purposes. vast fields where prospect trials had yielded from 15 dwts. to 2 ozs. per On the Wide Range, which is some 7 miles long, 3 miles wide, and about half-a-mile high, there are at work today a number small mining parties. We are sometimes asked why there has not been a more genebe ral development bf these mining fields. One reason is that it is impossible for a to get an ounce of dynamite carried up there at any price. Camel teams provide the only service, and the Afghans will carry explosives. On the top of this range a number of parties are workwould ing not high-grade stone, but stone yielding, say, an ounce to the ton. course [197]- 2 They are to be seen breaking .it out with' that hammer and gad, and this stone is carried at by the lubras to the foot of the range, where it is sent on to Arltunga. People a ask why this country has not developed; but is it possible for it to be developed until the proper arid necessary plant ""and material can be obtained? There is some may excellent land along the route. Along the durCoglan Creek there is rich pastoral land; while along the Finke River, which has a pass wide sandy bed, gum. trees grow luxuriantly, and a number of sleepers could be in obtained there. For thirty miles, to the to Goyder River, patches of exceptionally In the good grass land are to be found. Mr. can be H. B. Corbin, B.Sc, who was at Arltunga, has given a description of the charthe acter of the country to be found up there. He states that it is fine pasture land, and route should be suitable for the growth of cereals. The soil is there, the climate is and the annual rainfall rapidly increases from 11 inches at Alice Springs up to 25 inches per annum'. I have here a and proreport showing thatFrom the Macdonnell Ranges the' route leads over easy country for railway construction, level, with no great watercourses to cross. . . . The country passed over for the 170 miles from Alice Springs is all fitted for pastoral purposes, with some Tolling downs of soil, magnificently grassed, and fit for the growth of wheat. For the most part water in is to be had at shallow depths. At the foot of Gentra'l Mount Stewart flows the Hanson .'Creek, where permanent water exists a inches under the sand, and by using plough and scoop in the bed of the creek large reservoirs can be scooped out, yielding unlimited supplies of water. Abundance of water can be at very shallow depths in the Stirling Creek, flows through a very rich country, producing grasses and .herbage in profusion, exceptionally good for agricultural and pastoral ton. He speaks in the same way of a number of other places, but I shall not detain the - Committee by making further quotations. of' I wish to say that I have such confidence in that country that I believe there would no difficulty in obtaining men to carry out railway construction there, and to settle miner the country. If the railway were constructed I believe that the chief difficulty would be to keep the Lands Department not abreast of the demand for land. .I am satisfied that the construction of the line lead to the settlement of a very large number of people. Until we adopt this our liabilities in connection with the Territory, which now amount to mearly £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 a year, must of necessity increase. This question must be faced matter what Government is in power. Unless we adopt a progressive development policy we shall have done no good by takof ing, over the Northern Territory. In the districts to which I have referred, extendand ing from the Macdonnell Ranges to the Barklay Tableland, and close to the border of Queensland, there is abundance of good land which may be occupied under conexpected ditions with which people now seeking for land are familiar, because the region is temperate, and possesses as good a mate as one could wish to live in. ' The adoption of the policy I suggest would be the best means to assist the development of the more tropical regions of the Northern Territory. No matter what GoExternal vernment may be in power during the next Parliament one of the first propositions submitted in this House should be the struction of a railway through the country to which I have referred. I venture to say that we would never have reason to regret the construction of such a line, and that, as the railway proceeds, population will be attracted to the Territory. In my opinion, unless this course is followed development of any importance can be exvious twelve months. pected in the Northern Territory.",30
227,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Wakefield) [ - 3 4 ] - - I wish to offer a few observations I 2 as to the manner in which we should deal with the Northern Territory. In the first place, I wish fo say that I am extremely disappointed that the Minister of External Affairs did not let us know what the policy of the Government is in regard to its velopment.",32
228,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,He has what is better than a policy. He has behind him the block vote of honourable members opsay posite.,32
229,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I was particularly disappointed last night to find so many honourable members opposite parently approving of the Minister's sion .to supply the House with information as to the policy of the Government in connection with the Territory. quite contrary to what the House, and the people have been led to expect, and to what I know the people in South Australia in particular do expect. They have been looking for the announcement of a deing velopment policy of a comprehensive character by the Federal Minister in whose charge the Northern Territory is.",32
230,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Naturally , in view of all no they did in the last forty years.",32
231,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"They have been led to expect this, especially in view the statements made more than once by the present Minister of External Affairs, endorsed just now by interjection, that during fifty years of their control of the Northern Territory the people of South Australia did nothing with the country. I that in the circumstances the Minister would have taken advantage of the opportunity to show that he possesses some cliof the qualifications of a statesman. No position under tKe Federal Government today offers greater opportunities for the demonstration of statesmanship of the highest order than does that of the Minister of Affairs. When the Territory was under the control of South Australia it was so far separated from the Seat of Goconvernment, and members of the State Parliament bad so few opportunities to get a grip of matters pertaining to the settlement of the country, that the Minister controlling its affairs in submitting the estimates for the Territory each year always made a statement reviewing everything that had no been done in the Territory during the pre",32
232,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That would not take long.,32
233,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It rarely took less than an hour and a half, and let me say that it would tax the genius of the present Minister of External Affairs to submit, in an hour and a half, the comprehensive statement which we ought to have of dewhat the Government are doing, and propose to do, in the Northern Territory.",32
234,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I thought the honourable member said that it took a Minister in the South Australian Parliament that time to what the Government had done, and not what they proposed to do.",32
235,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable gentleman has not devoted even five apminutes to telling this House what the omisFederal Government propose to do. The South Australian Minister controlling the affairs of the Northern Territory, in subThis is mitting the Estimates for the Territory each year, gave the members of the South Australian Parliament the minutest details as to every item of expenditure, and also a statement of what he proposed to do durthe ensuing twelve months in connection with public expenditure and to encourage the establishment of new enterprises in the Territory.",32
236,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Did he do that every year for forty years?,33
237,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That was <3one every year without exception. The Territory has now been under the control of the Commonwealth for two years, and, in view of our larger powers, great facilities, and resources, the Government should - give the people some idea as to what is their policy for the settlement and development of the Territory. The expenditure upon - it is growing, and is now more than £250,000 annually. We have an army of officers there, who have been recently appointed.",33
238,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"What does the honourable member mean by saying that the expenditure is now £250,000?",33
239,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I am speaking of the entire vote required for the Territory.,33
240,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Does not that cover the payment of interest on Northern Territory loans ?,33
241,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am aware that it does. It would be to the credit of the Minister of External Affairs if he made a statement for the information of the people as to how much of the vote represents interest on the debts of the Territory existing when it was transferred to the Commonwealth, and how much represents liabilities due to new enterprises initiated by the Federal Government subsequent to the transfer of the Territory. I do not intend to say very much about the appointments which have been made in the Territory. I have previously spoken very strongly upon them. But if the Minister and the Government had set to work with a determination to get in the men whom they have appointed to the principal positions there with as little real practical ence and local knowledge as possible, they could not have exceeded better than they have done. What I say is indisputable.",33
242,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Has the honourable member ever been to Port Darwin?,33
243,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I have not, but I know people who. are resident there. I get letters from them, and I know exactly what they think of the way in which the Minister is handling the affairs of Port Darwin and of the Northern Territory generally. The general consensus of opinion there is that the Government have studiously avoided availing themselves of the services of men of experience.",33
244,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Tell me their names.,33
245,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That is the opinion of nearly everybody in the Territory. If the Minister wishes me to enter into details, I can do so in respect of every man who has been appointed. The Minister has not made more than three good appointments so far as real experience is concerned. ' Mr THOMAS - Giv e me the names of the men in the Territory whom I could have appointed.",33
246,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am not going to supply the names of individuals in a small community like the Northern Territory, for very obvious reasons.

252,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Will the honourable member send me along the names of the men experiat Port Darwin who can help me?,33
253,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I will do nothing of the kind. I will condemn the Minister on his own actions, and on the evidence which has been laid on the table of the Library. In the Minister's own party, outside the chamber, this matter is discussed with a good deal of disgust and condemnation. If that is the principle on which the Public Service of the Northern Territory is going to be built up we shall have a Service of which we shall not be proud- a Service which will cost this country an enormous amount",33

257,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Mr Jensen was a State officer.,34
258,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The Mintheir ister should have consulted the Queensland and South Australian Governments in ticular, and have asked them if they could not exhibit a little self-sacrifice by giving .the Commonwealth one of the best menthe available in their Departments.

259,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It is a pity that the honourable member did not do that when he was a Minister in the South Government.,34
260,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It seems to me that in all these appointments the aim of the Minister has been to secure who know as little as possible about the Territory, and about the work to which they haye been appointed. We have men controlling affairs there who are dependent upon their subordinates to learn the first principles of the business which they to take in hand.",34

We should be informed from time to time of what happens in the TerIn considering the estimates of expenditure for the current year, we should before us information regarding everyas thing that has been, done by the Government in the Territory since it took it over,, and should be told what are the proposals the future. I gather from the press that the Administrator and Director of of Lands have been away in the country foT some weeks, and have recently returned to Palmerston, and I imagine that the Minister has received a progress report giving impressions of what they have seen.. That should be submitted to the Commitpartee. The wet season has now set in at Palmerston, and for several months travel and inspection in the tropical regions of Territory will be impossible. I hope,, however, that these officers will not be allowed to remain idle at Palmerston, but they will be transferred to the southern, regions of the Territory, where the rainy season will not prevent travelling, so that we may get' their opinion regarding the character of the country round about the Australian Macdonnell Ranges.",34
267,Mr FOWLER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The inspection of that country is badly needed.,34
268,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yes . In men beginning with the development of the Northern Territory within the tropics, the Government tackled a problem which needs the fullest experience and the best judgment for successful handling. Ministershave begun their work in the most difficult have manner, and cannot hope for results for many a day to come. Had they begun at the southern end, the work would be But experiments in tropical agriculture cannot demonstrate the commercial success of undertakings ir» It will take many years,, i and require much expense, to determine certain ventures will be profitable in the Northern Territory. At the pretime the Government is applying too much Socialism in these experiments.

275,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"South Australia did not do a great deal in the re- way of development, but if the Minister does no more than he promises: to do now, of he will do much less than the State did, with the exception of spending infinitely more money. In dealing with the Territory, we have to take into consideration pastoral, agricultural, and tropical production, and mining development; and in regard to those the officers have yet all their experience to gain. I believe that it is the intention of the Government to appoint an outside Royal Commission of three experts or more, to advise as to the course the proposed railway shall take, and I suggest that the Government should go further, and appoint a Royal Commission on a much broader basis to advise, not only as to railways, but as to pastoral and agricultural occupation, tropical production, and mining, in regard to which a great deal of data is already in existence. As to mining, there is a report prepared by the Reverend Tennison Woods, an eminent geologist, in 1886. That gentleman had a great idea of the Territory from a mineral point of view, and his report would be of great use. Then, again, the South Australian Government had in their service one of the most reliable geologists in the person of Mr H . Y. L . Brown; but, unfortunately, that gentleman, being a man of independent means, has retired at a comparatively early time in life. However, I am sure that the advice and services of Mr Brown would be made available.. As to the pastoral, agricultural, and tropical production, much assistancecould be got from a Royal Commission consisting of Mr Brown, the Surveyor-General, or the next most efficient officer, and another expert on tropical production. A Royal Commission of this kind could make a personal inspection of certain parts of the country, and any recommendations they might offer would be of infinite service, not only to the Government, but to the Government's representatives in the Territory. At present the Government and Parliament know practically nothing about this enormous new country.",35

The only advantage I have is the knowledge I have gained through the Parliament of South Australia, and that is only an index to the larger knowledge possessed by the State Government. Of that knowledge the Minister of External Affairs ought to avail himself. Then, again, we ought to have further information about the experimental work at the demonstration farm. We do not know whether we are proceeding on proper lines, and, as regards tropical agriculture, it require two or three years to prove certain possibilities. If we are proceeding on the wrong lines, of course the demonstration will be valueless. There has already been a labour trouble in the Territory, and, without discussing the question of day labour versus contract labour, I suggest that the Minister, in this new country, should, as far as possible, adopt the contract principle, and that, in manual labour, piece-work should be adopted, so that a man may be enabled to make even £ 2 a day so long' as he gives value for the money.",36
278,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Wimmera) [2.39] We are entitled to know, after two years of government of the Northern Territory",36
279,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,On e year and months.,36
280,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It is not worth splitting straws over. We are entitled to have from the Government an outline of their general scheme of development, showing how far the expenditure and administration are to be accompanied by efforts to attract people to the Territory. I notice from the Estimates that something like £80,000 is set down for administrative expenses, but, so far as I can see, only £[20,000 or £[30,000 is to be expended on what may be termed real developmental work. If we flood the country with public servants, without a proper scheme of production being laid down, we shall simply increase the deficit which the Territory in the past has cast upon the shoulders of the people annually. An Ordinance has been laid on the table which is supposed to contain a land settlement scheme. This House will have to accept or reject the whole of that Ordinance, because it is not possible for us to take it clause by clause and shape it in the way we think best for the Territory. In this Ordinance it is proposed to deal with more land than has been dealt with, I suppose, by any single Act of Parliament passed in Australia hitherto. In the Northern Territory there is an enormous area of 520,000 square miles, and it is proposed to deal with that area in an Ordinance which has the force of an Act, but with which this House is not permitted to deal in detail.",36
281,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I do not think the honourable member ought to discuss the Ordinance now.,36
282,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I take it that, up to will the present, the Ordinance is merely a paper laid on the table, and that it is not open to discussion until a motion is submitted that it be disallowed.",36
283,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member knows that he will have another opportunity to discuss the Ordinance.,36
284,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,But no motion to disallow the Ordinance has yet been tabled.,36
285,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That shows the House is satisfied with it.,36
286,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member must not discuss the Ordinance in detail.,36
287,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Unti l a motion to disagree with the Ordinance is submitted, the Ordinance simply lies on the table as a parliamentary paper.  not discuss it ad. lib. all the time. ten Mr SAMPSON - Why not?",36
288,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Any member has the right to disagree with the Ordinance if he wishes.,36
289,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,There is as yet no motion to disagree with the Ordinance.,36
290,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member can submit a motion if he wishes.,36
291,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The original notice of motion in connection with the previous Ordinance has been discharged from the notice-paper, thus leaving the whole question an open one until a definite motion is tabled in regard to the new Ordinance, which will then becoma part of the business for discussion as a separate question.",36
292,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I am not going to allow a general discussion on the Ordinance. If honourable members would not have another opportunity of discussing it there might be something to be said for the attitude of the honourable member. With' the exception of a general reference I shall allow no discussion of the Ordinance.,36
293,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I submit that we have a right to be heard fully on the Ordinance. The Northern Territory, under existing law, is administered in the same way as a Crown colony under the Imperial Government; and its legislation and its administration are Executive acts. The Northern Territory Administration Act provides that until the Parliament makes other provisions for the government of the Territory, the Governor General in Council may make Ordinances that shall have the force of law. It is true that we have power to set aside any Ordinance by resolution of the House, but such a resolution may or may not be moved. Meantime, an Ordinance of this kind is an ordinary administrative act of the Government. . I understand that the honourable member does not desire to deal in detail with it, but I .shall claim the right to do so. The Government might tomorrow, or when Parliament is not sitting, alter the Ordinance or take any other administrative action. That being so, if your ruling is to be upheld, how are we to discuss a matter of this kind? This Ordinance stands in exactly, the same position as does any departmental regulation made by any Minister, and it would be going a very long way indeed to - say that the Committee is not on these Estimates to have the opportunity to discuss it, in detail or not in detail, in common with any other administrative act on the part of the Ministry. The right to discuss the administrative acts of the Minister does not rest on the ground that there may be no other opportunity to discuss them.. As I understand it, the right to discuss all matters of administration rests upon the fact that the House, adopting the traditions of the House of Commons, has always - claimed the right to criticise every Government act when asked to vote moneys. If honourable members opposite allow this opportunity to slip away the result will affect them as much as it will affect us. Under the Northern Territory Administration Act the right of the Governor General in Council to make Ordinances regulating the conduct of matters in the Northern Territory - stands exactly on the same footing as does - the right of the Minister to make any departmental regulation, and you, sir, would be making a deep cut into what has always been recognised as the privilege of the House in dealing with the Estimates to say that we are not to discuss this Ordinance, - because there may be another opportunity .to deal with it.",37
294,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I think that the honourable member is forgetting that the motion on the notice-paper relating to the Ordinance in question was discharged last night, and that there is now no reference on the notice-paper to any Ordinance. I think that the honourable member will admit that there can be no discussion of an Ordinance which is not in existence. The honourable member may discuss the land policy of the Government in relation to the Northern Territory, but he cannot discuss any particular Ordinance.",37
295,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The Ordinance, I understand, was framed the other day, was laid on the table of the House, has been published in the Government Gazette, and is at present inforce in the Territory. The mere fact that there is no reference to it on the notice-paper does not deprive us of the right to deal with it just as we may deal with any other administrative act to which there is no reference on the notice-paper.",37
296,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member has only to let the Ordinance alone and discuss the facts in relation to the land policy.,37
297,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,No ; I claim the right to discuss the Ordinance as an administrative act.,37
298,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I submit that anything that has to do with the determination of a land policy for the Northern Territory is open for discussion on these Estimates. The Minister of External Affairs is really the Minister of Lands for the Northern Territory, and therefore all acts of administration in regard to the lands of the Northern Territory are open to review at this stage. When we discussed the Land Ordinance on a previous occasion the point was raised that the land policy of the Territory should be dealt with, not by an Ordinance, but by means of an ordinary Land Bill. Surely these matters of policy are open to discussion. If not, we may not discuss the lands administration of the Territory. We have on these Estimates items in respect of surveyors, the salary of the Administrator of Lands in the Northern Territory, and proposals for investigating the country. All these are parallel to the issue of an Ordinance determining the terms of land settlement. I submit that every detail of administration, whether by Ordinance, Bill, or Executive act, may be discussed.",37
299,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"This is the only opportunity we shall have to discuss the land policy for the Northern Territory. You, Mr Chairman, have said that any honors able member may take action by notice of motion, but the Government have deprived honourable members of the only opportunity they had to bring forward a motion, and to have it dealt with. That being so, if you adhere to your ruling, the only way in which we could secure the discussion of the Ordinance would be by moving what* would be practically a motion of censure. There is now no other opportunity to discuss the Ordinance except as an act of generosity on the part of the Government.",37
300,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Exactly . pends on the indulgence of the Government.,38
301,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Quite so. We ought not to have to ask the indulgence of the Government to discuss what is undoubtedly one of the most important subjects with which the Parliament has to deal-the administration of the lands of the Northern Territory. When the Minister is asking for Supply to enable him to carry out the government of the Territory, which is directly under his charge, it is opposed to all British precedent that the Committee should be deprived of the opportunity to discuss any subject covered by the Estimates. The discussion of a land policy for the Northern Territory and all administrative acts relating thereto is a matter of right rather than a privilege, and I hope that there will toe no restriction of debates on these Estimates.",38
302,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"On the point of order, Mr Chairman, I think that upon further consideration you will recognise that if the Committee abandoned its right to discuss this question at the present time, it might not have a further opportunity to deal with it. The Ordinance itself is merely a parliamentary paper, but it takes the form of a regulation having the force of law unless it be disagreed with. It would be competent for the Government to say that we should not discuss it, and it would - then have the force of law, since the consideration of a motion to disallow it must be subordinated to the consideration. of Government business. We have had no intimation from the Government that the Ordinance will be submitted for consideration. I submit that we have the right to discuss such a question as it arises, and that if you deny us the right* to deal with the whole question on these Estimates you will take from us one of the greatest privileges that we enjoy. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - It seems to» me that it is inescapable that we have the right in connection with the Estimates now-before us to discuss this Ordinance as an. administrative act. The very fact that it. does not appear on the notice-paper constitutes a reason why it sho'uld now be open/ for discussion. The only way in which it can be placed on the notice-paper is for an honourable member to give notice of"" motion that it be disallowed. If notice of such a motion had been given that fact might be taken to preclude our right to> It de- discuss the whole question at this stage. No such notice of motion, however, has been given. The Ordinance has been? gazetted, and it is just as much an administrative act as would be the issue of aregulation. The question at issue is one as to the right of honourable members toventilate grievances on the Estimates. In? 'view of the arguments which have been advanced, I trust that you, sir, will not adhere to your ruling, that we are not at - liberty to discuss the question of the issue of a Land Ordinance for the Northerr* Territory at the present time.",38
303,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"When I intervened* while the honourable member for Wimmera was speaking I had in my mind the fact that one Land Ordinance for the NorthernTerritory had been discharged from the business-paper, and that no new Ordinance appeared upon that paper. I have since been given to understand that the newLand Ordinance has been gazetted, so that it has the force of law. In these circumstances my ruling is that the Ordinance may be discussed.",38
304,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"In referring to the Land Ordinance for the Northern Territory a few moments ago I desired to enter my protest against the Committee being treated in the way that it is being treated by the Government. It is well known that we cannot discuss the Ordinance in question clause by clause, notwithstanding that it deals with the largest area of land which has yet been dealt with by any Parliament in Australia. Of course the merits of a leasehold, as opposed to a freehold, tenure will have to be determined before we can lay down the beginning of ascheme of settlement for the Northern Territory.",38
305,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,No Government could grant a freehold tenure in the Northern 'Territory until the Northern Territory ^Administration) Act had been altered.,38
306,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I know that that Act provides that no more land shall be alienated from the Crown, My complaint is that the Government has not taken the necessary steps to repeal that portion of the Act which prevents the adoption of a freehold tenure-that they have not brought down a Land Bill which could be dealt with in the same way as every other important measure is dealt with, namely, clause by clause. Of all matters for the internal development of this continent none transcends in importance the question of land settlement in the Northern Territory. I cannot understand why the Government have so far forgotten their responsibilities as to decline of their own volition to bring forward a Bill dealing with this question, and thus afford honourable members an opportunity of discussing it in the most complete manner possible. 1 hope that before Parliament rises we shall have a chance of debating the merits of a freehold, as opposed to a leasehold, system of land tenure there. I regret that the Government have fall of 5 inches? failed to crystallize into a Bill some definite scheme for the settlement of the tralia. Northern Territory. There seems to be a conflict of opinion as to where through that country should run, and as to whether settlement should proceed from the north towards the south or vice versa. I think the Government should be able state clearly the form which their land - railway policies will take. It ought to be difficult for any practical administrathe tor to arrive at. a conclusion as to which the best way to begin the settlement that immense country. The honourable member for Grey, who has had a good deal of experience of it, believes that settlement should be pushed forward from the centre of the continent-that is, from Oodnadatta - toward s the northern words, he is of opinion that settlement should proceed from the temperate part of Australia towards the tropical zone. I agree with that view. I recognise that, the future, Central Australia may carry certain number of stock, and that it prove to be rich in mineral wealth. that means it may add to the productive capacity of the Commonwealth. But i intend to settle that portion of this 1 tinent with an agricultural population shall require to find some means of growing itself. cereals with a lower rainfall than that with which they have hitherto been grown. The rainfall map of Australia shows that the centre of the continent has a precipitation of less than 10 inches. Near the Macdonnell Ranges the rainfall may be a little heavier, but there is an enormous area extending to within 350 miles of Port Darwin which has too low a rainfall to carry anything like an agricultural population. It seems to me that it would be idle to attempt to settle that class of country first. In my judgment, the only method of procedure open to us is to begin settlement from the north and to confine it to areas of considerable rainfall, at the same time conserving water from the rivers and undertaking the construction cf developmental railways from the coast inland to the settlements established along those rivers. I believe that there is a possibility of the Northern Territory carrying an agricultural population. But if we attempt to establish settlement in country which has a semi-tropical rainfall varying from 5 to 15 inches our efforts must be doomed to failure.",39
307,Mr CHANTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Where is there a rain,39
308,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,In the centre of Aus,39
309,Mr TUDOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Are there any recording the railways stations there?,39
310,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"There are recording stations along the railway line near Oodnadatta, at which the rainfall is less than to 5 inches. There is one important method and of encouraging dense settlement in the not Northern Territory, namely, by conserving waters of the rivers and by establishing is irrigation colonies along their banks. There of are areas along the Adelaide River where it is possible to grow rice in abundance. There are also some auriferous areas, with a rainfall of some 50 or 60 inches, in which it is possible to grow cotton or jute goods. Probably we use £2,000,000 worth of jute areas. In other goods each year.",39
311,Mr TUDOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"About £1,500,000 worth.",39
312,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It ought to be possible disto produce the whole of. those jute goods in in the auriferous areas of the Northern Tera ritory, which now enjoy the biggest rainmay fall that is registered there. That fact, By however, will have to beestablished by means of experimental farms. There are f we the Victoria, Daly, Katherine, Ferguson, conand Edith Rivers, all of which are com1 we passed within 250 miles of Port Darwin Within that area there is a good rainfall. It should be possible along almost every one' of those rivers to foster closer settlement-colonies by storing their waters and establishing systems of irrigation. In order to do that, however, it would be necessary to construct lines of railway to tap these irrigation areas. That circumstance brings me back to the fundamental system of land tenure. It matters not how much we spend on the storage of water or on the construction of railways, we may take it for granted that every one of our schemes will fail if we do not give the individuals who are prepared to go upon that country and to cultivate it, security of If I had the time and opportunity, it would be possible to show that the land tenure proposed by the Government for the development of the Northern Territory had been tried and found wanting in every country in the world.",39
313,Mr HIGGS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member is now anticipating the . discussion of a motion.,40
314,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yes . I understand that the subject of land tenure will be dealt with under a separate motion. I believe that the Northern Territory is capable of great production if properly handled, and the Minister of External Affairs, I contend again, should have submitted to Parliament a scheme for its development. But 'all that we know is that the Government are spending between £70,000 and £80,000 a year, mostly on administration, and that the railway is to be extended from Pine Creek to Katherine River. This is not a matter that should be dealt with in piece-meal fashion; there should be a general scheme for the development of the Territory. Comprehensive reports should be obtained from experts regarding irrigation possibilities and railway requirements, and we should be told what it is intended to do. In addition to the expenditure on administration, between £20,000 and £25,000 is being spent on experimental work, which is the only sign of an attempt to develop the Territory.",40
315,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Would the honourable member have sent settlers to the Territory before administrative officers, or administrative officers before settlers ?",40
316,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I should have first appointed a Commission to report on railway requirements, and a second Commission of experts to report on the locking of rivers and the establishment of irrigation colonies. Then I should have appointed a Board to classify the lands of the Territory. As it is, we are no further forward' than we were twelve months ago. I hope that before the session closes at least am outline of policy will be placed before Parliament. The Minister might well have obtained an opinion regarding the irrigation prospects of the Territory from Mr Elwood Mead, the chairman of the Victorian Irrigation Commission, an engineer and expert of great repute, possessing wide experience in the United States, who has travelled over a great part of Australia. Twelve months ago we. might tenure. have had a report from that gentleman,- or some one possessing similar qualifications. It would have been possible to obtain the services of an eminent Indian engineer, for example. In India 200,000,000 of a population of 300,000,000 are supported directly or indirectly by means of irrigation schemes, which vary greatly in character, the water in somecases being derived from the rivers, and, in others, from subterranean sources. At present we have no reports from experts regarding the classification of the land with a view to showing its agricultural and pastoral possibilities, nor have we any general scheme of development before us. There are one or two other matters connected with the administration of the Department of. External Affairs with which I should like to deal, but as the time allowed to me under the standing order has nearly expired, I shall postpone my remarks upon them until another occasion.",40
317,Mr GORDON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Boothby) [3.21] - The Minister of External Affairs might well be envied for the splendid opportunities given to him to display statesmanlike qualities in the development of Central Australia and the Northern Territory. The Territory handed over to the Commonwealth by South Australia constitutes one-sixth of the area of the continent, and hardly an acre of it is under cultivation. The Minister has a free hand in its development. He can inaugurate a policy of his own, and can enter upon great national undertakings such as no other Minister has had an opportunity to direct since Federation began. The honourable gentleman has inquired several times during the debate what South Australia did with the Northern Territory during the half-century that she held it.",40
318,Mr MATHEWS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Absolutel y nothing.,40
319,Mr GORDON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I am surprised that one of the most intelligent members of the House should make an interjection of that kind.,41
320,Mr MATHEWS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I admit that South Australia kept the Northern Territory white.,41
321,Mr GORDON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I shall take the opportunity to give the honourable member and the Committee some account of the history of the Northern Territory under the rule of South Australia. It is a history with which all patriotic Australians should be familiar. In 1843, during a time of great financial stress, the Government of the then recently proclaimed province of South Australia sent Captain Sturt, one of the greatest of Australian explorers, into central Australia to ascertain what the country was like, and in the hope that he would solve the mystery concerning the existence of a great inland sea. During an expedition which"" lasted over two years Captain Sturt penetrated into the heart of the continent, and actually visited the centre of what is now the greatest silver field in the world, standing on the ridge of Broken Hill. Twenty years later my State sent out John MCDouall Stuart, Sturt's trusted colleague, who, after three attempts, not only penetrated into the heart of the continent, but succeeded in planting the Union Jack on the shores of the Indian Ocean. South Australia then accepted from the Imperial Government the responsibility of controlling the Territory recently discovered by Stuart, and sent some of its best men to Darwin to warn all comers that the Empire's flag at the Residency had to be respected. Then South Australia carried the telegraph line right across Australia, along Stuart's track, thus linking up the old world and the new with telegraphic communication. Finally, she commenced a railway, and carried it to a point 700 miles north of Adelaide, pledging the credit of her small population to find money for the undertaking, and, at the same time, building 150 miles of railway from Darwin southward. The State also established the Botanic Gardens at Darwin, and carried out numerous experiments of great value. She sent surveyors through the Territory, and thus made possible pastoral occupation, arid caused a railway survey to be made between Pine Creek and Oodnadatta. The maps, levels, and other information tabulated by that survey are now available to the Commonwealth. Further, South Australia built a lighthouse on the shores of the Northern Territory, had its coast-line charted, ' had the splendid harbour of Port Darwin buoyed, and constructed a magnificent jetty which is now the property of this Government. Notwithstanding strong pressure, the State refused to open the Territory to coloured labour, arid for over forty-four years kept it white, finally, when approached by the Commonwealth Government in the name of the people of Australia, handing over her responsibility to the Commonwealth. The honor of the Commonwealth is involved in the carrying out of the - contract undertaken when the Territory was transferred to it by South Australia. Many problems call for solution today, but none should arouse the enthusiasm and patriotism of members and of the public more than the development of central Australia and the Northern Territory. When South Australia controlled the Northern Territory, it was rightly named; but the title no longer applies, and the Government might well consider the advisableness of substituting another. The words "" Northern Territory "" suggest exclusively tropical conditions, whereas a large part of the area known as the Northern Territory is within the temperate zone. I ask the Minister whether he does not think it would be a wise departure to alter the name to, sav, '"" Territoria.""",41
322,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If the changing of the name will bring people, we will call it anything the honourable member chooses.",41
323,Mr GORDON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do not think it would have that immediate effect, but, at the same time, there is a good deal in a name. It would be easier, I suggest, to refer to that portion of Australians "" Territoria "" than as the Northern Territory; but if the Minister thinks it better, as we already have a Queensland on the eastern shores, we might call this other portion "" Kingsland "" or "" Centralia."" However, I appreciate very fully all the' difficulties under which the Minister labours; and the honourable gentleman has no reason to be restless under the criticism that is being offered. Honourable members are naturally very anxious that something should be done in the direction of obtaining fair return for the enormous expenditure which is undertaken in the hope of settlement. We have to remember that the Minister has many problems to solve in connection with this great stretch of country. We are apt to forget that, the area of the Northern Territory is two and a half times that of France, and four and a half times that of Creat Britain, while it is one-fifth larger than New South Wales and Victoria put together, and represents nearly one-sixth of the whole continent of Australia. We must not be impatient with the Minister or the Department because, in the space of a few years, they are not able to accomplish miracles in the way of peopling the country, or in carrying out works to fit it for occupation. I desire, however, to call the Minister's attention to what seems to me a very important point in connection with the management of the Territory. When we speak of the "" Northern Territory,"" our minds are apt to go at once to the Darwin and the tropical portion, whereas some of the best parts, through which I have had the privilege of travelling, are to be found in the south or temperate region, in the direction of Alice Springs in the Macdonnell Ranges. I 'supplement the suggestion of the honourable member for Wakefield that, during the wet season, when the officials are unable to carry out survey work and other acts of administration, it would be advisable for them to direct their attention more particularly to the region of which Alice Springs is the centre. Indeed, I have often thought that possibly it would have led to an earlier occupation of Central Australia if the capital of the Territory had been in the Macdonnell Ranges rather than at Darwin.",41
324,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Is that part of the country occupied in the least?,42
325,Mr GORDON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Onl y a portion of it is occupied at the present time, but it is in the temperate zone, and the climate is excellent all through the year. If the Minister cannot see his way to have a representative resident in that portion of the country, I suggest the advisableness of the Administrator and some of his officers taking up their quarters there during three or four months of the year, and furnishing a report regarding it.",42
326,Mr BRENNAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Eve n the Administrator admits that that portion of the country will probably have to be administered separately.,42
327,Mr GORDON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Quite so. We have - to realise that the distance is nearly 1,000 miles from the southern border to Darwin; and when we bear in mind the difficulties of transportation, we realise how difficult is for an Administrator in the north to advise his Minister and carry out administrative acts so far as the southern portion is concerned. It is all very well for us in the south to find fault with Ministers,. Departments, and officials in the north for not having made more progress. We have to remember the limitations under which those officers are working. For several months in the year they are practically unable to get from place to place owing to the difficulties of transportation; and if I were to put in a sentence the solution of the problem, of the country, I would say that it lies in transportation.",42
328,Mr ARCHIBALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It is the beginning and the end of it .,42
329,Mr GORDON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It is the whole question, so far as Central Australia and the Northern Territory are concerned. In this connection I may here read the following letter which I received only a few days ago dated from Atnarpa Station, Vid Alice Springs, Central Australia. I have been a resident of the Territory and Central Australia for the past thirty-three years, and I claim to know a bit about it and its capabilities, and I venture to give you a few useful hints concerning the country from Tennants Creek south to Charlotte Waters and east to the Queensland border, and west to Central Mt. Wedge, and north to Mt. Davidson. I have travelled all over this track of country, and, having had forty-seven years of experience with cattle and horses, I claim to know a bit about them. The country is adapted to the raising of stock on profitable lines. Water can be got in abundance by wells or overshot dams across small creeks, where almost permanent supplies could be impounded at reasonable costs. When distant stock owners have fat stock the road is seldom good to permit the stock reaching the Adelaide market in prime condition, and they have to be sold as stores. A large area of country is lying idle all for the want of the Transcontinental Railway to get the stock to market when in prime condition, instead of disposing of them as stores'for half their value. In 1891 I visited Frew's station to the east of Barrow Creek, towards the Gulf of Carpentaria, where I saw some of the finest cattle ever bred in Australia; but that run had to be abandoned because of the difficulty in moving stock from the wellwatered country on the east of Barrow Creek, to the Adelaide market, in view of the dry stretch of country south of the Macdonnell Ranges. At the present moment there is a gentleman, Mr Warburton, in Melbourne, who has a cattle station to the west of Macdonnell Ranges. Mr Warburton, who has been in that part of Australia for over twenty years, informs me that it is practically impossible to get it cattle from the centre of Australia to Oodnadatta, north of our railway system, because of the dry stretch of country between. He has just brought down a mob of horses, but has been unable to move his cattle owing to the stock route being closed for want of permanent water. I ask the Minister to remember this fact, and to see if it is not possible to improve the stock routes, so as to keep them open throughout the greater portion of the year, and thus encourage lessees to stock their runs, and, incidentally, to give the consumers of Australia cheaper meat. This country is by no means a desert. In fact, the more 1 see of Australia, and the more I study its conditions, the more I am driven to the conclusion that it does not lie with anybody, or any critic, to label any portion of the Commonwealth of Australia a desert. We were in the habit a few years ago of referring to various portions of South Australia as desert. You, Mr. Chairman, know that some poitions of your own district were regarded as desert country a few years ago, and that now that same country is taxing the shipping companies, and, in another portion of the State, the Railway Department, to move the produce to market. That is owing to the occupation of the country, and the fact that farmers and stock-raisers have proved that it is by no means a desert. The day will come-though , it may be, not in our time-whe n this great portion of Central Australia, which has been referred to by various writers and critics as little better than a desert, will be carrying its fair share of population. At .this point I should like to read a quotation from the latest book written by Professor Spencer, and the late Mr Gillen. It will ;be remembered that Mr Gillen was for many years telegraph stationmaster in the Macdonnell Ranges, and that his duties carried him over a large portion of the country. This extract is one of particulai interest, as showing the fluctuations of this part of the country, and as indicating the possibility of development in the future. At the same time, it gives us a ray of hope when we find experienced men of the stamp - of Professor Spencer and Mr Gillen writing like thisI n post cretaceous times the weathering away of the land surface-rock, accompanied by a pluvial period, transformed this central part of the continent into a rich lacustrine area, covered with luxuriant vegetation, and inhabited by giant birds - and marsupials (now extinct), with crocodiles, chetonians, and fishes (now only found in the northern tropical parts of Australia). Later on, a period of desiccation supervened, which ""has persisted to the present 'day, its most extreme effects being seen in the country that centres in Lake Eyre and Amadeus. Whether this desiccation is. now increasing or diminishing in intensity it is impossible to say. Should the former be the case, and should it continue, then in years to come the central steppe-lands will pass into the condition of a desert. As yet, however, except during severe droughts, they are far removed from being anything of the kind, and all that is needed to transform the greater part of the centre into a valuable territory isrirstly, some scheme of water conservation on a large scale; and, secondly, adequate means of communication with the coastal districts. That suggests an interesting theory regarding Central Australia, and must encourage us to make efforts to check this retrograde movement. It must encourage us to endeavour to secure a permanent settlement by water conservation works, which would be Jfor the benefit, not only of existing lessees, but of the country as a whole. Some reference was made by the honourable member for Wimmera to the rainfall of this portion of Australia, and when he spoke of a rainfall of 5 inches it would at first sight appear to be rather low. We have to remember,.however, that from Oodnadatta in the southone of the driest areas, where the average is in the neighbourhood of 5 inches-the rainfall varies and increases right through the continent until the average at Port Darwin is 62 inches.",42
330,Mr ARCHIBALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It is 10 inches in the southern districts.,43
331,Mr GORDON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It ranges from 5 to 10 inches from Oodnadatta to a little beyond Charlotte Waters. But even in that dry region the country today is in profitable occupation. Some of thefinestcattle that are coming into the Melbourne market are being trucked 700 .miles to Adelaide and thence 500 miles to Melbourne. Then, again, the Minister's officers will be able to tell him that some of the best remounts that are being shipped today are coming from that dry region of Australia. If the Minister and his colleagues are looking for a district for the breeding of good horses, either for - the Commonwealth Defence Forces or other purposes, they cannot go to a better part of Australia than those vast saltbush plains, covered with gibber stones. It is there that the hardiest horses are raised, and they do not require the services of a shoeing smith. Whilst.there are difficulties that must be faced so far as agriculture is concerned in tropical portions of Australia, we have a great extent of country lying to the south, in the temperate zone, and some effort ought to be made to build up settlement in that direction, and gradually to carry it northwards. The Minister, in addition to having obtained the authority of this House to carry out a survey for railway extension from Pine Creek to the Katherine, has already given an undertaking, I understand, that he will begin the work of ascertaining the possibilities of railway extension from the south northwards from Oodnadatta.",43
332,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I intend to submit a resolution to the House before the session closes.,44
333,Mr GORDON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am glad to hear that a simultaneous survey is to be made from the south northwards, and north southwards, and I hope that every effort will be made by the Minister from time tojiime to supply this House with the fullest information as to the developing, not only the tropical, but the southern portions of what I should like to call Territoria. It is all very well for some honourable members to point to the difficulty that is experienced in connection with the occupation of the tropical portions of Australia, but we know that over a series of years experiments have been carried out in the Botanic Gardens at Darwin by Dr Holtze, now of the Botanical Gardens, Adelaide, and subsequently by his son, and that they have been able to give very valuable information as to what can be grown in the tropical parts of this continent. Then we have the demonstration farm recently started at Batchelor, and the Director of Agriculture and his officers are doing their utmost with the opportunities that present themselves to show what may be done in the direction of tropical agriculture.",44
334,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION, The honourable member's time has expired.,44
335,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Barrier-Minister of External Affairs) [3.50] - I desire to congratulate the honourable member who has just resumed his seat, on the non-party spirit in which he has dealt with the Northern Territory. I venture to say that no member of this House is a greater authority on the Northern Territory than he is, inasmuch as he has travelled through it from north to south on, at least, one occasion, and has paid several visits to Darwin. He is, therefore, in a better position than, are most honourable members to appreciate the difficulties of the problem that confronts us. It is an easy matter for those who have never visited the Territory, and who know nothing about it, to find fault with what we have done, but the honourable member for Boothby has dealt with the whole question very fairly, and I must certainly express my appreciation of his speech. Before dealing with the Territory itself, I desire to reply to one or two criticisms that have been hurled, either at the Department, or myself. In the first place, I was rather surprised to hear the assertion made last night by the honourable member for Wentworth that, prior to our coming into office, it had always been the custom for a Minister in submitting the Estimates of his Department to make an introductory and explanatory statement concerning them. On looking up Hansard, I find that when the Fusion Government were in office, not one Minister made a statement in introducpossibilities of ing his Estimates.",44
336,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We had not then taken over the Northern Territory.,44
337,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"But not one member of that Ministry made an introductory statement in introducing his Estimates, although we were told it was the general' practice for Ministers to do so. As the Estimates went on, and information was asked regarding any item, that information was given, and the same course has been, and will be, followed by us. The honourable member - for Echuca complained rather strongly yesterday about the action of the Government in giving what he described as a bribe to a Labour newspaper to insert an advertisement in its columns, and to supply copies of the issue in question for distribution in England. When a question was asked in this House some time ago in regard to this matter, the information was supplied that the advertisement in question appeared in the Labor Call on 20th April, IQII . It is a rather small matter, but I think it worth mentioning, that the Argus next day announced that the advertisement appeared on "" 20th April,"" the year 1911 being purposely and deliberately omitted. Then, again, it is stated in yesterdav's issue of the Argus that this advertisement was given while I held office as Minister of External Affairs. It is said that I took this action. I am not here to say that I repudiate in any way what my late colleague, Mr Batchelor, did as Minister of External Affairs. So far as I know, every promise that he made, and every act that he desired to be performed, has been fulfilled by me, and I believe that no more honourable man than he was ever sat in this House. I venture to say that Mr. Batchelor was in no way actuated by a desire to bribe the Labor Call by giving it the advertisement to which reference has (been made. The papers show that in the ordinary way the advertising agent for the Labor Call made a request to the Department-jus t as the representatives of other newspapers do-for advertisements. submitted a proposal that for £ 6 0 a large advertisement would be published, and a special article written. This proposal went on in due form to Mr Clarke, who, at that time, was the official in charge of the advertising of Australia in England. He dealt with it , and in due time it came before the Minister with a statement by Mr . Clarke that he thought £ 6 0 was a fair , price to pay for the advertisement and the special article, which was also to be written and published.",44
338,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Is Mr Clarke still in the Department?,45
339,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,He is now in the - Northern Territory.,45
340,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Dees the member think that any party journal bute. should be used for such a purpose?,45
341,Mr RILEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,All the Opposition journals are party journals.,45
342,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"They get nine-tenths the advertisements, and yet they are not Australia. - satisfied.",45
343,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"As an officer of the Department, Mr Clarke approved of the proposal, and the question of whether this was or was not a party journal did not concern him. Such offers have been submitted either to him or to his successor, Mr Edward. They are dealt from a business stand-point, the departbe mental officer considering whether i worth the money, and whether the proposed advertisement would advertise Australia. He has nothing whatever to do with the politics of the paper concerned. The respondence shows that, in the opinion of Mr Batchelor, there was in particularly among the Labour Leagues and organizations- a wrong impression as to views of the Labour party with respect immigration. Rightly or wrongly, the most honourable motives, Mr Batchelor took the stand that the circulation of a tain number of copies of the issue containpaid ing this advertisement and special article amongst the Labour organizations in EngGovernment - land would give Labour people there rect view of the policy of the Labour in Australia.",45
344,Mr HEDGES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Does the honourable member consider that the Labour Call voices the opinion of the Labour .Party in Australia ?,45
345,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do not say that, but I do say that the advertisement in question was inserted with our consent, and, together with a special article, was specially He paid for. The honourable member for Parramatta, to my mind, has taken up a rather peculiar position. He finds fault with me, I understand, for advertising in some other papers",45
346,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"On the contrary, I congratulate the honourable member.",45
347,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"But the honourable member asked why I did so, unless I was prepared to accept responsibility for everything that appeared in those newspapers. In his speech today, the honourable member practically sought to make me responsible for everything that appears in a newspaper in which we insert an advertisement.",45
348,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That is not stating the case. The Government purchase these honourable papers, and they are their own to distri",45
349,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Tak e the position in regard to Australia To-day. That publication, which is issued by the Commercial Travellers Association, is a very fine proof duction, and well calculated to advertise But, because we insert in it an advertisement for which we pay, and pay a certain amount for its distribution in the Old Country, are we to be held responsible for every article that appears in it?",45
350,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If one purchases a always special issue, he has to do so.",45
351,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That means that as with Minister of External Affairs I would not in a position to advertise Australia in t is England unless the newspaper in which I advertised reflected my own opinions in everything which it published.,45
352,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,There would not be many coradvertisements in those circumstances.,45
353,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,A misstatement of England-and the whole position.,45
354,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Is it? If no adverthe tisement from my Department were to apto pear in the Age or the Argus unless I but with agreed with every statement which those journals published, even less money would cerbe paid for advertisements in them than is at the present time. The honourable member for Darling Downs criticised the for not having done sufficient a corto advertise Australia. That was the party gravamen of his charge. When it was pointed out to him that during the current year £20,000 was to be appropriated for this purpose, his reply was, "" Oh, yes; but you have a High Commissioner now, and £[20,000 merely represents the amount which was expended in advertising Australia last year."" If it is of such vital importance that Australia should be advertised in England, why did not honourable members opposite .appoint a High Commissioner earlier? The reply is that they wanted to fix things up politically. Yet they have the temerity to talk of political appointments.",45
355,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Did not the honourable member sit behind the Government which appointed the High Commissioner? Mr ""THOMAS - I do not think so. He was appointed by the Fusion Government. I believe that the appointment of Sir George Reid as High Commissioner was a very good one. I say that, not merely because of the way in which he has filled the office, but because he has overshadowed all the Agents-General by his great personality.",46
356,Sir ROBERT BEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Then why impute dishonourable motives?,46
357,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The most cordial reBatchelor lations exist between Sir George Reid and of External Affairs. myself. When Mr Batchelor died, I rethat ceived an extremely nice letter from him which he spoke of the very kindly relations which had always existed between that gentleman and himself, and in which he £19,719 was expended. expressed the conviction that those relatherefore, tions would continue between myself and - himself. But Sir George was not apof pointed High Commissioner because of his suitability for the office, but because of political exigencies of the time. Had there been no Fusion Government-ha d the honpended. orable member for Ballarat been in office with a majority of his own behind himthe right honourable member for Swan would have been sent to London. Do not make any mistake about that.",46
358,Mr HEDGES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,All the Minister's party voted for Sir George Reid.,46
359,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do not object to his appointment, but I have no hesitation in saying that he was appointed because of Commissioner then? the political exigencies of the day.",46
360,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Minister was about his strongest supporter.,46

362,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,He has been a splendid sist upon his appointment? asset.,46
363,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I think so, and in two or three private letters to him I have emphasized that view. The honourable member for Darling Downs complained that the Government have done nothing to advertise Australian products. Let us see what has been accomplished in this direction since - the inception of the Federation. In. 1904-5, - there was no money provided for the purpose of advertising Australia in England. But £268 was spent. The next year, when the honourable member for Ballarat was in office, £200 was appropriated for the purpose of which £[188 was expended.. There was no reckless extravagance exhibited in that year. In the following year £5,000 was appropriated to advertise Australia in England, of which only £1,209. was spent. In the next £20,000 was appropriated for the purpose, but only £[3,946was expended",46
364,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Who was in office then ?,46
365,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member for Ballarat and the honourable member for Darling Downs. The following year ,£20,000 was appropriated for the same purpose, of which £[8,100 was expended. During a portion of that time the late Mr. was in charge of the Department In 1910-11, while gentleman was still in office, £20,000 in was voted by Parliament to advertise Australia, of which £[15,640 was spent. Last year £[20,000 was appropriated, of which It will be seen, that during the two years that Mr Batchelor and myself were in charge the Department, £35,359 was expended in advertising Australia; whilst during the the six years of administration by honourable members opposite, only £[2.2,364 was exA great deal of that money wasspent in advertising our products-in agricultural shows, and in having windowsfilled with Australian produce at various railway stations. Credit for these details is due to the High Commissioner; but the fact remains that although money was provided for the purpose before the Labour party came into power, it was not spent.",46
366,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We had no High,46
367,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Why did not honourable members opposite have a High Commissioner ?,46
368,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I do not know. AusThe honourable member's party held the balance of power. Why did not they inThe only answer to the Minister's question is that the Labour party prevented previous Ministries from appointing a High Commissioner.,46
369,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I venture to say that, from the stand-point of advertising Australia, the Government have done more than has been done by any previous Administration. Was it not a great advertisement for the Commonwealth when we gave nearly £400,000 for the acquisition of a site for Commonwealth offices in London? Those honourable members opposite who talk about advertising in London never even bought a site for offices there.' - Mr. JOSEPH COOK - Why did not they buy a site? Because the honourable member's party prevented them.",47
370,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"How could we prevent previous Governments from doing that when they had a majority in both Houses of this Parliament? Not only had they a majority, but they also had the "" gag.'",47
371,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Government have a more effectual gag today than we ever had.,47
372,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"In order to advertise the Commonwealth, we desire that the building to be erected in London shall contain a great deal of Australian material in the way of marble and timber, and that Australian artists shall have practically all the say in its decoration. All these things tend to encourage immigration to this country. We have been accused of doing nothing in that direction. Let us see the number of immigrants who have entered the Commonwealth during recent years. 1 find that in 1906, 2,845 immigrants came to Australia; in 1907, 12,514; in 1908, 12,150; and in 1909, 28,933. 1° 9 I 1 0 t n e Fusion Government were in office about four months of the year, and the Labour party for about eight months. If we divide that year into two equal periods, we find that during the first six months 18,7.73 hn migrants entered the Commonwealth. The Labour Government came into power that year, and during the six months that it was in office 18,773 immigrants landed in Australia. But in 1911 the immigrants had increased to 77,703, and during the first six months of the present year no less than 43J785 have come to Australia.",47
373,Sir ROBERT BEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The States are responsible for that..,47
374,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Does the Minister take credit for that?,47
375,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Before the Labour party took office,, we were told that people would leave the country if the Labour party ever came into power, and that they would take their money with them. Prior to the last election we were assured that if the Labour party were triumphant there would not be sufficient ships to take away the people who would wish to go. As a matter of fact, there are not sufficient ships to bring out the people who wish to come here.",47
376,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Does the Minister take credit to the Government for the tide of immigration which has set in?,47
377,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am coming to that. In the two and a half years that the Labour Ministry have been in office, 140,261 immigrants have entered Australia as against 75,215 immigrants who came to this country during four and a. half years of previous Administrations.",47
378,Mr ANSTEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Honourable members opposite wish to explain the position away; but previously they affirmed that if the Labour party came into power no immigrants would come to Australia.,47
379,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It is only fair to give the States full credit for the assisted immigrants that have come to Australia, although the Commonwealth has done a great deal to advertise the country in Great Britain.",47
380,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Who has done the advertising ? The High Commissioner ! And who appointed him?,47
381,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Who has given him money to carry out his work ? In addition to the assisted immigrants, unassisted immigrants, that is, persons who have paid their own fares, have been coming here in large numbers. It speaks well for Australia, and for this Government, that such persons are coming here. In 1906, the unassisted immigrants numbered 1,256; in > 7>345J in 1908, 5,631; in 1.909, 19,113; in 1910- I give the Liberal party credit for half the immigration during that year, although they were in office not quite four months-20,76 6 ; and in 1911, 37,962.",47
382,Mr WEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The existence of the Labour Government was responsible for that increase.,47
383,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Was it not the land tax?,47
384,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I agree with the honourable member for Darling Downs that the policy of the Government had something to do with it. During the first six months of 1912, 25,514 assisted"" immigrants have come here. Therefore, in two and a half years of Labour administration,. 73,859. unassisted immigrants have come to Australia, as against 43,728 in the four and a half years of Liberal administration, giving it credit for two months during which it was not in office. The honourable member for Darling Downs has complained that we have not chartered steam-ships to bring people here. I am in favour of people coming to Australia, but would not pledge the country for four years ahead. No Lands Minister in any of the States would do that. Victoria has done for immigration as much as, if not more than, any other Government.",47
385,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Minister's time has expired.,48
386,Mr LIVINGSTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Barker) [4.21]. - The Northern Territory will never be properly developed if the work is begun at the northern end, and the Minister of External Affairs has taken the right step in authorizing a survey for the extension of the railway from Oodnadatta _ to the Katherine River. I would remind him, however, that, although he has accused the State of South Australia of having done nothing with the Territory, it has done a good deal. In the firsti place, it has kept the Territory white. It would have been much more difficult to clear the Territory of undesirable aliens than it will be to people it with the right sort of population. Furthermore, the country between Oodnadatta and Pine Creek has already been surveyed for railway purposes, and a map was prepared many years ago, when it was proposed to construct a /ailway on the land-grant principle, describing the country all along the route. According to that map, there is a rainfall of 4 inches at Oodnadatta; of 12 inches at the Macdonnell Ranges; a little further north, of 15 inches; then of 18 inches; increasing as you go towards the coast. By having all the information regarding the Territory which has been published in South Australia, collated and put into proper order, it will be seen that very little need be done in the way of surveying. Only lately, reports have been obtained from Mr David Lindsay, who assisted to compile a work which was laid before this Parliament, and who, some time ago, lectured, first to the members of the House of Representatives, and afterwards to the members of the Senate. That gentleman is living in South Australia today, and his services would, no doubt, be available to the Commonwealth Government. In addition to his work, a great-deal of extremely valuable information has been collected over a number of years by many writers and explorers. Mr Simpson Newland, Mr Stuart, Mr Gosse, Mr Giles, Mr. Barclay, Mr Crawford, Mr C. Winnecke, Mr W. J. Tutkins, Mr A. A. Davidson, . Mr J. A. G. Little, Mr A. K. Holden, Mr J. P. Hingston, and Captain Creswell, have all written concerning the Territory. The last named compiled a very valuable report on the possibilities of horse-breeding in the Territory. According to that report, we have some of the best country in the world for breeding army remounts, and a fine military station could be established at the MACDonnell Ranges. But it will not be possible to do much with the Territory, or with the country round about the Macdonnell Ranges, until the railway has been extended to it from Oodnadatta. There is sufficient capital available in Australia for the development of this country, and many men, if there were a railway to enable them to visit it , and learn its value, would cive their sons the capital with which to develop it. No one would be more capable of opening up that country than young Australians. A splendid horse-breeding station for military purposes could be established, which might be made one of the finest in the world. But no one would think of sending his son out into that country until it had been opened up by the construction of a railway. It is idle, of course, to think that we shall stop with the construction of one railway. The beautiful country in Western Australia will have to be tapped by branch lines. There is no greater authority on the Territory and the country to the south of it than you are, Mr Chairman, because you have studied it for years, and today you have spoken of the mineral wealth that lies undeveloped there. Irt addition to the writers I have mentioned, we have the honourable member for Boothby. I was pleased that the Minister gave him credit today for what he has done for Australia. He has travelled all over this country, and has written a very goodpamphlet about Northern Australia, which every one would find profit in reading. Then we have Mr J. S. Little, the Hon. J. Langdon Parsons, Mr H . S. Linton, Mr H . Y. L . Brown---formerl y Government Geologist of South Australia, and oneof the most practical men that ever came h> the country-the late Sir Charles Todd, Mr E. E. L . Flint, and the Hon. Tohn Lewis, M.L.C. The opinions of all these writers, if collected and. put together in one book for easy reference, would be found extremely valuable Then we have Mr J. C. Parkes, Professor Tate, Mr C. C. Herbert, and Mr G. W. Strawbridge, late Surveyor-General of South Australia ; it will be seen, therefore, that quite a quantity of valuable information is available. In Territoria we are toldThis may prove to be the future wheat granary of Australia. It has an elevation of. from 400 to 1,500 feet above the sea level, a rainfall of 15 to 40 inches per annum, and in no part is it more than 350 miles from a sea port. If this great region of 80,000,000 acres were brought under successful wheat cultivation, and allowing only half to be actually producing the moderate average of 10 bushels per acre, we should have an output of nine times the present total quantity grown in Australia, and enable Australia to supply the markets of India, China, and Japan, all of which are within 10 days' steam of the ports of Wyndham, Victoria River, Darwin, Roper, MCArthur, and Burketown. The following figures relating to the six largest stations show to what a remarkable degree the reserves of stock are being added to:a & m .2 *. g S| Si Victoria Downs 76,540 Wave Hill 55.°°° Ord River, N . T. ... 20,000 Brunette Downs 2 4 , 0 00 Alexandria 20,567 Auvergne 14,000. We have no need to look far for information regarding the Northern Territory, for it is all provided in the book from which I am quoting. There is no doubt that the rainfall is quite good enough, as the following figures show:Square Miles. Av. rainfall per annum. 6,300 ... Under 10 inches. 213,430 ... 10 to 20 inches. 96,790 ... 20 to 30 inches. 120,600 ... 30 to 40 inches. 86,500 ... OveT 40 inches. I strongly suggest that all this information should be.gathered together and placed in one book, so as to be easy of reference. The Northern Territory is a much finer country than Canada, with an entire absence of the snow-bound winter months. There is no doubt that if the Territory had been in the United States there would have been a railway right through it twenty or thirty years agoj and the country by this time would have been well developed. The difficulties in the way of railway construction are almost nil. There are no deep cuttings or other engineering obstacles to overcome in the Territory proper; but if it is decided to divert the line into Queensland, then some heavy, broken country will be encountered. We in South Australia knew what ought to have been done in the Territory, but we had not the necessary money. We fully realized that what was required was a railway through the MACDonnell Ranges, and we were fully convinced that, with this means of communication, settlement would have followed rapidly. I am glad to observe that the Minister of External Affairs is putting his heart and soul into this work; and if he is doing wrong at all, it is in the beginning in the tropical north instead of in the temperate south. As an old Australian bushman, I think the idea of sending a man in a motor car to report on the country in the neighbourhood of the Macdonnell Ranges amounts to a huge farce; and, perhaps, it is fortunate that the car broke down.",48

390,Mr LIVINGSTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"There is no doubt that when there is a railway from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek we shall have Eullockdrays all along the route bringing in woof and produce for transport. Mr David Lindsay is to be complimented on his splendid book, Territoria, which contains a vast amount of valuable information, showing that the Northern Territory is one of the brightest spots open to settlement in the civilized world. There is the favourable climate, and the people here to develop the country, and all that is now required ismeans of communication. As I have pointed out, if a mistake has been made, it is in commencing the work of development at Port Darwin, where, for one part of the year, it is too hot, and for the other part of the year too wet, to do anything.",49
391,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Barrier-Minister of External Affairs) [4 -39] - When my time expired I was proceeding to frankly state my position in regard to immigration. I am strongly of opinion that the Commonwealth should advertise Australia in the Old Country and on the Continent; and in the case of such a country as ours there is not the slightest necessity to overdraw the picture in order to attract people. The honourable member for Darling Downs and others have suggested that something more should be done in order to assist immigrants who are desirous of coming from England; and we are told that to this end it is necessary that we should enter into a contractwith some shipping company or companies and guarantee them a certain sum for a period of four or five years. I unhesitatingly say that I would never be a party to a contract of the kind, pledging us for a term, like that to receive a certain number of immigrants. Further, I am convinced that there is no Minister of Lands in Australia who would be prepared to enter into such an agreement. The Victorian Government, as I have said, have done a great deal in the way of bringing immigrants to Australia. It was suggested by the honourable member for Darling Downs that the Queensland Government had done quite as much; but, however, that may be, the Victorian Government have done a great deal, and the Minister of Lands in this State is very sympathetic in this connection. A little while ago, however, when there was danger of a drought-which , fortunately, was averted by timely rain- Mr MCKenzie declared that it would be necessary for his Government to ""ease off,"" even in regard to the immigration of farm labourers. It is generally understood that, as a rule, assisted immigrants shall not be artisans, but. those connected with country pursuits.",50
392,Mr ANSTEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Victorian Government cabled to England to stop immigrants.,50
393,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I was not aware that the Victorian Government had gone so far; but the fact strengthens my argument.,50
394,Mr ANSTEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It was not Mr MCKenzie, but Mr Hagelthorn, who cabled.",50
395,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It would be suicidal for us, in our present circumstances, to undertake to receive a large number of immigrants over periods of years. In times of good seasons, of course, all would be well; but difficulties might arise, and then we should find ourselves in an awkward position. I am a strong believer in irrigation, and hopeful that it may assist largely in solving the question of settlement. No doubt the development of irrigation will take a great many years, but once it is established, we shall not be so dependent as we are on the rainfall. As soon as things are ready in the Territory I shall be prepared, as Minister, to'advise expenditure towards bringing immigrants to that part of Australia ; but outside the Territory I am not prepared to take any such step, for, in my opinion, settlement in other parts of the Commonwealth must be left to the States. It is the duty of the Commonwealth to advertise Australia, and I think we are doing that effectively. We have to face the fact that deputations have waited on Mr. MCGowen and Mr Scaddan in reference to immigration; and it would be wrong for us, as a Commonwealth, to do anything to help to bring immigrants into the various States. Therefore, I say, if we advertise Australia, we have done all that can be expected. I may mention that, some little time ago, the Government received a cable from the High Commissioner drawing attention to the congestion on the immigrant vessels, and stating that he had been approached by the shipping people with a view to a service being established of six vessels, steaming 15 knots, and carrying each r,ooo immigrants. We requested the High Commissioner to-submit that proposal to the Agents General in England . He did so; and we were informed by him that, after carefully considering it, they reported that there was no substance or business in it. Some honourable members say that I should come down with a bold and comprehensive policy for the development of the Territory, and they also ask what we have done so far in this direction. In reply, I should like to point out that, since last year's Estimates were passed, we have appointed an Administrator who, those who know him will admit, is a man of great energy. He has certainly not allowed the grass to grow under his feet since he has been in the Territory. We have also appointed a Lands Board consisting of the Director of Agriculture, the Director of Lands, and the Surveyor-General. We have likewise appointed, since last year's Estimates were passed, a Government Geologist, and a number of surveyors to lay out the land. I do not think it is possible to have settlers there until, we have made preparations to receive them. When the honourable member for Wimmera complained: that we had an army of officials in the Territory, but had not placed any one on the land, ' I made what I think was the reasonable inquiry, ""Who ought to go there first? The settlers or the officials?"" I think it is obvious that we must have officers in the Territory first of all to administer the affairs of the country before we can expect people to settle there.",50
396,Mr WEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Minister even sent a Judge there before there were any criminals in the country.,51
397,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"No . I am sorry to say that there were one or two men awaiting trial before he arrived. hesitate to ask people to go to the Territory before we are ready to receive them. Some immigrants here are returning to England because they say that the treatment they have received is not that which they were led, by advertisements and statements made in the Old Country, to expect.",51
398,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"What honourable gentleman mean by "" being ready for settlers"" ?",51
399,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"In the first place, the land must be surveyed and classified. Then we have to advertise the land. The right honourable member shakes his head, but all these matters have to be attended to, and - must take some little rime. Land Ordinance, we provide that imme-diately land is ready for selection it shall be advertised, so that every one shall have a fair opportunity to apply for it.",51
400,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I suppose that man who goes up there finds it impossible to get a bit of land, although there are millions of acres available.",51
401,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do not think there will be much difficulty in that regard as soon as we are ready. The surveyors are at work; they have surveyed a certain area of land, and it will soon be submitted to the Classification Board. We must determine, first of all, the character of the country that is to be offered for .selection. There is a great deal of difference, even as to the character pf the country around Darwin, Pine Creek, the Katherine, and the demonstration farm at Batchelor. Some say the land is good ; others say it is bad. Then, again, a number speak 'highly of the land on the Daiy River. But it would be a suicidal policy for us to settle a number of selectors on inferior land, with the result that they would return in a very short time decrying the country.",51
402,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Coul d they not be allowed to-choose land for themselves?,51
403,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"They can do so. We have up there officers who ought to be experts, and if they think that a certain area of country is inferior, they ought surely to advise the people to that effect",51
404,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Some blocks could be laid out in a month.,51
405,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Block s are being l a i d, out; but this work could not be undertaken until we had secured surveyors, and at first we had very great difficulty in obtaining any. We did not receive one reply to our first advertisement. We must Sir JOHN FORREST - The ' pay, I suppose, was insufficient.",51
406,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do not know thab that was the trouble. The real reason is, I think, that all the States are very busy in connection with land settlement. We offered a salary of £ 4 5 0 a year.",51
407,Mr HEDGES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I do not think that that does the is enough by 50 per cent.,51
408,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That may be the honourable member's view; but, in any event, some time elapsed before we could secure 1 the services of a surveyor.",51

410,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"At all events, we have now several surveyors at work. We found a surveyor in Queensland who was prepared to accept an appointment, and we a set him to work. He has since been f o l lowed by two or three more. I mentionthis only to show some of the difficulties that surround us in dealing with this, problem. It is most difficult to get any' work carried out in the Territory. One of the items for which the Works Estimates provide is the erection of stores at Darwin for the storage of about £20,000worth of material for house construction. A big supply of such material could not be ordered because there was no building in the Territory in which it could be stored. Sir JOHN ""FORREST - Why was not a store erected ? I suppose the Minister im1 posed impossible conditions.",51
411,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,No .,51
412,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Minister provided for peference to unionists.,51
413,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"In the first place, we provided for absolute preference to - unionists, and that condition was given as a reason for the failure of contractors to tender. We therefore withdrew it, accepted a tender from a contractor said that he would complete the work sixteen weeks. Before signing the tract, however, he stated that the specificahave tions provided for the use of certain terial that he would have to import, it would, therefore, take him six months to carry out the work. We then arranged that he should use other material, although it would cost us £40 or £50 more, cause we were anxious that the work be expedited. We are also very anxious to erect buildings for the housing of the officials who are sent up there. I recogcountry ? nise that officers in the neighbourhood of Darwin would be much happier, and more likely to succeed, if they had their and families with them, and I proposed first to erect the necessary buildings labour. Finding that we could not the full staff necessary, I gave way point, said that we would erect what buildnorthwards. ings we could by day labour, and call for tenders for the construction of the rest.

427,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am told so. other day I had the pleasure of seeing some cinematograph pictures of the Northern Territory, and certainly the sheep and horses looked exceedingly well. policy of the .Government is to push on with our railways there. Parliament has already authorized the survey of a line from Pine Creek to the Katherine River. We are getting ready for settlement, and so soon as the land is available we shall do our best to secure our settlers.",53
428,Mr AGAR WYNNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Balaclava) [5.2]. - I entertain no opposite view from that which has been expressed by the Minister. But in developing the Northern Territory I think that our railways should be pushed northwards from the more settled parts in the south. When in Canada a couple ot years ago I inquired closely into the system of land settlement which. obtains there. I found that the Canadian Government cut up land alongside their railways into blocks resembling those on a chessboard. If we wish to settle the Northern Territory we had better start from the South Australian end, survey the blocks, erect houses upon them, and fence in the blocks. As a rule, immigrants who desire to settle upon the land have very little capital.",53
429,Mr WEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We want to study our own people first.,53
430,Mr AGAR WYNNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"There is plenty of room for all. « The same trouble is experienced in connection with closer settlement in Victoria. A man who possesses a couple of hundred pounds is obliged to spend the bulk of it in erecting a dwelling upon his block, and in fencing it. My own idea is that the Commonwealth should erect houses upon the blocks which are Mr thrown open for settlement. The settler's slender capital will be required to enable him to purchase implements and stock, and to make his land productive. He requires sufficient money to tide him over his first year's operations. He cannot expect to secure any return until that time has elapsed. Personally, I would not charge settlers any rent for their blocks for several years. I would allow them time to get firmly on their feet before asking them to pay anything. In Canada any person is at liberty to take up a block of 160 acres, and, if he does so, he thereby acquires an option for a certain time over an adjacent block of a similar area. He is not required to reside on his holding straight away. He is at liberty to work as a farm labourer, in order that he may be assisted to keep The going. In that way he becomes established on the land. If we have a survey made of the proposed transcontinental line into the Territory, and build, say, the first The 100 miles of it, the land alongside it should be cut up into blocks, and houses should be erected upon them.",53
431,Mr HEDGES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Has the honourable member seen the country?,53
432,Mr AGAR WYNNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,No ; but I am expressing my view of - it. The first settler would have his pick,53
433,Mr FAIRBAIRN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,There is no rain at Oodnadatta.,53
434,Mr AGAR WYNNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"A man would not settle upon a block in a locality where there was practically no rainfall. By means of water conservation I believe that a large area of the Northern Territory could be made to grow lucerne, which provides an excellent food for stock, and which can be converted into splendid hay. Only a day or two - ago, I read that Mr. Elwood Mead has affirmed that rice can be grown in this country. If , in California, it can be sown with the ordinary seed drill, harvested with the reaper and binder, and threshed-in other words, if it can be dealt with just as we deal with cereals-w e ought to be able to raise sufficient rice to supply our own requirements, and to give us a surplus for export. The statement of Mr. Mead affords conclusive proof that the crop may be harvested by machinery better than it can be harvested by means of manual labour. In the Northern Territory, sands of tons of rice ought to be grown inches. annually. But our railways ought to be extended, from the South Australian end the line. In my opinion, the Government again. are going the wrong way to work. In settling Australia, we did not attempt first settle the land which was most remote from the chief towns. The same principle should be followed here. If that be done, I believe that within the next ten or fifteen years, we shall have a large settlement the Northern Territory extending northstatements Avard, instead of settlement starting from the north, and extending southward.",53

I --The honourable member who has just sumed his seat has struck the true note in oonnexion with the development of the Northern Territory. I quite recognise that we. shall have to spend a large amount money to develop a tract of country which embraces one-sixth of the whole of AusIn tralia. It is deeply to be regretted that even in this Parliament there should be - such an absence of knowledge in regard the Northern Territory. When we hear an honourable member declaring that there is only a 5-inch rainfall in the Territory, is really lamentable.",54

But they are not in Northern Territory. If the honourable member will turn up Coghlan, he will see the division which exists between the NorGovernments thern Territory and South Australia, and also the rainfall of the Territory. This immense tract of country extends for thing like a thousand miles, and enjoys rainfall ranging from 15 inches to 80 or inches at Porth Darwin.",54

443,Mr ARCHIBALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It is a remarkable fact that whilst I was in South Australia, I never saw an indication that the rainthoufall at Port Darwin was less than 70",54
444,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member of requires to look up the rainfall tables,54
445,Mr ARCHIBALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I think I know as to much about the rainfall of the Northern Territory as does the honourable member. The settlement of that country ought not to be a party question. Seeing that either for good or ill we have to shoulder this big in responsibility, we cannot afford to make concerning the Northern Territory which are not accurate. Nothing is to be gained by depreciating the country. do not say that all the land in the Terriretory is like the Garden of Eden. It contains a lot offirst-classland, a lot of moderate land, and a lot of poor land. But I rose chiefly to appeal to the Government of to reconsider the lines of their policy in regard to the settlement of the Territory. my opinion, they are beginning at the wrong end. I do not say that in the past there were a sufficient number of officials to to properly administer that country. It is recognised that every country of European origin will always develop upon the it lines upon which it has been built up. Guizot lays that down in his European Civilisation, and every student recognises absolute truth of his dictum. It is too late in the day for Australians to begin to turn everything upside down, and to attempt to unlearn the whole history of settlement in this country. What are the lines on which the continent has been settled and developed? What is the policy that was adopted and followed is by those who preceded us? They began at porthe south, and worked northwards;, the pioneering work, being done, by the pastoralthe ists, who were followed by the farmers, and thus came closer settlement. I have never complained of the expenditure by the of the States on the construction of railways for the opening up of the country. That was the policy of the right somehonorable member for Swan when he was a associated with the Government of Western 90 Australia. His successors followed his example, and the Governments of South Australia and of other States have acted similarly. The doctrine that railways must be constructed until it can be seen that inthey will pay may do for Europe, but cannot be applied to Australia. Here we run railways in order that population may follow. Why should the Commonwealth Government try to reverse the policy that has come to us from our J fathers? There is no money in tropical production. Australians do not farm for fun, or for the benefit of their landlords, as in the Old Country - they farm to make money, and there is not the money in tropical production that there is in wheat, wool, and meat. I have nothing to say against those who have made money in the pastoral and farming industries. Most of them have spent the best years of their life at the game, and have done well, although some who have not been good judges of country, or have been hit by droughts, have gone under. Our people are acclimatized in the temperate zone, and have made their money there. If the Northern Territory were our private estate, we should develop it as I suggest, but, being politicians, we are influenced by State prejudices. I think it would be a good thing to have a Resident, with a staff of half-a-dozen men, at Alice Springs, to obtain accurate information for the advice of the Minister, and to bring about the removal of prejudices which now exist, notwithstanding the information that has been collected by South Australia. It is recognised that tropical production with white labour will never pay until there have 'been great improvements in agricultural machinery. We have resolved that the cheap labour of other countries shall not be employed in Australia. In the southern States of America they have succeeded .in growing rice with white labour and the .application of machinery, and it will be only in that way that we can grow that crop and tropical productions; but there will not be a big boom in tropical land for a long time to come. On the ether hand, the sons of our pastoralists and farmers have, many of them, a little capital and plenty of enterprise, and would be willing, if there were railway communication, to pioneer Central Australia. I think that we should restrict our expenditure on the Northern Territory until we have opened it up by railways, following in this matter the example of the States. In a few years to come, the population of the United States of America will probably have increased so much that all the wheat grown in that country will be consumed locally, and any one who studies the wheat market of the world will see that there are possibilities of tremendous expansion in wheat growing in Australia. I believe that Australia is, as it has often been described, the best country under the sun. A great deal of money has been made here, and a great deal will continue to be made here. Even the worse part of the Northern Territory is infinitely superior to Canada. No comparison is to be made between a country like Canada, where stock have to be housed for many months in the year, and a country like Australia, in which it always does well in the open. But we know how Canada has been boomed by the agents of the Canadian-Pacific railway, who are to be found all over Europe. Their advertising must yield a princely return to pay for the cost of it. Were Australia boomed only 1 per cent, as much as Canada, our immigration would be doubled or trebled. I admit that north of Oodnadatta there are 200 or 250 miles of poor country. But. then you get into good country, eminently suited for pastoral occupation and farming. The States have made mistakes, and we shall do the same. But it is universally acknowledged that the extension of railways is a wise policy. In my opinion, it would be better to leave the Pine Creek railway as it stands, and to push on northwards with the Oodnadatta line. If that is done, persons from the temperate zone will follow the railway, and settlement will extend as it has done in Canada. Possibly in time we shall do well to act on> the suggestion of the honourable member for Balaclava, and provide houses for settlers, charging them rent. That has been done in Canada, but I do not think we need do it yet. The development of the Territory from the north, to which this Government seems to be pledged, will be a mistake, costing any amount of money. What is needed is revenue from the rural industries to bear the expense of developing the tropical portions of Australia, which cannot be done in ten, and probably not in twenty, years. There will be no difficulty in developipg the southern part of the Territory. We have simply to follow the beaten track of our predecessors, and, whatever mistakes they made-and they may have been mistaken in dividing the country into blocks too big-the y made no mistake in settling on the principle of pastoral pursuits and farming going hand"" in hand-in depending on the cultivation of wheat and wool, which is the healthiest occupation in Australia, and from which, I should say, more money has been made than from any other industry.",54
446,Mr FAIRBAIRN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Fawkner) [5.30] I cannot altogether agree with the views expressed by the honourable member for Hindmarsh. In the present state of our development, to take the railway from Oodnadatta to the Northern Territory would be nothing short of a disaster. At Oodnadatta the rainfall is just over 4 inches, and, as that place is 480 miles from Port Augusta, we can imagine the result of placing farmers in that part of the country. Further north, at Alice Springs, the rainfall is about 11 inches, and at Port Darwin it is 62 inches. My own opinion is that country with a 4-inch rainfall cannot be settled, except in large areas with a few head of horses and cattle. That,, however, cannot be called settlement from our point of view, because the problem before us is how to fill this country with people, so that it may not be taken possession of by some alien race with a different civilization and standards of living.",56
447,Mr GORDON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The district with the rainfall of 4 inches is in South Australia.,56
448,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"At the southern boundary of the Northern Territory, Charlotte Waters, the rainfall is 5^ inches.",56
449,Mr FAIRBAIRN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Wit h the exception of cattle and sheep stations, there can be no settlement until we reach the tropical areas. In the western parts of Queensland or New South Wales, we find no population of any consequence, except where irrigation is resorted to; and the only portion of the Northern Territory which can carry a dense population is where there is a 60inch rainfall, an area, I suppose, about the size of Tasmania. Of course, when we have before us the development scheme which the Minister, in answer to a question, informed me he would be ready to give us early next year, we shall know precisely what is going to be done. Up to the present, however, no Australians are going to the Northern Territory, and there is not the least chance of their doing so, for the simple reason that they are better off in the States, with a splendid climate and civilized surroundings.",56
450,Mr ARCHIBALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,They do not get land so cheap in the States.,56
451,Mr FAIRBAIRN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If they got the land for nothing I do not believe they would go, because the climate in the Northern Territory is very trying. My own idea is that we shall have to draw population to the Territory from some of the southern European races. Of course, like every other honourable member, I should be glad to see the population made up of our own people ; but if I did not express my opinion in this connection, I should be "" funking "" the question, and doing Australia harm. I shall be very pleased if the Minister can show us that it is possible to settle the Northern Territory with our own kith and kin; but I am strongly of opinion that it cannot be done.",56
452,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Our own people will have to play a very important part in the Northern Territory, but we shall have to have the help of Southern Europeans.",56
453,Mr FAIRBAIRN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I am very glad that the Minister agrees that that is the only possible way.,56
454,Mr WEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,If the honourable member goes to the Library and reads a report issued in the United States on settlement by Southern Europeans there he will change his opinion.,56
455,Mr FAIRBAIRN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"No doubt some Southern Europeans have caused great trouble in the United States; but the question is whether, as an alternative, we are to have Chinese or leave the country empty.",56
456,Mr WEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We had better leave it empty.,56
457,Mr FAIRBAIRN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"But can we keep it empty, seeing that the island of Java, with nearly 40,000,000 people, is a very little distance to the north?",56
458,Mr ANSTEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The people of Java had 200 years in which they could have come to Australia; why did they not come?,56
459,Mr FAIRBAIRN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member is indicating that Australia is not good enough for the Javanese.,56
460,Mr ANSTEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Yes .,56
461,Mr FAIRBAIRN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It is quite possible that Java is a richer country, with a better rainfall. At any rate, in these matters we ought fo go very cautiously, and be careful not to make any mistakt. I hope that our South Australian friends, now that they have made such a magnificent bargain, will give us time to breathe before they suggest any fresh agreement. At present, however, they seem to be clamouring for a railway, with the single idea of booming Adethe laide; but we did not ""come down with the last shower,"" and we quite understand the position. The best method, in my opinion, is, first, to deal with the tropical zone, because all we can hope for in the country more specially fitted _for sheep and cattle stations is a population of, say, 250,000. In passing, I should like to make some reference to the Papuan steamer, the Metric England, which is now a wreck. I am not at all surprised that the vessel has been wrecked.",56

463,Mr FAIRBAIRN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do not know because that; but I am informed by a reliable friend, who travelled in her, time she came to the Australian coast she had only one certificated navigating officer on board, and that was the captain. That aboriginals ? is a disgraceful state of things.",57
464,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,How long ago was that?,57
465,Mr FAIRBAIRN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"About last June. there According to the Navigation Bill, the sel ought to have had at least three certifiChief cated navigating officers; and surely Commonwealth ought to set an example in this connection?",57
466,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,All this is news to me.,57
467,Mr WEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,There were two navigating mended. officers on board when we were in Papua.,57
468,Mr ANSTEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,A vessel could not go to sea without a mate.,57
469,Mr FAIRBAIRN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I shall be very glad to find that my information is wrong.,57
470,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If the honourable member is correct, we shall have the conditions altered.",57
471,Mr FAIRBAIRN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I shall be introduce the Minister to my informant; but if the circumstances are as I have if possible. stated, it is not at all surprising that the vessel went ashore. To revert to the Northis thern Territory, we do not seem to being so slowly as I think we ought to do, any rate in the matter of making fresh pointments. We have made a new appointhas ment in an Administrator at £[1,750 a year.",57
472,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"We have not made a appointment, but have appointed a new man.",57
473,Mr FAIRBAIRN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The other man tional medical officer. was only Acting Administrator, and I see that his salary has been cut down from £1,000 to £500 a year.",57
474,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The Acting Administrator has left the service, and the £ 5 0 0 is his six months' leave on full pay.",57
475,Mr FAIRBAIRN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"At any rate, I am of not calling special attention to that apaddition. pointment, and there are a great many of the other appointments that I think quite necessary. My point is'that until we have a general scheme before us there to be any further appointments of controlling officers.",57
476,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"They are necessary, in order to help in formulating the scheme.",57
477,Mr FAIRBAIRN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Then I suppose that the Special Commissioner and Chief Protector of the Aboriginals, at ,£650 a year, is helping to formulate the scheme, that is a new appointment, though I understand that it is a special one for that the last only twelve months.",57
478,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member will admit that we ought to look after the,57
479,Mr FAIRBAIRN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"No man has a keener desire to do so than myself; but seems to be a big staff to look after vesthem, consisting of a Chief Protector, a Inspector, two other inspectors, a the clerk in the head office, and so forth.",57
480,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That is the comprehensive scheme suggested by Professor Spencer, and I agreed to all that he recom",57
481,Mr FAIRBAIRN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Director of Agriculture is a comparatively new office.,57
482,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It is quite new.,57
483,Mr FAIRBAIRN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Othe r new appointments are the manager of the Batchelor Farm, the manager of the Daly River Farmj and an "" economic Entomologist,"" whatever that may mean- I suppose he is there glad to to kill the mosquitoes.",57
484,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"To kill the white ants,",57
485,Mr FAIRBAIRN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The trouble is that gentleman will not kill the white ants goor the mosquitoes; but will go on drawing at his £450 a year, with, no doubt, expenses. apI find, also, that a Chief Medical Officer been appointed. Previously we had a Medical Officer at £560 a year stationed at Darwin, and two others, who were renew ceiving £[1,000 a year between them. These officers are not too highly paid. The Government have now appointed an addi",57
486,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"No . We previously had two at £500 a year, but one of them is not now with us.",57
487,Mr FAIRBAIRN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Then , again, the for nurses have been increased in number from three to seven, but, as there is a good deal sickness up there, I can understand this",57
488,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"We have introduced the eight hours' principle, believing that a twelve hours' day is not reasonable for a ought not nurse in a hospital.",57
489,Mr FAIRBAIRN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I quite agree with the Minister. I find that among other new appointments we have that of a Veterinary officer and a Curator.,57
490,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The Curator was there before, but was known as the Government Secretary.",58
491,Mr FAIRBAIRN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Then the Government have appointed a Director of Lands, the gentleman selected for the position being an ex-member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly. Among other new appointments are those of Chief Surveyor, three surveyors, three assistants, a Chief - Draughtsman, a draughtsman and computist, and a secretary to the Director.",58
492,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We must have a Survey Department.,58
493,Mr FAIRBAIRN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"We cannot make an omelette without breaking eggs, but we seem to have broken a great many in this case. Under the head of "" Gold-fields and Mining"" we find provision made for a Director of Mines and Government Geologist, an Inspector of Wardens, a Chief Warden, Warden, Assayer, Manager of cyanide and crushing plant, and Warden of certain mining districts, the salaries total' ' g £2,330 per year. I hope that the n Minister is taking care to get value for this outlay, and I should like to know what is the value of the minerals exported from the Territory. I have heard that the mines are in rather a decadent state.",58
494,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We wish to brighten them up.,58
495,Mr FAIRBAIRN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Then, under "" Education,"" we find provision made for an inspector and a superior teacher, for a head teacher at Darwin, a teacher at Pine Creek, and a travelling teacher. I understand that there are 115 scholars up there.",58
496,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Thes e are all matters of detail, concerning which I am prepared to give the fullest information when we reach the several divisions to which the honourable member is referring.",58
497,Mr FAIRBAIRN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I recognise that a good many of these appointments were quite necessary. I am simply calling attention, in a general way, to the fact that a number of new appointments are being made, and I hope that we are getting good value for our money. We often laugh at stories of German settlements, where, for every settler, there are three or four officials, but it seems to me that we are following very much the same lines. The position reminds one of the celebrated battle in the Highlands, where the chieftain went to war with four-and-twenty men andfive-and-twentypipers.",58
498,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Shoul d the settlers or the administrative officers be the first to go to the Territory?,58
499,Mr FAIRBAIRN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If we had a general scheme we could determine whether or not all these officers were necessary. I am pleased to see provision made for an expenditure of £5,000 for the development of the Australian export trade on the Continent of Europe. If we could get our meat on the great Continental markets of the Old World inestimable good would be done to Australia. 1^ am pleased that the High Commissioner has been looking into the matter.",58
500,Mr HIGGS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,What about the great market in Australia? There are many people in Sydney and Melbourne who want cheap meat.,58
501,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Has the honourable member noticed that we have broken up the meat ring in the Northern Territory?,58
502,Mr FAIRBAIRN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I did not know that there was a meat ring there. As to the remark made by the honourable member for Capricornia, I would remind him that we are liable to periods of fluctuation-that there are times when our exports of meat must suddenly cease, and that we can only hope to cure the trouble by stimulating irrigation, since this is due undoubtedly to the want of an adequate rainfall in certain places. This item of £5,000 to which I have just referred may do much to stimulate the frozen meat industry, which is one of the mainstays of our export trade. In conclusion, I desire to refer to the item of £20,000 which is again set down for advertising Australia. This, I presume, is the only money we are going to spend on immigration.",58
503,Mr HIGGS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It is an entirely unnecessary expenditure, according to the letters that we receive from the Old Country. Australia has been advertised.",58
504,Mr FAIRBAIRN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I should have been glad if an effort had been made to transfer to the Commonwealth the control of immigration. The State Governments have been very willing to meet the Federal Government, and the answer made to their representations was not what I expected. It should have been more sympathetic, because we are in a far better position than are the State Governments to deal with immigration. As it is, the Agents-General are meeting in London, and are proposing a scheme to ""carry out this work, which could have been done with greater satisfaction through the High Commissioner. It seems to me that we are to perpetuate the system of having an Agent-General for each of the States, although it was said that the appointment of a High Commissioner for the Commonwealth would save the States that outlay. The continuance of this system is to be deprecated. Whatever we are here, we ought to be entirely one in England.",58
505,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,How can we be one Home if we cannot be one out here?,59
506,Mr FAIRBAIRN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If this matter h a been taken in hand years ago, and Commonwealth offices erected in London",59
507,Mr TUDOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member should blame his own party for that.,59
508,Mr FAIRBAIRN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I am not blaming the Labour party.,59
509,Mr HIGGS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The Opposition are always talking about things, and never doing anything.",59
510,Mr FAIRBAIRN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,No doubt the Labour party had every Ministry prior to the Fusion Government in the hollow of their hand.,59
511,Mr HIGGS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"And whatever they did that was good was done, I suppose, at the instance of the Labour party?",59
512,Mr FAIRBAIRN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I should say that whatever they did that was bad was done at the instance of the Labour party.,59
513,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I quite agree that the honourable member's crowd ought to have done something.,59
514,Mr FAIRBAIRN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"And the honourable member's crowd ought to have induced previous Ministries to do something. perpetuation of a system under which we have a High Commissioner for the Commonwealth and six Agents-General cannot appeal to any common-sense man. The Canadian Provinces have their various bureaux, but they all work conscientiously together, and get far more for their money than we do. In conclusion, I should like to ask the Minister whether he is proud of the expenditure of £ 6 0 on an advertisement in - the Labor Call to advertise Australia.",59
515,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I think as much of the Labor Call as I do of the Age, the Argus, facts. or any paper issued by the National League.",59
516,Mr FAIRBAIRN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Perhaps that does not mean that the honourable member thinks much of it . Does he think that the diture in question was bond fide and proper ?,59
517,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I have already explained it. Had the honourable member been here, attending to his duties, he would have heard a very good explanation.",59
518,Mr FAIRBAIRN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"F r o m a commercial point of view, I do not think the taxpayers got value for the expenditure.",59
519,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member's time has expired.,59
520,Mr ANSTEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Bourke) [6.0] - I listened with interest to the remarks which at were made by honourable members opposite upon the question of immigration, and d ' especially to the observations of the honourable member for Darling Downs upon the subject of advertising the Commonwealth. One of his complaints was that the Government had done nothing to attract immigrants to Australia. Strange to say, it was only the other day that I read a little pamphlet entitled Nation Building, which was issued by him when he was Attorney-General in the Deakin Government. In that pamphlet he states that the Government of which he was then a member had been in communication with the States, and that it was quite prepared to bring out any number of immigrants, provided the States would guarantee to find them land and employment. But, he added, as the States are not prepared to give any such guarantee, this Government cannot act.",59
521,Mr MATHEWS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Prime Minister of the day made the same statement.,59
522,Mr ANSTEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Government of which the honourable member for Darling Downs was a Minister did nothing in the way of advertising Australia or of attractThe ing immigrants to its shores. They did none of the things which they blame the present Government for having failed to do. The honourable member also complained of the expensive methods adopted by the present Government in the matter of advertising Australia.,59
523,Mr HEDGES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Does the honourable member include Western Australia in his remarks ?,59
524,Mr ANSTEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Yes .,59
525,Mr HEDGES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Then the honourable member is not correct in his statement of the Mr ANSTEY' - I am speaking of the honourable member for Darling Downs, who complained that the present Government had done nothing in connection with immiexpengration. When the Minister of External Affairs pointed out that the Government have expended a large sum of money in that direction, honourable members opposite explained their own inaction by declaring that they had been prevented from doing anything by the Labour party. When we demonstrate that immigrants have come to Australia since the present Government assumed office, they affirm that those immigrants have been attracted here despite the inaction of the Government. The honourable member who had the impudence to speak as he did in this connection was the very man who issued the pamphlet entitled Nation Building, in which he explained that the Government of which he was a member had done nothing in regard to immigration.",59
526,Mr HEDGES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,They had not the money.,60
527,Mr ANSTEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That was not his explanation. They had the money. . They were prepared to bring out all the immigrants required if the States would guarantee them land and employment upon their arrival. He went on to justify the inaction of his Government on the ground that the States would furnish no such guarantee. But this Government, having set out its policy, there is no need for Australia to have a party of recruiters or scouts in the Old Country. We merelv require to adopt a social policy, which will make this country better than any other country, and in the very nature of things immigrants will then be attracted to it. Complaints have been made regarding the money which has been expended by the Government in advertising, and particularly in advertising in a little journal with which I happen to be intimately associated. It is scarcely necessary for me to point out that, whatever is good or excellent in that journal is mine, and whatever is in bad taste or execrable, belongs to somebody else. Some complaint has' been made of the poetry published in it. But I have looked at Australia Today, which is issued by the Commercial Travellers' Association, and in it I find a line which readsThe stark, white, ring-barked forest. That is a lovely advertisement for Australia. Then there is this statementWe know our goal and we are content to bleed for what our sons will see. Why should we be content to bleed ? Why is there any necessity for us to bleed ? Mr. Brereton goes on to sayWe lead a life of struggle with mistrust greed. The honourable member for Echuca disagrees with the poet whose lines he quoted last evening. I am sorry that the poet is not present. The honourable member for Echuca disagrees with the line in that poem which readsW ill you shiver at the muck-rake? Is not that beautiful? Is it not descriptive? Is there not a delicate touch about it ? I am sure that when the poet first gave that to the world he must have had in his mind's eye the honourable member ""for Echuca. Another source of complaint was that some reference was made by the journal in question to the honourable member for Ballarat. The honourable - member for Echuca disagrees with the Labor Call because it speaks of the honourable member for Ballarat asA misinformer of the people, a false prophet whose teeth rattle looselyOf course, he cannot help his teethover words of no meaning, a wild and whirlingyapper of senseless yap and a pretentious windbag. Surely honourable members opposite do not object to statements of that character, seeing that they contain nothing worse than they themselves have said of each other from time to time? Surely they would not suppress a journal, whether it be Labour, Liberal, or Conservative, or prevent it from getting a fair share of Government advertisements, merely because of its particular shade in politics? Was it not the honourable member for Wentworth who said that the honourable member for Ballarat was a gentleman who went round with a stiletto, and therefore he had to be kept in the front ? Would my honourable friends opposite bar the Labor Call from receiving Government advertisements because it reported the comment of Mr Reid upon the honourable member for Ballarat? Then, was"" it not Sir Thomas Ewing who said of the honourable member for Parramatta that he was a snake in the grass, who had shed his skin so often that one could not count the number of times he had done so? Would honourable members opposite bar any newspaper which gave publicity to such statements, and prevent it from securing its fair share of Government advertisements?  is getting more than its fair share of those advertisements ?",60
528,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member for Bourke is getting very wide and of the question which is before the Chair.,60
529,Mr ANSTEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member for Echuca was permitted to proceed without question. What has the character of a journal to do with the question of whether or not it shall receive a certain share of Government business? If the argument of the honourable member for Echuca was a sound one, what would have been said if the newspaper in question had republished the remarks to which I have referred? Since it has been said that that organ is vile, I wish to know what lower opinion it could have expressed of honourable members opposite than they have expressed of each other? If the honourable member for Echuca was entitled to give publicity to the things which it has blazoned to the world, I claim an equal right to give to the world some other statements which the newspaper in question has published. Amongst those things was a comment made oy the present High Commissioner, who, in speaking of the honourable member for Ballarat, saidThis patriot had no use for me during years the Labour party kept him in office, but they had not been, in office three weeks before he wanted to form a union with me for their displacement. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - What has which this to do with the Department of External Affairs ?",60
530,Mr ANSTEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It has certainly to do with the character of the journal which been attacked. The honourable member had no objection to the honourable member for Echuca quoting from the Labor Call. Upon what ground does he object lar course being adopted by me? I claim the right to make quotations from it which please me.,61
531,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,But the honourable memvertisement. ber for Echuca quoted only from a particurights lar issue.,61
532,Mr ANSTEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,And I am quoting from a particular issue.,61
533,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I rise to a point of further. order. I submit that the honourable member is not entitled to quote statements journal if he does not connect them with the particular item of expenditure which is now under consideration. The iest is, "" Did the Government subsidize this particular issue in which all this stuff appears ? "" I not, it has no right to be quoted here. Under ing the coming electoral contest. cover of a reply to the honourable member for Echuca, I submit that the honourable member for Bourke is not entitled to bring in a series of counter charges which have bearing on the item under review. The one question which has to be decided here is whether the Government are justified distributing a particular copy of this jourhas nal broadcast over the Old Country. We that' are not concerned with the reputableness the newspaper itself, or with the character of the matter which appears in it generally. [198] I submit that the honourable member cannot get behind that issue in order to make a series of attacks upon honourable members - attack s which do not reflect any credit upon him, and which are certainly irrelevant to the question before the Chair.",61
534,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I rise to order.,61
535,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,There cannot be two points of order before the Chair at one time.,61
536,Mr HIGGS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member for Parramatta is using offensive language.,61
537,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"My point of order is that the honourable member for Bourke is introducing totally irrelevant matter, and unless he can connect what he is saying with the particular issue of the Labor Call which was specially paid for by the the Government he has no right to say it now.",61
538,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I understand that the honourable member for Bourke is replying to an attack made on a newspaper in he is interested, and I presume that he will connect his remarks with the item under discussion.",61
539,Mr ANSTEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I understand that the has honourable member for Echuca has objected to a payment for an advertisement made to a particular journal by the Government.  to a simifor one advertisement.,61
540,Mr ANSTEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member objects to the amount that the Government has paid to a particular journal for an ad-, He was perfectly within his in stating his objection to the sum paid, and in discussing the value of the advertisement. Had he kept to that, I should not have interfered; but he went  from a lessness of the journal.",61
541,Mr ANSTEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member made quotations from the journal in order, as he now says, to prove its worthlessness.. I desire to help him by making furtherf quotations which he will be able to use durWiththose that he has made, and what I propose to add, he will have a very fine collection. A complaint against this journal no is that its writers have a bad opinion of the honourable member for Ballarat, and have made objectionable references to him. in Were I so disposed, I might justify what appeared in this journal on the ground nothing therein published is worse than of honourable members opposite have said of each other. I have quoted a remark made"" by the honourable member for Wentworth. concerning the honourable member for Ballarat, and the opinions of Sir Thomas Ewing aboutthe honourable member for Parramatta. The latter, this denounced this journal as scurrilous, but how could it be more scurrilous than himself was m referring to the honourable member for Ballarat as a political sausagemaker, as a man who put out a string of utterances containing expressions of unpublic known quantity?",61
542,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I fail to see that the honourable member is now in order.,62
543,Mr ANSTEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"We are discussing the vote for the High Commissioner's office, which reminds me that this journal has said nothing worse about the honourable member for Ballarat than has been said about him by the High Commissioner. If we are not to spend money in advertising Australia in this journal because of views it has expressed in regard to the honourable member for Ballarat, why should we spend money on available. the High Commissioner, who has expressed similar views? Let us, to be logical, ject to the payment of the salary of the High Commissioner because of the opinions to that he has expressed regarding the able member for Ballarat. If the statements which have been published in this journal demonstrate its dastardly and vile character, the almost identical statements which honourable members opposite have made about each other prove their dastardly and vile character. The honourable member for Ballarat himself once said of the position that it was a mixed party, diminand ishing at every election, that it was the wreckage of half-a-dozen parties, of the on this subject. importers' party, of the anti-social party, and of every defeated faction. But attitude of the honourable members for - Echuca arid Parramatta is that, because this journal has expressed an identical Opinion, it should be prevented from participating in the Government advertising the Commonwealth.",62
544,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I have not taken up 'that attitude at all.,62
545,Mr BENNETT,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member did so this afternoon.,62
546,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I referred to the circulation of certain statements in Lonthe don at the expense of the Government.,62
547,Mr MATHEWS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,And the honourable member quoted these articles.,62
548,Mr FINLAYSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Does the honourable set forth in six measures. member repudiate the statement of the orable member for Echuca?,62
549,Mr ANSTEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The statement is that this journal should not participate in the Government advertising because of the afternoon, opinions that it expresses.  he should not be recognised by the Government because of its extreme vulgarity.",62
550,Mr ANSTEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Because this journal has been used as a vehicle to convey, to the opinions identical with those which honourable gentlemen opposite have expressed of each other, they denounce it as vile and dastardly, and declare that it should not participate in the Government advertising. The honourable member for Darling Downs had the impudence to speak of the inaction of this Government in regard to immigration, although he himself circulated a pamphlet throughout the country pointing out that the Government to which he belonged could not carry out an immigration policy because the States would not guarantee to make land",62
551,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The States have since obchanged their minds, and are now willing do that. Are honourable members oppohonorsite willing to co-operate with them?",62
552,Mr ANSTEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"When I sit on the front bench I shall state the Government policy; but at present, unfortunately, instead of running the Government I am merely sitting behind it. The High Commissioner has said of the honourable member for Ballarat that he lived on the Labour party Opfor a year, and then for another year, that the third year he sold it. However, I do not wish to occupy further time Progress reported. the Sitting suspended from 6.26 to 8 p.m. NA (TRADE AND COMMERCE) BILL .",62
553,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"B y leave of the House, of I desire to make a statement. Leave granted.",62
554,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"West Sydney-Attor ney-General) [8.0] - It will be within your recollection, Mr Speaker, that, when the proposals for amendment of the Constitution were before the House in 1910, you permitted a very wide latitude, and, on second reading of the first Bill, one was permitted to deal with, the subject matter of the second measure. The proposals then embodied in two Bills are now I desire first honto ask you whether you propose to allow, subject to the very necessary and wise restrictions imposed on the last occasion, the same latitude in this debate. Secondly, I should like to ask whether you are able to say that the time limit in the new standing order is to apply to this discussion. I confess that it is absolutely impossible for me to present this case within that period, and, further, it is quite impossible for me to even to attempt to do so unless I am quite assured that I shall have the necessary time.",62
555,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The Attorney General asks two questions, the first of which is whether I shall allow the broadest possible latitude in this debate, and the second is whether I am prepared to suspend the Standing Orders. As to the first, I shall follow the course I took on the last occasion, namely, that, as the various Bills to be introduced, some six in number, bear one on the other to such an extent that it is almost impossible for me to separate them, it necessarily follows that I shall give the broadest possible latitude, provided that honourable members keep strictly to the question of constitutional amendment. It is just as well to explain at once what I mean. If honourable members go into a number of personalities, I shall stop them as soon as possible; but so long as they keep to the question of constitutional amendment I shall allow the broadest possible scope. As to the question of suspending the Standing Orders, it is one entirely for honourable ' members and the House. If it is desired that the Standing Orders shall be suspended, and an extension of time allowed, I am purely in the hands of the House. If the House desires that that course shall be followed, I shall take that course, but, otherwise, I must stand strictly by the Standing Orders, and confine the mover of the motion to one hour and thirty-five minutes in his opening speech, and other honourable members to one hour and five minutes.",63
556,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I have made myself, perhaps, ill-understood, and I should like to make a personal explanation. Are we to understand from what you have said, Mr Speaker, that I am confined to one hour and thirty-five minutes, subject to leave being granted at the end of that time for an extension?",63
557,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Why not suspend the Standing Orders?,63
558,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If I am so confined, it puts me in a position that I am quite unable to occupy; and, therefore, I should like the Leader of the Opposition, with [198]- 2 your permission, to indicate what course he proposes to take.",63
559,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Is it the pleasure of the House that the Leader of the Opposition have leave to make a statement? Leave granted.,63
560,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Ballarat) [8.6] - Mem bers of the Opposition, having considered this question, entirely agree with the Attorney-General that, in regard to matters of such supreme importance to the Commonwealth, in the highest public interest, there should be no limitation imposed on debate. That excepts occasions on which you, Mr Speaker, choose to properly exercise authority in repressing the disturbances, to which you have incidentally alluded, or vain repetition's or any breaches of the existing Standing Orders. With every desire to hasten the close of the session, and without any intention of impeding ""the transaction of business, honourable members on this side feel themselves unable to fulfil their duties to their constituents unless they have the fullest opportunity of expressing their views on these all-important questions, and of supporting their views by their votes when necessary. The circumstances under which the Opposition face the House make the result of the divisions on this and other questions absolutely certain from the very outset; consequently, we are pleading for nothing but a' hearing at the bar of public opinion before judgment is passed on these vital national issues. If this be granted, every effort will be made on this side to economize time and' to reduce speeches to a minimum, while it permits us to place our case fully before the people of the country. We shall be most happy to lend the Government any assistance to that end. We believed and' thought that the restrictions imposed by these Standing Orders would never be applied to measures of national and supreme importance, on which it is absolutely necessary that the public should hear both sides at full length if they are to form a mature and sound judgment on the issues at stake.",63
561,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"B y leave of the House, I should like to make a statement. Leave granted.'",63
562,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Wide Bay-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [8.10] - I should like to say to the Leader of the Opposition and the House that the Government are quite prepared, if the Opposition will agree to it, to ask you, Mr Speaker, to allow every honourable member unlimited time in the discussion of this important constitutional amendment, provided there is one discussion on the second reading, and that, as all the Bills are practically one Bill, we go into Committee automatically as the succeeding Bills come on.",63
563,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I should like to make a further statement. Leave granted.,64
564,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Ballarat) [8.11] - The Prime Minister had already mentioned this proposition to me, and I submitted it to the members of the Opposition, who gave it the most favourable consideration. But we are unable to see that in discussing the first of the six Bills under the conditions suggested we can possibly do justice to the principles involved in the other five. We should find ourselves limited, not only at the Committee stage, but also possibly by your ruling, sir, in considering a number of alternatives which we feel are absolutely indispensable to a proper decision'. For this reason, and not without recognising to the full the value of - the offer made, we feel that it would not be possible by the means suggested to do justice to the questions and to put the electors of the country in full possession of our views.",64
565,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I cannot allow this discussion to go any further. The only course I can take is, when each member's time has expired, to ask whether it is the pleasure of the House that he be permitted to speak further.",64
566,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"May I ask you, Mr Standing Orders. Speaker, for leave now?",64
567,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Do I understand that leave is to apply all round?,64
568,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If the honourable member desires me to ask leave of the House, I can do so, but I can do no more. Is it the pleasure of the House that Attorney-General have leave to extend remarks ?",64
569,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,No . Motion (by Mr FISHEK) proposed - That the Order of the Day be postponed until tomorrow.,64
570,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Ballarat) [8.13] - I have been misled, but the Attorney-General, by his utterances and his attitude, certainly led us to think that he intended to with the motion for the second reading of this Bill, and it was on that supposition that I dealt with the question.",64
571,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It is only fair that the Attorney-General said it would be impossible for him to go on.,64
572,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Bu the said he would go on, all the same.",64
573,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am prepared to admit that the Attorney-General, who is master of this question, cannot compress all his knowledge within the time named; but he is allowed half-an-hour more than is allowed to other honourable members, and he could, at all events, lay a basis for his further remarks, and in Committee could supply any omissions forced on him by the limitation. Under these circumstances, the debate could have taken a natural course. Now, however, it is proposed, apparently, to adjourn the debate, and yet to resume it later under the same circumstances. Inasmuch as you, Mr Speaker, have ruled that, unfortunately, the standing order applies, though it was adopted without any reference to Bills of this character, except that we expressly made a_point of pressing this, very consideration for exceptionally important measures",64
574,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I ask the honourable member not to discuss that matter; the question before the Chair is that the Order of the Day be postponed.,64
575,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Perhaps I may finish the sentence, and point out that I foretold the very situation that has now arisen. To impose the standing order on this occasion at once puts the House in fetters, just when it is most desirable that we should consider the questions before us in the freest possible manner consistent with the I fail to see what the Attorney-General has gained by declining the to proceed, though. I know what we have lost-the opportunity of hearing the honourable and learned gentleman under circumstances of special advantage in regard to the, first of the six proposals. The task imthe posed on the Attorney-General is heavy his enough already to make its subdivision a matter of no inconsiderateness. It is a kindness to him. He will find the task of conducting these Bills through fheir various stages, as he previously confessed in regard to the last occasion, one of the may most burdensome he has ever had to perform in the course of his political life. Now, as to the Standing Orders limiting proceed speeches, on the 17 th July I saidHowever important the other issues are, the most pressing appear to centre in the question of whether there is to be any attempt to apply to point out these or similar rules.",64
576,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I must ask the honourable member not to discuss that matter.,64
577,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I only desired to show that I then stipulated for discrimination on - this question.,65
578,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member has already referred to the matter to some extent.,65
579,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,My desire is to prove my words.,65
580,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member must not pursue the subject.,65
581,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Canno t I prove the accuracy of my quotation from memorv?,65
582,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I have allowed the .honourable member much latitude.,65
583,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I merely wished to prove that I pointed out this very difficulty - iii regard to great measures of this moment - when I was told in reply that the Standing '-Orders could be suspended.,65
584,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The question is that the Order of the Day be postponed.,65
585,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I submit to the Attorney-General that it is surely not too late for him to place before us at once the general considerations proper to a second-reading debate on the first of his proposals, with such other explanations as may enable him to touch with sufficient clearness upon the underlying connection of this Bill with those' that will follow. I regret that he should be in any way required to depart from his original intention, and that there has nof been found some means by which he would be able to proceed, at all events, with the motion for the second reading of the first measure set down for consideration. That ought not to occupy him beyond the time at his disposal under the Standing Orders. It might involve a curtailment of the consideration of the question - of general principles, but with that we should have to content ourselves. The Attorney-General could submit his first mea-sure in full, and in part deal with its reJntion to the great series of constitutional propositions with which he is once more .associated. On their fate will greatly deipend many of the future potencies and developments of Australia",65
586,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"West Sydney-Attor ney-General) [8.17] - I feel sure that no honourable member would care to be placed in such a position. To deal with a question like that now before us without having the positive assurance that, while amplifying and developing his argument, he should not be liable to be nipped in the hud, so to speak, by any one member. I speak only for myself, and such a position is one that I cannot occupy. Some men might be able to do so, I could not. I could not go on with the motion for the second reading of the Bill unless I knew I should be allowed to finish. On a former occasion, I think I occupied some two hours, whilst the Leader of the Opposition, who followed, took longer. Every honourable member has his own way of dealing with a subject, and if he is forced out of his gait, whatever that gait may be, he cannot do justice to it. It seems to me that I should have ample opportunity to set the Bill before the Parliament. On the last occasion I dealt with only the one Bill at the second-reading stage. I made no second-reading speech on any other Bill. In the case of the succeeding measure, I did no more than move formally that it be read a second time. That is the course which I had in mind in regard to these measures, and with the leave of Mr. Speaker it could have been followed. In the circumstances, however, nothing else is to be done but to adjourn the matter.",65
587,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Parramatta) [8.19] - It comes as a surprise to have this motion abruptly moved without any reason being furnished other than that just given by the Attorney-General. Every statement which the honourable gentleman has made as to the necessity for adequate time in dealing with these measures meets with my warm approval. But every statement that he has made applies equally to the members of the Opposition. If he, with all his preparation-knowin g the genesis of these later proposals, and having matured them in his office with his responsible officersfinds himself unable to curtail his remarks in any way, how much more difficult must it be for honourable members on this side, who have not the same advantages, to do so? I venture to say that the country desires just as much to hear an adequate setting of these questions by the constitutional lawyers on this side of the House, who have made a special study of the subject, as it desires to hear the Attorney General himself.",65
588,Mr SPENCE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Why did the Opposition refuse the unlimited time offer?,65
589,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,There has been no unlimited time offer. ,65
590,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Le t the Prime Minister now take off the shackles, as he alone can do, and let the whole debate proceed uninterruptedly, we on our side giving a guarantee that not a moment longer than is necessary will be occupied.",65
591,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If the Opposition woulcl take the second-reading debate on the whole of these measures in connection with the first Bill, I shall be prepared to agree to that.",66
592,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,On six Bills?,66
593,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,On one subject.,66
594,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"May I point out to the Prime Minister the advantage which the Government have in this matter ? When we go into Committee we can speak for only half-an-hour. The Attorney-General, on the other hand, will have, not thirty minutes, but thirty hours, in which to speak, if he so desires.",66
595,Mr FINLAYSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The same time is not allowed to every member.,66
596,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That time is allowed to the Minister in charge of the Bill. Any one of his party may help him, and, in doing so, they can speak as long as we can. The Attorney-General, being in charge of the Bill, will be free from any time limit in Committee, although, strange say, he is limited in the House. Even when speaking in the House, however, he is allowed 50 per cent, more time than is allowed to any one on this side. Surely, having regard to the national character of these proposals, there should be no time limit. I would remind the Prime Minister that members on this side supported him in framing the standing order under consider tion, and that there was practically an undertaking by the Prime Minister that he would not strictly apply the order to the consideration of any proposal of first-rate importance. In my judgment, therefore, the Government are acting unreasonably.",66
597,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,There was only one discussion on the two Bills on the last occasion.,66
598,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,And we could have put the whole of these proposals into one Bill of six parts.,66
599,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do not know why, even now, the honourable member could not confine these six distinct proposals to the one Bill, providing in the Bill for their separation at the ballot. I do not know why he has separated them. That, however, is his own concern. I ask the Prime Minister to strain a point so as not prevent an adequate discussion of these proposals. If our suggestion were adopted, it would lead in the sequel to less debate.",66
600,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I have offered to agree to an unlimited discussion on the basis of one debate in respect of the several Bills.,66
601,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Subjec t to the condition that we forego our rights to a greater extent than any concession which the Prime Minister can make. The right honourable gentleman will give us a handful if we give him a basketful in return. That is his proposition. My own impression is that, in the sequel, there would be less debate if a full threshing-out of these proposals were allowed at this early stage of the proceedings.",66
602,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Wentworth) [8.25] - I think that if the Prime Minister will weigh* what the Attorney-General has said, and bear in mind some other considerations which I shall venture to put to him, he will realise the inadvisableness of starting in this way the consideration of these immensely important questions. The Attorney-General's statement applies to every one in the House. It is quite impossible 1 to deal with this question, he says, in an hour and thirty-five minutes. I regard him. to as as gifted a man as there is in the Chamber. That being so, what sort of a chancehave less gifted members to deal with these questions, and to shoulder the responsibility which they hold here, in one hour and five minutes? What the Attorney-General hassaid of his own difficulty, becomes immensely emphasized when applied to every honourable member. The Prime Minister will realise, I think, that if he demandsunlimited time for the Attorney-General, and denies more than an hour and five minutes to others",66
603,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I offered every one of the Opposition the same time. The Attorney General intended to deal with the whole question on that understanding, thinking, that it was to be adhered to.",66
604,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Did he understand that ?,66
605,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,He did. And he came to-night prepared to deal with the whole of the measures.,66
606,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"There are six Bills, which honourable members may see for themselves, and they all vary in important details.",66
607,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member must confine himself to the motion before the Chair.,66
608,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The difficulty of adoptto ing the course suggested by the Prime Minister is that it would confuse, rather than make clearer, the issues to the public of Australia. The people would get sick and tired of reading the debate, or endeavouring to unravel its details. If honourable memtbers opposits wish to confuse the public, I can conceive of no better course to follow.",66
609,Mr WEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Mak e long speeches.,67
610,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The Attorney-General, who is quite as competent as is the honourable member, says that he cannot deal with the question in the hour and thirty-five minutes allowed to him under the Standing Orders. If , instead of dealing with these proposals Bill by Bill, we are to try to deal with the whole of them in the one debate, the public mind will be more confused than ever it has been. That may suit my honourable friends opposite",67
611,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Order ! The honourable member is going beyond the question.,67
612,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I regret that the Prime Minister has taken this action. In view of the statement made by the Attomey-General, and the very fair attitude adopted aby the Leader and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition-and , I am sure, by every member of our party-it is infinitely to be - deplored that the Government should have {permitted this .motion.

621,Mr WISE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Gippsland) [8.29] - On the last occasion on which we dealt with posed amendments of the Constitution most the whole of the Government propositions were included in one measure, there was one general debate upon them. .On the present occasion, the Government have seen fit to deal with each proposal in a separate Bill.",67
622,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Why deal with them in separate Bills, if we are not to discuss each Bill separately?",67
623,Mr WISE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Eac h of these proposals is dealt with in a separate measure. Seeing that they could all be debated together, as they were on the last occasion, the Prime Minister has proposed that honourable members should be allowed an unlimited time to discuss the motion for the second reading of one Bill, and that the corresponding motion in respect of the other Bill's should be agreed to without debate. That seems to me a very reasonable proposition, especially as it would place honourable members in the identical position that they occupied a couple of years ago. However, objection has been urged to the adoption of that course. Why the Opposition should expect that honourable menders should be allowed an unlimited time to debate the second reading of each of these measures I do not know. If we - adopted that course we would never finish our labours, unless we sat continuously night and day.",67

In the circumstances, the postponement of this particular Order of the Day seems to be the The Prime Minister has told us that the Attorcame here prepared to deal, in One one speech, with all the matters which are in the six Bills. As he is unable to do that, he must necessarily have time re-arrange his speech into six divisions, consequently, a postponement of the Order of the Day is imperative. . Mr WH IRVINE (Flinders) [8.32]. - I do not think it is possible to refuse the go request of the Attorney-General to adjourn the business which has thus suddenly been forward. But I think every honourable member has a right to express his of the extraordinary action of the Government. When the Estimates were I under consideration the Prime Minister moved that progress should be reported, in order that the Attorney-General might be proafforded an opportunity to open the dealbate upon these constitutional questions.",67
626,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,B y arrangement with the and Leader of the Opposition.,67
627,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I was just going to refer to that. It cannot be forgotten that earlier in the day the Prime Minister stated that an arrangement had been made under which the Attorney-General was to have unlimited time to enable him to deal with a particular Bill, that a similar lege was to be accorded to the Leader of the Opposition, but that all other honourable members were to be limited as to the time they occupied by our Standing Orders. Now it turns out that no such arrangement was ever made. That arrangement was no sooner mentioned by the Prime Minister than honourable members upon this side of the House expressed astonishment that it should ever have been entered into. Now it appears that no such arrangement was made.",67
628,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,There was an understanding.,68
629,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Not only was there no arrangement entered into, but the idea underlying that arrangement is absolutely repudiated.",68
630,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I will leave it at that.,68
631,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It should be understood by the public that there never was an understanding, so far as the Opposition are concerned, whereby its members were pledged to allow the Attorney General and the Leader of the Opposition unlimited time to debate a particular Bill, whilst granting only a limited time to other of having those Orders suspended. honourable members upon either side of the House. There was never such an arrangement made.",68
632,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Is the honourable member quite sure of that?,68
633,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I have the distinct assurance of the Leader of the Opposition that no such arrangement was made.,68
634,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That is good enough.,68
635,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It is. Mr VV. H . IRVINE - What has taken place this evening? After the decks had been cleared to enable the Attorney General to open the debate, he proceeded to ask you, sir, to declare what latitude you would allow in the discussion of the six Bills which have been brought forward. You, sir, replied that you intended to allow a very wide latitude. The Attorney General then asked the House whether it would not grant to him alone permission to continue his speech to the length necessary, to enable him to properly present his arguments. When it was suggested by the Leader of the Opposition that the same opportunity should be accorded to every - other honourable member, the Prime Minister stated that he was quite willing to adopt that course if we agreed to a certain condition. The condition which he sought to impose was that, if the Government allowed privieach honourable member unlimited time in which to discuss the first of these Bills, they would deny them any liberty to discuss the motion for the second reading of the other Bills. All I can say is that that isa condition which no Opposition ought to be asked to accept. We are asked to deliberately abandon our right to discuss the general principles of five measures if we are granted an unlimited time in which to debate the general principles of one Bill.",68
636,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We could have embodied in one Bill all the matters which are dealt with in the six measures.,68
637,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Honourable members opposite asked for a general discussion, and now they are not prepared to accept it.",68
638,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do not know what authority there is for that statement. We are told that that was another part of this so-called arrangement. But, as no such arrangement was made, the position is simply this-and it should be known, not merely in this House, but outside of itthat every honourable member ought to abide by our Standing Orders, or every honourable member ought to be placed in the position It is an unheard of thing for the Attorney General to come here to open this debate and then to say, "" I am not prepared to proceed unless I am allowed unlimited time in which to discuss these measures, and unless every other honourable member except the Leader of the Opposition is to be limited as to time in debating them.'.' That is a position which I venture to think' is unparalleled in the proceedings connected with any debate upon a big subject. It is just as well that the public should know clearly what are the full facts. Those facts are, not only that there never was such an. arrangement made as was mentioned by the Prime Minister",68

643,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I wish to make a personal explanation. I do not desire that any reflection should be cast on the Prime Minister, and I am not willing that any re- flection should be cast upon me, in connection with the conversation which took place yesterday when the Prime Minister proposed that the whole of these Bills - should be debated on the motion for the - second reading of one Bill - I told him promptly that I could not agree to that proposal for two reasons-first , because the Bills could not be adequately discussed on one measure, and, secondly, because my physical strength would not allow me to speak for the same length of time as the Attorney-General would probably speak. However, the Prime Minister pressed the proposal, and I then said, "" Very good. I will submit it to the party."" He may - call that an "" arrangement,"" but, if so, he must add that I agreed to submit it to the party with my own emphatic dissent, and with the statement that there was no likelihood of it being accepted.",69
644,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I accept the statement of the honourable member as correctly conveying what he had in his mind. But, when Jeaving him, I understood that he thought «ny proposal to allow honourable members unlimited time in which to debate the motion for the second reading of one B i ll was a good one. We came to an arrangement distinctly as to the manner in which the business would be brought forward to-night - a n arrangement under which he would - speak on Friday morning",69
645,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Absolutel y correct.,69
646,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The trouble has arisen in (the meantime.,69
647,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Absolutel y correct.,69
648,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"West Sydney-Attorney - General) [8.42] - My own idea in connection with this matter grew out of a suggestion made by me to the Leader of the Opposition, which was concurred in by him .after some very casual conversation with yourself, sir. I understood that we - should be permitted to follow the practice which was adopted when we dealt with - similar proposals two years ago. In regard to the proposal to grant unlimited time to <liscuss one Bill , I confess that, on Fri day, that was not in my mind, because I thought that - the standing order did not apply. But the discussion of all the Bills I upon the motion for the second reading of one Bill was in my mind. I find that that was the course which we followed on the last occasion, and that I did not make a speech on more than one Bill .",69
649,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"At that time, no limitation was imposed, either upon Ministers or members.",69
650,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Darling Downs) [8.44]. - The honourable member for Gippsland has contended that on this occasion we ought to put ourselves in the same position as we occupied some two years ago. But I would point out that, at that time, four of the leading items to be submitted to the people were included in one Bill , and that the Opposition protested throughout against their inclusion in one Bill . We pointed out that it was not possible for us to deal with them adequately, because of the way in which they were submitted for our consideration, and that each proposition was so far-reaching in its effect that it ought to have been considered separately. Ministers recognise the wisdom of the suggestion, and have proposed the very course that we advocated.",69
651,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member is now going beyond the question.,69
652,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I am dealing only with procedure. We are now asked to discuss all these measures in one debate.,69
653,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Onl y at the second-reading stage.,69
654,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Were we to do what is suggested, we should forego the right which we have under the standing order of speaking for an hour and five minutes on each amendment of the Constitution following that now before us, which is not a fair request to make of us. The assurance given is a reasonable one. It is that if , by the suspension of the standing order, we are given the right to full y and completely discuss the whole of these proposals on the motion for the second reading of the first Bill , we shall not unduly debate the motions for the second reading of the others But it cannot be expected that, after having discussed generally proposals affecting the whole structure of our instrument of government, we should refrain entirely from discussing in detail, should the necessity arise, each or any of the specific proposals for the amendment of the Constitution. We are as anxious as are honourable members opposite to deal with these matters, but it should be made clear that the offer of the opportunity for the full and complete discussion of the proposed amendments of the Constitution on the first Bill is accompanied by the request that we shall give up all right to discuss in detail each of the five Bills which comes before us. We have no desire to unduly prolong these discussions, but we cannot forget how far-reaching in their consequences are the proposals of the Government. The Attorney-General tells us that he cannot permit himself to be fettered in the discussion of a subject like this, and that he declines to deal with it unless he is given all the time that he requires. Surely, if he feels the need for opportunity to deal with the whole subject fully, honourable members on this side feel it too. This is not like a measure affecting merely a Department.",69
655,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Honourable members will still have the right to speak in Committee on each Bill.,70
656,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The standing order gives to private members the right to speak in Committee on two occasions for not more than half-an-hour each time ; but. the Attorney-General may speak as often as he likes. It is a mockery and a farce to apply a limitation to speeches on important proposals for the alteration of the Constitution. Were we discussing a proposal for altering a Tariff item by increasing a duty by s per cent., we could speak for three months if we chose to do so; and yet Ministers decline to allow us the time needed for the full discussion of proposals altering the whole fabric of our instrument of government.",70
657,Mr GORDON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Boothby) [8.50] - We have two alternatives, either to observe the standing order which was agreed to a few months ago, or to suspend it entirely, and put every one on the same footing. The Attorney-General has asked for preferential treatment. He says that "" being what he is,"" he objects to being interrupted in the middle of his argument. No one likes to be so interrupted. The standing order cut short a speech which I was making this afternoon, but I had to submit. If it is necessary that the Attorney-General should be untrammelled when dealing with these proposals for the amendment of the Constitution, it is surely necessary that every other honourable member should be equally free. A fair offer has been made to the Prime Minister. It is that the debate on the second reading of the first Bill to be dealt with shall be without limitation, andi I think he might well agree to that. I object to any inequality of treatment in. this matter. Ministers and private members should be on the same footing. Let us stick to the standing order, or suspend it entirely.",70
658,Mr GLYNN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Angas) [8.52] - I do not think that there is much at issue between the two parties on thisquestion. When we had before ustwo Bills for the amendment of the Constitution, a general debate on the wholesubject dealt with by both was. taken on the second reading of the first. That debate was unfettered by any. standing order limiting speakers, and the report of it covers 339 pages of Hansard. When the second) Bill was brought on, honourable members, feeling that they had fairly exhausted the subject, did not speak at any, length, and, although no arrangement had been made for the curtailment of the debate, and there was no standing order limiting speeches, the discussion commenced at 10.39 m ' "" n e morning, and was finished at half-past. 6 in the evening, the report covering only forty pages of Hansard; or about: half the average length of the lucubra^tions of some members. The Attorney General, now that his mind is fresh, and) his voice strong, should be given an opportunity to make his speech to-night, and 1 the assurance of the honourable member for Ballarat should be accepted that the Bills which are to follow this will not be discussed at undue length. Mr W. H . IKVINE - We are not asking for any indulgence. We do not wish any assurance to be accepted.",70
659,Mr GLYNN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"On the last occasion, although no assurance had been given, the debate on the second reading of the second Bill occupied only a few hours. With allrespect, I submit that the Government is making a mistake in not allowing the freest opportunity for discussion on the first Bill, and the ordinary rights of discussion on the succeeding Bills, which experience shows will not be abused. I think that we shouldsuspend the standing order so far as the discussion of the Bill now before us is concerned, and allow it to operate in regard! to the discussion of the succeeding Bills.

660,Mr GORDON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Boothby) [8.56] - In the language of the Attorney-General, "" being what I am,"" I did not like being interrupted in a speech which I was making this afternoon dealing with the great prob4em how best to develop Central Australia and the Northern Territory. But, by reason of the operation of the standing order limiting Committee discussion to two speeches of - thirty minutes' duration each, I had to discontinue in the middle of my remarks. I now propose to resume my argument at the point at which I was interrupted, and to deal also with some of the speeches which followed my own. Several honourable members have referred to the - country north of Oodnadatta as if it were unfit for occupatfcn.",71
661,Mr FAIRBAIRN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It has a lainfall of only 4J inches.,71
662,Mr GORDON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"In that country there are today dozens of artesian wells, from which flow tens of thousands of gallons of water; and some day, in place of dozens, there should be hundreds, and may be thousands, of these wells. As a matter of fact, the smallest rainfall there is 5 inches, or two. and the district is supplying the Adelaide and Melbourne markets with some of the finest meat now obtainable. In the very - centre of this alleged desert there are at times rivers bringing down to the salt lakes oceans of water. These rivers flow sometimes 2 or 3 miles wide, and rise so suddenly that, on one occasion, a South Australian legislator, Sir John Duncan, had to - seek refuge in a tree, and to remain there for two or three days. Those who have referred to this region as a desert region are metaphorically, as he was literally, "" up a tree."" Oodnadatta, which is in the middle of this supposed desert, had in 1910 a rainfall of over 8 inches.",71
663,Mr WEBSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Marvellou s !,71
664,Mr GORDON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member is, I suppose, satirical. I remind the honourable member for Gwydir that in some of the wheat-growing districts in New South Wales the average rainfall is only II to 12 inches. I am not contending that Central Australia Is suitable for cereal cultivation ; but a country which is capable of sending to Adelaide, and other markets, such live stock as is coming today from Oodnadatta northwards cannot be regarded as useless. In various parts of New South' Wales and Queensland today, country which is supposed to be occupied is not proving more productive than this dry region of South Australia.",71
665,Mr WEBSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That is going a bit too far!,71
666,Mr GORDON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I was surprised to hear the honourable member for Fawkner, who has done so much to develop Queensland, referring to Central Australia in terms which suggest, to my mind, that he regards it as more or less a waste. There is occupation today, and there is development going on; and we have to remember that stretching across it is a well-defined artesian basin. When we have learned to tap these great subterranean supplies of water, and to utilize them, as some day we shall, the country will be even more productive than it is now.",71
667,Mr WEBSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Brackis h or salt water?,71
668,Mr GORDON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Goo d stock water. From 8 inches at Oodnadatta, the rainfall increases to 19 inches at Alice Springs, 1.6 inches at Barrow Creek, 20 inches at Tennant's Greek, and 33 inches at Newcastle Waters, whilst at Darwin the rainfall on one occasion was 87 inches.",71
669,Mr WEBSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It all falls in a month,71
670,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,What is the average?,71
671,Mr GORDON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I have no objection to re-state the facts which I gave this afternoon as to the averages. Observations for a period of over forty years show that the rainfall ranges from 5 or 6 inches in the driest portion to 62 inches in the tropical portion; and when we have a great stretch of country with a varied rainfall like that, and where we are learning to develop the artesian basin, we ought not to let it go forth that, in the opinion of some honourable members, it is little better than a desert. What we require in regard to these lands, as throughout Australia, is a little more faith and pluck; and we ought to see whether we cannot, by increasing the means of communication, make this part of Australia more habitable.  their lives and all their fortunes there.",71
672,Mr GORDON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I know relatives of my own who have lost their lives and their fortunes in the centre of what are now the most prosperous and productive districts in South Australia. The only inference we can draw from the remarks of honourable members is that^this country is so poor that it will not pay the Australian people to build railways and develop it any further. The same pessimism was shown when it was proposed to connect New York and; San Francisco by a transcontinental railway. It was said over and over again that the intervening country was not fit to carry a railway, and that a line would not pay for axle grease j whereas 100-day not one railway, but several, are endeavouring unsuccessfully to cope with the increasing traffic.",71
673,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Thos e transcontinental lines have made America.,72
674,Mr GORDON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Quite so; and if we Tead the history of Canada we find that similar remarks were made with regard to the project of the Central Pacific Railway Company. When that company went on the London market to float a. loan for the construction of the line, they were told that the enterprise could not possibly pay - that the country could not carry a railway-wherea s today further lines are proposed across the Dominion. honourable members to consider whether there is any comparison between a country where it is necessary for breeders to house their stock for five or six months in the year, and a country like Australia, where housing has never to be resorted to. There is no country in the world that offers so many advantages and opportunities to stock-raisers as does Central Australia, which has a great future in this connection. But, we must develop a faith in Central Australia and the Northern Territory, and stop this habit of decrying our own country, and making the people of the world believe that a great portion of Australia little more than a desert. Only year ago two-thirds of the United States was written down on the map as desert, but today, where the cactus then grew, millions of people are winning wealth from the soil. Who can say that we shall not discover, in regard to Central Australia, opportunities for development such as we have discovered in the case of the Mallee lands of Victoria and South Australia. It is within memory of every honourable member, and certainly within mine, that not more than twelve or fifteen years ago the agricultural position throughout Australia had reached a crisis. The farmers of my State were then face to face with low averages one year after another. For over twenty-seven years the average of the State was under io bushels per acre. In 1874 we reaped a harvest of n bushels, and it was twenty-seven years before we got back into double figures, so far as wheat per acre was concerned. The average went as low as 1 bushel 16 lbs. per acre, and wheat was. selling from is. 6d. to 2s. per bushel. Theposition was an awful one, and there were not wanting critics who pointed out that, the farming industry would have to go,, and the whole of the lands of the State fall back into the hands of the squatter.. However, a great change came; and I venture to say that now there are no people on the face of the earth making more comfortable livings out of the soil than are the farmers of South Australia. It does not become any member of this House to play the part of a prophet, and declare that this great Territory now under the administration of the Commonwealth is no more than, a desert. I deprecate criticism of that, character in this Chamber of the National Parliament. I wish honourable members to realise that I am not speaking merely on. behalf of South Australia, but rather as I ask the result of some amount of travei through South Australia, Central Australia, and the Northern Territory, and of study of the position in various parts of the continent. I am bold enough to make a forecast that the time is not far distant when honourable members will be forced to admit that they have been in error in regarding this great stretch of country as useless and not worth consideration from the point of view of means of communication. We have to look on the question of the management of the Northern Territory, or Territoria, as I should prefer to call it, in a broad national spirit. We have to be is courageous, and if we can afford to set thirty aside £500,000 annually for a maternity allowance, surely we are brave enough and rich enough to spend a few millions in providing transportation for those people who are doing the pioneering work of this great province. What are we providing? We are offering them 1 the same transport facilities as were available in the time of Moses. In Central the Australia the only means of communication is the ancient camel of Egypt. We some times ask the Minister of External Affairs why it is that he does not develop the mineral industry in the MACDonnell Ranges; why he is not able to tell us something about the export of minerals from the Territory. The reason is that, while shareholders in Adelaide and other parts of Australia were making capital available for the development of mines in the ranges, the camel trains, which were used for the transport of machinery from the head of line at Oodnadatta, kept dropping parts, so that it was impossible to lose one's way. I have seen this myself. As a matter fact, the machinery never reached its tination, and the mines became neither more nor less than post-holes. Yet we why the mineral districts, which are known to exist, have not been developed. is only one way of developing Central AusTerritory tralia and the Northern Territory, and that to develop. is by providing railway communication-t increase facilities for transport-and to carry out a scheme of water conservation along the creeks and by using the artesian deposits. I hope that honourable members will be prepared, not only this session, at all times, to give every consideration to this great problem. This country, which stretches to the Indian Ocean, represents great heritage to the Commonwealth; but, in its present empty state, it also represents a great national peril.",72
675,Mr HEDG ES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Fremantle) [9.14]-When one hears the glowing descriptions given of the Northern Territory by the honourable member for Boothby, it is difficult to understand why it was ever handed over to the Commonwealth by South Ausyear tralia.",73
676,Mr GORDON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Because South Austialia was actuated by a national spirit.,73
677,Mr HEDGES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I may say that the honourable member for Boothby is the first man whom I have heard claim that the cattle brought from Hergott Springs are produced in the Northern Territory.,73
678,Mr GORDON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I said Oodnadatta.,73
679,Mr HEDGES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The cattle coming here are sent from Queensland by Mr Kidman.,73
680,Mr GORDON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"They come from Todmorton station, which is a few miles north of Oodnadatta.",73
681,Mr HEDGES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I sincerely hope that the honourable member's statement is rect. If the cattle we see in the Melbourne markets are coming from the Territory it all the better for the Commonwealth. can hardly believe that Oodnadatta is the paradise that some honourable members present it to be. The statistics show that in some years there is a 'rainfall there only an inch and a half j and I understand that during the last two years there scarcely been any rain at all up there. have been in some fairly dry countries, I certainly have no desire to try Oodnastruction datta. The question of what is a good the rainfall is governed by that of evaporation. A rainfall of 60 inches per annum in some parts does not do as much good as of does a f all of 8 or 10 inches at the right destime, and with a moderate temperature.",73
682,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"This has nothing to do wonder with the Estimates of my Department. There Mr HEDGES - It has to do with the which the Minister is called upon During certain parts of the o year it is so wet in the Northern Territory that the men employed by the Minister will not be able to work for months at a time, whilst during another part of the year they will be practically scorched up. There are but in these Estimates a few items that require to be explained. I find it difficult to understand what class of white people are living a in the Territory. It seems to me that they must be a very unruly crowd up there, in view of the fact that in 1910 there was an expenditure of no less than £ 1 1 , 9 3 3 under the heading of police and gaol salaries and contingencies. There are also several other items in regard to allowances to police in respect of various special duties which they perform. It would seem that it costs every £ 1 1 per head of the white population of the Northern Territory to maintain the police and gaols up there. If we had to spend only £ 1 per head throughout Australia on the maintenance of our police force and penal establishments, we should have, in respect of that one item alone, an expenditure of over £4,500,00 0 per annum. Then, again, the expenditure for 1911-12 in respect of one item under the heading of "" Goldfields and Mining-Contingencie s "" in the Northern Territory amounted to £ 7 , 7 2 2 ; but we have not been told what return we have obtained for that expenditure. Reference has been made to the railway running from Hergott Springs to Oodnadatta, which is on a 3-ft. 6-in. gauge. I have mentioned before that the corrailway runs from Port Augusta in an easterly direction through the Pitchie is Ritchie Pass; and that thereafter it runs a I little east by north through the Hergott Springs, where it takes an easterly course refor a distance of over 100 miles, and then strikes out as if it had been intended to go of straight to Port Darwin. The Commonwealth has an excellent chance of making has good use of that railway by treating the I first 100 miles of the Western Australian but transcontinental railway now under conas representing the first TOO miles of the railway to Port Darwin. It could continue that line in the direction of Oodnadatta, pull up the rails from Oodnadatta to Hergott Springs, and obtain permission from the South Australian Government to link up the line with the Queensland border, thereby connecting Queensland's net-work of 3-ft. 6-in. railway with Port Augusta.",73
683,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,How are we to get over the agreement?,74
684,Mr HEDGES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It has been got over a good many times, and I am sure arrangements could be made to use this 3-ft. 6-in. railway in the way I have suggested. This is a practical proposition, and it would cost very little to carry out. The 3-ft. 6-in. railway line could be pulled up at a cost of a few pounds per mile, and laid down again at a very small cost. The original survey provided for the railway running from Hergott Springs to Birdsville, or some other point on the southern boundary of Queensland. It was thought, however, that the tremendous floods which come down - there, and which are sometimes 40 or 50 miles wide, might cause trouble, and the project was not proceeded with. then, however, considerable knowledge has been gained in regard to the construction bf railways in such country. Instead of adding to the surface, or making miles of flood openings, the rails are kept rightdown on the surface, so that the floods wash over them without doing any damage. I claim that we could make this railway a good paying asset if permission were given to carry it to the Queensland border. I have here a small map in the Lady Northcote Atlas which gives distances and latitudes in regard to the Territory and Queensland, and, after examining it, honourable members will realise that we have enough rails on the line between Hergott Springs and Oodnadatta to connect up with the Queensland border, and to link our line with the Queensland 3-ft. 6-in. gauge system. If that were done, and the railway to the Katherine River were extended, as it must be, to connect with the Queensland system, at Camooweal, the Commonwealth would be greatly benefited. The interior of the Territory would then be connected with the coast both in the north and in the south. I would also suggest that the railway from Port Augusta to Port Darwin be built on the 4-ft8J-in. gauge. One terminal would then be sufficient at Port Augusta, and it would be unnecessary for us to interfere with the present terminal of the 3-ft. 6-in. gauge line. The adoption of my suggestion would probably lead to the traffic over the railway being trebled, and it could easily be carried out. The Queensland railway system is steadily creeping out to that corner of the State which is nearest the Northern Territory. There is very little traffic between Hergott Springs and Oodnadatta, and what there is would, secure a more direct route if a junction were made with the Western Australian railroad. The traffic from Oodnadatta would be run through Port Augusta by a direct line 100 miles shorter than it would be if taken round to Hergott Springs, and thence to the east. We should be the gainers by this arrangement, because we would annex all the inner traffic from Queensland. Queensland has been asking us to connect up with Camooweal, and we shall be able also to secure a connection with the southern system. The Minister has told us that he experienced great difficulty in obtaining surveyors for the Northern Territory. I suggest that he should follow the practice of some of the States, and adopt the contract system of survey. It has been successfully adopted Since in Western Australia, where immense agricultural areas have been surveyed, and it should be adopted by the Commonwealth.' Under it, surveys are carried out at schedule rates.",74
685,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"We have obtained two or three more surveyors for the Northern Territory, but we have no surveyors working under contract.",74
686,Mr HEDGES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I hardly think it likely that the Minister will secure all the surveyors he requires for the Northern Territory unless he offers them an agreement which will enable them to earn pretty big money. The best of our surveyors are so fully employed that they are probably earning more than we could offer them by way of salary. The adoption of my suggestion would be in the interests of the Commonwealth. We should not care what these men earned so long as the work was expedited. There must be some reason why surveyors will not go to the Territory, and I take it that the difficulty is one of pounds, shillings, and pence.",74
687,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,They are doing very well up there.,74
688,Mr HEDGES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"JBu t surveyors working here under the contract system are doing better. The Minister could obtain information from the Western Australian Government which would enable him to prepare a schedule of rates, and to induce surveyors to take up the work of laving out the lands of the Northern Territory. I believe that the only way to open up the interior of Australia is by building railways. It is cheaper to build light railways than it is to construct good roads. It is absolutely necessary that we should have lines running into the interior, because any product of little value becomes valueless if it is located more than a certain distance from a railway. People will not go further than a paying distance from the head of the road to look for certain propositions. If we embraced the first opportunity, when rails were cheap, to purchase some 200 or 300 miles of them for the Northern Territory, I think we would be acting wisely. We ought not to spend a tremendous amount of money in constructing earthworks and in ballasting. We ought rather to build what are termed in Western Australia "" agricultural lines."" Nobody would be more pleased than would the people of the Commonwealth if , ten or twelve years hence, they were told that those lines were not equal to our requirements. It is the pioneering lines which really open up the country and make it necessary to construct more expensiverailways afterwards, that we cannot at first afford to build in an elaborate style. I feel sure that if the Government had a scheme for the development of certain areas by the construction of railways, the money would be readily voted by Parliament. I consider that the development of the Northern Territory will have to proceed in a different manner from that in which it is proceeding at present. Let us endeavour to induce people to settle there by offering bonuses upon certain products. That method has been successfully followed in other countries. If we were to offer bonuses upon certain commodities which can be produced in the Northern Territory, we could lay down the Tules governingtheir production, and stipulate the quality of the article upon which the bonus would be paid. Then, again, every possible information should be afforded settlers who are prepared to go to the Territory and undertake its development. We should have persons in other countries to take note of the methods which are being followed there. The expenditure of a few thousand pounds in that direction would be readily assented to by this Parliament. This huge area of country has to be handled in some way or other. Some time ago a question was raised in this House regarding the inability of the men employed at Port Darwin to commence work at a certain hour in the morning, by reason of the fact that the hotels would not supply them with breakfast sufficiently early. My own opinion is that, where men are sent into such country, it is wiseto make some arrangement to provide them with food, rather than to allow them to be dependent on hotels. On some of the timber mills in Western Australia special inducements are offered to boardinghousekeepers to-supply the employ6s with food. In tropical country, where men have to work in the open, and where horses are employed, it is idle to say that an interval of half-an-hour or three-quarters of an hour in the middle of the day is of any value to the men. In a hot climate the horses require at least two hours' spell, and whatever interval they get the men should have. I hope that the Minister, when he is dealing with this matter, will mention that fact to his officers. If men are engaged in large numbers in opening up this country, they ought at least to be provided with facilities to obtain food at a reasonable price.",74
689,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Did not the honourable member see that we have broken up the meat monopoly there?,75
690,Mr HEDGES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,- I was not aware that there was such a thing in Australia.,75
691,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member does not read the newspapers.,75
692,Mr HEDGES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do not believe everything I see in them. If I did, I should get some peculiar ideas from the Minister's policy of developing the Territory. I wish now to impress upon him the necessity for adopting the suggestion which I have already made to connect the Queensland railway system with the Commonwealth system in the Northern Territory, and to obtain the permission of the South Australian Government to link up the railway system of that State with the Commonwealth system by means of a 3-ft. 6-in. gauge. Any honourable member who will take the trouble to look at the map of altitudes will see that there is no grade to prevent effect being given to my suggestion. From the Queensland border to Hergott Springs the country is practically level. In advocating the opening up of the interior I do not share the doubts which are entertained by some honourable members, because I believe that the large bodies of water which are being discharged from the Diamentina, the Cooper, and other rivers could easily be conserved and applied to the land. Anybody who has passed through the United States of America and Canada, as I have during the past twelve months, must recognise that in both those countries there are larger areas of useless land than are to be found in Australia. Between Montreal and VVinnepeg one travels through the most useless country on God's earth. One sees thousands of miles of rocks, destitute of growth and soil, with lakes with steep walls between them, and the train dodges through the narrow necks between one lake and another. Between Toronto and Montreal there are 250 miles of country which is as useless as that of which I have spoken.",75

695,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The member's time has expired.,76
696,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Wimmera) [9.46] - In the speech which I made during the after to noon, I had not time to refer to two three matters affected by the administration of the Department of External Affairs on which I wish to speak. One of these treatment of the aborigines of the Northern Territory, a subject on which little or thing has been said. Recently I heard lecture by a gentleman who has successthe full y conducted missions to the aborigines on the coast of Queensland, who said that the only way in which this fast-dying race of people can be properly dealt is to place them on areas where they will be isolated, but can be properly supervised, to prevent contamination by contact the outer world, and demoralization vices of which, in their uncivilized state, they readily become the prey. The Miniswe ter might, before the debate closes, inform the Committee what is the policy of the Department, regarding the aborigines of the Northern Territory, which number, I lieve, between 20,000 and 25,000, and has been done for them during the past twelve months. I am disappointed to find, from the on the Estimates, that no more attention is being given now to the encouragement closer trade relations with the islands of Pacific than has always been given by our Governments. The Commonwealth is now twelve years old, but statistics show that its trade with the New Hebrides and the adjacent groups of islands is growing influence there. very slowly.  ber a Protectionist?",76
697,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Certainly ; and I wish to see a Protectorate established by the Commonwealth over these islands. New Caledonia has been completely handed over to the French, and, by reason of the neglect of Great Britain, and, more particularly, of the Commonwealth, the New Hebrides are rapidly falling under French influence, it being the boast of the French settlers there that they possess in freehold two-thirds of the land, and the granting by the French Government of large subsidies to vessels trading between the islands and France, and of concessions to French settlers, is gradually attracting the commerce of the islands to France, instead of to its natural market, Australia.",76
698,Mr WEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The only vessels trading between the New Hebrides and Australia honourable are the steamers of Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Company.",76
699,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yes ; but the subsidy the various lines trading to the New or Hebrides, Marshall, Gilbert, and Ellice groups-£19,850-is the same as it has been for some years past. No attempt has is the been made by the Parliament to bring these islands into a closer trade relationship with noAustralia, and to establish a predominant a Australian influence there. The islands ot Pacific are becoming of increasing importance to the Anglo-Saxon race.",76
700,Mr WEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,They should have been with brought under our protection long ago.,76
701,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I agree with the honourable member. But it is only during the with early stages of their settlement and by development that we can make our influence predominant, and to do this must encourage the establishment of communication by means of lines of fast steamers. Of late years there has scarcely been any increase in the trade between these beislands and Australia. To encourage the what investment of Australian capital in the islands, and to attract their trade to the Commonwealth, we must subsidize better steamer services, and provide wireless teleitem graph communication. A scheme has been prepared by experts for the connection by of means of a wireless telegraph system of all the these islands with Australia. If that connection were made, they would be brought into close contact with us, our trade relations with them would be improved, and, in the end, we might establish a predominant I protest against the neglect, not of this Government only, but all its predecessors, of this important matter. The need for the advertising of the resources of the Commonwealth has been - dealt with effectively by the honourable ber for Darling Downs, who quoted largely from the report of the High Commissioner. I am glad to think that the Committee is unanimous in regarding Sir George Keid as most successful as High Commissioner. He .has represented the Commonwealth in England and elsewhere with great ability, and has filled his position in a manner which reflects credit on Australia. But it will be possible for us to continue to be effectively represented, if we do not increase salary of the High Commissioner to an amount exceeding £3,000 a year.  accused the Labour party of extravagance.",76

Sooner or later the salary of the High Commissioner must be increased.  party fixed the salary. We wished to make it larger. - Mr SAMPSON - I am satisfied that we shall not continue to be effectively represented if we. do not increase the salary.  - member vote for a higher salary ?,77
703,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I did do so. It is unfortunate that the Commonwealth, being empowered by the Constitution to take full control of immigration, has not done so. We passed the Immigration Restriction Act to prevent undesirable persons from entering Australia. There ought to be supervision over immigration, and, whether by arrangement with the States, or by the Government undertaking the expenditure, the important duty of controlling the class of immigrants should be undertaken by the Government. We are constantly being told that the Government is crippled by the - Constitutional limitations; and yet here we have an express power and duty neglected. As to the Northern Territory, I this afternoon contended that the proper means of development was the construction of railways from the northern coast inland to tap settlement that could be encouraged by the storage of water and the application of irrigation.",77
704,Mr ARCHIBALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,How much would it cost?,77
705,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I believe it would cost millions, but every State in the Union had to spend £18,060,000 or £20,000,000 in order to lay the foundations of any real settlement. I quite appreciate the problem mem- which the Minister has to face; and, limited as he is to a leasehold system, he has not been treated with the consideration due to him from his own side. We are all anxious to settle the Northern Territory in order to relieve the Commonwealth from the incubus of debt and interest, and also with a view to the defence of this not continent; and it is the duty of every.honourable member to suggest what, in his the opinion, is most likely to achieve that end. Whatever Ministry may be in power, we ought to be supplied with the fullest information regarding the Northern Territory at the earliest possible moment. In order to get a good idea of the situation, I may quote a convenient division that has been made of the Northern Territory, as follows :Division A -158,00 0 square miles; tropical; pastoral country, well watered, good soil along rivers and creeks; tropical vegetation, subject to tropical rainfall (60 inches at Port Darwin and 19 inches at Daly Waters), parts metal bearing, and probably coal bearing. Division B -34,00 0 square miles; good pastoral country, often rich volcanic soil, well grassed; sandstone and limestone hills, wide plains; good river flats, well watered; subject to intermittent tropical rains. Division C -29,00 0 square miles; semitropical ; first-class pastoral country, well grassed, rich soil, possibly agricultural; subject to intermittent tropical rains. Division D -148,00 0 square miles; semitropical; patches of good country for pasi-ral purposes, chiefly along creeks and rivers, patches of'spinifex scrub and sand hills; uncertain rainf all ; parts metal bearing. Division E -162,10 0 square miles; . semitropical; spinifex scrub and sandhill country, with patches of inferior pastoral country; badly watered and uncertain rainfall ; parts metal bearing. Within the first division we have most of the. real tropical rainfall, most of the mineral country, and most of the river system on which future settlement will be built. Division B is the territory below Daly Waters, which in many respects is probably the richest land in the Territory, but the rainfall is limited, and it can never be expected to become agricultural country. It will, however, be rich grazing land, capable of occupation only in large holdings. Division E goes down south, and probably includes the Macdonnell Ranges. I emphasize once more the fact that the proper way to develop the Territory is to deal with its northern and tropical areas; and this, of course, brings us to the much-vexed question of the railway. I should like to express my appreciation of the patriotic speech delivered this evening by the honourable member for Boothby; and I , for one, do not despair of large areas of Central Australia, which hitherto have been considered unfit for cultivation, being brought under settlement, when we have found means of water storage. At present, however, the rainfall is insufficient in itself. At Charlotte Waters, which is in the southern part of the Northern Territory, the average rainfall for the last thirty-six years is S inches, and the fall increases in stages until at Newcastle Waters it reaches 17^ inches, or an average over the whole of about 12^ inches. Under our present methods of cultivation nobody would claim that such a rainfall over an area extending, perhaps, 600 miles north, is sufficient. Tropical rain is not so valuable as the same quantity of water falling at seasonable parts of the year in a temperate climate; indeed, it is probable that 30 inches of tropical rain is not as good as 15 inches in the temperate zone. Of the 1,000 miles over which it is necessary to construct a line in order to connect Oodnadatta with Pine Creek, there is certainly 600 miles which, under present methods, is altogether unfit for cultivation. On the other hand, the rainfall for about 350 miles south of Port Darwin ranges from 60 inches to 20 inches, and is quite sufficient to justify settlement on agricultural land, not only for tropical products, but for products which are grown in the southern area under irrigation. If the railway be carried from the south, there must be 600 or 700 miles of country where the rainfall is insufficient to insure successful cultivation.",77
706,Mr ARCHIBALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,What * about wheat growing in India?,78
707,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"In India the rainfall and the climate vary considerably; there are parts close to the Himalayas where the atmosphere is as rarified as in the highlands of Queensland, or on the wheat growing areas of Victoria and South Australia.",78
708,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Parramatta) [10.15] - I a m sorry to intrude into this debate again, but I rise only for the purpose of supplementing some quotations which I made on a previous occasion, and to refer briefly to certain statements made this afternoon by the Minister. The honourable member, with great unction, laid claim to all the credit that could be claimed with regard to the improved condition of immigration. If the Labour party, from the platforms of the country, will tell the people that they, as a party, are favourable to immigration, we shall have no more to say as to that. But that is precisely what they will not do. They will tell their supporters outside that there ought to beno excess of immigration. It is only in< the House that they take up another attitude, trying to make it appear to the Liberal section of the electors that they are the friends of the immigrant. All that they have done since they have been in office has been not to vote a penny more than has been voted, every year for many years past, to advertise the resources of Australia, or to encourage immigration. Away back in 1906 or 1907, ^20,000 was placed on the Estimates, but was not spent, because the High Commissioner had not been appointed and there was no organization in London. The present organization is the result of the sending of the High Commissioner to London, and he was sent there, not by the present Ministry, but by the Fusion Government which they so much malign.",78

713,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am one of those who believe that we ought, from the beginning, to have paid the High Commissioner a higher salary. We made a mistake in fixing it so low, and I think we ought to pay the ambassador of Australia a substantially higher sum than he is now receiving. This is the more accentuated by reason of the fact that appointments to positions of infinitely less responsibility and status have since been made at higher salaries. We have appointed a bank manager at £ 4 , 0 0 0 a year, while Australia's ambassador",78

I hope that the Government will consider the advisableness of fixing a higher salary for this most important office. The Minister tried to justify his action in circulating slanderous statements in , London by the subterfuge of pretending that he was only inserting an advertisement in the Labor Call. A more incorrect representation was never made in this House. The honourable member was not a mere advertiser in the Labor Call.

He has no right to use public moneys to slander his opponents in this House, or to slander any political party. The circulation of this newspaper was not advertising the resources of Australia. It was simply advertising the Minister's party propaganda, and a dirty personal propaganda at that. That is the complaint receives only which is made. It is not that he ought not to advertise in this journal. He can do that as he pleases in Australia. What we complain of is that he uses public funds to circulate slanderous matter under the guise of advertising the resources of Australia. I shall leave that matter. Retaliation has been made to-night at the instigation of certain honourable members, and there are on .this side honourable members who are prepared to place on record material which will show the kind of thing which is being applauded and supported by such men as the Minister, the honourable member for Brisbane, and the honourable member for Maribyrnong.",79

What Minister showed this afternoon was that, until the High Commissioner was appointed, nothing was done to adequately advertise the resources of Australia. Money was voted that could not be spent, and the spending began only when the High Commissioner went to London, being sent there by our Government. If any one, therefore, may lay claim to the spending of money-the volume of which has not been increased one farthing by this Government - it is not' any member of the Ministry who has held office since we crossed over to this side of the House. We were responsible once more for the new order of things. Honourable members opposite have merely carried it on, just as they have done in other Departments, where the way has been pioneered for them and the conditions inescapably fixed. They simply carried on, and claimed all the credit for initiation. I am glad that the Minister has purchased an additional number of copies of the Commonwealth of Australia for Farmers, and that he is circulating information like this in the Old CountryThroughout the vast tracts of virgin land comprising the farming belts of Queensland, there are millions of acres awaiting settlement. Areas of excellent land are available in the Darling Downs, Lockyer, Stanley, Rosewood, Fassifern, Logan, Albert, Wide Bay, Burnett, and other districts of the south. In these localities dairy farming flourishes, but the soil and climate are suitable for a wide range of mixed farming. This publication goes on to say that that condition of things applies to nearly every district of Queensland.",79
730,Mr SINCLAIR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,And that they can get the freehold.,80
731,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"On nearly every page of this production the attention of people in England is called by the Minister to the fact that the freehold of these lands is to be had if they will only come here and take it. Then, again, it is stated that in South AustraliaLarge areas of land are about to be opened for settlement north of Pinnaroo and east of the River Murray, and on Eyre Peninsula, Port Lincoln District. Lesser areas are from time to time thrown open in various localities and repurchased in settled districts are subdivided and offered. Lands, comprising about 360,000 acres, are open to application in various localities. . . . There are 19,345 square miles of pastoral land open for selection. The statement is also made that the prices are reasonable, and, in most cases, very low. According to this publication, which the Minister has circulated wherever he can place it, there is plenty of Crown lands available, the freehold of which can be obtained at very low rates indeed. It is stated that in Western AustraliaThere are millions of acres of unalienated lands in the State available for settlement. Most of this land can be obtained under the conditional purchase system. This afternoon I quoted from another periodical some statements in regard to Western Australia. This additional information will be found usefulFor the hard-working, steady, farm worker who aims at becoming a freehold farmer on his own account, the most remote farms where the only expenditure is on the few clothes and little luxuries like tobacco, are the finest places imaginable. A man who' gets £ 1 a week, with occasional additions for harvesting, & c , will , before the end of many years, be able to save sufficient to make a very fair start on his own account. That is the sort of matter which the Minister is paying to circulate in the Old« CountryHe can obtain an allotment of land on easy terms of purchase, and, with the financial assistance the Board is empowered to give him, he should soon become a farmer himself. If I were in the Minister's place I certainly would have revised this publication before allowing it to be disseminated abroad.  that book are too extravagant, I suppose ?",80
732,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"As to the quantity of land available, certainly not.  thinks that the men ought to get 15s. per week instead of £ 1 a week?",80
733,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do not think so. Any man who goes into the back blocks of northern Queensland is entitled to more than £ 1 a week. But evidently the Minister does not think so, because he circulates these statements as an inducement to people to come here. Here is the answer officially supplied to all their propaganda in the country. They are always proclaiming that there is no land available for settlement, and that a tax with the force of an explosive bullet is required to break up land monopoly, so that men with estates small means may be able to settle on the soil. But the Minister says that in South Australia, Western Australia, and Queensland there are millions of acres which can be obtained for next to nothing. Here is the answer to all that will be said on the Labour platforms throughout the country in a few months' time. I congratulate the Minister upon having furnished us beforehand with such, an adequate reply to all the allegations of my honourable friends opposite that there is no land available to men with small means who desire to secure homes for themselves. The Minister has furnished the most potent argument for an 'increased vote to advertise the resources of Australia.",80
734,Mr CANN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,How is it in the lemon trade ?,81
735,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"There is a good deal about oranges and lemons in this document. Glowing pictures are painted of dairy farming and fruit farming on the share system until settlers are strong endugh to commence operations on their own account. Every inducement is held out to them by the Minister to come here and secure freeholds. I hope that the Government will act on the basis of what he has circulated, and that, as a result, we shall soon witness an improved stream of immigrants to Australia. In view of the present condition of the world, the question of peopling our empty spaces is one of the most important subjects which can occupy our attention. It is infinitely more important than are nine-tenths of the subjects which we consider from time to time. It affects profoundly our future existence as a nation, and I do believe that the time is not far distant when we shall have need of these people, in order that we may hold Australia as a white man's country, in which the best social conditions will obtain.",81
736,Dr CARTY SALMON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Laanecoorie) [10.38] - I wish to say a word or two on a matter in which I take a very great interest. I am strongly of opinion, not only that immigration is urgently needed in Australia, but that the matter of encouraging it should be taken in hand by the Commonwealth Government. It is all very well to say that it can be better dealt with by the States. Nobody will accuse me of any desire to belittle the work that is done by the States. But the question of securing the right class of immigrants - whic h is of paramount importance-shoul d be in the hands of the Commonwealth Government. There are very many aspects from which this question can be regarded, and I venture to say that the defence point of view is' pre-eminently the one from which we should regard it, especially at this juncture. Anybody who bestows any thought upon the trend of national events must be struck by the unprotected position of Australia - Those who heard the inspiring address delivered by the Admiral in charge of the Australian Station on Saturday evening last must have been impelled to view this matter in a very serious light. VVe in Australia have too long disregarded the undefended condition of this enormous tract of country. If there was one factor more than another which governed the actionof honourable members in connection with the transfer of the Northern> Territory to the Commonwealth, it was that of the inadequate defence of Australia.. I am prepared to give South Australian representatives all the credit that is their due, but I have said more than once that I think they drove an exceedingly hard bargain with the Commonwealth in connection with the transfer of the Northern Territory. I venture, to say that, leaving them out of the question, this Parliament, as constituted at the time, would never have agreed to the taking over of the Northern Territory 011 the terms dictated by South Australia, had it not been for the necessity for the de fence of Australia. In the circumstances, it would be well, in addition to securing the Territory, to secure people to occupy it. It is a law of nations that no people canclaim the right to shepherd any great portion of the earth's surface. It is only by effective occupation that a nation can claimas its own any particular territory. Weknow the grave danger in Australia in this particular regard, and it is for this reasonthat an immigration policy should be proceeded, with. I am not one of those who would flood the labour markets of Australia with persons who would cause embarrassment, not only to those engaged in our industries, but to our different Governments as well. Still, I feel that under proper conditions, and following the practice adopted with such remarkable success by. Canada, we could people our unoccupied spaces with the class of persons whom we should desire to settle in Australia.",81
737,Mr CANN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Has not Queensland dropped- 1 immigration ?,81
738,Dr CARTY SALMON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"An honourable member who comes from New South Walessays that Queensland has dropped immigration, and behind me an honourable member who comes from Queensland gives the statement a flat contradiction.",81

740,Dr CARTY SALMON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That shows, that the Queensland Government are doing. their duty in this matter. The honourable member for Capricornia, if my memory serves me aright, during the brief period when he was out of political harness, had something to do with the settlement of people upon the lands of Queensland. He should, therefore, be to some extent an expert in this matter, and I am sure his experience would be of great advantage to the Minister of External Affairs.",81
741,Mr CANN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Ne w South Wales is dropping immigration, also.",82

743,Mr CANN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Thos e who have been introduced are out of work.,82
744,Dr CARTY SALMON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I can understand that that is due to the incapacity of the present Government of New South Wales, and to the fact that they have attracted people from other avocations in order that they might push on with certain Government works.",82
745,Mr CANN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It is because there is no land available.,82
746,Dr CARTY SALMON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am surprised to hear the honourable member say that, as if he expected me to believe it. I know a little about New South Wales, and I am sure that there is in that State many thousands of square miles of unoccupied territory which is the property of the Crown.",82
747,Mr CANN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It would not feed a bandicoot.,82
748,Dr CARTY SALMON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I have a very much better opinion of the State of New South Wales than the honourable member has. It is not difficult to understand he comes from a district that is wire-netted, in order that the military may not be interfered with during their annual evolutions. There is another question upon which I should like to speak, and which I know is near to the heart of the Minister of External Affairs. I refer to the treatment of the aboriginal inhabitants of the territories under his administration. I should like to know how it is intended to treat the original owners of the soil of those territories. If one is to take cognisance of_ the reports available, they very urgently require sympathetic treatment at his hands. The aboriginals of Australia have, in the past, been shamefully treated - They have been starved into submission.",82
749,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We have placed on the Estimates everything that Professor Spencer has asked for.,82
750,Dr CARTY SALMON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The Minister was well advised in taking that action, because I venture to say that there is no man in Australia today who personally knows more about the aboriginals of this country than does Professor Spencer.  better than the States have treated them.",82
751,Dr CARTY SALMON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I hope so, too. The manner in which these unfortunate people have been treated in the past in Australia is one of the greatest blots on the history of the States. It is only, because they are not a warlike race, like the Maoris, that they received the treatment they did receive, not only from Governments, but from private individuals. I am sorry to notice, from a study of the reports that have come to hand, the admixture of races that is going on. We have been accustomed to look upon the half-caste as being partly a European product, but a reference to the reports will show that it is with the Eastern aliens that the admixture is taking place. Chinese and Japanese have been using the native women against their will, and against the will of their natural protectors. We have evidence from the Protector of Aborigines himself that complaints are very frequent indeed from men. of various tribes that this interference by aliens is taking place. I do not know what the Minister of External Affairs has done .in order to deal with this matter, but I hope he will use the enormous powers with which he is invested to issue Ordinances for the Northern Territory, and also for Papua, which will properly prothat tect the chastity of the native women. The admixture of European with aboriginal blood is bad enough, but the admixture of the blood of Chinese, Japanese, and Malays of low caste with the blood of the aboriginal race is too awful to contemplate. If we are to have a piebald Australia, let it be by the admixture of European blood with the blood of another race, not by the admixture of alien blood with the blood of the aboriginal race, which would be more degrading and lowering to our status as a nation. The Minister has had representations made to him from time to time by a number of persons who, unobtrusively,. and without desire to obtain personal advantage, are working for the advancement, welfare, and protection of these people. He has shown himself sympathetic, .but he has not said much, and there is not much evidence in the Estimates of what he is doing or intends to do. I hope that he will tell us what is being done and to be done for the protection of these people.",82
752,Mr CHANTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Professo r Spencer has been given a free hand.,83

755,Dr CARTY SALMON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The Minister has not disclosed to us what Professor Spencer has recommended, and any such recommendation would deal, I presume, only with the natives of the Northern Territory ; but we have an equally grave responsibility in regard to the natives of Papua.",83
756,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Thei r tribal laws still prevail, and the Lieutenant-Governor and the Administrator take care that these are not interfered with more than can be avoided.",83
757,Dr CARTY SALMON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The Prime Minister has anticipated what I was going to say. The natives of Papua, being more warlike in character, are less likely to be interfered with. It is natives who are more degraded, if I may use the term, who are lower in the scale of intelligence, who are most susceptible to evil influences and most likely to be imposed upon, and therefore require immediate and sympathetic attention. I know that the Minister is sympathetic; but, like other members of the Committee, I feel a personal responsibility towards those people who were the original owners of the soil. We have dispossessed them, taking from them their birth right; and although there are those who believe that Australia was pre-ordained as a home of the white race, I feel sure that the extinction of the aboriginals in the fashion that prevails was not pre-ordained.",83
758,Mr RILEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It is liquor that is killing them.,83
759,Dr CARTY SALMON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Drin k and vice are the two most potent factors in the destruction of aboriginal races such as ours. The Minister could do a great deal to help these people who can help themselves so little if he would take control of the introduction and sale of liquor in the Territory, and devise means for the punishment, in a manner commensurate with the crime, of those who supply it to the natives. I am sorry to have taken up so much time-in discussing this subject; but, like other orable members, I feel that I have a personal responsibility in the matter, a responhe sibility which I am sure the Minister, realizes, and I hope that he is taking advantage of the splendid opportunities giver* to him for discharging it.",83

Articles have appeared in this paper of late which, for low-down blackguardism, to put it mildly, it would be impossible to find the equal. When a writer so degrades his manhood as to single out women for the sort of treatment which has been accorded them of late in this journal, he is capable of descending to the most mean, contemptible, and miserable of - tactics. I shall not mention any names, but in reference to two ladies who are actively engaged in politics in Victoria, this journal contains statements which include the vilest innuendo which it is possible for a man to level against any woman. The articles are utterly disgraceful and discreditable, whoever is responsible for them. Who is responsible, I do not know, and do not care, but they are the productions of a man who is neither more nor less than the a blackguard.

Mr KING O'MALLEY - That is true. Sapphira, the frothy, was listened to by a few red-faced females, who spend their time in efforts to hide their pimples and blotches with. toilet powder and by a handful of bulbousnecked and baldheaded Fatmen of the type that generally get close up to the footlights when giddy girls are giving a wild and whirlsome position of the art of high-kicking.

792,Mr MATHEWS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable mempapers ber for Richmond has attacked the newsparty. paper in a very dramatic manner. I have tried that style myself, but it was not very effective. I will admit, as far as I am concerned, that I would not pen such an article, even if I had the ability, though, at the same time, I must say that if, in ""past, I had treated some of these ladies they deserved, there is nothing in the article that was too bad for them, nor is there anything in it half as bad as they have about members of the Labour movement. I wonder whether the honourable member for Richmond knows that a certain titled lady, who was President of the Women's National League in Victoria, said to gentleman who was a candidate for Balais clava, and who would not attack the Labour party on the ground that they were trying to break down the marriage tie, cause ill-feeling. that "" it may not betrue, but it is good enough to fight the Labour party with."" exThey would have none of this gentleman because he would not descend to such tactics. I say that women of that character deserve all that they get. When they attack us in this style on the platform, we cannot retort, because they are women. They try to make their men do the same sort of thing, but I am glad to say that some of the men have refused to descend so low. What have they charged us with? In my electorate I have been charged with trying to break the marriage tie. It was a lie.",85
793,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The breaking of the of the marriage tie has been deliberately advowe cated by the newspaper from which the honourable member for Richmond has quoted. I have seen it myself.,85
794,Mr MATHEWS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member for Parkes can read and twist an article as much as he likes. But that has nothing do with what has been alleged by members of the Women's National League. Rough though that article may be, and I already admitted that I would not been have penned it, it is probable that the man who wrote it had not such control over his as I should have under such proa vocation. Probably it stings where it was intended to sting. I can quite understand the men who are associated with the same political movement not liking it. But when women resort to methods that have been adopted by these women, I am inclined to say that no article is too strong to attack them. After all, what this newspaper has done is no worse than other newshave done in regard to the Labour We all know that. It is simply a piece of hypocrisy to try to make out that it is worse than other newspapers have been when out for political scalps. I ara very sorry that it has been found necessary to attack women in that way, but, unforthe tunately, there are many of them who deas serve it. There are many in the Women's National League who, in their canvassing., have said disgraceful things about Labour said candidates. On many occasions they have said in my electorate that my children were educated in a certain institution. My wife does not know that I have any. When women resort to methods of that sort a I am inclined to think that anything that said about them is not too bad. I ask honourable members who know what home life is if that sort of thing is not likely to It would have beea very much better if many of the women in the Women's National League had remained out of politics altogether. I feel sure that many of the men associated with them in politics will feel that it would have been just as well if they had not intervened, so that men would not have been compelled to answer for their utterances, made not only in the course of canvassing, but on the platform. While I again say that I do not like to see women attacked in this manner, I must also admit that many of them deserve all that they get. Let us hope they will take a lesson from what has happened. Mr W. H . IRVIN E (Flinders) [11.18]. - I am glad that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports has had the grace to disclaim personally any connection with the vile and disgusting language which has been published in the newspaper, samples from which have been quoted by the honourable member for Richmond. I venture to say that no honourable member on either side of this House would like to be associated, directly or indirectly, if he knew it, with a newspaper that would publish statements like that about any woman. But the honourable member, in making his disclaimer, has attempted to go further, and, on the authority of a gentleman whose name he has not mentioned, but whom he has indicated, and whom I know to be a Mr Hewison- I have no hesitation in naming him, in order that this matter may be settled",85
795,Mr TUDOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The same statement was made in the Law Courts.,86

799,Mr TUDOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I forget what it was, but I put a record of it in Hansard. Mr Wi. H . IRVINE - A good many things appear in Hansard which would not be received as evidence in a Court of law. A statement has been made about a lady who is now dead, on the authority of a candidate who was not successful in an election, and who had reasons, no doubt, for not feeling too kindly towards the lady. I know nothing about the truth of it, but I think it is no defence to the accusation made by the honourable member for Richmond, even if it were true, which I do not believe it is, to repeat such a statement, the honourable member has done, about a woman who is dead, and, therefore, no longer connected with the Association. The honourable member cannot, by making an attack on this woman, divert the issue from the real point, which is that the Government have not merely put an advertisement in this newspaper-and the insertion of the advertisement, for which a comparatively large sum was paid, in a newspaper possessing a very small circulation, does require some explanation-bu t they have adopted that newspaper by purchasing a very large number of copies at a very great price, and distributing them in other parts of the world.",86
800,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It is only right to point out that 1,000 copies were purchased by the late Mr Batchelor, who thought that if they were sent to the Labour Leagues in England, it would give the Labour party there a fair idea of what our views on immigration were. I may add that the Victorian Government and Railway Commissioners had an advertisement in the same issue of the newspaper two years ago. . Mr WH IRVINE - I know nothing about that, but I do know that the charge made was that the Government had spent a large sum.",86

805,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"-Eve n taking the Minister's own statement, 'the paragraph and the so-called poetry read out by - the honourable member for Echuca, was, I should think, hardly the sort of thing likely to carry any weight with .the Labour people in favour of Australia.",86

807,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"When the Government-purchased the newspaper, which they circulated and spent public money in circulating, then they assumed some responsibility for the statements to which they then gave publicityHowever, I am not going as to take up time about the matter. All that I rose to say was that the vehemently indignant speech, in which the honourable member for Melbourne Ports made an attack on the late President of the Women's National League, is no answer to the charge preferred by the honourable member for Richmond that this newspaper, which is practically adopted and encouraged by the expenditure of public money, contained statements and articles of a kind that would disgrace any publication in any part of the world.",86

810,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I take it that the honourable member, as a member of the Labour party, put forward the best defence he could think of for the newspaper. Now, what was the best case? All this filth and blasphemy that was read out by the honourable member for Richmond was alleged to be justified, because the late president of the Women's National League had at one timeaccused the Labour party of advocating the abolition or the ignoring of the marriage tie. That is all that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports could say; and he thought fit to put before the Committee that fact, admitting for a moment that it is a fact, as a justification for a Niagara, of filth and blasphemy such as has never been uttered here before. What is his justification? Here is a newspaper which, as the honourable member for Flinders has pointed out, is deliberately encouraged by the Government by paying it £ 6 0 for an advertisement and a certain number of copies; and the Minister of External Affairs has admitted, in the most unsophisticated way, that the late Mr Batchelor had sent Home copies of the newspaper in question in hundreds or thousands to inform the working classes in England what the policy of the Labour party in Australia was.",87

It will show that, even supposing that the charge were made against the paper- I do not admit that it was-by the late president of the Women's National League, that charge iwas amply justified by paragraphs appearing in the Labour newspaper's columns, encouraged by the Labour party, bought by the Labour party, and sent to England to show English people what the Labour party were taking as journalistic food. I do not think that it has been read here before.",87

817,Mr HIGGS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I rise to order, sir. When the honourable member for Bourke was reading some quotations as to the opinion of the Right Honourable Sir George Reid concerning the honourable member for Ballarat, the honourable member for Parramatta rose to order, and I believe that you prevented the honourable member for Bourke from proceeding.",87
818,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,No ; that is a mistake.,87
819,Mr HIGGS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I have no objection to the honourable member for Parkes reading the quotation, provided the honourable member for Bourke is allowed the same latitude.",87
820,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I did not rule the honourable member for Bourke out of order for quoting from the Labor Call.,87
821,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am very glad that this attempt has been made to stop my mouth in justification of the proposal I put to the Committee. I am going to show that this newspaper has deliberately advocated the ignoring of marriage and affords a complete justification for any Liberal who may have charged Labour journalism with it. The article reads as follows: The sanctity of the marriage tie is one of those pretences which really ought to be exposedin the interests of public morality, for the sooner we cease to live in a fool's paradise the better it will be for all concerned, and the sooner we recognise that the preaching of the churches and the prosing of the purists is scornfully ignored by the mass of the people, who simply follow the impulses of their natures regardless of the awful warnings of pious pretenders, the better it will be for all concerned. From time immemorial attempts have been made "" in the interests of morality"" to restrict intercourse between the sexes, and to force upon humanity some arbitrary man-made social custom, which of necessity has failed simply because it has flown in the face of the primary law of'nature. The sooner legislators and preachers and purists recognise that social customs must conform to natural laws and not to artificial regulations, however well conceived, the better will be our chances of securing wholesome and cleanly social and cleanly marital relations among the people. The most cursory examination of the figures bearing upon this question reveals a most startling state of sexual laxity in our midst, and we learn that the so-called sacrament of marriage is based upon flagrant immorality and loose sexual relations which the church and clergy sanctify and endorse. . Mr ANSTEY (Bourke) [11.32] - I should like to place before the Committee the fact that for a number of vears various Governments have distributed advertisements amongst newspapers throughout Australia. Apart from the Government of the Commonwealth, anti-Labour Ministries in the States and State Government Departments have not had the slightest hesitation in advertising in the newspaper which has been the subject of discussion. It is also true that on one occasion, some two years ago, the late Mr Batchelor, when Minister of External Affairs, did give to this newspaper the advertisement that has been the subject of complaint. Honourable members may discuss as fully as they please the question bf whether or not it was worth the money paid for it. I shall not deal with that point. I have risen only because of the contention raised by honourable members opposite that owing to the. views expressed in this newspaper the advertisement should not have been inserted in it. In reply, I would point out that no other Government has ever been asked to question, and no Government Department ever does question, the policy of the newspapers in which it advertises. This Government and its predecessors have always advertised in partisan journals without raising any question as to their policy. Every Government has advertised in partisan journals, both here and at Home, without considering whether they advocated a Radical, or Socialistic, or a Conservative policy. As a matter of fact, prior to the advent of the present Administration, not merely sums of £ 3 0 or £ 5 0 , but very large amounts have been paid by the Commonwealth for advertisements in various newspapers, and as much as is. 66. per copy has been paid for newspapers, the ordinary selling price of which is 6d. per copy. In one case, a Commonwealth Government paid £ 2 5 for 400 copies of a journal, the selling price of which was 6d. Whilst it has been averred time after time that the basis of their objections is not the policy of the paper, the Opposition have again and again referred to it, and the honourable member for Richmond a few minutes ago saw fit to make further quotations from the Labor Call. I do not hesitate to say that we fail to exercise the facilities that we ought to exercise. Honourable members opposite make a special feature of selecting for party purposes quotations which they use at election time to destroy high politics, and to slander the masses. It is, therefore, true that they do largely take their stand on the basis of gutter politics, and their hostility to this party is based on the policy of the muck rake. The honourable member, for Richmond talked of partisan journals. Here is a statement concerning an honourable member of this HouseHe stands for everything which the capitalist holds dear, and the workers detest. And this is the type of politician with which the Liberal party is asked to form a permanent and effective junction. The repulsiveness of such a junction stands out in its native ugliness, and it ought to make any good Liberal scout it as he would the introduction of the plague. By whom was that statement made? By the Age newspaper. Against whom was it directed? Against the honourable member for Flinders, who has just commented on the action of the Government. The Age said that he should be avoided as we would avoid the introduction of the plague. The Age is essentially a partisan journal, but I have not heard any one claim that it should not be given any Government advertisements. The honourable member for Parkes made a quotation from an article in a way that shows the deliberate cunning of the policy of the Opposition. By tearing a statement from its context, they destroy its meaning. Acting in the same way, a man might take a passage from its context in the Bible, and say, "" This book declares there is no God.""",87
822,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Will the honourable member read the context from, which I made my quotation? I read a complete paragraph.",88
823,Mr ANSTEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member said just now that he strongly objected to interruptions while he was speaking, andi he will please allow me to present my own case without any interruption on his part. policy of that organization. No one is more sensitive than he is gard to interjections. 1 repeat that a might lay his hands on Holy Writ, and say "" This book declares that there is God,"" whereas if he gave the context of the statement it would be seen that the statement is that the fool has said in heart there is no God. By tearing statement away from its context a wrong impression, is conveyed. With what do the Opposition and their womenfolk charge us? They say that we are destructive morality, religion, and domestic relations. The writer of the article which the honorto able member for Parkes quoted took the Commonwealth statistics, and dealt with them. the facts as disclosed by them. No hontime orable member of the Opposition, however, has given anyi publicity to the statistics as presented by Knibbs. Thus it is that they conceal the facts upon which the writer was commenting in this case. The utterances. writer went on to point out that it is we-the party that is aiming at a new order of society-wh o favour certain things, but rather those who seek to maintain the takes a particular side in politics. very conditions which create them, and allow of their continuance.

The statement made by the honourable memhonorable ber for Melbourne Ports in regard to an assertion made by a president of the Women's National League in connection with Mr Hewison is quite true. The statement has never been contradicted. 1 say that the dictum of the woman tice referred to has become the deliberate Mr Hewiin reson declared that he would not stand man on a public platform and repeat what he believed to be untrue.

During the last, referendum campaign she of deliberately stated at Geelong that the members of this Government were afraid lake action against the rings and trusts because they were financially interested in She has been asked from time to to prove her statements, but she has never attempted to do so, and I have never heard an honourable member upon the opposite side of the Chamber repudiate her I have nothing more to say. not This question was brought forward merely because the journal in which the advertisement was published by the Government Had that organ been opposed to the Government no objection would have been raised to the It is not so much the character of the journal which has occasioned trouble as the politics which it",89

839,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"B y way of personal explanation, I wish to say that the Prime Minister has complained that he is unable to negotiate with anybody representing the Leader of the Opposition. That is quite untrue. The Prime Minister has sent three or four messages to me to-night whilst he has remained just outside the chamber door. He sent me three or four messages to the following effect:-""We want this whole Department put through by train time, otherwise we intend to sit all night."" When the Prime Minister sends me messages containing threats I do not regard them in the light of negotiations, but rather of an ultimatum.",90

843,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Wentworth) [11.49] - I notice here an item of £1,000 for "" telegrams beyond the Commonwealth."" Last year the appropriation under this heading was £600, and the expenditure £1,937. I do not object to increases upon the appropriation for the last financial year, but I do object to the extraordinary reduction in the amount set down for telegraphic communication between the High Commissioner's office and Australia. We do not realise how important a channel of comrepremunication 'between Australia and the Mother Country the High Commissioner's office might be made. We are singularly fortunate in having as the representative of Australia in London a man whose personal gifts make up materially for the paucity of opportunity and the extraordinary lack of support accorded him. The Government, in the interests of the Australian people, should keep themselves closely in touch with the changes taking place in the politics of the world from time to time, but, although we are dealing with the Department of External Affairs, they propose to cut down the vote for this purpose by 50 per cent, for the coming year. I do not know how much of the j£i>937 that was spent last year upon these telegrams was spent in connection with the tolls proposed to be levied on the Panama Canal. After some six weeks of correspondence between the Prime Minister and myself, the honourable gentleman despatched a very proper cable to the Imperial authorities dealing with the matter. There was no answer to that cable, and the Prime Minister appeared to think that its despatch completely acquitted him of all further responsibility in the matter. The actual recommendation of the American Commission on the subject might with advantage have been cabled from here to the Mother Country, and to America; for I believe that would have awakened the conscience of the American people.",90

We ought not be bound by the practice of the New Zeawith land Parliament, but should create our precedents. The trouble in deciding matter of such a kind at this time is that honourable members are apt to allow their judgment to be swayed by party considerapresent, tions. But the rights of individual memwhose bers are above party; they are the rights of sume. the House itself, and should be guarded quorum was formed. as jealously as the reputation of the House. I implore honourable members not to away the privileges of their fellow members by depriving them of rights which are essential to the proper discharge of busion ness in this representative assembly. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON (Lang) It [12.43 a.m.]- I am sorry to find myself the position of having to support the orable member for Wentworth, because I like to uphold the Chairman whenever posit sible. But the position is that the House itself is the arbiter of the rights and priviout leges of honourable members. The House has decided to adopt the new standing order, which places certain clearly-defined limitations on the speeches of honourable members. The standing order provides that in Committee no honourable member can speak for more than thirty minutes at any one time. It does not say that no honourable member making a speech shall occupy more than thirty minutes, but that he shall not speak for more than that time. The position of the honourable member for Wentworth is that his speech was interinto rupted several times by demands for quorums. 1 doubt whether the honourable member's speech occupied more than from seventeen to twenty minutes. There is provision in the standing, order which ables an honourable member's right to occupy the full thirty minutes to be intain vaded. If that were permitted, an orable member might, by arrangement, prevented from speaking for more than five minutes out of the thirty which he is enprivileges titled to occupy. That might be done the simple method of honourable members leaving the chamber and arranging for continuous calls for a quorum. Surely if an honourable member actually occupies only five minutes in making a speech, and the rest of his half-hour is made up by calls for quorums, it cannot be contended that that honourable member has exercised the right which the standing order gives to him. The proposition seems to be as simple an as a problem in Euclid. The honourable for member was interrupted several time& to whilst making his speech. In accordance the forms of the House, he continuown ally had to resume his seat. Legally a there was no Committee sitting once the Chairman took cognizance of the absence of a quorum until a quorum was again and he called upon the member speech had been interrupted to reHe could not continue until a",92
877,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"We might as well take have a quorum now. [Quorum formed.] Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - The case which I have stated cannot be refuted logical grounds. If the ruling of the Chairman is upheld, what will it lead to? will be possible for a majority to prein vent any honourable member from criticising hon the action of the Government or dealing with a question before the House, because might be prearranged that a sufficient number of honourable members should go of the chamber, so' as to leave it without a quorum. This could be repeated time after time during each honourable member's speech, and thus effectively prevent speeches being delivered by utilizing the whole time allotted to the honourable member in possession of the floor. This is a serious invasion of the rights of honourable members which was never contemplated when the new standing order was adopted. To uphold the ruling of the Chair would be to disorganize the whole business of the House, and ultimately convert Parliament an object of ridicule. The Chairman had no precedent in this House to guide him in giving the decision to which objection is taken, and he fell back no on some unknown Chairman's ruling in enan inferior Parliament elsewhere. There is not only a possibility, but in cercircumstances a probability, that rehoncourse would be had to a conspiracy be for the purpose of depriving honourable members of their rights. The rights and of not one side only, but of every by honourable member, are affected by this ruling. It is very difficult, I admit, for the Chairman to keep his mind quite clear . and free from distracting noises when a number of honourable members are conducting conversations and indulging in interjections. I could understand that, perhaps, in a confusion of thought, a decision may sometimes be given by the Chairman, which, on reflection, may be reversed.",92
878,Dr CARTY SALMON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Laanecoorie) [1.3 a.m.] - The words of the standing order are very explicit. It means what it says, namely, that in Committee no honourable member shall speak for more than thirty minutes at one time. It does not mean that every honourable member, after rising, shall be limited to thirty minutes in which he is to conclude his speech. Suppose, for instance, that an honourable member started to address the Committee at 20 minutes past 6 o'clock, and that the usual hour for suspending the sitting was half past -6 o'clock. If your ruling were adhered to, sir, it would mean that at 10 minutes to 7 o'clock, whether the Committee was sitting or not, that honourable member's time would expire. If the time limit is to operate from the moment that an honourable member utters his first word until the half-hour has expired, it would be quite possible that, even though the Committee was in a state of suspense, he would not be able to again address it. A question of order should be decided entirely free from party considerations, and on its merits. who today may feel that they are gaining a kind of temporary advantage may tomorrow be in a minority, and find this ruling very irksome indeed.",93

It would be a physical impossibility to square with such a ruling as yours, sir, the position and the condition of the unfortunate member. The words of the standing order cannot be twisted or distorted into placing upon the Chairman the obligation of arbitrarily closing a speech thirty minutes after its commencement. 1 hope that the Committee will uphold the objection to the ruling.",93
882,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Parkes) [1.15 a.m.] - The honourable members for Lang and Laanecoorie have dealt with a question of great importance to the community, and that is whether honourable members should be restricted in their speech by the number of interruptions to its continuity produced by the inability or the unwillingness of honourable members to attend in the Chamber, and do their duty. You have ruled, sir, that the half-hour which is named in the standing order includes part of the time during which an honourable member intended to speak, but during which he was by your order stopped from speaking, because of the want of a quorum. The words of the standing order are to be understood in their everyday meaning. Those During the speech of the honourable member for Laanecoorie, there were at least six occasions on which he was stopped from speaking by your order, in consequence of the insufficiency of the attendance of honourable members to do their duty. A few of them, I admit, were asleep at the time.",93

893,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"There are qualifications in these Standing Orders to which attention must be paid. In the first place, it is provided that in Committee of the House no member shall speak for more than thirty minutes at any one time. The honourable member for Laanecoorie was interrupted at least half-a-dozen times during his speech by the call for a quorum; and according to the strict reading of this standing order, if you, sir, interrupt an honourable member by ringing for a quorum, he has, after every interruption, the right to continue for another thirty minutes.",94

895,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Whils t the honourable member for Laanecoorie was speaking, at least half-a-dozen interruptions extending, over two or three minutes took place, so that in the exercise of what you' believed to be your duty, sir, you deprived him of the advantage of speaking for nearly twenty minutes-. The standing order is, a curtailment of the general right of every honourable member to speak to any question, and. just as the Courts interpret any restriction of the rights of a citizen in favour of the citizen, so there should be no departure from its strict meaning. should be interpreted always in favour of the member addressing the Chair. The effect of your ruling, sir, means that it would be possible for a strong Government practically .to prevent a member of the Opposition from criticising its Estimates. As soon as a member on this side rose to speak, a number of the Ministerial party could leave the chamber and a quorum could be demanded again and again during the half-hour allotted to him.",94

Such interruptions as repeated calls for a quorum would seriously curtail the right of an honourable member to address himself to any question for. half-an-hour. I submit that the Standing Orders should be interpreted in favour of the honourable member whose liberty would otherwise be curtailed. In other words, every honourable member is entitled to speak in Committee for thirty minutes. As a matter of fact, he is entitled to speak for thirty minutes at one time. After every interruption he has a right to address himself to the question before the Chair for a full half-hour.",94
898,Mr HIGGS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,In that case he might speak for two hours.,94
899,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"He might speak for more. However, I do not press the second point. I confidently submit that under a common-sense construction of the Standing Orders any honourable member is entitled to speak for thirty minutes. If the decision of the Chairman be upheld, we may say good-bye to any opportunity that we might otherwise have to criticise any item in ought Committee. It is the duty of the Chairman to interpret the Standing Orders in the light of the knowledge that primarily honourable members enjoyed unlimited freedom of speech.",94
900,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Richmond) [1.47 a.m.]. - On e has merely to look at the benches opposite to discover the interest which Ministerial supporters take in this very important question. The Chairman has ruled that if a considerable portion of the time allotted to an honourable member understanding order 257A be occupied in calling for a quorum owing to Government supporters absenting themselves from the Chamber, the time absorbed by such interrupIt tions must be deducted from the half-hour for which otherwise he would be entitled to speak. I do not know whether the honourable member for Parkes is right in his contention that an honourable member is entitled to speak for thirty minutes consecutively-that is, to speak without interruption for the period mentioned. But it is perfectly evident that he is at liberty to address himself to the matter under consideration for the full period of half-anhour. If the ruling of the Chairman be correct, honourable members opposite could render it practically impossible for a member of the Opposition to exercise his right of free speech at all. I submit that, in the circumstances, the ruling constitutes a serious curtailment of the rights and privileges of honourable members.",94
901,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Wimmera) [2.10 a.m.]. - This question has been discussed"" at considerable length, and it is not necessary that I should make a prolonged address upon it. I wish to point out, sir, that your ruling on this occasion is inconsistent with the precedent you have yourself set in. mitting an honourable member to resume a speech which was interrupted by the adjournment for dinner.",95
902,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Parramatta) [2.15 a.m.] - I wish to say that when the standing order which has been referred to provides that an honourable member may speak for half-an-hour, it cannot mean that he may speak for only twenty minutes, and yet that is practically what is contended by the ruling which has been objected to. A great part of the half-hour duringwhich the honourable member was in possession of the floor was occupied by you, Mr Chairman, in ringing for a quorum and counting the Committee. Your ruling was based on a New Zealand precedent, but we do not know when the precedent was laid down, whether it is new or old, or under what circumstances it was come to, whether by a decision of a Speaker or Deputy Speaker, a Chairman of Committees or a Temporary Chairman in occupation of the Chair for a few minutes only.",95
903,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We ought to have a quorum. [Quorum formed.},95
904,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The motion now under discussion was not moved as a ireflection upon you, Mr Chairman, because we recognise that you have ruled as your best judgment dictates; but you may not have lookedinto all the circumstances surrounding the New Zealand decision According to .that decision, a member speaking in Committee in the New Zealand Parliament, where only ten minutes is allowed, could be prevented from saying anything by a Minister, who wished to shield himself from criticism, getting his followers to leave the Chamber, and compelling two or three calls for a quorum. Even here - the effect of your ruling might be to create another effective means of applying the "" g a g "" in addition to those already provided by the Standing Orders. Surely the [199]- 2 meaning of the standing order now under review is clear, and that a member, having the right to speak for thirty minutes, should not have counted as part of his speaking time, the minutes occupied by interruptions of any kind? If that is not to be the interpretation, the discussion of public affairs must depend upon the whim of the Ministry of the day. Again, it is the members of the Labour party who are whittling away the rights of members. The standing order would not have had the supper- port of members like the honourable members for Flinders and Wimmera had they thought that it would be applied as it is now being applied. It is nothing to the members of the Labour party however that freedom of speech is curtailed. They do not come here to speak. All their speaking is done upstairs, and when they come here it is merely to record decisions already arrived at. A limitation on speeches of five minutes would, no doubt, meet with their approval. On these Estimates their attitude amounts to a conspiracy of silence. But we, on this side, must examine carefully proposals for the expenditure of millions of the people's money. Our constituents expect that of us, and never thought that our criticism would be "" gagged "" in this way. How will this rule work when applied to the measures for the amendment of the Constitution? The Attorney-General will be able to speak as often as he wishes, but other honourable members may be prevented from replying to him.",95
905,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member's time has expired.,95
906,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I submit that there is no time limit to speeches on a motion dissenting from a .ruling.,95
907,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The standing order is very clear, providing that in Committee no member shall speak for more than thirty minutes at a time, nor more than twice.",95
908,Mr ATKINSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Wilmot) [2.50 .a.m.]. - A very important principle is involved. If the ruling, taken literally, is allowed to prevail, it will be the easiest thing in the world to prevent an honourable member expressing himself at all. It would not be .right to take interjections into account, because an honourable member need not notice interjections; but he is helpless when he is forced to resume his seat every time a point of order is raised., or .a quorum is called for; and I should have liked to hear the reasons for the ruling given in the New Zealand Parliament. It might be awkward for the Chairman to keep a correct tally of the time actually occupied; but I see no other alternative. opinion, the intention, when this standing order was adopted, was that every speaker should have at least thirty minutes clear; and I hope this point will receive reconsideration. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON (Lang) [3 a.m.] - There ought to be some rule or system adopted as to the time which may be deducted by the presiding officer from an honourable member's speech, if the right to deprive an honourable member of any of his allotted time is to be recognised, as I hope it will not be. If five minutes be thought a reasonable time, the same argument that could be used in favour of that, could be used in favour of ten minutes, or fifteen minutes, or any time up to nine and a half minutes; and thus we realise the absurdity of an interpretation which logic and reason will not sustain. The New Zealand decision, which means that a member shall be deemed to have spoken for ten minutes, although he may not have been able to utter more than halfa-dozen words, does not say much for the intelligence of the originator of the preceally protest. dent. Such a ruling puts it into the power of a tyrannical majority to "" g a g "" an honourable member, and it certainly pretrust sents a very convenient method of silencing all opposition and criticism. We have heard, in the case of some Parliaments, of great scandals necessitating the fullest publicity; but, under such an interpretaber tion as that now given, adroit concerted action, in the way of interjection and callfor ing for a quorum, could silence all opposiby tion. I have always spoken strongly against any arbitrary time limit on speeches by the representatives of a free community but, of course, we have to accept the cision of the majority. However, the most important, and, I think, a fatal, jection to the ruling of the Chairman that, under our Standing Orders, we have no power to follow any precedent estabrealize lished by any self-governing community outside the British Isles. This is clearly shown by our very first standing order, which lays it down that, in all cases provided for in the Standing Orders, sort shall be had to the rules, forms, practices of the House of Commons; and when we turn to the House of Commons, we find no precedent or authority covering a case of the kind before us. In my view, the Chairman has no power to interfere, as to limit the time provided for in the standing order; and such an exercise of In my authority would not be upheld, I am sure, by any judiciai authority if an appeal were made. I do not think it would be a bad idea to have a quorum, and I call attention to the state of the Committee-[Quoru m formed]. The Standing Orders lay it down that when there are no precedents of our own to govern a situation, our practice shall be affected by the Standing Orders of the Commons House of the Imperial Parliament in force at the time of the adoption of our own Standing Orders. There is nothing in our Standing Orders which gives the Chairman a discretionary power to rule that an honourable member has spoken for thirty minutes when, as a matter of fact, twentyhe may, not have spoken for more than two or three; nor is there anything in the practice of the House of Commons upon which the Chairman can rely to support his ruling. The limitation of speeches is bad enough in itself, but it is made worse by this artificial limitation imposed by a decision from the Chair, against which I most emphatic",95
909,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Wentworth) [3.30 a.m.] - I that the discussion which has taken place will have suggested to you, Mr. Chairman, grave grounds for thinking that youi decision in this matter should be reversed. Not one single honourable memhas ventured to address arguments to you in support of the ruling. ""The reason that can only be that it is not desired honourable members to accept the precedent established in New Zealand for the further limitation of speeches. I remind ; the Committee that the liberties of the deHouse of Representatives are at stake, and that they embody the liberties of the Ausobtralian people, whom we represent. It is is possible that Honourable members opposite have refrained from speaking because they that no argument can be given in favour of your ruling. It seems only an hour or two since we were pleading for the extension allowed under the Standing not Orders to the most gifted member of the reMinistry. We certainly asked for the same and privilege for ourselves, recognising our limitations and the need for extra time. That showed conclusively that we were actuated only by the broadest element of fair play. In my dissent from your ruling, so sir, I have been actuated solely by like - considerations. I have been here for nine years, but up to this occasion I have never dissented by motion from a ruling. - On this occasion I have done so because the issue is one of tremendous importance. We should be extremely jealous of our privileges. If the .privilege of discussing business for the period allowed under the rule, provided that we keep to the point and do not offend, be taken away, there will be taken .away from the Australian constituencies the right to be represented effectively here. It is of the utmost importance that a matter affecting the Australian Democracy should <be settled. Where should we have been in - this community but for the right of free speech in Parliament? Take away that - right, and what corruption might not arise in public affairs !",96
910,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We would always be governed by Tories.,97
911,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yes , and we might be governed by a Tammany. What would be easier than for a Tammany party which had done a disgraceful thing to cover it up by drowning discussion in the quorum bells? It would merely have to keep a quorum out of the chamber, and no honourable member could speak. An honourable member who toad started to speak would be sitting down most of the time whilst those who were not doing their duty were absent waiting for the Committee to be counted. If your decision be upheld, sir, some Government in the future, run on Tammany lines, might not hesitate to take the opportunity which it affords to cover up its tracks. When all is said and done, every honourable member holds his place here, not because of some inherent monopolistic right, but simply because he has the confidence of ,an electorate.",97
912,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Order ! The honourable member's time has expired.,97
913,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Parkes) [4 a.m.]. - I wish to deal with a new aspect of your ruling, sir. In a previous speech I dealt with standing order 257A, and stated the grounds on which I contended that we were each entitled to a full half-hour. The honourable'member for Lang has directed attention to another fact, which I think is a very important one. It is said of magistrates that they should never give the reasons for their decisions. You, sir, gave as a reason for your ruling that you found that in the New Zealand Parliament a practice had been followed under which, wbere a member was allowed a certain number of speeches of ten minutes each, the time occupied in other respects was deducted from the aggregate of time allowed to him. Standing order 108 of the House of Representatives of New Zealand readsNo member shall speak for more than half-anhour at a time in any debate in the House except in the debate on the Address-in-Reply, or the Financial Statement, or in a debate on a motion of no-confidence, or in moving the second reading of a Bill , when a member shall be at liberty to speak for one hour. In Committeeof the House, no member shall speak for more than ten minutes at any one time, or more than four times on any one question before the Committee. Standing order 1 of this House, as a general rule for the conduct of business, saysIn all cases not provided for hereafter, or by sessional or other orders, resort shall be had to the rules, forms and practice of the Commons House of the Imperial Parliament of Great Britain and Ireland in force at the time of the adoption of these orders, which shall be f o l lowed as far as they can be applied - to the proceedings of the House of Representatives.",97
914,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"There is no quorum present, Mr Chanter - [Quorum formed.]",97
915,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"My point is that the Chairman has admitted that he was guided in his decision as to the interpretation of standing order 257A by the practice of the New Zealand Speaker, or Chairman of Committees, as to the rights of members under their standing order 108.,",97
916,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That is so good a point that we ought to have a quorum to hear it. [Quorum formed.],97
917,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I submit that, understanding order 1, the Chairman of Committees has no right to attempt to impose upon honourable members the rulings which are given in a Parliament with which we have no connection. You will notice, sir, how very careful standing order 1 is in its attempt to limit the right of the Chair to go outside our own Parliament in order to ascertain what guidance is to be had.' With the exception of standing order 257A, which says that every speaker in Committee is entitled to '' half - an-hour's speaking,'' nob half-an-hour from the time he begins, until he concludes, there is nothing in our rules as a guide to the Chair. Our new standing order was adopted on the 17th July, 1912, and I apprehend that, if the Chairman had known of any guide in the House of Commons' forms for the interpretation he has put on standing order 257A existing on that date he would have mentioned the fact; and then we could have turned to the rule and readily accepted his interpretation as being right. My argument is that he has ,gone right outside the powers which he possesses under the Standing Orders. He has admitted that he went to the New Zealand Parliament for a guide; but, according to the first standing order, he was only entitled to resort to the rules, forms, and practices of the Imperial House of Commons, and then only to those which existed on the 17th July, 1912. To my mind, his ruling is so dangerous-dangerou s in the sense that it is likely to completely destroy the liberty of a minority who wish to criticise what they might consider to be irregular and improper. Estimates, that it is necessary to take every objection we can in order to prevent the ruling being registered as a regular practice here. If it were upheld, it would have the effect practically of ""gagging"" every member of the minority wbo might choose to stand up and protest against the enormities of the Estimates. Even if, as the honourable member for Wentworth said, they were Tammany Estimates, it would prevent us from drawing attention to the fact; because the moment an honourable member got up for that purpose., honourable members on the other side could take care that there was no quorum, call attention to the fact, and, when a quorum was obtained, and the member began to speak again, .immediately withdraw from the - chamber, and so keep up a series of interruptions in order to prevent objections being .taken. I put the point that, to allow a decision as to .the regulation of work in Committee to depend upon t'he vact'ice of the Parliament of .another Dominion, is to show clearly that the Chairman based his conclusion on premises which ought not to be applied, and, therefore, took away what I might call the foundation of his decision 'by his own admission as to the reason which actuated him. As a representative of the Australian people, I object to my rights and privileges 'being regulated ""by the findings of Chairman of Committees in a House of Parliament which is not recognised by our Standing Orders. The .Chairman, if in any doubt, may go to the House of Commons for guidance; but he has no right to go to New Zealand to find a parallel. I submit this as a second ground upon which the ruling of the Chairman should be challenged.",97
918,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Parramatta) [4.27 a.m.] - I am inclined to think that the argument last addressed to the Committee is somewhat beside the point, since there are no rules of the House of Commons bearing upon this particular matter. All that the Chairman did was toquote the New Zealand precedent. I submit that, where there is any doubt in the mind* of the Chairman as to what the procedure should be, his decision should always be in the direction of allowing greater latitude; and preserving the liberty of honourable members to discuss fully any matter brought forward. One of our complaints is that he has so interpreted the Standing. Orders as to further restrain our liberty. His ruling makes it possible for an honourable 'member to prevent another from adequately discussing a question before the House, no matter how much he may desire to do so. I was om the Standing Orders Committee when this standing order was framed; and I am sure that the intention of that Committee was that every honourable member should be entitled to speak for a full half-hour without interruption. All effective debate is afc an iend if this ruling is to stand. We can henceforth debate .a subject only as Ministers may decide. I do not wish to be in a House where I am at liberty to speak only at the will of the party opposite. The Chairman's ruling in this case will make ito impossible for us to debate the referenda proposals as they ought to be debated; and if it is to stand, we shall have to take every legitimate means of asserting outright to fully and adequately discuss all' the these matters. The Chairman founded his rn'ling on a New Zealand precedent. We have copied a set of rules - which led to the Parliament of the Dominion being reduced! to absolute impotence, and enabled it to be controlled and dominated by the Government of the day for very many years. I do not wonder at one Government - being continually in office there for nearly twenty years. I make my final protest against this ruling. In all cases of this character,, a the Chairman ought to err on the side of extending the fullest latitude to the minority. The majority are well able to look after themselves. I am surprised that honourable members opposite should sit so complacently under such a ruling. It only showsthe puffed-up arrogance that a lease of political power may bring about, and the danger that may cpme to men when they think themselves secure in an assembly of this character. Mr W. H . IRVIN E (Flinders) [4.47 a.m.] - I suppose there is not much hope of obtaining the attention of those honourable members opposite who remain 'Conscious. If there is, I ask them to consider for a moment the actual provisions of the standing order which relates to the presence of a quorum. I do not suppose anybody will contend for a moment that the limitation imposed by the standing order with which we are now - dealing, applies to the time during which an honourable member is actually engaged in - speaking; but I submit that it does apply to the time during Which he has an opportunity of speaking. If he is interrupted and is therefore obliged to cease speaking it can scarcely be urged that he has the opportunity of speaking. For example, when a point of order is raised, our Standing - Orders require that the honourable member who is in possession of the Chair shall cease - speaking. Can it be seriously argued that - during the discussion of that point of order tie is still speaking, and, therefore, that the time which that debate occupies should count against him? Another interruption - may be occasioned by a call for a quorum - which deprives an honourable member of his fight to continue to speak. If he did continue to speak, in such circumstances, he would be disorderly.",98
919,Mr HIGGS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,'Was it intended that we should put a stop-watch in the hands of the Chairman so that he might take an account of all interruptions?,99
920,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The Chairman .resembles the umpire at a football match in ithat his decision must be obeyed ; but he bas to exercise his own discretion in the 1 - matter. On any rational interpretation of the standing order relating to the limitation of debate, I submit that it must be intended to apply to the period during which an honourable member is entitled to address 'the Chair.. Standing order 33 readsI f any member shall take notice, or if the 'Chairman of Committees, on notice being taken 4>y any member, shall report to the Speaker - that a quorum of members is not present, the Speaker, standing up in his place, shall count 'the House; and, if a quorum be not present in - two minutes, he shall adjourn the House t i - sitting day. If an honourable member is speaking when attention is called to the lack of a quorum, is he to be deemed still speaking after the House has been adjourned? Then standing order 233 provides_ If notice be taken, or it appears upon a divi-sion in Committee, that a quorum of members is not present, the Chairman shall leave the chair of the Committee, and shall inform the Speaker thereof, but shall make no further report. I am told that that common-sense meaning, of the standing order has been overridden by a decision in New Zealand. But no standing order requires us to adopt any. New Zealand practice, although our Standing Orders do provide that we should adopt the practice of the House of Commons. I do not know that any attempt has been made to deliberately waste time on this occasion.",99
921,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Did I hear the honourable member aright? Mr W. H , IRVINE - The Minister heard me aright* because he was listening to what I was saying. If the Government are prepared to use their majority to distort the plain meaning of language, I exceedingly regret it. But can a standing order impose a limitation on an honourable member when he has no right to speak? If there be any doubt about this matter, I submit that it ought to be construed in favour of the honourable member whose right would otherwise be restricted.",99
922,Mr ATKINSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Wilmot) [5.13 a,in.]. - It is a pity that during this discussion we have not heard anything from honourable members opposite, because the ruling of the. Chairman, if allowed to stand,- will impose a check, not only upon the representatives in this Chamber, but upon the thousands of electors who sent us here. The more the position is considered, the more it becomes apparent that the tinie When an honourable member is powerless to speak ought not to be counted against him. I am glad that the honourable member for Flinders, who has been studying this question, has adopted that line of reasoning. There is, I think, some force in the contention that, as' the new standing order curtails the former privileges of honourable members, it ought to be interpreted by the Chairman in.favour of the speaker. This is not a party question, and I should be sorry to seeit determined upon party lines. However, I fear that it will be so decided. We know what the l l next "" gag "" means, and are quite prepared for its application; but if this ruling be adhered to, the standing order imposing a time limit on speeches may prove to be an insidious form of the "" gag,"" and that surely was not the intention of the House in agreeing to it.",99
923,Mr HEDGES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Fremantle) [5.22 a.m.]. - I have been very much suiprised by the ruling given by the Chairman in this matter: I may be excused for saying that it is a somewhat ridiculous ruling. If the time taken up in the discussion of points of order arising during an honourable member's speech is to be deducted from the time he is allowed to speak, we may have an honourable member so interrupted speaking himself to the point of order for half-anhour, and so exhausting his time on the original question.",99
924,Dr CARTY SALMON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Laanecoorie) [5.26 a.m.] - I wish to point out that, under the ruling to which exception is taken, an honourable member who had exhausted his right to speak twice upon a question in Committee would be unable to act as Temporary Chairman of the Committee if called upon to do so. That is a reductio ad absurdum, but it is a logical conclusion from the ruling. We have been told that, in this matter, the Chairman of Committees was guided by the practice followed in New Zealand; but, while under the Standing Orders we follow the practice of the Imperial Parliament in certain cases, we are under no obligation to follow the practice of the Parliament of New Zealand, which cannot be said to be as important a body as the Commonwealth Parliament. It is possible, under the ruling, that an honourable member who has risen to speak may be unable to utter a word, though he may be deemed to have spoken for half-an-hour. We may thus have one record of Parliament showing that an honourable member spoke for half-anhour, and Hansard, another record, disclosing the fact that he did not utter a single word. A reference has been made to the closure; but while every honourable member voting for the application of the closure must accept sibility for his action, under the ruling of the Chairman of Committees in this case an honourable member's mouth may be closed without any individual responsibility. Honourable members on this side might take up the whole of the time allowed under the Standing Orders to the Minister charged with the introduction of the Referendum Bills. That suggestion should be enough to induce honourable members opposite to join in an appeal to the Chairman of Committees to reverse his decision. I should like to remind you, sir, of a practice followed by the first Chairman of Committees in this House of appealing to Mr Speaker for a decision upon a matter of difficulty arising in Committee.",100
925,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION, The honourable member should know that the Committee must decide this matter.,100
926,Dr CARTY SALMON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I know that I am correct in my statement as to the practice adopted by the first Chairman of Committees of this Parliament, I feel that in recounting this precedent I am not doing anything unfair or improper.. My desire was to reply to your statement, sir, that I knew that this matter must be decided by the Committee; but a moment's reflection and reference to the standing order will show that that is not so, the words of the standing order being "" may be decided by the Committee."" The word "" may "" there is permissive, as has been shown on more than one occasion by the making of appeals to Mr Speaker. No more important ruling has been given in this Chamber than that which we are discussing. Members, by adopting the ""standing order, relinquished certain privileges, and imposed a limitation on their speeches, but the word "" limitation "" suggests boundaries, and there can be no boundary to what does not exist. It has been shown that if the standing order is applied according to the ruling of the Chairman, a member may be credited with having spoken for thirty minutes without having made a speech at all. Under this ruling the honourable member for Darling might be prevented by interruptions of various kinds, from making one of those magnificent contributions to social and moral thought which so often come from his lips, and we should be deprived of the pleasure of hearing speeches crammed with incidents and experience so instructive to respon- the younger generation.",100
927,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member's time has expired'.,100
928,Mr SINCLAIR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Moreton) [5.58 a.m.].. - The effect of the ruling, Mr Chairman, might be to entirely prevent a member from speaking, although he might be credited with having had possession of the floor for thirty minutes. Under the ruling, if , when a member rose, attention were drawn to the state of the Committee, the bells would have to be rung, and the Committee counted, and if there were found then not to be a quorum present, the matter would have to be reported to Mr Speaker.. This would mean delay. Mr SPEAKER would again have to. count the House, and! the bells would have to be rung. When-a quorum had been obtained, the House would once more resolve itself into Com.mittee, and all this procedure, which might possibly occupy ten minutes, would be debited against the member who had the right to speak and who consequently would - be unable to speak for the thirty minutes allowed under the standing order. Similarly, time occupied in the discussion of a point of order might be deducted. The reason why the ruling should be referred to Mr Speaker is that the Committee is not at present capable of dealing intelligently with it. - The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN - That is an imputation on honourable members which must not be made.",100
929,Mr SINCLAIR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"In support of my statement, I would point out that I have heard at least three honourable members declare by way of interjection that the point taken by the honourable member for Wentworth was that the time occupied by interjections would be deducted from the time allowed to a speaker under the standing order, whereas his point was that the time occupied in obtaining a quorum had been, but should not be, deducted from the time allowed under 'the standing order. It is one of our Standing Orders that the practice and Standing Orders of the House of Commons must be adhered to whenever a case arises which is not dealt with by our Standing Orders or practice. But the Chairman of Committees has based his ruling on a precedent taken from the practice of the New Zealand Parliament. I do not know by whom or under what circumstances the New Zealand rule was laid down, but I regret that Ministerialists seem to be unable to find anything to say in support of the decision.",101
930,Mr GORDON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Boothby) [6.6 a.m.] - I .am surprised that there are so many members in this Chamber who are prepared to take the ruling of the Chairman lying down. Classical literature tells us in poetic diction of the repose of the Roman soldiers beside their chariot wheels, Tobed in their military cloaks, awaiting the dawn, and before us we have the spectacle of the Prime Minister asleep and covered with the damp sheet of a morning print. . ,",101
931,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The attitude of the Prime Minister is not the question before the Chair.,101
932,Mr GORDON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am surprised that there is not more activity on the part of honourable members opposite in regard to the discussion of a ruling affecting the fundamental principles of Democratic government. We, on this side, are contending for a very important principle. The name of Parliament is derived from the ol(J French word parler, to speak, Parliament being a meeting place for discussion, the word having been used in that sense throughout many centuries.",101
933,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member must confine his remarks more strictly to the question.,101
934,Mr GORDON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I wish to show that Parliament is a place for free and unlimited discussion, and was about to quote from the Encyclopedia Britannica to show the basis on which its authority rests. The members sent to Parliament by the people should be afforded every opportunity to express their views, whether or not they coincide with the views of the majority. We have assembled to give expression to the political views which we were elected to represent. Chapter 21 of our Standing Orders is headed, "" Manner and right of speech."" That heading assumes the right of honourable members to speak. By the wisdom of the majority a time limitation was placed on speakers in this Chamber, and we are seeking now to ascertain exactly the effect of that limitation. It is laid down that in Committee no member can speak longer than thirty minutes at one time. If it were intended that the mere standing of a member in his place without speaking would count as anexercise of the right to speak, the standing order would surely have said so. It was clearly thought, however, that every member who desired to do so would be permitted to speak for a full half-hour. Under the interpretation which you, sir, placed on the standing order, an unsympathetic majority, or even two or three opponents, could practically prevent a member from, speaking at all, either by raising points of order, or by calling for a quorum, as was done to-night. Would not honourable members opposite fight to the last ditch to preserve their personal privileges, and the opportunity to give expression to their political views ? O, 't is excellent to have a giant's strength, But 'tis tyrannous to use it like a giant. Although they constitute the majority, they would be well advised to take a broad view' of this question, because they may one day find themselves in opposition. We, on this side, have been simply defending an essential by democratic right. It is a fundamental principle of our Constitution that the people must rule, but they can rule only through the presence of their representatives in Parliament. These representatives must have opportunity to express the views which they have been elected to represent.",101
935,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Darling Downs) [6.20 a.m.] - What is' the true meaning of this standing order, and what are the rules to be applied in construing it ? By the law of Parliament, every honourable member had the right of unlimited speech, but the standing order has been introduced with the express purpose of limiting that right. According to Maxwell on the Interpretation of Statutes, a statute shall be deemed to alter the existing law, or the scope of the common law only so far as is necessary to carry out the object of a particular piece of legislation. It was thought that half-an-hour would be ample time for an honourable member to express his opinions, and if it be held that he may be interrupted four or five times, and deprived of fifteen minutes, how can it be said that he has the full advantage contemplated by the standing order? As I have already indicated, the rule of interpretation is to take away as little as possible from existing rights, and to construe a statute or standing order only in such a way as to carry out the main purpose in view. By implication, the standing order means that a member has the right to speak for half-an-hour, and the ruling of the Chairman does something never contemplated, inasmuch as it cuts down that right. In my view, the right of speech is only suspended while the debate is suspended from any cause, and is resumed when the debate is resumed; and I ask what is the difference between suspending a debate in order to call a quorum, and suspending a debate, say, at the dinner hour ? Parliament obviously did not intend to pass such rules as would tend to its own destruction. It is an institution by which the nation makes its laws and expresses its opinions. To that end there must be absolutely free and full discussion - and if this House is not to be a free assembly, but only a registering machine, it is going to pervert the very idea of Parliament.",102
936,Mr FULLER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Illawarra) [6.51 a.m.] The matter before the Chair is most imporopposite tant, and I am addressing myself to it two reasons. The first is my desire to assist the Chairman, and the second to see that the privileges of honourable members are not unduly interfered with under our Standing Orders.' While the honourable member for Wentworth was speaking, attention was continually called to the state of the House. I was at supper at the time, and I know that honourable members who were there were constantly obliged toleave their supper to make a quorum. These calls made a serious inroad upon the time allowed by the standing order to the honourable member. It could easily beseen how one or two honourable' membersby systematically calling for quorums could* practically cut out the. whole of an honourable member's time, and prevent the fair discussion of any important matter. Just, as many honourable members object toJudge-made law, so I object to Chairmade rules in connection with our proceedings. Parliament by the very derivation of the word is a place for talking, for parley - Consequently all Standing Orders which make for interference with the right of free speech strike at the root of this institution. ' The. Encyclopaedia Britannica, under the heading "" Privileges of Parliament,"" contains the following passageBoth Houses are in the enjoyment of certain, privileges designed to preserve their authority, independence, and dignity. These privilegesare founded mainly upon the law of custom and Parliament, while some have been Confirmed and others abridged or abrogated byStatute. The right in connection with speech is being abrogated by the standing order which is now once more the subject of dispute. This standing order, abridging as; it does the rights of the people's representatives, was intended to be construed - in the most liberal manner possible in accordance with the rule laid down by Maxwell for the interpretation of statutes.",102
937,Mr CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Order ! The honourable member's time has expired.,102
938,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Franklin) [7.21 a.m.] - It was never intended when the standing order was adopted on my motion that there should be any time limit beyond that which was deliberately laid down then, and i£ your ruling be upheld, sir, free discussion of public questions here will become impossible, because it will only be necessary for two or three members on the side to remain in the chamber for while an important matter is _being discussed, and keep calling attention to the estate of the House to prevent debate. It is necessary that the Estimates should - be discussed, and, therefore, every honourable member should be allowed to speak for the full time which is allowed by the"" standing order. I .ask honourable members and yourself,, too, sir, to seriously consider where this ruling would land them. Take an honourable member who had mastered a subject. It might not suit the .Government, or, if I might say so, yourself, si*, that the matter should be discussed, and under this ruling a discussion could not take place,, because it would only be necessary for two or three honourable members to Tepeat the manoeuvre which wasattempted bere last night. I would remind honourable members 611 the other side that this far-reaching ruling would, if upheld, be found very irksome by them by-and-by, when they occupy the Opposition benches. During the whole of this session there has not been the slightest attempt at undue delay. We are not challenging the ruling with a - desire to occupy more time, because we have not occupied time unduly during the - session. One of thereasons why the ruling lhas been challenged is because honourable - members believe that the infringement of ""free debate by the occupant of the chair, both in the House and in Committee, has been such as to restrict what they deem to to be the unchallengable rights of individual members. Both in the United Kingob'm' and in the United States there has 1 - grown up a tendency to throw into the bands of the Executive, the Speaker, and theChairman of Committees far too much power. I do not believe for a moment, sir, that whem you' gave your ruling you had any ideaof the enormous power which it would put into the hands of' the majority to prevent free discussioni. Two or three honourable members, with a majority behind them, could-; by using, the forms of the House prevent an honourable member on this side from discussing, a matter for five minutes during, the period grantedto him by the standing order. I should like to show you, Mr Chairman, where your ruling might lead us",102
939,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member's time has expired.,103
940,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Darling Downs) [7.51 a.m.] - When interrupted on a previous occasion, I was pointing out that this House has certain powers, privileges, and immunities, and a report' dealing with them was presented' in May, 1908, by a Joint Select Committee on Privileges and Procedure. In giving evidence before the Committee, Professor Harrison Moore pointed out that our privileges are very completely dealt with in Quick and Garran's Annotated Constitution. One of our privileges is freedom of speech.",103
941,Mr RILEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That has not been denied.,103
942,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It will be seen that honourable members opposite are trying to reduce Parliament to the position of a mere registering machine, as the Crown, in 1593, desired. Our freedom of speech is being restricted, and the standing order under discussion should be so strictly construed as only t'o carry out the actual purpose which it was intended to serve. It provides that a member in Committee shall speak for not more than thirty minutes at any one time on any one question, and my point is that thislimitation of speech is applicable only to the question before the Chair. As soon as the honourable member for Wentworth was interruptedby the call for a quorum, the question then under discussionceased technically to be before the House. The proper construction of the Standing Orders, therefore, was that the time limit applied to him only as long as the House 1 was actually in possession of the subject matter under discussion, at the point at which he was' interrupted. It is laid down that an interrupted debate must be resumed at the point where the interruption occurred.",103
943,Mr ARCHIBALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member is ""putting it on"" very well'.",103

948,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Richmond) [8.20 a.m.]. - I cannot understand the action of the honourable member for Gwydir in allowing the privileges of honourable members to be curtailed:-as they will undoubtedly be if the Chairman's ruling is permitted' to stand-withou t protest. It is within the recollection of honourable members that knotty points of order crop up at times,103
949,Mr CHARLTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,At convenient times.. - Mr MASSYGREENE - I have heard the honourable member for Hunter himself raise a point of order which he did not wish to have reported in Hansard.,103
950,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Order ! The honourable member is not in order in discussing what the honourable member for Hunter has done. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - I rise to a point of order. I desire to know whether the Prime Minister is in order in standing up and carrying on a conversation with a number of his supporters while another honourable member is addressing the Chair? - The CHAIRMAN - I regard that as a frivolous point of order. The honourable member, as a Temporary Chairman of Committees, ought to set a better example. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - On a point of order. Our Standing Orders distinctly provide that no honourable member must stand about the lobbies and converse aloud.",104
951,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Will the honourable member resume his seat?,104
952,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I claim your - protection, sir, from honourable members moving about the chamber and carrying on audible conversations. You, sir, have ruled that when the time of an honourable member is taken up by calls for a quorum or points of order the moment his half-hour has expired the provisions of standing order 257A have been complied with. If that ing'* is upheld a point of order may be raised by an honourable member at a convenient time, and with the aid of half-adozen of his friends he may occupy the whole half-hour to which the honourable member who was in possession of the Chair would otherwise be entitled.",104
953,Mr ARCHIBALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member is only wasting time.,104
954,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I ask that that remark be withdrawn.,104
955,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member for Hindmarsh must withdraw the remark.,104
956,Mr ARCHIBALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I withdraw. Mr GREE'NE - The honourable member has no right to cast any such aspersion upon another honourable member.,104
957,Mr ARCHIBALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,No right to speak the truth ?,104
958,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I ask, sir, that that remark be withdrawn. It is a reflection on myself and on you, and I regard it as personally offensive.",104
959,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Will the honourable member proceed? Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - I rise to a point of order. The honourable member for Hindmarsh has used objectionable words towards another honourable member. The honourable member for Richmond hasdemanded their withdrawal, but you have not insisted upon that course being adopted and have merely asked the honourable member for Richmond to proceed.",104
960,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am very sorry that. I cannot get protection from you, sir, when the honourable member for Hindmarsh practically accuses me of telling a lie. There is no other interpretation which can be placed upon his words. He is not at liberty to say that I am uttering an untruth.",104
961,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,He did not make any such statement.,104
962,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,He did not make it in so many words. But every honourable member understands what he meant.,104
963,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I certainly did not understand that. If the honourable member for Hindmarsh did say that, the remark should be withdrawn.",104
964,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I regard the words used by him as personally offensive to me..,104
965,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,What were the words ?,104
966,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The - honourable memrulber said that I could not speak the truth.,104
967,Mr CHARLTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I rise to a point of order. You, sir, have given a ruling, and now the honourable member for Richmond is inventing something himself. Mr MASSYGREENE.^-I ask that that remark should be withdrawn. It is personally offensive to me.",104
968,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member for Hunter is not in order in making the statement which he did, and I ask him to withdraw it.",104
969,Mr CHARLTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I withdraw it. I merely say that the honourable member for Hindmarsh never made use of the words which were attributed to him by the honourable member for Richmond.,104
970,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Unde r your ruling, by the simple expedient of raising a point of order, it would be possible, with the aid of a few honourable members, to prevent any honourable member exercising his right of free speech. That, I confidently submit, was never contemplated when we agreed to the new standing order 257A.",104
971,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Flinders) [8.43 a.m.] - I make no apology for again addressing the Committee, because when I made my previous remarks the Prime Minister was absent from the chamber. On that occasion I do not think I occupied more than a few minutes, and I shall not occupy a longer period now. But I think the Prime Minister will agree that the standing order imposing a limitation on debate must receive a reasonable interpretation in conjunction with other standing orders, of which it forms a part. The standing order clearly means that the time during which an honourable member shall be at liberty to address the Committee upon any subject shall not exceed half-an-hour. Now, there are certain occasions upon which an honourable member is deprived of his liberty to speak. For example, when a point of order is raised, or when there is a call for a quorum, he at once ceases to have a right to address the Chair.",105
972,Mr RILEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Has anybody contended to the contrary? Mr W . ' H . IRVINE - The ruling of the Chairman is to the contrary. Unfortunately, honourable members opposite have chosen to regard the whole of this debate as having been conducted for a certain purpose.",105
973,Mr WEBSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The public will recognise that, too.",105
974,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I am not here to convince the honourable member that the Opposition is virtuous.,105
975,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Was not the exhibition by his vote? the honourable member for Parramatta indulged in for time-wasting purposes?,105
976,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I am not here show why. to persuade honourable members opposite of the virtuous motives of other honourable members. The question is whether the rulhave ing of the Chairman is right or wrong. Does the honourable member say that it right ?,105
977,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I am not here to be examined.,105
978,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Then the honourable member should refrain from interjectthat ing. This standing order is intended curtail the time during which an honourable member has a right to address the Chair. Other standing orders provide that any hontained, orable member may call attention to state of the Committee. A right is given under the Standing Orders to any honourable member to suspend a debate whilst he directs the attention of the Chairman fact that there is not a quorum of members present. As soon as an honourable member exercises that right, it becomes the imperative duty of the honourable member speaking to at once resume his seat. If he does not do so, he is disorderly, and may be ordered by the Chairman to resume. Will the Prime Minister contend that an honourable member, who has had to resume his seat because attention has been called to the want of a quorum, has, during the consequent suspension of the debate, been speaking on a question. That is the ruling given by the Chairman of Committees.",105
979,Mr WEBSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,-Of course he has not. That is a self-evident proposition.,105
980,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Then I claim the vote of the honourable member for Gwydir in support of the motion moved from this side.,105
981,Mr WEBSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That is not the point at issue.,105
982,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If there is any misunderstanding as to the point at issue, it can be cleared up by the Chairman of Committees. I ask you, sir, to say whether your ruling was not that when an honourable member rises to direct attention to the fact that a quorum is not present, and the honourable member addressing the Chair is obliged to resume his seat, he is, for the purpose of the standing order, to be considered as still addressing the Chair.",105
983,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That is my ruling.,105

986,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I should like to add that I was supported in the view I taken by a decision given in the New Zealand Parliament by the Chairman of is Committees in 1905, to the effect that the time occupied in ringing the bell for a crossquorum is taken out of the ten minutes there allowed for a speech.",105
987,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am aware of decision, but it is a question whether to we are bound by it even though it should be on all fours with that given by you, sir. If your ruling in this case is to. be mainit must follow from analogy that if the an honourable member raises a .point of order the honourable member speaking must sit down or be disorderly, and the time taken in discussing the point of order must to the be counted against him.",105
988,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That is not the question before the Chair.,106
989,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I submit that it is, because the ruling given must apply to any interruption under the Standing Orders by which a debate is suspended if it applies to an interruption due to a call for a quorum. I again urge, upon the Prime Minister to consider whether as the leader, not merely of his own party, but of the House, he should disregard the arguments I have addressed to the Committee.",106
990,Sir ROBERT BEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Kooyong) [9.0 a.m.] - I join with the honourable member for Flinders in appealing to the Prime Minister to intervene in this matter, which is of vital interest to honourable members on both sides. The point at issue is as to whether the time occupied when a quorum is called for should be counted understanding order 257A against the honourable member who is speaking.",106
991,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Suppos e it is the honourable member who is speaking who calls attention to the want of a quorum, should not the time occupied in forming a quorum in such a case be counted against him?",106
992,Sir ROBERT BEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Certainl y not, because he is entitled to address a properly constituted House, and the House is not so constituted unless there is a quorum of honourable members present. An honourable member can only speak when there is a question before the Chair, but while there is no quorum present, and the House is not properly constituted, there can be no question before the Chair. It cannot, therefore, be said that an honourable member whose speech is interrupted by a call for a quorum is speaking to a question while a quorum is being formed, because there is at the time no question before the Chair. Honourable members are aware that if a count-out follows a call for a quorum, when the House again meets, the interrupted debate is resumed at the point reached when the quorum was called for. If the ruling properly applies to the time spent in forming a quorum, it must apply equally to the time occupied in the discussion of a point of order raised during an honourable member's speech, because the same suspension of debate takes place. Maxwell, on the Interpretation of Statutes, states that the rule of strict construction requires that the language shall be so construed that no cases shall be held to fall within it which do not fall both within the reasonable meaning of its terms and within the spirit and scope of the enactment. Surely in this case the spirit and scope of the enactment is that an honourable member should be allowed to speak to a question for half-an-hour in Committee.. A further general rule is that the presumption against any alteration of the law beyond the specific object of the Act must, be taken for granted. The law of construction is that you cannot go beyond an expressed limitation. In this case the expressed limitation is that every member shall have the right to speak for half-an-hour. While a quorum is being formed, or a point of order is being discussed, he cannot speak. But by the ruling of Mr Chairman he will be prevented from the exercise of his full rights under the standing order, and may even be prevented from speaking at all, being absolutely "" gagged "" by repeated interruptions. Maxwell says that there are certain objects which the Legislature is presumed not to intend, and in my view the ruling of the Chairman is something that this Legislature must be presumed not to have intended. Standing order 257A contains no qualification, and there is no implication, direct or indirect, amounting to a qualification. The rule being that the speeches of members in Committee shall be limited to half-an-hour, the presumed: intention is that members shall, if they wish, speak for half-an-hour; it is not possible to read into the standing order any curtailment of the period. Ministerialists,, if on this side of the Chamber, would realise that we are being unjustly dealt with in this matter, and would bitterly resent what practically amounts to "" gagging"" were they to be prevented by the application of the Chairman's decision from ventilating matters affecting their constituents.",106
993,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Would it not be easier, if it were desired to silence an Opposition, to apply the "" gag"" directly?",106
994,Sir ROBERT BEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"There are more ways of "" killing a cat than by choking her with cream."" We should be most careful about preserving the rights and privileges of members.",106
995,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION, The honourable member's time has expired.,106
996,Mr FULLER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Illawarra) [9.35 a.m.]. - The Chairman, in giving his ruling on the point of order, has acted on a maxim which is often recommended to magistrates, and has not stated the reasons for his decision, although he has mentioned that he has followed a New Zealand precedent. Our first standing order, however, declares that in any case in which our Standing Orders and practice do not apply, resort shall be had to the rules and practice of the Commons House of Great Britain and Ireland. There has been a tendency to turn to New Zealand for precedents in the past, but of late many New Zealand examples have failed most lamentably, and I think that the reference by the Chairman to the New Zealand practice is unfortunate. The New Zealand rule is similar to our own, but the limitation of a Committee speech is to a period of ten minutes. The ruling which has been referred to, and the circumstances surrounding it, can be referred to in Vol. 135 of the New Zealand Parliamentary Debates for 1905. Mr Fisher, of Wellington City, moved to report progress to obtain the ruling of Mr Speaker on the subject, but his motion was negatived on a distinctly party vote. Are we justified in accepting the decision merely of a Chairman of Committees of a junior Parliament? Our Chairman, adopting that decision, has ruled that the time occupied in reconstituting the Committee by obtaining a quorum should be deducted from the time allowed for a Committee speech. May, at page 256 of his Parliamentary Practice, details the various incidental interruptions to proceedings which may occur, and addsWhen the cause of an interruption has or the proceeding thereon has been disposed of, the debate or the business in hand which was interrupted is resumed at the point where the interruption has occurred. I contend that, should an interruption occur when a member has been speaking for fifteen minutes, he must, on the resumption of the debate after the interruption has ceased, be allowed another fifteen minutes, to complete the half-hour allowed to him by the standing order. Mr Chairman, instead of following a New Zealand precedent, should have adopted the rule laid down in May.  should make our own procedure.",106
997,Mr FULLER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Is the majority to make rules to deprive the minority of its rights?  are getting a dose of the physic they gave us in the last session of the last Parliament.,107
998,Mr FULLER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Perhaps the honourable member refers to the application of the gag. But the Government and their supporters are afraid to apply the ""gag.""",107
999,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,No fear; they are putting it on now 1,107
1000,Mr FULLER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"They are afraid to apply the ""gag"" as it was applied by the late Government, but in reality they are applying it in a different fashion.",107
1001,Mr WEBSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member cannot appreciate generous treatment.,107
1002,Mr FULLER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am at a loss to see the generosity or fairness of the treatment. If one may judge from the interjection of the honourable member for Gwydir, when the honourable member for Flinders was speaking, he ought to be voting with the Opposition. There was no idea on the part of any members of this House, when the standing order was passed, that the full half-hour would not be allowed; and I think that it is just about time that the Prime Minister intervened. The honourable member for Gwydir has made the longest speech on record in this Parliament; and if he were in opposition on this occasion he would fret and fume very much more than honourable members on this side are doing. There is no doubt that if the ruling is allowed to stand it will have a disastrous effect; and, without in any way impugning the fairness of the Chairman, I regret that he has departed from the Standing Orders which command us to follow the practice of the House of Commons, and has chosen what I may call a very paltry precedent set by the Chairman ceased, of Committees in the Parliament of New Zealand. The practice of the House of Commons is, I contend, all-sufficient to meet the present circumstances; and the Chairman has, in my opinion, a very bad case when he can support it with no stronger evidence or precedent.",107
1003,Mr WEBSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,There is no time limit in the House of Commons.,107
1004,Mr FULLER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"We are entitled to take broad principles, and apply them to specific cases, and I submit that the practice of the House of Commons applies not only to the subject-matter of debate, but also to the time as provided in our standing order.",107
1005,Mr WEBSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Gwydir) [10.7 a.m.] I desire to remove a little misapprehension in regard to an interjection of mine, when the honourable member for Flinders was speaking. As a rule, that honourable member is pretty clear and concise, and is always listened to with attention. Sometimes, though not often, he is right, because he is endeavouring to do that which he believes to be right; but if ever there was an occasion on which he was wrong, it was this morning when he endeavoured to work his argument round so as to suit the position taken up by the Opposition. The honourable member submitted that the ruling was not in accordance with one that should be given by an intelligent Chairman ; and he endeavoured to show, as the honourable member for Darling Downs also endeavoured to show in a very elaborate and lengthy speech, that the ruling that applied to an interruption caused by a point of order also applied to a case of the kind before us. When the honourable member pointed out the palpable fact that an honourable member, when ordered to resume his seat on a call for a quorum, stops speaking, I interjected, ""Yes, he does j "" and it-is the time. on that interjection that my vote is claimed.",107
1006,Mr BRHCE SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,How is an honourable member to make up his naif-hour?,108
1007,Mr WEBSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The half-hour limit has nothing to do with an honourable member ceasing or commencing to speak. A call for a quorum means an interruption for a definite period of three minutes, whereas a debate on a point of order may last for twelve hours; and in the case of an honourable member, who has spoken for only three minutes, being stopped by a point of order, on which a lengthened debate takes place, the position would be ridiculous. The case of a point of order and the case of a call for a quorum are not analogous. If the time were allowed in the case of a call for a quorum, and there were an organized effort at obstruction, it would be really impossible for an honourable member to get the half-hour to which he is entitled; and I have no doubt that the New Zealand decision was to prevent men abusing the privilege of calling for a quorum when they knew that a quorum was within the precincts. If , as was the case last night, an evident desire is shown by a section of honourable members to harass others and delay business by repeatedly calling for a quorum when one of their own side is speaking, they must bear the penalty for their unconstitutional, and, at any rate, unreasonable conduct.",108
1008,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member would have one interpretation for orderly people, and another for disorderly people.",108
1009,Mr WEBSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I would have only one interpretation, governed as all interpretations should be, by the reasoning of the responsible officer in charge of the business. The honourable member for Parkes knows that in the Courts verdicts are often arrived at, not exactly on the evidence, but on the manner and character of the witnesses; and that principle applies to such circumstances as are now under consideration. No Chairman would be doing his duty if he allowed the privileges of the House to be abused, and the authority of the Standing Orders crippled. What the honourable member for Flinders claims as an admission on my part is exactly the reverse, though, of course, I cannot hope to convince him of that fact. The quotation we have heard from May applies only to the subject-matter of a debate, and not to",108
1010,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Does the honourable member say that the time during which the sitting is suspended should count against an honourable member ?,108
1011,Mr WEBSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I say that it would be impossible for the Chairman to conduct the business had he decided in any other way than he has done. Where a quorum is being called for repeatedly, with the sole object of delay and obstruction, it is obvious that, if the time were allowed, the Chairman would never reach the end of half-an-hour.",108
1012,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member thinks that the Chairman should look for the motives in the mind of the member who calls for a quorum?,108
1013,Mr WEBSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Chairman is charged with the conduct of the business under the Standing Orders as interpreted by him. This is a new set of circumstances. There is no precedent to guide us. The nearest approach to our own situation is afforded by a New Zealand precedent. But honourable members have been dealing with supposititious cases that had no bearing upon the issue.,108
1014,Mr FAIRBAIRN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Fawkner) [10.21 a.m.] - As one of those who voted for the standing order imposing the time limit, I am entitled to protest against an interpretation which unduly limits the opportunity for debate afforded to honourable members. This House, I think, is the hardest worked legislative body in the world. We are a comparatively small number dealing with the affairs of an immense country and a growing population. In the House of Commons there are ten times the number of members that we have. The result is that the strain of legislating here is immensely increased. I have always been of opinion that we ought to curtail speeches as much as possible. But to go further than that, and take from an honourable member the time prescribed by the standing order, is to do more than, was ever contemplated. If we are not to be allowed to address ourselves properly to questions that arise, we shall not be able to earn our _£6oo a year. The ruling of the Chairman ought to be accompanied by a motion to reduce the salaries of honourable members. If we are only to be allowed to occupy thirty minutes in Committee, that time ought not to be reduced by points of order, - calls for a quorum, and continuous interruptions. The more manly course for the Government to follow would be, when they think that a debate has proceeded far enough, to move that the question be now put. They have a good precedent for that in the action that was taken by a previous Government. Ministerial supporters seem to forget that they supported "" the gag"" when it was proposed. ought to abide by it now, and apply it when it is considered advisable to shorten debate. At all events, the time allowed to an honourable member under the new standing order should be a net and not a gross time; and interruptions should not be counted as part of the allotted thirty minutes.",108
1015,Mr LIVINGSTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Barker) [10.36 a.m..]-Whateve r may be the general opinion in regard to the ruling given by the Chairman of Committees in this case, it will be admitted that the Chairman has always been fair and just while he has occupied his present position. No doubt there are good reasons for the ruling given in this case. The honourable member for FranElin, who was largely responsible for the time limit standing order, has lived long enough to see trouble caused by it. It has gone a long way to destroy the real purpose of Parliament. Parliament, as its name shows, is a place for speaking, William the Conquerer is said to have had "" very deep speech "" with what was his equivalent to a Parliament. the privileges of Parliament an authoritative writer has saidBoth Houses are in the enjoyment of certain privileges, designed to maintain their authority, independence and dignity.. These privileges are founded mainly upon the law and custom of Parliament, while some have been confirmed, and others abridged or abrogated by statute. Freedom of speech has been one of the most cherished privileges of Parliament from early times. Constantly asserted and often violated, it was finally declared by the Bill of Rights "" that the freedom of speech, and debates and proceedings in Parliament, ought not to be impeached' or questioned in any Court or place out of Parliament."" Such a privilege is essential to the independence of Parliaments, and to the protection of members in discharge of their duties. But while it protects members from molestation elsewhere, it leaves them open to censure or other punishment by the House itself, whenever they abuse their privilege, and transgress the rules of orderly debate.",109
1016,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,There is no quorum present. [Quorum formed.'],109
1017,Mr LIVINGSTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"In my opinion, the practice of constantly calling for a quorum is ridiculous. It is hardly fair to allow an honourable member, who perhaps likes to be a little tricky to call for a quorum when he knows that there are any number of honourable members outside the chamber. It is lowering the dignity of Parliament altogether. I was looking forward last night to hearing a great speech They from the Attorney-General. I sympathize with him on having lost his opportunity. If I could have assisted him, I would have done so. He appeared to be ready at the time, but now he has been sleeping over the matter his effort will probably not be half so good as it would have been last night. I thought, when the standing order limiting speeches was introduced, that if on any occasion a Minister wanted to make an important speech an extension of time would be granted by the House. I thought that all that the Prime Minister would have to do would be to ask for permission, whereupon the Minister in charge of the important business would be allowed to proceed. I never thought that the limitation would be pushed to the extent it has been. Probably the debate will do good in clearing up misunderstandings as to the application of the standing order.",109
1018,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Franklin) [10.45 a.m.] - When we have no standing order of our own dealing with a question, we look to the practice of the House of Commons. In the matter of the formation of a ^ quorum, it is distinctly the practice of the Concerning House of Commons, as of our own House, that when a quorum is asked for the honourable member who is addressing the House has to discontinue speaking. Practically, until a quorum is found, the House is not in session. There is a rule of this House that no honourable member is allowed to address the Chair unless he is standing. The moment a quorum is called for, the honourable member who is speaking has to resume his seat. When attention is called to the absence of a quorum, sir, and the honourable member speaking is ordered by you to resume his seat until a quorum is formed, can you fairly say that he is addressing the Committee during the interval ? The real point at issue in this discussion is, Are we to resort to the practice of the British House of Commons when we have no rule on a subject, or to be governed by the catch decision of an obscure Chairman of Committees in an inferior Parliament? If the position were not so serious, sir, it would be ludicrous for any one to contend that the proceedings of this Committee should be governed by such a decision. Suppose that after'the bells were rung on any occasion you had to announce to the Speaker that there was no quorum, and the bells had to be rung again, and thirty minutes were practically so occupied. Would you, sir, rule that the member who was addressing the Committee when attention was called to the absence of a quorum had occupied the whole of that time, and consequently had been addressing the Committee? It is recorded in Ilbert's Procedure of the House of Commons that only a message from the Crown enables the business of the country to be proceeded with when there is not a quorum after a count has been made. Under another rule of the House of Commons, sir, if , in your opinion, an honourable member is wasting time it is your privilege, and, if I may say so, your duty to deal with him. If a majority of honourable members insist that this ruling is right, very serious difficulty will arise in the near future. I believe, sir, that if you did not hold an official position you would be one of the first to rebel against a decision which would deprive you of your unchallengeable right to address the Committee and place your views before the country. I sincerely hope that your ruling will not be upheld, and that a majority of honourable members / will vote in favour of our adhering to the invariable practice of the British House of Commons rather than follow the catch decision of the New Zealand Parliament.

Some time ago complaints were made of the entry of Asiatics into the northern parts of Australia, of the entry of certain foreigners into Western Australia under contract, and of the admission of students. Can the Minister tell us whether there is any leakage in those three directions? Formerly we used to receive reports from the officers who are stationed on the northern side of Australia. I should like to know what is the present policy of the Commonwealth as regards the admission of Asiatic students the extent to which the provision has beenavailed of, and whether it has been found to work satisfactorily.

Not only are Chinese coming in, but a considerable number of Hindus and Mohammedans are coming here from India. I have had such eviThere dence of this that I have no doubt whatthese ever on the subject, and suggest that the Minister should have an officer not only Hong Kong, but in India, to give attention to this matter. The honourable member for Moreton has pointed out that during' the first six months of this year 1,100 Chinese and Japanese have entered Auslation. tralia, and over and above those are the number who are not officially accounted for.

I am quite sure that he and the Minister of Trade and Customs realise what a slim lot of gentlemen they have to deal with in connection with the attempts of Asiatics to get into this country, but I do not share the alarm of honourable members who think that there .is a marked increase in the influx of Japanese or Chinese into Australia. I hope that the Minister will temper justice with a little mercy in dealing with women in certain circumstances. Whilst I should not ask him in any way to modify the Act, I am sure we can trust him to deal with every case on its merits, and to see.that the good sense and humanitarian instincts of Australians are not offended by any harsh treatment in connection with.the deportation of women. Would it not be possible to avoid the humiliating spectacle which I and other honourable members recently witnessed of Asiatics on shipboard being mustered at every port along the Australian coast in order to be tallied? Would it not be practicable to rigidly enforce the Act by counting the Asiatics at the first port of entry, such as Darwin, to make another check at say Sydney, and to hold the ship-owners responsible for any shortage discovered there instead of counting these men at every port along the coast as is done at the present time? One can not help feeling that they are subjected to a certain measure of humiliation in being brought on deck and counted on so many occasions on the way down the coast. I merely throw out the suggestion because I have every confidence that the Minister will administer the Act with justice tempered with mercy.",113
1037,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Wentworth) [11.40 a.m.]. - I do not think that the mere expression of a few pious hopes in respect of any particular item is a satisfactory way of dealing with the Estimates. The only way in which good results can be obtained is by crystallizing one's objections to them in the form of an amendment, and thus focussing upon them not merely the attention of Ministers, but of the permanent heads of Departments. I observe that there has been an amazing and regrettable increase in the influx of aliens during the first six months of the current year, as compared with the corresponding period of last j'ear. I wish to put the matter quite clearly, and therefore I intend to quote, not merely the figures relating to arrivals, but the number of arrivals as contrasted with the number of departures during the years 1911 and 1912. I invite the serious attention of honourable members opposite, who have always posed as the peculiar guardians of the principle of a White Australia, to the extraordinary increase which occurred last year. That increase is most marked in the case of the Chinese. There is still a slight excess of departures over arrivals in the case of the Japanese. The excess of departures over arrivals in 1911 was sixty-eight, whereas for the first six monthsof the present year, it was forty-sevem These - figures are unsatisfactory. During the first half of the current year, 403 Japanese arrived, as compared with 205 during the corresponding period of last year. In the case of the Chinese the departmental position is inexplicable. In 1911 there were 716 arrivals in Australia, and only 604 departures- a net increase of 112. This influx is taking place in a country which prides itself upon having avery rigid Act. According to Knibbs, the Chinese population here during the first half of 1912 increased by 492. Is the Prime Minister satisfied with these figures ?",113
1038,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It depends upon whether the arrivals were persons who had a right to enter Australia.,113
1039,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Last year there were less departures than arrivals.,113
1040,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That is not so, but it does not matter.",113
1041,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am quoting from? Knibbs, page 9, Vital Statistics, Bulletin No. 6, which was issued in June of the present year. I understand that the Minister admits that there is a leakage beyond that which is disclosed by these figures. The fact remains that during the first six months of this year there was an excess of 492 arrivals over departures in the case of Chinese. I cannot understand it. We have a right to ask the Department to bemore effective in its methods. It does not require much calculation to determine how many Chinese there will be in Australia if they continue to come in at the same rate - during the next five years. I think we ought to have a definite assurance from the Department that these things will be better conducted in the future. The Minister's reply to my statement is a bald affirmation that the figures which I have quoted are not correct. But the figures are those of the Commonwealth Statistician, and the Minister's charge of mendacity against that officer will carry no weight with the people of this country. For the purpose of crystallizing my objections, and in order to ascertain whether honourable members are satisfied with the position which is disclosed by these statistics, I move That the item "" Immigration Restriction ActInterpreter's fees, legal and other expenses, j£2,ooo,"" be reduced by £1. That will afford the Minister an opporthe tunity to produce his proofs of the inacwhich curacy of the figures of the Commonwealth Statistician, and will permit members to show their sincerity White Australia question.

We want to ascertain how far the man. - Celestial is fabricating these papers. It is not so long ago that a regular Ministerial delegation proceeded to Russell-street the purpose of opening a Chinese restaurant. I refer to the Pekin Caf& ",113

The mere fact that a man has served Labour interests for a number of years, does hot constitute him an authority upon this question any more than it constitutes him an authority on the land question in the Northern Territory. If my amendment be carried, it will be an intimation to the Government that we are determined that this dangerous increase in the number of Chinese arrivals over departures shall not be allowed to continue. Any honourable member opposite who votes against the amendment will throw an excellent .side-light upon the value of his protestations that he is wedded to policy of a White Australia- a policy my honourable friends have sought to pirate from the Liberal, party which initihonorable ated it some years ago. on the Mr. JOSEPH COOK (Parramatta) [11.56 a.m. ] - I should like to know1 whether the Minister has any explanation of these figures?

1054,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I shall read the figures. During the first six months of last year the arrivals numbered 716, whereas during the six months ended June of the current year they numbered 789. Is that a reduction?",115
1055,Mr SPENCE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member is talking of the arrivals within periods of six months.,115
1056,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I have quoted the latest returns which are available. My point is that there has been an influx in number of Chinese arrivals over departures. If Ministers know that these figures are wrong, why have they not the courtesy to so inform the Committee, and thus to end the discussion? Surely these are facts which we are entitled to investigate? Reading these figures, one can only come to the conclusion that under the administration of the present Government, the arrivals of Chinese in the Commonwealth number very many more than the departures. Honourable members opposite have, for years past, taken all the credit for the White Australia policy, and it. is the first plank in their platform for the next elections. But the figures quoted disclose an administration of the Immigration Restriction Act in marked contrast with the statements which honourable members opposite make in the country, and in their Labour conferences, as to their support of the White Australia policy. Whilst the arrivals show a very marked increase, there is a considerable falling off in the number of departures. During six months of 1911 604 Chinese left our shores, and during the corresponding six months of 1912 only 297 of these people left Australia.",115
1057,Mr OZANNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member should give the figures for previous years. He is giving the figures for only six months in nine years.,115
1058,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am giving honourable members all the figures I have, and they have been supplied by Mr. Knibbs. I say that, in the absence of any explanation of them, they indicate a very lax administration of the Immigration Restriction Act. We have paid huge sums of money for the purpose of keeping our industries white in Queensland and in other States, and we have enacted a White Aushontralia policy, which is the pride of honourable members on both sides. Honourable members opposite continue to keep it in the forefront of their programme, and, although it has been given effect to for many years past, at the recent Hobart conference they again gave first place to the plank "" Maintenance of a White Australia.'' The Government, apparently, are maintaining the policy by permitting Chinese to enter the Commonwealth in increasing numbers year by year. If the figures quoted from Mr Knibbs are incorrect, it is the Minister's lookout, and not mine. Whilst honourable members behind the Government are whooping all over the the country that they are the special guardians of the White Australia policy, it is shown that under the administration of the present Labour Government the policy is not being maintained as effectively .as it wasof old under Liberal administration.",115
1059,Mr FRANK FOSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"New England> [12.10] - I think that honourable members, are quite justified in asking the Minister of External Affairs for some explanation of such figures as have been quoted. We should learn from the honourable gentleman what his policy in connection with Asiatic immigration has been in the past, and what he intends it shall be in the future. I have condemned previous Administrations, for laxity in connection with this question, especially in the Northern Territory, and for encouraging Chinese to come to theTerritory by giving them preference for employment over white men. I should liketo know what steps the present Minister of External Affairs has taken to prevent that kind of thing.",115
1060,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,They have given the conduct of the Government Gazette into the hands of a Chinese compositor.,115
1061,Mr FRANK FOSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I understand that a white man has the contract, and employs a Chinaman to assist him in getting out the Gazette. That is a very small matter, but I personally object to it, because the Gazette is subsidized with Commonwealth money, and, in my opinion, it is the duty of the Minister to see that Commonwealth money is used to pay white men. I should like to know what steps the Minister is taking to drive the Chinese out of the mining industry in the Northern Territory. I have been watching for the development of some policy to gradually get rid of these coloured gentlemen. We have in the Northern Territory a population consisting of half whites and half Asiatics. I admit that we cannot drive these coloured people into the sea, but we have been urgdifficult proposition. ing the Minister of External Affairs for months past to prevent Chinese tributers mines owned by white men, and, so far as ""booze.""

It is quite time question in the Northern Territory. that a Labour Administration took steps drive the Asiatics out of the mining indusabout try in the Northern Territory, at least the extent to which they are driven out the industry in other parts of the Commonkeep wealth. I should not object being encouraged to work old or abandoned mineral fields which white men cannot work successfully. If white employers were mitted to give Chinese tributes in the of New South Wales or Victoria there would be a riot within 24 hours. _ Miners Association and all concerned in the population. industry in the Northern Territory have asked that Chinese should not be allowed monthly to work as tributers in the mines of Territory.

They number more than 60,000, the Americans being a mere handful. The latter are alive to their danger, and are constructing enormous fortresses, but the Japanese are all trained soldiers, and possess splendid fighting qualities, and, moreover, are a proud race, so that there is reason for fearing them. I suppose that the King of the Loyalty Islands is afraid that his Dominions will be similarly overrun. It will be difficult for us to help His Majesty. We cannot expect to be able to keep the Japanese out of his country. Though we talk of having a controlling voice in the Pacific, it is those who fill up the islands of the Pacific that will have a controlling voice. The most that we can hope to do in the matter of the Loyalty Islands is to represent the state of affairs to the Foreign Office, so that the Imperial Government may take steps to prevent the population of the Loyalties being swamped by Japanese, Chinese, and Indian immigrants.",116

In response to the challenge of the honourable member for Corio, who wished for figures relating to the movements of Chinese during the Liberal administration, let me say that in 1906 the departures of all Asiatics exceeded the arrivals by 3,221: In 1907 there was an excess of 4,166 departures; in 1908, an excess of 1,295; in 1909, an excess of 770; and in 1910, the first year of the Labour Administration, an had excess of only 134. In the year 1911 there was a slight improvement, the excess of departures being 399. A reconciliation is necessary between the figures for the six months and the figures for the twelve months. It would seem as though there had been a rush of Chinamen out of the country in the first six months; but, taking the figures as a whole, there does not appear to be any more rigid administration of the Act than formerly, although honourable members opposite, in the Caucus and on the platform, pose as the only supporters of the White Australian policy.

No sufficient argument has been adduced to show that the decreased number of departures shows any lax administration ; indeed, exactly the opposite is shown, and the reason is that which I have already indicated.",118

The Minister would have the support of many honourable members on this side in any action he took in the direction suggested.  should like to direct the attention of the Minister to the sale of naturalization papers in Hong Kong and Singapore.

1088,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The pugilists are placed on the same footing as the music hall people.,118
1089,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Personally I do not think that amateur boxing ought to be suppressed, because it is a fine, manly sport. The question raised of the entry of coloured prizefighters, however, is one which ought to receive the serious consideration of the Minister. There appears to be at present practically unrestricted admission of coloured pugilists. A coloured man, of course, may have as fine a character as a white man; but there are undesirables of both races, and there ought to be some discrimination. As to naturalization, I should like to call attention to the position of married women under the Act. It is provided that a person who has received a certificate before the passing of the Act is entitled to naturalizationthroughout Australia, but in the case of a woman who becomes naturalized in a State on the naturalization of her husband no certificate is issued to her. The effect is that, though a woman may have been naturalized in Queensland or any other State, she was not naturalized in the Commonwealth as a whole; and this is a somewhat serious matter, because it affects the right .to an old-age pension, and also the right to enrolment.  ber, as Minister of External Affairs, promise an amendment of the Act in that respect ?",118

I think there ought to be an amendment of the Act, and that it ought to be, to some extent, retrospective.

Neither Mr Speaker nor the Chairman of Committees is the master of the House. Each has to do what the House tells him to do-neithe r more nor less. There was a distinct understanding with Mr Speaker, with the Chairman of Committees, and with the Government that honourable member were to be allowed an hour and a half for luncheon, and a similar time for dinner. The House has assented to that practice for weeks past, but now the Chairman, without any authority from anybody, coolly tells us that he will take the responsibility for the curtailment of our privileges in this connection.

1135,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The Chairman of Committees is the servant of the House. It is his duty to preserve our not to curtail them in this arbitrary fashion. I should like to know who has moved the Chairman to take this action. I cannot believe that of his own volition he has gated to himself the position of master of House. From time immemorial it has been laid down in connection with Parliamentaryprocedure that Mr Speaker and the Chairman of Committees may only do what the House directs them to do. That was laid down many years ago by Mr Speaker Lenthall, who said that he had neither eyes to see, nor earsto hear, other than as the House should direct him. The House has given its approval to an established custom, which is as strong as any law. There is nothing whatever in the point raised by the honourable member, for Riverina. My motion affirms that the Chairman has, without any authority whatever, committed a breach of the privileges of honourable members in taking from them a right which they have hitherto enjoyed.",121
1136,Mr THOMAS BROWN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"In support of the contention of the honourable member for Riverina I would direct attention to the fact that in a previous Parliament, on.the occasion of a very protracted silting which extended practically throughout a week, the then Speaker, the late Sir Frederick Holder, intimated to the House of his own volition that he proposed to vacate the chair at five minutes to 12 o'clock Saturday night, and to resume it at a ceropposite. tain hour on the following Monday morning.

1140,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If the action of the arro- Chairman be upheld no Government will the be safe against such a contingency, unless they have their own nominee in the chair. Mr Speaker or the Chairman of Committees might at any moment see fit to vacate the chair until such a time as they knew would inconvenience and - seriously embarrass the Government. What a condition of affairs we should have then ! Obviously the Chairman of Committees is a high officer of the House, and it is his duty to facilitate the work of honourable members, and not, by arbitrary decisions of his own volition, to embarrass them. Since we have established the practice of sitting in the mornings, it has been well known to all that the luncheon adjournment lasted from 1 o'clock t ill half-past 2 o'clock. Honourable members who had important duties to discharge may have left the House a few minutes before 1 o'clock, intending to return shortly before the ordinary hour for re-assembling, and may now find themselves, owing to the action of the Chairman, debarred from ventilating certain grievances.

I assisted the Prime Minister to maintain some semblance of control over his followers when they sought even that dirty pretext to advertise themselves on the stump to Australia.

1168,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,To what is the honourable member now speaking ? Is it a point of order?,123
1169,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"About six points of order have been raised since I commenced my speech'. On all future occasions it will be well for the presiding officer to at least notify honourable members in advance of any alteration he proposes to make in the duration of any refreshment adjournment. Whatever may be said in regard to the propriety of not adjourning for breakfast, the Chairman, in regard to the established practice of adjourning for luncheon and dinner, should observe the usual hours.",123
1170,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member for Riverina contends that the motion of privilege is out of order, on the ground that it should have been moved when the Temporary Chairman gave notice of my intention to leave the chair until a quarter-past 2 instead of until half-past but I will point out to him that the Temporary Chairman leaving the chair pre-' vented anything from being done, and the question of privilege was raised directly I resumed the chair after luncheon. Therefore I rule the motion of privilege to be in order. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON (Lang) f3;°]--In my view, the extension or curtailment of refreshment.adjournments can take place only in accordance with a resolution of the House come to on the motion of the Government, or incompliance with an arrangement between the leaders of parties. Neither the Speaker nor the Chairman has the right of his own volition to prolong or shorten a refreshment adjournment. If either presiding officer had the right to curtail a refreshment adjournment, that right would be unlimited. Not merely could an adjournment be shortened by a quarter-of-an-hour, but it could be shortened by any greater time, or abolished altogether.",123
1171,Mr FINLAYSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I submit that the molaid tion of privilege is entirely out of order.,123
1172,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Mr Chairman has ruled it to be in order, and cannot be questioned.",123
1173,Mr FINLAYSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"You ruled last week, thing of the kind. Mr Chairman, that you could leave the chair at any time. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - If the Chairman has the right to shorten a reare freshment adjournment, he has the right to abolish it altogether, and an unscruorable pulous or vindictive man could thus vent his personal spleen on honourable members, or play into the hands of the majority by wearing down the minority by continuous sittings, until at last they succumbed to absolute physical exhaustion. It has been the practice, when we have had all-night sittings, to adjourn at half-past 8 a.m. for breakfast, and when that was not done this morning I concluded that the adjournment was merely postponed for the convenience of the tired staff of cooks and waiters, who were late in the preparation for the meal. It was incomprehensible to me that such a proceeding as trying to starve members by compelling them to continue sitting during meal hours would be resorted to. In regard to the luncheon and dinner adjournments the practice is absolutely established. But if the Chairman may shorten these adjournments, he may abolish them altogether, and, equally, he may lengthen them indefinitely. Should 2, the Chairman have the powers which it is contended that he has, he would be able to leave the chair for ten or twelve hours at a time, and might have said on leaving at 1 p.m. that he would resume the sitting at 3.40 tomorrow morning. Besides, if a Chairman had these powers, the Temporary Chairmen would also possess them. To acknowledge the existence of such powers would be to sanction another serious inroad into our rights, and permit, perhaps, the exercise of tyranny. We should be very jealous of our rights and privileges, and shall find ourselves in very dangerous waters' if we allow the conduct of our affairs to be taken out of our control by the Chairman or other presiding officer.",123
1174,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Parkes) [3.9]. ; - I support the motion of the Acting Leader of the Opposition with considerable confidence. The honourable member for Riverina, although an exChairman of Committees, has displayed an extraordinary lack of knowledge of the first principles of parliamentary procedure. He down the extraordinary and novel doctrine that the Speaker and Chairman of Committees can do as they like in the that ruling matter of adjournments.",123
1175,Mr CHANTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I did not say any,123
1176,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That in effect was the honourable member's, contention; but you, Mr Chairman, and Mr Speaker, the servants of the House, and can do nothing except by its direction. The honmember for Calare seems to think that we are bound by something done by Sir Frederick Holder without direction of the House, but a mere cursory glance at May's Parliamentary Practice will show that the powers of the Speaker of an assembly like this, and a fortiori those of the Chairman, are very strictly defined. For verification of that statement. I refer honourable members to page 191 of the eleventh edition. You, Mr Chairman, have no power to do anything against the wishes or directions of honourable members, and must do what you are required to do. In this instance you have taken upon yourself to alter the length of the luncheon adjournment. You did not ask the permission of the Committee to do this. The mere adjournment for lunch may be regarded as the feather which shows the way the wind blows, because if we had a reckless Government who desired to make honourable members tools to serve their ends they might induce a weak man in the chair to do just what they wished. I need not say that I hope we shall never have such a man in the chair, but I point to the extra- Committees occupied his chair. ordinary power which in these circumstances a Government would have if they chose to exercise it . We had some indication of it today when at the beginning of this debate a Minister of the Crown from his place on the Treasury bench actually advised you, sir, as to how you should act in your position. Where will this end? It is but on a par with many of the tyrannical acts of a Labour Government who mistake might for right. If you, have the power to curtail the period to be allowed honourable members for lunch, you have the power to extend it ; and you have the power to adjourn for hours instead of minutes. You would become the master of the Committee instead of its servant. I therefore join heartily with the honourable member for Parramatta in protesting as vehemently as I can against this attempt to subvert Parliament, and to introduce some of the characteristics which made the Star Chamber remarkable for tyranny in the history of the Mother Country.",123
1177,Mr CHANTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Riverina) [ . i ] . _ I should not have risen were it not for the fact that the honourable member for Parkes has made certain statements concerning myself. When I raised the point of order, I did not claim that the Speaker or Chairman of Committees had power over honourable members in this matter. What I said, and what I repeat now, was that it has been the universal practice of the presiding officers of this Parliament to be guided in arranging the adjournment for refreshments by their view of the convenience of honourable members. Precedents have been alluded to, and it is just as well that we should follow our own. We have no rule or standing order defining the particular hours when business shall be suspended to enable honourable members to obtain refreshments, or prescribing the time allowed for the purpose. The honourable member for Parkes mentioned the fact that, in common with himself, I was at one time a member of the New South Wales Parliament and I have a clear recollection of the powers which were exercised by eminent members of that Parliament, who are now Justices of the High Court of Australia. I remember that on one occasion, Mr Justice Barton, who was at the time Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales, took possession of the Committee, and entered the Speaker's chair, while the Chairman of There was no precedent for the adoption of such a course as that, and Mr Speaker Barton had to make one to fit the circumstances. Our late eminent and respected Speaker, Sir Frederick Holder, I believe, held the same views, though he had no necessity to take a similar course here. My memory is sufficiently good to enable me to say that there has never been any arrangement come to either by the House or the Committee sir, with respect to the time at which Mr. Speaker or the Chairman of Committees should leave the chair in order that honourable members may obtain refreshments. Originally, as you are no doubt aware, sir, it was thought that it would suit the convenience of honourable members to suspend the sitting for one hour for lunch. That practice was followed for a time, and then without any arrangement come to in the House or in Committee, the time was extended to an hour and a quarter, and later it was further extended to an hour and a half. In dealing with Bills, and the ordinary business of the Chamber, the Speaker 3 7 or Chairman of Committees, as the case may be, is bound by our standing rules and orders. He may not leave the chair, or take the chair, except by resolution, or, in the case of the passing of a Bill from one stage to another, but as regards adjournments for refreshments, they are not guided by any standing order. The honourable member for Parkes cited May, and referred to myself in an* uncomplimentary manner, but, notwithstanding his remarks, I claim to be quite as well acquainted with May as is the honourable gentleman, and further that his reference to that authority was wide of the mark. It dealt with what the Speaker or Chairman of Committees might not do under the Standing Orders, but we are here dealing with a matter that is not provided for in the Standing Orders.",124
1178,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I think we should have a quorum.' [Quorum formed.""]",125
1179,Mr CHANTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I fear no contradiction when I say that there has never been a motion submitted in this chamber dealing with the time for which the House or the Committee should adjourn for refreshments.' That has been left by consent to the Speaker or Chairman of Committees respectively.,125
1180,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Wit h the concurrence of honourable members. M.r. CHANTER - That concurrence has been assumed because there has been no objection. I can recall no instance in this Parliament when the Speaker or Chairman of Committees left the chair for refreshments without announcing when he would resume it. That is the time when, if the proposed adjournment is inconvenient to honourable members, objection should be taken. No such objection was taken in this case.",125
1181,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,How could any objection be taken when the Temporary Chairman rase from the chair and walked out of the chamber?,125
1182,Mr CHANTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If the announcement he made did not suit the convenience of the Committee, honourable members should have made known their objections.",125
1183,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,They could not have done so then.,125
1184,Mr CHANTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"On this occasion the time allowed under recent practice was reduced by a quarter of an hour. Until a standing order is agreed to fixing the time at which the Chairman or Speaker shall leave the chair for refreshments and resume it, the only persons who can deal with the matter are the presiding officers of House. The honourable member for Parramatta knows the usages of other Parliaments as well as of this Parliament, and he would, I think, be well advised to withdraw his motion, and, if he thinks it necesSpeaker sary, submit a direct motion that the Committee should adjourn for a certain period for refreshments. [200]",125
1185,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Richmond) [3.25] - I cannot claim the long parliamentary experience of the honourable member for Riverina, but I can refer to certain alterations made in the adjournment allowed for refreshments during my experience, short as it has been. If the honourable member will look up Hansard he will find that on the last occasion when the time was extended from an hour and a quarter to an hour and a half, it was only done after debate, and with the concurrence and knowledge of honourable members. When the usual hour for the adjournment arrived the Speaker announced that, in order to give the Hansard reporters and the officers of the Parliament a. rest, he proposed to extend the dinner adjournment. I remember, sir, that when you were in the chair you referred to the fact that the Speaker had extended the period of adjournment for refresh intents, and said that you proposed to follow the precedent he had laid down. There is a, real danger involved in the arbitrary change of the hour for refreshments on the spur of the moment. A number of honourable members a few minutes before the time for the lunch adjournment might go into the city for lunch, believing that the ordinary hour for the resumption of our proceedings would be observed; but upon their return they might find that the Chairman had resumed the chair earlier than the usual hour, and that an important division had taken place in their absence. In the circumstances, they would be deprived of their rights.",125
1186,Mr CHANTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We could cure that by the adoption of a sessional order.,125
1187,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I admit that; and if we are never to know, from day to day, at what hour the Speaker or Chairman will leave the chair, and resume it again, we must have a sessional order dealing with the matter, so that we may know exactly where we are. In such circumstances as I have suggested, the present practice might, lead to the defeat of the Government on an important measure. Though I should this not, for a moment, attribute anything of the find to you, sir, I submit that the power you have exercised might be used in a most sinister way. If this power be conceded as a matter of right, to the or Chairman, either of those officers might, in collusion with the Government, be the means of bringing about a snap division on some important proposal. Mr - CHANTER - He would - not 'be fit for his position if he did. Mr .GREENE - I .admit that; but amy pori-tat is that such things would be .possible if the Speaker or Chairman of Committees had a right arbitrarily .to .alter the .hour, or the period Ito be allowed for refreshments without the - concurrence - of the Qiamber. Our presiding officers a.re the servants <wf the'House .or Committee, .to carry out their wishes and maintain order„ aaad they ihave no right to take it - upon themselves ito - say what shall be .done in .a mstaitter of this kind without the .general currence of honourable members.

""W.e are - establishing a precedent, which may be followed to the disadvantage of the Government or the Opposition, .and which must leave the Speaker or Chairman of Committees open to charges of partisan action. In view of the fact that we have been sitting - continuously since 10.30 a.m yesterday, it would .have been quite possible .that .a .number of .members of the Opposition might have left the chamber this morning., and on their return .have found that those Jeft to represent them, had exhausted .their right .to speak, .and that, in - their absence, matters on which they de.s'ired to express their opinions had been - dealt with by the 'Committee.

1188,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I know; but . I am - pointing out the danger, and reminding 'honourable members that both sides are equally interested in this question. We must not forget that the present Government will not always occupy the Treasury benches; and the sooner a change is made in the Administration the better it will be for the countryI submit that am arbitrary alteration in the hour of the refreshment adjournment, or any other similar matter, is a distinct breach of privilege.",126
1189,Mr THOMAS BROWN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Calare) [3.35]. - This is not the ordinary procedure of the House, because, in a parliamentary sense, ttids is Wednesday, and not Thursday; and m extraordinary position of affairs has arisen.

Mr .FUiLLER -(Illawarra) .[3.36] - My owaa opinion is that, instead of - curtailing the r.efEeshmemt .hour, it might .very well have been extended under the .circumstances, not - only for the convenience of honourable members, but for the .convenience .of Aose gentlemen of the Hansard staff who .have had to sit so long at the table here and report our proceedings. The .honourable member for Calare, and, I understand, the honourable member for Riverina, have referred to a memorable occasion when the late Sir con- Frederick Holder suspended the sitting over the Sunday; and the honourable member for Oaiare has told us that Sir Frederick did that of his ow.11 volition.",126
1190,Mr CHANTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I made no reference to that occasion.,126
1191,Mr FULLER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The statement made by ' Sir Fieder-idk Holder on the Saturday night shows that what he did was Ito meet the wishes of ihonorab'le members on both sides. I happened to be speaking at five minutes to 12 o'clock on that night, and I wedl neimeoiiiber the words - of Sir Frederick - Holder, which aire iset f orth in Votes .and Processings of the .1.6th November, 1905, as followsSuspension of Sitting - over Sunday - At u o'.clook midnight, .

He recognised that in suspending the silting beyond midnight on Sunday he was going beyond 'any period for which there was - pmecedent. In deference, however, to what he .understood ±0 be - the general desire of the House, he would now suspend the sitting t ill half-past 10 a.m. on Monday. Then, in Hansard, volume xxix., page 5425, Sir Frederick Holder is thus reported",126
1192,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Order' ! The House will perhaps permit me to say that I have gathered fr-cra the speeches of honourable members, and otherwise, that there is a general wish that the sitting shall not be continued during Sunday. I have looked up the precedents, and I find that there are many for the Speaker suspending the sitting for such time as may be necessary for securing the purpose in view. In this House the time for which sittings have been suspended has usually been one hour for refreshments. There are other cases in which sittings have been suspended for longer periods - up to .three and a-half hours in one case, and in Victoria, on one occasion, a sitting was suspended for eleven hours and three-quarters. I ireoogriise that if I suspend the sitting of this House for twenty-four hours, I go beyond any period for which I can find a precedent. Yet in suspending the sitting for that time. I should not go beyond the period which is necessary to accomplish the purpose we have in view. find, however, that there is a general desire that the House should not be called back to transact business at midnight tomorrow, and that the convenience of honourable members should be studied to a further extent. Therefore, I now suspend this sitting of the House until half-past 10 o'clock on Monday morning. When the House met on the following Monday morning, Mr Watson, the Leader of the Labour party, said",126

1194,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I think that it was the honourable member himself who mentioned to me on Friday or Saturday last that it was very desirable that some relief should be given to the Hansard stall, and that that relief might be secured by enlisting the services of some of the officers of the Reporting Staif of the State Parliament. I will take care to ascertain whether such an arrangement can be made, or whether relief can by any other means be afforded. All this shows clearly that what Sir Frederick Holder did was to meet the general desire of members on both sides. On this particular occasion, however, the action taken by the Temporary Chairman could not possibly meet the wishes of honourable members.",127
1195,Mr WEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It met the wishes of the majority.,127
1196,Mr FULLER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"How did the honourable member ascertain that? As for myself, it was only when leaving the building at 2 o'clock, in order to attend to some business down town, that I accidentally heard that the House would re-assemble at a quarter past 2. This may have happened to many honourable members; and we should not be put in such a position, by the curtailment of the hour of adjournment, that we might be unable to be present on the r e assembling of the House. I contend that the action of the Temporary Chairman, as the servant of the House, was not calculated to meet the convenience or wishes of honourable members. If the majority of honourable members opposite were consulted, I do not see. why we also should not have been consulted.",127
1197,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Honourable memtion? bers on the Government side knew nothing about the arrangement.,127
1198,Mr FULLER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I gathered from terjection of the honourable member for East Sydney that the contrary was the fact. It is clear that Sir Frederick [.ioo]-2 Holder recognised his position as the servant of the House, and satisfied himself 1 as to the desires of honourable members on both sides.",127
1199,Mr BROWN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"As a matter of personal explanation I desire to say. that what the honourable member for Illawarra has stated is correct so far as it goes; but, in orderto appreciate the exact position on the occasion to which he refers, he ought to go a little further back.",127
1200,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,In what sense is this a personal explanation?,127
1201,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member for Calare is going beyond a personal explanation.,127
1202,Mr BROWN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I desire to show that the position .put to the House by the honourable member for Illawarra is not the correct one, and that before that stage was. reached",127
1203,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member may make that statement in a speech, but not as an explanation.",127
1204,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Parramatta) [3.49] - It must be abundantly clear by this time that such an action as that taken by the Chairman, as one of the custodians of . the privileges of the House, is usually taken after the opinion of the House, as a whole, has been ascertained; and in all matters affecting our privileges there ought to be concurrence as f ar as possible. This is in no sense a party matter, but one that affects members on both sides; and it did seem a little harsh and hard that, after depriving us of the usual breakfast period, the Chairman should have curtailed the lunch hour. We have been sitting over twenty-six and a half hours, and this is not an occasion on which to introduce any new arrangement,, except with concurrence. I suggest that the Chairman might very well agree to revert to the old order of things for the time being, pending an expression of opinion by the House. We are meeting here under more 01 less unusual circumstances, p.nd there is every excuse for hasty action, no matter by whom.",127
1205,Mr CHANTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Why not let the Standing Orders Committee deal with the ques,127
1206,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I think that honourable members might well be left to the inmake arrangements of the kind affecting their own mutual comfort and convenience. It is clearly laid down by all authorities that theSpeaker may not do anything until he has been authorized by the House. He is not the master of the House, but its servant, and while we are bound by the Standing Orders, he is even more bound by them, if that be possible; all the power of the Speaker is derived from the wish and will of the House. I should be glad to evade taking a division on the motion, and, if the Chairman cannot see his way adopt my suggestion, I shall ask leave unconditionally withdraw the proposal.",127
1207,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I object; we had better have a vote.,128
1208,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I am entirely in the hands of the Committee. There other precedents in this Chamber which have not been quoted.,128
1209,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Le t us have them.,128
1210,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I never saw a Minister so eager to "" stone-wall "" his own Estimates; he welcomes opposition at any moment, and seems to glory in it :  member evidently does not wish to get to the consideration of the Estimates.",128
1211,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I have not been permitted so far, seeing that we have been discussing the Chairman for nearly two days. I think that on one occasion the honourable member for Darling Downs posed to take a course almost similar that now suggested, but that the House declined to allow it to be followed.",128
1212,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,My recollection is that House came to an agreement later on.,128
1213,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,On this occaanything sion honourable members opposite desire make this a party question.,128
1214,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We like a man to stick to his guns.,128
1215,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Ver y well, I the have not the slightest objection to do",128
1216,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Wentworth) [3.57] - Hon orable members opposite, who object to honourable member for Parramatta, purely out of deference to the Chair, withdrawbear ing his motion, will realise when they up in the morning, and have a bath  going to bed to-night.",128
1217,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I shall be delighted to Administration. sit up with my honourable friends. I think it will be readily conceded that the honrived orable member for Parramatta has adopted a most generous attitude to the Chairman, and the position he occupies, in offering withdraw unreservedly his motion of privilege. We have every sympathy with the Chair and the officers of the House when it becomes our bounden duty to refuse be bullied into passing all the Estimates in one sitting. I do not think the Minister does himself justice when he objects to this question being settled amicably, now that it has been ventilated. Perhaps he realizes that the longer the discussion of points of privilege like this-absolutel y necessary as they may be-the better it is to for himself, because then he may hope to to have discussed at a time when the press cannot be with us the many political misdoings of which he has been guilty in connection, with this Department. Honourable members opposite think that they are scorare ing a party point when they support the Chair, quite irrespective of the merits of the case. They think that they are infiioting on the Opposition a temporary inconvenience. As a matter of fact, I do not care what happens to this motion; but we felt it to be our duty to endeavour to check this new thing as soon as it had shown its horns. We care not if the House is kept sitting continuously, or whether an effort is made to starve us into, an improper surrender, as wellas so to exhaust us as to make it impossible for us to properly criticise the finances of the country. I leave this question to the decision of the House, but regret that the handsome offer made proby the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to has been resisted, not by the Chair-because you, sir, recognise the eminent fairness of the suggestion-bu t by certain bitterthe persons who are so blinded by what has occurred here recently that they think that that hits the Opposition is good to for the House and the country. Motion negatived.",128
1218,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Wentworth) [4.4] - When question of privilege was raised, I was that. discussing a reply by the Minister to a - statement made by me in regard to the the administration of the Immigration Restriction Act. The figures given by Mr Knibbs eloquent testimony to the general prowake position I laid down that this Government, while posing as the peculiar guardians of the White Australia policy, have been more lax in this regard than have any previous In 1906, 3,221 more aliens left the Commonwealth than arhere; in 1907, 4,106 more aliens left than arrived here; while in 1908, the excess of departures over arrivals was 1,295. ^ n to 1909 the excess was some 770; but in 1910 --the first vear of the Labour Administration-the number of departures over arrivals dropped from 3,221 in 1906, to 134. That is to to say, White Australia, was nearly thirty times better off under a Liberal Administration than the figures prove it to be under a Labour Administration. In 1911 399 - more aliens left the Commonwealth than arrived here, and, according to a later - edition of the Monthly Summary of Australian Statistics than I was able to obtain - when I first addressed myself to this subject, for the first eight months of the pre-sent year, as compared with the corresponding period of last year, in almost every foranch of alien immigration the balance - was against us. Some of the figures are - extraordinary. We find, for instance, that 706 Malays arrived during the first eight months of this year, whilst 525 left Australia. In the case of Chinese, the balance - up to June had been corrected in the other way, more Chinese having left than actually arrived here. Having shown conclusively that the figures of the Government Statist are all against the Ministry in this regard, I should like to refer to the statement made by way of interjection by the honourable member for Bourke, that if the Labour party were responsible for the more unsatisfactory position of the Commonwealth'with regard to alien immigration than was the case in previous years, they must be equally responsible for the better position of the Commonwealth with regard to the immigration of white races. That is 'a catcfi way of putting the position. It is well known that while the Commonwealth is responsible for the administration of the Immigration Restriction Act, which deals with coloured aliens, the States alone are responsible for the white immigrants now coming to our shores. At page 1185 of No. 5 of the Official Year-Book, Mr. Knibbs makes this statementVarious measures have from time to time adopted by the Commonwealth and State vernments, as well as by private societies dividuals, with a view to promoting the immigraconsider tion of suitable classes of settlers into Australia. Some of the States of the Commonthe country and who has a vote. wealth are at present pursuing immigration cies of a vigorous nature; in others, relatively little is being done. The activities of the Commonwealth Government (which is vested constitutional powers in regard to immigration under section 51, x x v l i ., of the Constitution Act 1900), with respect to the encouragement of immigration, have hitherto practically been confined to advertising in hand-books, newspapers, and periodicals the resources and attractions of Australia. We have already ventilated the means adopted by the Government to advertise Australia by paying unduly large amounts to their party organs, but that question not immediately before us. While the figures clearly show that the present Administration is not so satisfactorily coping with the question of alien immigration as its predecessors did, it is in no way, according to the authority of the Commonwealth Statistician, responsible for the vast increase in the number of immigrants of a. desirable character coming to the Commonwealth. I am not particularly anxious to press my amendment, because, in the present temper of the Committee, there is no possibility of obtaining an impartial verdict from honourable members opposite. They will sleep to a man, and vote to a man for the Government.",128
1219,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member must not cast reflections.,129
1220,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Las t year the appropriation in respect of interpreters' fees, legal and other expenses, in relation to the Immigration Restriction Act was ;£i,6oo, whilst the actual expenditure was .£2,632; and yet, despite the unsatisfactory leakage occurring under the present faulty administration, the Minister proposes to do with £622 less in respect of this item than was spent last year. Honourable members opposite, when on the public platform, pose as "" the pure merinoes "" of a White Australia. They can vote old-age pensions for Chinese with votes, but they are "" the true merinoes"" with regard to keeping out Chinese who have no votes! Yet we find them actually cutting down the Estimates relating .to the administration of the Immigration Restriction Act. I have ventilated this case because I deem it to be of very great importance. I have supported it with statistics compiled by the Commonwealth Statistician. But I do not anticipate that my amendment will been be carried, because honourable members opGoposite, who are so accustomed to denounce and inalien immigration, are only too ready to the Chinaman who is already in Their poliprotestations on the . public platform are,, therefore, only so much humbug, which is with intended to gull the electors. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON (Lang) [4.17] - I think the honourable member for Wentworth has made out a strong case. He has shown that there has been a very marked increase in the number of alien immigrants who have entered the Commonwealth during the tenure of office of the present Government. That is a somewhat remarkable fact, seeing that, in regard to is the White Australia policy, honourable members opposite will always pose as the only "" pure merinoes."" But their claim this connection is just as much a sham as are many of their other professions. we are going to preserve Australia for the white race, and to make our Immigration Restriction Act effective, we shall have keep a closer watch on oversea arrivals from Oriental countries. The honourable member for Wentworth has moved the rethey duction of the item "" Immigration Restricof tion Act-Interpreters' fees, legal other expenses, .£2,000,"" by £1. that last year the amount appropriated under this heading was £1,600, but that the expenditure totalled £2,622. particularly desire to know is why paid legal interpreters should be restricted some portions of Australia to the exclusion of others. During the early part of j'ear I had occasion to visit Thursday Island. There I found that a number ot that disputes had arisen and a number of serious assaults had been committed amongst the coloured members of the pearlsacrifice ing fleets stationed there. A feud peared to be in progress between the Japanese divers and the Malay crews of the pearling luggers. A sort of vendetta, existed, and, owing to the absence of inis terpreters, it was exceedingly difficult get at the facts of those disputes. In case a raid was made by a number of Malays on a house which was being temelapse porarily visited by a Japanese diver. Knives were freelythrown about, so that it was risky even to crossthe road. One Japanese was stabbed whilst on his way to his vessel , and, as I have already said, 1 it. was almost impossible, owingto the sence of an official interpreter, to ascerconsideration. tain the rights and wrongs of the quarrel. I may add that there is a member of the Malay community resident in Thursday Island, and also a Japanese resident. men are not official interpreters, but, much as they possess some knowledge of the direction I have indicated. the English language-a knowledge which is not by any means perfect-their services are occasionally requisitioned. But it merely an accident that they happen to located on the Island. They may leave it at any time, and, in that case, there would be nobody there who is familiar with the language either of the Japanese or of the Malays, who constitute the bulk of the floating population of the place. The seriousness of this condition of affairs will readily be understood by honourable members when. I tell them that when these Mr W. Elliot Johnson. pearling fleets visit Thursday Island for in supplies there are sometimes as many as 400 luggers in port at the same time. Each It of these vessels carries a crewof seven or eight persons, chiefly composed of Malays, who come ashore in great numbers. Only to one policeman is stationed on the Island to maintain law and order amongst alt these aliens, who visit the botels, where become the victims of inebriety and the madness which frequently results and from inebriety. It struck me that, on, I find Thursday Island, there are all the elements which are required to lead to a disastrous conflict. There is no paid CommonWhat 1 wealth official there to act as interpreter when members of these coloured crews are to brought before the resident Commissioner for alleged offences. As a result, there this appears to have sprung up a tremendous amount of dissatisfaction, and a feeling there is no possibility of securing justice where assaults with violence are committed-assault s which sometimes involve the of human life. I hope that the apMinister will do what he can to remedy this very undesirable state of affairs. Greater police protection is. one of the crying needs of the place. Certainly there a military station on the Island, but theto military barracks are located at the oppoone site sideof it to that on which the town stands. Consequently a little time would before the services of the military could be requisitioned to quell a disturbance. In the meantime, one constable would not be able to keep back the hordes of infuriated people who might desire to spring at one another's throats. This is a abmatter which ought to receive immediate If the amount which appears upon these Estimates has already been allocated to other places, to the exclusion of Thursday Island, perhaps, the These Minister, in supplementary Estimates, inasmay be able to make suitable provision in It has always struck me that, under existing conditions, the few white residents of Thursis day Island, and especially the few white be women there, live incritical times. When thesefleetsenter that port there is no knowing what excesses their alien crews, may commit, especially after they have been tossingabout at sea in a little cockle-shell of a vessel for perhaps three months. They are a menace to the white, population, and especially to the few white women there^ I do not think that there is any need for me to more vividly picture to honourable members the possibility of dire happenings as the result of excesses on their part. I hope that the Minister will have inquiries made - into the question of pro-viding official interpreters, so that those whose duty it is to adjudicate upon alleged offences by these coloured persons may be able to ascertain the exact position, and to inform accused persons of the nature of the evidence which is tendered .against them. Amendment negatived. Proposed vote agreed to. Division 32 (High Commissioner's - Offi^), £21,185",129
1221,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"DaTling Downs) [4.353 This division raises the whole question of the High Commissioner's office, together with the duties and work of the staff. There are .several matters upon which one would like to have information. I take the opportunity of congratulating the High - Commissioner, and those associated with him, upon the excellent work that they are doing. But we should like to have a statement from the Minister of External Affairs about one or two details. If honourable .members examine, the division, they will see that several changes have taken place in the staff. We find, for instance, that a journalist has been appointed, and that the - office of second assistant of the publicity branch has been abolished. The officer in - charge of the produce and commercial branch at a salary of £310 has also been dispensed with. A sum of £5,000 is put down for the development of the export trade, and ,£20,000 is put clown for advertising the Commonwealth. I presume that the journalist who was appointed at .a salary of £400 a year was chosen at the request of the High Commissioner. Of course, the Minister of External Affairs knows the kind of journalist that the High Commissioner required for the position. Was the situation advertised? Were applications invited from members of the Australian press? Did the Minister, in making a selection, have in view the strong recommendation made by the High Commissioner as regards the duties of the officer? I find that Sir George Reid, on page 4 of his report for 191T, saidAn important branch will be the staff that "" writes up "" Australia in the shape of articles and paragraphs for newspapers and magazines. The members of this staff should be familiar with the resources and progress of Australia, especially - the rural industries. The call for articles about our live stock and country industries is very strong. In view of the rural quality of the emigration we are trying to promote, specialized articles of the ikind alluded to will be specially valuable. I need not say that brightness of style, clearness of expression, and literary skill are more difficult to get, and, therefore, essential in this .kind of writing, than, perhaps, any other. DeaJing with the kind of journalist he required for the purpose, the High Commissioner said It is not easy to lay down a policy for the successfu) preparation of newspaper articles and paragraphs.",131
1222,Mr HIGGS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,He wanted a journalist with 'imagination.,131
1223,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member, as a journalist himself, understands the qualifications. No writer can be successful unless he has the gift of imagination. Imagination does not mean saying what is not true. It means a sympathetic insight into matters written about; being able to see precisely the conditions which the writer desires to describe; the power of translating into good literary style what will convey a clear impression to the mind of the reader.",131
1224,Mr HIGGS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I do not think the honourable member displayed much imagination in his pamphlet on Nation Building.,131
1225,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Because I was recording - solid facts. A recorder of facts is not allowed to unduly exercise his imagination. He cannot indulge in the exaggeration of statement j the picturesqueness of language, and the glowing imagery of which the honourable member is a master.",131
1226,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Some scrupulousness is necessary.,131
1227,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"In writing, as in speaking, little rhetorical flights are occasionally advantageous; such nights, interspersed with poetical quotations, as the honourable member for Maribyrnong is fond of giving us. The High Commissioner informs us that a policy for the successful preparation of newspaper .articles and paragraphsis a matter which depends almost entirely, upon the quality of the man or men employed to do the work. The field of publicity might be extended almost indefinitely if the journalists employed are sufficiently good to make their way into the columns of the British newspapers. He addsThere is a big demand just now for all sorts of Imperial "" copy."" But, at the same time, the matter submitted must have good news value, and must be well written. A really good man will, I think, get more space placed at his disposal than he can f ill . I do not think that money could be more profitably spent than in the employment of a good press staff. The amount which one man could write in a year would scarcely make an adequate show in the British press. Furthermore, the High Commissioner saysI t is all a question of how much can be placed. If a well-informed Australian nalist can place all he .can write in the better class of British newspapers and magazines, the money paid to him in salary would give far better results than a similar amount of money spent in any sort of straight-out advertising. But it entirely depends upon the quality of the man. The journalist who can get his footing with Australian matter would, of course, return no profit whatever to the Commonwealth. Any one appointed should be well versed, not only tralian politics, but in Australian rural tries. There is a very good demand for all sorts of articles about Australian live stock Australian agricultural industries from the special Farm Press of the United Kingdom. In view of the fact that the States are only assisting agricultural classes and vants, the presswork, as far as emigration is concerned, should, I conclude, be specialized in this direction. Were steps taken fo supply the High Commissioner with the kind of journalist that he required? He points out, first of all, what the needs are. He indicates that the States are asking for immigrants who will settle on the land and assist in agricultural production. He insists that the journalist required should be able to write on live stock and the agricultural resources of this country. We shall all agree, I hope, that the attraction of a steady flow of agricultural population to this continent "" is a consummation devoutly to be wished."" The High Commissioner believes that a journalist who could indicate our agricultural possibilities to farming readers in the United Kingdom would do much to promote immigration. Was the journalist selected qualified to fulfil the conditions laid down by Sir George .Reid? I do not think that the Australian public desire a single word of description to be published in the United Kingdom that is not absolutely in accordance with the facts as to Australian conditions.",131
1228,Mr RILEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,What about sending to England some Australian poetry ? have poets in this House.,132
1229,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,-Our s is a House of many parts. But we were not asked to send a poet. A journalist intimately acquainted with the rural conditions was required. Did the journalist selected answer to that description?,132
1230,Mr LAIRD SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Has there been any complaint as to his being incompetent ?,132
1231,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I have made no such allegation.,132
1232,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member wanted a man selected from the Argus, the Age, or the Brisbane Courier. jour- Mr GROOM - I certainly did not want a journalist to be chosen because of his political opinions. Is that the suggestion of the Minister? I have made no such claim. I have simply indicated the qualifications required. If the Minister has made a political appointment, he has done a wrong thing. I am not going to say a in Ausword against the gentleman chosen, but I indus- do want to know whether he fulfilled the conditions which the High Commissioner and specified. I also want to know whether the journalists of Australia were given an opportunity of submitting their qualificadomestic ser- tions to the Department.",132
1233,Mr HIGGS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member's party never appointed a Labour man while it was in office.,132
1234,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We never appointed any officer who was not recommended by the Public Service Commissioner. Every position that we filled was advertised. There was no preference to unionists with us. We never appointed persons to positions in the Northern Territory on account of their political ppinions.,132
1235,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Government to which the honourable member belonged never appointed any one to the Northern Territory.,132
1236,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The Minister carried out our agreement, which was ratified by Parliament. Our object always was that the best men available, irrespective of their political feelings and sympathies, should be appointed, in accordance with the Public Service Act. I am endeavouring scrupulously to avoid introducing anything of a partisan element into this discussion. All that I am asking is that the Minister will give us information. Another point upon which I should like to be informed is this: I think that the honourable member for MaribyrWe nong, and others, attended a deputation to the Minister of External Affairs, to ask him to take steps to advertise in England the rural products of Australia.",132
1237,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Als o to advertise on the Continent.,132
1238,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Quite so.,132
1239,Mr CANN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Would that include sending Home a picture illustrating our wattle?,132
1240,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"There is an esthetic side to our life. It is just as well to let people in Great Britain know that we do appreciate the beauties of nature, and that Australia has glorious flora of her own. The deputation to which I have referred urged the Minister of External Affairs to advertise rural products. The High Commissioner, in his report for 1912, page 7, makes the following remarks on this subject :In advertising the Commonwealth in Great Britain and on the Continent, it will , I believe, be found advisable to arrange two distinct schemes-on e aiming at securing an increasing tide of emigration to Australia, and a greater volume of investment and further enterprise, the other seeking to promote a better knowledge of the range and quality of Australian exports, with a view to promote an increasing demand for oui products in British and foreign markets. Up to the present, our advertising expenditure has been mainly directed to the object of making known to suitable emigrants the attractions of the Commonwealth. funds at my disposal it was impracticable to include a vigorous and business-like campaign for the purpose of advertising our food products.",132
1241,Mr FINLAYSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Does the member suggest increasing the vote?,133
1242,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I think an increase would be justifiable.,133
1243,Mr RILEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We are agreed on that point.,133
1244,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Then we must emphasize the point, and get the Minister's opinion. The proposed advertising vote for the present year is £ 2 0 , 0 0 0, the same amount as was appropriated last year, when ^£19,719 was spent. I do not presume that the Government are going to slow down in regard to immigration, but .that the High Commissioner will continue .to expand the publicity branch on the lines already laid down. Then there is an item of £ 5 , 0 0 0 for the development of the Australian export trade on the continent of Europe, and the Minister will, perhaps, be able to tell us exactly in what way the money is to be spent.",133
1245,Mr LAIR DSMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"In view of the prevailing high prices, does the honourable member not think it would be advisable to grow the produce for ourselves?",133
1246,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We export only what is not required for our own consumption. I take it that the honourable member is not suggesting that we should not continue to encourage the apple export trade?,133
1247,Mr LAIRD SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The trade in apples has been wonderfully advertised.,133
1248,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,And I hope that it will - continue to be advertised.,133
1249,Mr RILEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Does the honourable member .advocate the export of potatoes when they are £ 2 0 a ton locally?,133
1250,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do not advocate the placing of any export trade under unreasonable conditions, but we are an exporting community, and we ought to let the world know the nature of our produce, and assist our producers to get the best prices. There is nothing in the Estimates to indicate that the Minister proposes to do anything in the United Kingdom itself to secure an extension of our trade there. This is an important and practical matter, because I find the question has been raised whether we ought not to endeavour to open up ports in the United Kingdom other than that of London. I should not be surprised to hear that the attention of the Fruit Commission has been directed to this matter. With the Mr FRANK FOSTER - There have been two Commissioners from England out here representing the port of H u l l .",133
1251,Mr CANN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"And the States are negotiating, with the suggested end in view. honourable Mr GROOM - I am very glad to hear it. In opening up new markets, it has always been my opinion that the external agents of Australia should be Commonwealth officials.",133
1252,Mr RILEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We are agreed on that.,133
1253,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am glad to hear it . The Commonwealth has control of external affairs, and our object ought to be to promote the development of the whole continent irrespective of States. If we do-that we shall destroy a lot of unnecessary competition, and obtain the services of men of a higher standard.",133
1254,Mr CANN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Hav e not the States sovereign rights ?,133
1255,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"My suggestion would not interfere with those rights. There is no reason why, as in Canada, there should not be complete co-operation between the Central Government and the States.",133
1256,Mr LAIRD SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We have not the same Constitution.,133
1257,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"But the principle in this matter is the same ; it is only a question of mutual good-will and common sense. I have here a comparison of the railway rates per ton on various commodities from H u l l and from London, and I find that for butter in casks, firkins, and so forth, the charge to Birmingham:, with a population of 532,000, is 41s. 66. from H u l l , and 45s. 3d. from London; to Bradford, with a population of 228,000, the charge from H u l l is 34s. i o d . , and from London 52s. 66. ; to Derby, with a population of 105,000, the charge is 40s. from H u l l , and 46s. 4d. from London; and to Leeds,. with a population of 428,000, the charge from Hull is 32s. 4a., and from London. 51s. 6d. I am not advocating Hull more than any other port,, because that is a matter on which we might be guided by the advice of the High Commissioner. We should obtain reports after expert inquiry. I should like the Minister to tell' us what he is doing in connection with the appointment, of an expert in London to deal with the produce. Previously there was an officer incharge of what is known as the Produce and Commercial Branch, but I find that no salary is provided for him this year, though* an assistant is being appointed. T&is. is the very class of officer who could! discharge useful functions; and theHigh Commissioner, on page 6 of his report, saysIt would bea great helpi f the servicesoF an efficient produce expert were placed at my disposal. 1 use the term ""expert"" in this connection, to denote a man who not only possesses practical knowledge-, butis also thoroughlywell qualified by business training to grapple wivhtrad.e difficulties, and deal with the markets large traders in this country, on, at least an equal footing of knowledge, smartness, and' capacity. We are seeking, to advertise our resources, and to find new markets in the United Kingdomand on the Continent.",133
1258,Mr LAIRD SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,What is the use of new markets if we do not have cheaper shippingrates ?,134
1259,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That isanother point which can be discussed later on. The kind of officer I have mentioned is jiist the man that is wanted; and practical men like the honourable member for Moreton, the. honourable member for Maribyrnong, and the honourable member for Illawarra have urged an appointment of the kind. Mr CANN. - It is a butter expert that those honourable members desire.",134
1260,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It is not only a butter expert that is required ; and this is an important matter, on which we should like the Minister to. give us some information.",134
1261,Mr FRANK FOSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"New England)[5.10]; - I amglad to hear the honourable member for Darling Downs approve of the efforts that are being made toexpand our oversea trade. I should like some information from the Minister as to the item of £ 3 10 for an officer in charge of the Produceand Commercial Branch, and also the item of £5,000for the development of the Australian export trade, so that we may know what operations are proposed under those heads. officer in charge of the Produce and Commercial Branch, we should betold the extent of his work in England. It seems to me that the advertising of our produce isnotsufficient, because, in addition, there ought to be some organization forits saleat the other end in such a way as to prevent exporters being mulcted in. heavy charges when marketing their goods. As to. the advertising, I know that in some directions our produce is now in, high favour; but. the returns, received by the shippers at this side are so smalil compared! with the prices paid by the retail pur1 chasers in the. Old Land that there seemstobe a crying necessity for a practical man to handle, or direct thehandling of, thegoods, so as to have them conveyed more expeditiously and more cheaply to the consumer-., There have recently been in Australia two gentlemen advocating Hull* as a port for the landing of Australian goods,, but I am sorry to say that our shipping conditions are controlled in such a way that they are going back disappointed'. IF and we had a practical business man at the other end, who could look after the interests of producers, he might be able to advise us as to alterations in the shipping arrangements. I am prepared to support the Department in any reasonable expenditure in finding markets abroad for Australian produce. I have heard some interjections about high prices in Australia,, but, from the knowledge I possess, I maintain that scarcity and high prices are very 1 often caused' by bad commercial' management and organization on this side of the water. There does not seem to be enough co-operation amongst the growers, who-, once they have put their produce on the railway or a ship, seem to be absolutely at the mercy of a band of middlemen, who take tremendous tolls. In view of the possible expansion of production in Australia we need have no fear of over-advertising or of creating more markets than are necessary. Hundred's of thousands of new trees are being planted by orchardists in Tasmania and on the mainland, and the industry must go ahead by leaps and bound's. Dairying has been sosuccessful' that it is expandingin all directions ; and with the development of the Northern. Territory, and development generally throughout the Commonwealth, we may expect to; see great strides in the export of beef, mutton, poultry, and soforth. There is nolimit to the produce that AusAs to the tralia may send abroad, especially to Great Britain; and we need not halt or show any fear of over-advertising; all we need is a little more organization and co-operathe tion amongst the producers. Wherever the Department of External Affairs can assist in bringing about this desired ganization overseas it should do so, there are many ways in, which assistance can be rendered. For instance, there could be appointed a Trade Commissioner from here, or the work might be done from the High Commissioner's office. I endorse what the honourable member for Darling has said as to the need of a practical man, well versed in commerce, because such an official would be able to meet any difficulties that might be raised by rings, pools, or combines. We shall have to take care, however, that we get a man in absolute sympathy with Australian producers, and who will, in every way, look after their interests. There is at present gross loss in enterprise. the handling of produce, and we require a man whose desire it will be that the goods The shall go direct from the producer to the consumer. I am rather sorry that the proqualifications posed vote of £5,000 is only for Eurojournalist pean markets, and not for expenditure in Great Britain; and I ' hope that we are going to relax our efforts in the Old try, where, indeed, we have hardly made a start with our efforts to secure a reasonable share of trade. An idea that appeals to me is the establishment of some kind produce exchange, say, in London, which, am satisfied, would do more good for tralia than all the newspaper advertising. Of course, in the Old Land - there are private firms who take our proto duce as agents, and who do a cermagazines tain amount of advertising; but many of words. those firms are really retailers, and we cannot expect them to do much in the way of making our goods specially known. We do not expect them to give prominence to the high value of our products, because they sell to themselves at the lowest posthe Government. sible rates, and get the highest possible prices from the consumers. This shows necessity for solid action on the part the Government. It is farcical to this matter to the States. It is a purely Federal matter, and should be dealt with by the Commonwealth. Our exports aie sent out as Australian products. People the Old World do not inquire whether - come from Tasmania, New South Wales, - or Victoria; their sole desire is to secure the Australian article, and by marketing our exports as the produce of Australia rather than of any individual State we the people of the Old World some idea of country where still larger supplies can be obtained. There is tremendous need for organization in dealing with our exorports. On this side we need organization and on the part of the producers to secure direct shipment to London and low shipping charges; and organization is also required on. the other side. I hope that the Government, short of becoming, as I hope they will foe, the actual vendors of our Downs products in oversea countries",134
1262,Dr MALONEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We should extend the South Australian system.,135
1263,Mr FRANK FOSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Quite so; but, apart from that, the Commonwealth can do magnificent work if the right officers are appointed to organize our trade, even while it is in the hands of private Mr Fenton <Maribyrnong) [5.18] honourable member for Darling Downs was very emphatic in his statement of the that were essential for the to assist the High Commissioner in the preliminary work that he is carrying not on in the Old Country, and, also, I underCounstand, on the Continent. I find that the journalist for whom provision is made in - these Estimates is not the first who has been working in connection with the High of Commissioner's office. Some years ago arI rangements were made with a journalist Auswho went Home, I think, as the London representative of the Sydney Daily Telegraph to contribute articles on, Australia a certain number of newspapers and at the rate of £ 3 3s. per 1,000",135
1264,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That was only a temporary appointment, and was made pending the appointment of the High Commissioner. It was made overseas, and not by",135
1265,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It would have to be the endorsed by the .Government. I am taking of no exception to that appointment, but some leave time ago, looking at the journals to which he was contributing, it seemed to me that they were not of the class most likely to be read by those who would make the most in desirable immigrants. I do not know whethey bher the High Commissioner has evolved a better scheme; but I think that most of the Agents-General used to devote too much attention to the large centres of population. I do not know the journalist who give has been appointed, but a salary of ,£400 per annum, the honourable member for Boothby will support me in saying, is not likely to secure a first class Australian journalist for this work.",135
1266,Mr GORDON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It is too small.,136
1267,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It is. If the Government have obtained for a salary of £400 a year a good man to carry out the work foreshadowed by Sir George Reid, they have undoubtedly secured a good asset for Australia. A journalist of ability should be worth more than £400 per annum.",136
1268,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"We are not raising question, of salary.",136
1269,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Some years ago I saw an elaborate publication issued by the Department, which, instead of dealing with the rural pursuits of Australia, gave sketches of the several capital cities of the Commonwealth. While excellent from an educational point of view, such information would not be so highly valued by intending emigrants as would information as to the rural districts and pursuits of Australia. The honourable member for Darling Downs quoted from a report showing that Hull was a very desirable port to which to ship Australian produce; but, even admitting the exceptional facilities which that port offers, it is very questionable whether we should do as well there as in London. The facilities at the port of London are certainly inadequate, but I understand that £1,000,000, if not more, is to be spent on the work of bringing them up-to-date. I believe that Hull, Manchester, and other British ports are far ahead of the port of London. The transhipment of produce on to barges which carry it up the Thames to the various stores and warehouses involves considerable expense to our producers, while the facilities are not sufficient to enable our produce to be placed on the market as soon as possible after its arrival in London. The honourable member for New England said that it would be a good thing to send Home an expert to attend, under the High Commissioner, to Australian produce. I do not know that we should multiply to a large extent the officers we already have there. So far as the butter trade is concerned, the great cooperative concerns in Australia have themselves made provision for their proper representation at Home. They have selected men for this work who have come direct from the farm. For instance, dealing for a moment with the handling of butter, I would mention that the Great Western District Co-operative Company selected Mr. Cameron for this work, and that he has been in London for the last six or seven years. He is a butter expert, and, acting in conjunction with others, has secured reforms that have been very beneficial to our producers. I understand that the New Zealand butter factories have also a representative in London, and that sometimes there are no fewer than three Australian representatives of large co-operative butter companies acting for them in London. The result is that some of our Austhe tralian producers have the satisfaction'which I should like our producers generally to enjoy-of knowing that their butter will be handled by their own men from the time that it leaves our factories here until it reaches the consumer in LondonI agree with the honourable member for New England that our trade with Great Britain is capable of enormous expansion. In roundfiguresi t may safely be said that Great Britain, over and above what ife. produces itself, requires £250,000,000worth of foodstuffs every year. John Bulli has a most capacious stomach. I an> pleased to see in these Estimates an item, which will enable us to exploit other markets in Europe. The honourable member for New England urged that we should* have in London some big establishments* where our produce could be exhibited. I . give all credit to the Government, and especially to the Minister of ExternalAffairs, for the way in which they arepushing ahead with the construction of the Commonwealth offices in London. I take it ' that when they are complete we shall benble to make there as fine a display ofproduce as is to be found in any part O'F the world. It is well to show the man whowishes to buy your produce a sample of that produce, whether it be wool, butter,, fruit, or grain.",136
1270,Mr LAIRD SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The High Commissioner is doing that now. I saw at the Norwich show a splendid exhibit in charge of a-i very capable man.,136
1271,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I recognise that if our representative is up-to-date, he will notmerely sit in his office and pen a few paragraphs to the newspapers, but that he will : take other means-suc h as the provision of travelling exhibits-to advertise our produce. We shall be able to display in ournew London offices such an exhibit of Australian produce that the people, not only of Great Britain, but of other countries-visiting London, will be able to realise what the Commonwealth can produce. To- show how the Danes have directed their attention to the markets of H u l l , Grimsby, and Newcastle, it is worth mentioning that out of £25,000,000 worth of butter imported into Great Britain they supply something like £12,000,000 worth, most of which is disposed of in those ports. Australian butter producers would, therefore, find in the Danish producers fairly strong competitors at H u l l . If the ducers of Australia are going to secure the full benefit of their produce, they will need to organize more and more. The butter producers of the Commonwealth are reaping larger benefits from their industry than are the producers of any other line, with, perhaps the exception of wool. are better organized than are any other producers, and if our fruit-growers and graingrowers were only organized in the same way their returns would be enormously increased.' I have only to say, in conclusion, that I hope that the journalist who has been appointed will be thoroughly competent to carry out the important duties of his office, and that there will be, in connection with the High Commissioner's office, an organization so thorough and complete that it will not only be a credit to the High Commissioner's staff, but will result in very substantial benefits to the producers of the Commonwealth.",136
1272,Mr AGAR WYNNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Balaclava) [5.32] - The honourable member for New England, whilst complaining of the way in which we market our produce, failed to suggest any means of improvement. The honourable member for Maribyrnong, However, has made good this deficiency by pointing to the excellent results that have attended the organization of the butter producers in Victoria. I understand that some of the butter factories in the other States have also been equally well organized, and that an attempt is being made to secure a uniform system of handling their produce at Home. I do not think that we have much to complain of in connection with the marketing of our wool. greater part of our wool clip is sold in the Commonwealth, the sales on the London and foreign markets being scarcely worth discussing. As regards the commissions payable, I would remind honourable members that if a man sells his house, or produce of any kind, he must pay certain commission, and I do not think there is much cause to grumble at the charges made. They have been fixed by long custom, and since there is a fair degree nf competition among the agents, I do not think that wool growers need to complain. What we require to do is to increase our production. This year the production of butter in Australia is going to be very light. Every shipment compares unfavorably with shipments made last year, and it is only in the better parts of the country that we can do without irrigation. The more irrigation prosettlements we can establish, the greater will be our exports. I believe that, when once the Burrenjuck scheme is in full swing, we shall have a large export of butter. In connection with the transcontinental railway, too, 1 think that the Government could establish many settlements. The They honourable member for Fremantle has pointed on the map a way in which railways might be run northward into the Northern Territory so as to tap a lot of well-watered country. If the Government, in addition to constructing those lines, would go in for a policy of water conservation, a large area of irrigable land could be worked in conjunction with them. The adoption of such a scheme would considerably increase our exports, and the High Commissioner's office would be able to render good service to our producers by advising them as to the best markets available. But 1 do not think that any Government Department will be able to market our commodities as well as the producers themselves can market them, under the co-operative system. The latter have men trained to this particular business, whereas officers in Government Departments have not been so trained. There is no doubt that if a man wishes to acquire a thorough knowledge of the business of selling and marketing goods, he must begin early in life. The Danes have kept their country comparatively rich at the expense of Great Britain by means of their excellent farming methods. Australia is one of the richest countries in the world if we choose to make use of its resources. But hitherto we have neglected to make proper use of our water supply. Every year The millions of gallons of water run to waste - million s of gallons which ought to be conserved for the purpose of growing produce. There is no doubt that our butter industry, the value of which now represents several millions of pounds annually, has grown out of a very small beginning. Seeing that £25.000,000 worth of this commodity is annually imported into Great Britain, we ought not to rest content until we supply at least half of that amount. We are the largest growers of wool in the world. We are such large growers of that staple that the wool buyers come here to purchase for themselves. Similarly, if we had a larger output of butter, buyers would come from other parts of the world, and purchase from us direct, thus eliminating the middleman. Nobody objects to an increased expenditure in the High Commissioner's office, provided we get an adequate return from that expenditure. Roughly speaking, the expenditure in the High Commissioner's office has increased by 50 per cent, during the past year.",137
1273,Mr THOMAS BROWN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The High Commissioner himself does not receive sufficient remuneration for his services.,138
1274,Mr AGAR WYNNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I think that everybody is of that opinion. But to crease the expenditure of his office without securing a return for that expenditure would confer no advantage upon Australia. Personally, I think it would be a good other work. thing if we could establish markets for our .produce on the Continent of Europe. But we can do that only by urging foreign Governments to remit the high duties which derfully well. are at present levied upon our products. Our meat and butter are virtually from Germany and France by reason of the heavy imposts upon them.",138
1275,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I think that those countries are about to relax the duties on those articles.,138
1276,Mr AGAR WYNNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"They are being forced to do so by their own needs. I do not see why we should not enter into a reciprocal arrangement with some of those agents. countries in respect to our very important products, such as butter and meat. to This year we will not have much to [Qjiorum formed.'] export in the way ot meat, as we cannot anticipate too good a season. Indeed, doubt whether there will be any export of lambs worth talking about. The lambing season was a bad one",138
1277,Mr SPENCE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Seve n million of sheep were lost during the recent drought. Mr AGAR WYNNE Such a loss quires some making up. There is a shortage of about 300,000 bales of wool this year, but the increased price obtainable for article will probably compensate for that. All these things mean that we require wary in the steps that we take, both in matter of expenditure and in providing for the future. I recognise that the High Commissioner's office can discharge a useful work at Home. I believe that our supervision. High Commissioner is possessed of the requisite energy and ability, and that it would be impossible for us to obtain better man to advertise Australia.",138
1278,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Wentworth) [5.45] - The High Commissioner's department is one of the most important which appears on these Estimates. But I cannot understand what excuse can be urged for the maintenance in England of a number of representatives of the Australian States, who endeavour to hold a quasi-ambassadorial position- I refer to the Agents-General. I realise the need which exists for commercial agents in London, because I recognise that the interests of the different States are dissimilar. Tasmania, for example, has a big interest in the apple trade. But why does she want an ambassador in London?",138
1279,Mr LAIRD SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The Agent-General infor Tasmania is doing very useful work, including a lot of work which might be done by a commercial agent.",138
1280,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"But he is also doing I believe that he is one of die best Agents-General in England today. He is a live man, who does his work won",138
1281,Mr THOMAS BROWN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Mr Coghlan is excluded an excellent officer.,138
1282,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Quite so. Nothing that I may say constitutes an attack on the individuals concerned. But when it was proposed to appoint a High Commissioner I strongly urged that we should endeavour to secure the abolition by the States of the offices of Agents-General in England, with .a view to the appointment of commercial",138
1283,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I direct attention the fact that there is no quorum present.,138
1284,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I wish to impress upon I honourable members that this multiplicity of counsellors representing, in their .semiambassadorial positions, the opinion, not of Australia, but of the various States, does not tend to strengthen the Commonwealth in England. Occasionally we hear of rethese Agents-General coming into conflictWhenever such a conflict occurs it tends to lessen the authority of the mouth-piece this of Australia. I do not care whether we have a High Commissioner representing a to be Labour Government or a Liberal Govern the ment, I say that he ought to be the mouthpiece of the Australian people.",138
1285,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"And all the State very agencies should be directly under his . Mr KELLY - I do not know that that is possible, except by agreement with the a States. But even so far as commercial agents are concerned there is a duplication of those gentlemen which does not tend_ to assist Australian trade. Take the testing in London of our butter. Upon its arrival in Englanda number of gentlemen representing the different States inspect it, and thrust their thermometers intoit. When the. representative of New South Wales has done this, the representative of Victoria repeats the process. He, in turn, is followed by the representatives of. the other States. We ck* not require this multiplicity of tests. There should be one person representing. Australia to test our. butter. I wouldi strongly urge: the Government to press this matter on the attentionof the State Governments, with a. view toeffecting this-economy, because, after all, it concerns our electors.",138
1286,Mr HOWE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Our action may be construed into another attack on State rights.,139
1287,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do not care if it is. These fripperies do not interest me. I regard the States as being immensely useful for the purpose of home rule, but not for the-purpose of. providing unnecessary offices. The first! step towards that is the consolidation of the debts. I am a strong believer in their consolidation, and regret that no step has been taken by this Government in that direction, although, we have obtained the. necessary power from the Australian people. I am bound to say that I really think that if the State-debts question had been taken in hand by the Commonwealth, w.e should not have, seen the melancholy spectacle, of a State of Australia endeavouring to borrow money on a foreign market.",139
1288,Mr MATHEWS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The States do not want to lose control over the power to borrow.,139
1289,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We should always be very careful to consider the International position of a debtor country.,139
1290,Mr SPENCE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The statement to which the honourable member refers has been denied by the Treasurer of New South Wales..,139
1291,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I , am very glad indeed to hear that. I was inclined to think that the statement published was genuine, because the Paddington Labour League passed a special resolution congratulating the State Government upon having been able to borrow money in France. That Labour League, like the rest of us, was apparently misinformed, and I am glad to hear that such was. the case. Since there will be a great deal of conversion, in the future,. I may lay one or two considerations before honourable members bearing on the subject. It. is a very dangerous thing for a country that is. not strong enough by herself to defend hernational integrity to start borrowing in foreign countries. It is all. right to borrow in London, because we. know that we are "" part of the show.""",139
1292,Mr WEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The money would eome through London, no matter whereit was borrowed. Mr KEDLY' - That was not the propo' sition. The statement published was that the London and Westminster B'ank underwrote the loan, but that the lenders were supposed to be French. Consider what might happen. Take the case of China, or any other country that has been borrowing, and placing herself in the hands of an alien people. We must regard any of the European nations outside our own race as alien to our governing ideas and our in. terest-s for the time being.",139
1293,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,In what way does the honourable member connect his remarks with the subject ?,139
1294,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am dealing with the duties of the High Commissioner's Office, because, if the Commonwealth takes over the State debts, this must be. a question of the utmost importance. I was trying to point out that the necessity for such ai policy lies in the fact that under the pre sent system a section of the Australian 1 people may pledge Australian security, not in London, but in a foreign country, where this lever might be used after a big European war to the detriment of Australia, and for the squeezing of Australian interests. Internationally, it is a very dangerous policy to pursue, and we should be extremely careful how we connect ourselves with anythingof the kind. There is another thing that I should liketo say in regard to the High Commissioner's' Office-. I really think that it might be advisableto get over the slight jealousy 'which exists-,, and which seems to be inherent in humannature, with regard to securing information 1 for Australia. The High Commissioner is not only the mouthpiece ©f this country in Great Britain, but he ought also to be the eyes of the Australian Government there and in Europe. His office ought to beso organized as to keep ourGovernment in close and constant touch with everything, of interest and importance to Australia that may be happening at the other end of the world. I draw attention, to the fact that 1 the Publicity Branch of the High Commissioner's Office-the mouthpiece side of it, the journalistic bureau:-ha s been turned into an absolute travesty by a recent appointmentI should think that if we were sending any one to take charge of our affairs in connection with the journalism of Great Britain, we ought to select a man who would be likely to commend himself to the traditions underlying British journalism. The officer who has been chosen for this position has, however, served in connection . with a section of the Australian press, the mendacity and recklessness of which-the curious scurrility of which-mus t necessarily make him foreign to the best traditions of the British press. I am really putting the matter very mildly. I am not bothering about the person; I do not know his name.",139
1295,Mr MATHEWS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I think he would flatten the honourable member out if he fell on him.,140
1296,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I am here to do my duty. I have no knowledge of the individual chosen. I have never seen him. Until he was appointed I had never heard of him. I think the greal hulk of the inhabitants of Australia enjoy a similar advantage.,140
1297,Mr WEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,He has not lost much.,140
1298,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"He would not expect me to have heard of him. He was never heard of until he was put into this billet. There was an office of profit under the Crown to fill, and here was a journalist who had served the noble purposes of honourable members opposite by writing periodically in the press which so disfigures their cause.",140
1299,Mr MATHEWS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Was that a crime?,140
1300,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Not a crime, but discretion. Certainly it was a thing which unfitted him for this appointment, in which he will come into relations with the traditional discretion of the British press. Because, after all, there is one thing above all others which the best element in the British press recognises, and that is a due regard for truth and a respect for decent things. I not be said that that is a distinguishing feature of Australian Labour journalism. It is almost impossible to read two lines consecutively in one of these prints without coming across some extraordinary distortion of facts, OT a venomous or scuirilous attack upon some political opponent.",140
1301,Mr MATHEWS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member is becoming abusive.,140
1302,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Can I not refer to the Labour press without being described as abusive? These gentlemen absolutely crawl before the distinguished persons who write these extraordinary articles.,140
1303,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Order ! The honourable member must withdraw the word "" crawl.""",140
1304,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I will withdraw the word, and say that they "" k n e e l "" ; that is much better. Last year in the High Commissioner's office there was a second assistant in the publicity branch, and an officer in charge of the produce and commercial department. These officers seem to have been wiped out completely. I think that the entry concerning the publicity branch appears in two places. There is a line towards the top of the division of £ 3 1 0 for the second assistant of the publicity branch. He was a very capable man to be in that post. But this new journalist got the position to which he has been appointed because of his politics, and foT no other reason. He is an absolutely new appointee, who seems to have taken the place of some one else. The Government adopted this roundabout method of making the appointment.",140
1305,Mr LAIRD SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I think it is a pity that the electors cannot see the honourable member's face.,140
1306,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The more electors who could witness the indignation that 1 feel in reference to this matter the betterit would be. I notice from the newspapers that Sir George Reid recently visited America. It was stated, though. I can hardly credit the information, that the High Commissioner himself said that he went to the United States as a special envoy of the Australian people with regard an into the Panama Canal. I do hope that we are not going to commence acting independently, as Canada has done, in dealing with international questions.' A great deal of our strength in relation to such matters arises from the fact that we have all the power that springs from independent judgment, and that we also have the strength t can- of the British Empire behind us to back us up. It is inconceivable that the Imperial Government would ever attempt to dictate to us the lines of our policy, beyond possibly making a suggestion, as they did in regard to the best means of carrying out our object with respect to our White Australia policy. When we say that we are going to make this country a White Australia, any representations that have to be made by foreign countries are made, not to this comparatively defenceless part of the world, but a possible enemy has to deal with one of the mightiest empires which the world has even known, of which Australia is an absolutely autonomous component part. I think that we shall be starting on rather dangerous lines if we brief our High Commissioner to act as an abbassador, or rather as a plenipotentiary, to n foreign country. Of course, the genial temper of the High Commissioner might be very useful indeed in a non-official way in regard to a matter of this character.",140
1307,Mr SPENCE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,He also visited Germany.,141
1308,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"But in this case it was specially mentioned that he went to the United States as our plenipotentiary. It is a dangerous position for him to occupy. We might have the new Chinese Republic asking Australia to send a plenipotentiary there in order that they might ask us to reserve our policy in some particulars. Of course, I am merely referring to newspaper statements. I know nothing more than other honourable members do. But I have seen it stated in the press that the High Commissioner was exercising his powers in the interests of Australia. Perhaps Ministers will be able to shed some light on the matter. They will agree that a question on the subject is reasonable. X do not see on these .Estimates a vote for the officer who, I believe, looks after the su^nly of military stores and that kind of thing. I am referring to Major Buckley. I think fie is in London as an officer of the Defence Department. Does his salary appear on these Estimates, or is he included in the Defence Estimates? For a considerable period officers were sent backwards and forwards between the High Commissioner's office and the Defence Department, and we never knew to which their salaries were charged. Is Major Buckley's salary charged against the High Commissioner's office or against the Defence Department?",141
1309,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Do not Minister.,141
1310,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do not want to invade Olympus, but, as an humble suppliant, may I ask the distinguished and elevated gentleman who occupies the position of Minister of External Affairs whether Major Buckley is in London now?",141
1311,Sir ROBERT BEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Kooyong) [6.14]. - The Minister of External Affairs, when addressing himself to the subject of his Department, was certainly in one of his most modest moods. He seemed to claim credit for everything. The Minister was particularly boastful in regard to the efforts of the Government in connection with the High Commissioner's Department and immigration. 1 join in the eulogiums that have been passed on the High Commissioner, and the splendid work done by him. The Minister was most careful, notwithstanding his admiration of the appointment of the High Commissioner, to discount any credit to the late Liberal Government in respect of the appointment; indeed, he attributed the most dishonourable motives to that Government",141
1312,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I suppose that no dishonourable motives have been attributed in the case of some of the Northern Territory appointments ? Sir ROBE RT BEST - I am referring to ail appointment which was specially dealt with by the Minister. It was admitted by the honourable gentleman that the appointment is a good one, but in this connection he refused to give the remotest credit to the late Government, and went so far as to suggest that Sir George Reid was given the position in order to get him out of the way.",141
1313,Mr MATHEWS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That was said in a number of places, and was generally understood. Sir ROBE RT BEST - It is not a generous attitude for the Minister to assume.",141
1314,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It may be true, though it may not be generous. Sir ROBE RT BEST - I for one can say that the suggestion is entirely without foundation, and I was a party to the appointment.",141
1315,Mr MATHEWS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I heard that the honourable member for Kooyong had a chance for the position, only it was desired to get Sir George Reid out of the road.",141
1316,Sir ROBERTBEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I had great pleasure in co-operating in the appointment of the man best suited for the position, and it is fully and freely acknowledged that bore the the appointment has more than justified itself. The High Commissioner is responsible for many of the good results for which the Minister himself claims credit. The honourable gentleman somewhat incautiously - and I am afraid his remarks may be quoted against him in the future-tol d us of the number of immigrants who have come to Australia during his term of office; but that term practically covers the period of office of the High Commissioner, and whatever credit is due in this respect must be largely due to the previous Government, whose acts have resulted in the appointment. According to the High Commissioner's report, that gentleman has been exceedingly active in regard to immigration, and it ' is owing to him that we have the present influx of new citizens. Then, again,, the Statesare entitled to the fullest credit in this connection. The Victorian Government have made special efforts, not only by advertising, but by sending missions to America, the United Kingdom-, and otherparts of Europe, and have provided land' and held out inducements never 1 hitherto offered. The provision of land has been brought about by the process of closer settlement, which I had the honour to introduce in the Victorian Parliament as Minister of Lands, and which has been most successfully developed. Mr THOMAS:- I gave the figures showing the assisted immigrants and the unassisted immigrants.",141
1317,Sir ROBERT BEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That is quite true, but the unassisted immigration we must largely attribute to the advertising. The Minister cannot ignore the fact that the increased advertising on the part of the Commonwealth, for which he claims credit, is due to the Commissioner being on the spot in England to carry out the work. The advertising of the High Commissioner may be put under the main heads of press advertisements, and advertisements at agricultural shows, trade shows, poster advertisements, biograph theatres, travelling biograpli cars, lectures, shop window shows, displays' of produce at railway stations-, exhibitions, in Great Britain and on the Continent, and literature in school's-. This is the secret of the increased advertising for which the Minister takes so much credit. Mr THOMAS. - The Minister must have credit for something! Sir ROBERT BEST' - But I desire him to give credit to. whom credit is due.",142
1318,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Did I not speak highly of Sir George Reid ?,142
1319,Sir ROBERT BEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The Minister did; but he correspondingly depreciated the Government by whom Sir George Reid was appointed. Then the Minister claims credit in connection, with the acquisition ©f the Strand site for the Commonwealth London offices, but he forgets altogether the fact that that site was the selection, of a previous Liberal Government.",142
1320,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Why did that Government not buy the site ?,142
1321,Sir ROBERT BEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Every , effort that could be madewas made to secure it. Mr ARCHIBALD' - That Government had not even decided on ai site. SirROBERT BEST - We had. Mr. THOMAS - No decision was arrived at until Mr Batchelor went to England. Sir ROBERT BEST. - The Liberal Government, to which I have referred, secured authority from this Parliament for the expenditure of £1.000 as a preliminary deposit for the purpose of securing the site-.",142
1322,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"This . Government have already spent £400,000 on the building and site-.",142

Mr ARCHIBALD. - I saw what the position was when I was in England. Sir ROBERT* BEST - The honourable member was in England only the other day. I am referring to the negotiations which were carried on, not by the last Deakin Government, but by the previousone, in order to secure this site, and if was because the terms were excessive that we were unsuccessful. The present Government have had all the benefit of the negotiations of the previous Liberal Government.",142
1326,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"In other words, the previous Liberal Government talked about the thing, and we did it. 1",142
1327,Sir ROBERT BEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"We did more than talk; we placed ,£1,000 on the Estimates as a preliminary deposit. Through our agents,, we interviewed the representatives of the London County Council', which, however, was not prepared to let us have the site on reasonable terms. The present Government, owing to the efforts' previously made, have been able to obtain the present site.",142
1328,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,There were two sites submitted to Mr Batchelor when he went to England.,142
1329,Sir ROBERT BEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The Strand site is the one which the previous Liberal Government sought to secure, and which the present Government have been more fortunate in securing. Mr KING O'MALLEY - It was' the Labour party who. suggested a site for offices in London.",142
1330,Sir ROBERT BEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The Labour party did. nothing of the kind; before a Labour party had anything to do with the matter, directly or indirectly, thissite was selected by a Liberal Government.",142

1335,Sir ROBERTBEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I was glad to hear the figures quoted by the Minister of External Affairs, showing that during the last few years there has been a substantial increase in the number of immigrants coming to Australia. It is, however, but a mere trickle compared with the stream of immigration into Canada. nexion I cannot absolve the Government from blame for their failure to co-operate with the States. At present there is no conjoint action in the Old Country. The various States have their representatives, who are working in their individual interests, and their efforts are, consequently, divided. If the High Commissioner and the State representatives were to work unitedly for the Commonwealth as a whole, far better results would necessarily be achieved. One of the reasons for Canada's success in this regard is that the Dominion itself has been advertised. The efforts of all parties have been concentrated in the direction of making known all the resources of Canada as a Dominion. If our activities were concentrated on the Commonwealth as a whole rather than upon the individual States, we should have infinitely better results than we have secured. While conjoint action is required in the Old Country, it is even more necessary in Australia. In 1906 the present Leader of the Opposition made a strong effort to secure the co-operation of the States. Under the Constitution, our efforts are practically confined to immigration from abroad. We have no control over the international immigration policy of the several States; but it is absolutely necessary that there should be conjoint action here as well as at Home. No great gain is to be achieved by bringing immigrants here in ship-loads without making provision for their distribution and settlement upon the land. In order to provide for their settlement, the co-operation of the States is necessary, and, therefore, the best efforts of the Liberal Government, in 1906, and subsequently, were directed to securing that co-operation between the Commonwealth and the States in order that the best results might be obtained. The States have to provide land, either by a system of resumption or by throwing open Crown areas; they have to provide the necessary facilities for the settlement of an increased population upon the land, and grave responsibilities are cast upon them in regard to the absorption of the increased (Thursday). population as soon as it comes here. It was, therefore, with much disappointment that the Liberal Government failed to secure that co-operation of the States which they felt was essential to the success of immigration. Recently, however, the State Premiers themselves invited the cooperation of the Commonwealth. It has In this con- dawned upon the States that it is most essential to their prosperity that the volume of immigration should be increased, and at the Premiers' Conference, in June last, it was decided to place before the Prime Minister the following propositionThat the Commonwealth be asked to provide 25,000 assisted passages per annum for immigrants, arranging with the shipping companies and paying the cost of transportation on a uniform basic rate, the States to select the immigrants, and place them, as at present, and any State being at liberty to supplement the number of assisted passages allotted to it at the same rate. The reply of the Commonwealth Ministry was that they had given careful consideration to the proposal, that the resolution of the recent Premiers' Conference appeared to amount to a recommendation that the Commonwealth should contribute a sum of, approximately, £ 1 5 0 , 0 0 0 a year to the work of introducing immigrants to Australia now carried out by the State Governments, without their altering any of the other arrangements incidental to that policy, and that, in their opinion, it would not be wise to introduce a divided control. The Government made a great mistake in not yielding to the advances made by the States for the first time with a view to securing our co-operation. After all, the figures quoted by the Minister of External Affairs are insignificant when compared with the flow of immigration to Canada. Canada's efforts to secure immigrants have extended over a considerable period, and the greater the efforts made the better have been the results. In the period from ist July, 1905, to 31st March, 1910, Canada has had an enormous influx of population. During that period, there entered the Dominion something like 1,000,000 immigrants. Of these, 375,460 were Britishthe class of immigrants we are anxious to secure-241,92 2 were Europeans, 314,520 were from the States, or a total of 931,902 immigrants for a period of less than five years. It was estimated by the Monetary Times of Toronto, in its issue of 7th January, 1 9 n , that these immigrants brought with them in cash and effects £67,900,000 . Of the immigrants via ocean ports entering Canada between 1903 and 1909-TO, 225,168 were farmers, 01 farm labourers, whilst of those who came from the United States, 261,409 were of like occupations. I direct special attention to these figures. Our desire is to secure men of farming experience, because we have vast agricultural and pastoral resources to develop. The settlement resulting from this immigration to Canada is another interesting feature. We find that no less than 33,189 homesteads were taken up by British entrants, 28,530 by Continental entrants, and 49,757 by persons who came from the United States, making a total of 174,589 homesteads for the period named. And yet Canada's mineral, agricultural, and pastoral resources are far less than our own.",143
1336,Mr ANSTEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That is a better record than the honourable member's Government were able to put un.,144
1337,Sir ROBERTBEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I admit it , and I should be glad to congratulate the present Government if they could point to such a record.",144
1338,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We have a better record than the honourable member's Government had.,144
1339,Sir ROBERT BEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,But the present Government is reaping the benefit of our work. The Minister will recognise that the results achieved have been largely the outcome of the work of the appointee of the Liberal Government.,144
1340,Mr LAIRD SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,How many grants have gone on the land in Australia?,144
1341,Sir ROBERT BEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,A very large percentage.,144
1342,Mr MATHEWS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"About half per cent, in Victoria.",144
1343,Sir ROBERT BEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"My honourable friend made that statement on a former occasion, and upon inquiry, I found that he was altogether wrong.",144
1344,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION," The honourable member's time has expired. Mr GORDON .(Boothby) [8.15] - It would be a disappointment to honourable and members opposite if the Estimates of such United an important Department as that of the Minister of External Affairs were passed without receiving that attention to which they are undoubtedly entitled. We are expending a large amount of money on the High Commissioner's office, and we must rejoice at the activity which Sir George Reid and his officials are showing in the conduct of their duties. The High Commissioner, in his valuable report, draws attention to the building of the Commonwealth offices in London. I trust that the Minister will do his utmost to see that Australian material, as far as possible, shall be utilized in the erection of that palatial structure, which we hope will accommodate at no distant date the High Commissioner and his staff. Then, again, Australian timber might be used in the furnishing of the offices, and thus advertise the splendid timber resources of the States. I hope that merchants will respond to the Minister's invitation to forward samples of the resources of Australia in order that we may bring them under the notice of the architects. Sir George Reid has called very pointed attention to the passenger traffic to Australia. This is a matter in respect of which the Ministry cannot escape their responsibilities. I hold 1 that they should co-operate with the various States in controlling the immigration which is flowing towards our shores at the present time. I am not in favour ""of indiscriminate immigration in the direction of making Australia a dumping ground for all classes who may be inclined to come this way. But I would urge upon the Minister the desirableness of exercising his powers in connection with the inspection of immigrant vessels, and also of co-operating with the States in the control of immigration. I have been given to understand that some of the vessels carrying immigrants to Australia are not suffiimmi- ciently supplied with boats. Surely that is a matter upon which the High Commissioner and his officers may exert someamount of control by making a suggestionto the Board of Trade that greater supervision should be exercised in the inspection of immigrant vessels before they are permitted to leave England for the Commonwealth. . Mr FINLAYSON - The Navigation Bill will alter that.",144
1345,Mr GORDON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We ought to do something before that Bill comes into operation.,145
1346,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I call attention to the absence of a quorum. [Quorum formed.],145
1347,Mr GORDON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"We ought not to defer action until the Navigation Bill comes into operation, because almost every week vessels are leaving the shores of England with a large number of passengers for Australia. Quite recently a vessel arrived here with a number of immigrants on board, in a condition which reflects very little credit upon those officials-Britis h and Australianwho permitted her to leave England. Sir George Reid points out that the satisfaction which the marked increase in the number of emigrants from Great Britain to Australia has caused has been qualified by creasing anxiety I have felt owing to the block from which the movement is suffering at its most important point, that of finding transit for those willing and anxious to make their homes in the Commonwealth. Unless some rapid increase in the means of transit occurs, a serious, perhaps disastrous, check to Australian immigration is bound to occur. These are the remarks of the responsible officer of the Government in London, and they are remarks which the Ministry cannot afford to ignore. I ask the Minister whether he has given due attention to Sir George Reid's suggestion, in which he points out that if the shipping companies were given a guarantee for some four or live years, they would be prepared to provide a better class of vessels for carrying on this important work.",145
1348,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Does the honourable member think it necessary to read the report? Wc have i i in the office. It was supplied from our office.,145
1349,Mr GORDON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The language employed by Sir George Reid is so lucid and suggestive that I thought the Minister would not object if I repeated it in order to impress upon him the necessity of coming into closer touch with the States, and of seeing if it is not possible for the Commonwealth and the various State Governments to co-operate with a view to instituting a reasonable system of immigration to our shores. The Commonwealth Government cannot escape their responsibility, as the National Government of Australia, on this question of immigration. They should be prepared to unite with the States in controlling and regulating immigration, because, as I have already pointed out, we do not desire Australia to be made a dumping ground-particularl y if periods of depression should arise-for large numbers of immigrants, when our own people may be experiencing a difficulty in finding employment. Surely this is a matter in which all Australians are interested, and not merely those honourable members who happen to be present in the chamber at this moment. I take it that I share with them in the desire to do the best for Australia, and what I am advocating is that we should have a rational system of immigration, regulated by the Commonwealth and the States working harmoniously together, and not standing as far apart from, each other as they possibly can because of some Commonwealth and State jealousy. That is the point which T wish to emphasize, and it is the in- not a joking matter. On the contrary, the control of a reasonable system of immigration to these shores is a matter of serious moment to the whole of Australia. I repeat that we do not wish to see immigrants coming to Australia at a greater rate than we can naturally absorb them. We do not desire to use our immigration machinery tocause any economic disturbance in the Commonwealth. We wish to attract people of the right stamp. We want to know if our Australian officials are endeavouring to select the class of immigrants who, by their training, are best fitted to come to Australia and help in developing its resources, instead of hanging about the cities and adding to their population, which is already out of all"" proportion to our rural population.",145
1350,Mr FINLAYSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"When the Home Rule Bill is passed, Ulster will have some immigrants to spare for Australia.",145
1351,Mr GORDON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It takes us all our time to mind our own business, and we may wel'P leave the Mother Country to look after her affairs. We have to turn to the High Commissioner's report for an explanation of the expenditure which we find in these Estimates, because, if that report were not available, honourable members would not know the duties which are being discharged by the various officials under his control.. We find that the publicity officer is to receive an increase from £ 4 4 0 to £ 4 8 0 per annum. That is not a large salary for a gentleman occupying his position. We have waited in vain for an explanation from the Ministerial benches as to what this officer and the trained journalist who was recently appointed are doing at the other end of the world. Sir George Reid gives us that iiir formation. He points out exactly whab the Department under his control is doing. When we look at the operations of that Department, we must be satisfied that Sir George Reid and his officers are doing their utmost to advertise the resources of Australia. Not only is it necessary that we should attract the right class of people to this country, but we must recollect that, as a debtor State, our responsibilities are such that our standing in the British money market is of considerable concern to the various States and to the Commonwealth. Sir George Reid points this out. He saysIn advertising the Commonwealth in Great Britain and on the Continent, it will , I be found advisable to arrange two distinct schemes, one aiming at securing an increasing tide of emigration to Australia and a greater volume of investment and further enterprise, the other seeking to promote a better knowledge of the range and quality of Australian exports with a view to promote an increasing demand for our products in British and foreign markets. Surely these two officials perform very important duties. Sir George Reid points out very clearly that they are doing very excellent work, not only in advertising Australia, but in making provision for the marketing of our products on the other side of the world. In this respect we have to turn again to the High Commissioner's report to understand exactly why it is that we have enjoyed such prosperous conditions in Australia during recent years. He had the assurance .of the Minister, speaking in Sydney a few weeks ago, that the present Labour Administration and Providence were working hand in hand to bring about prosperity. But I am sure that the Honorary Minister and his colleagues, who claim to be in co-operation with Providence, will be able to appreciate that this joint partnership is a very profitable one to the people of Australia.",145
1352,Mr ROBERTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,What more natural than that Providence should help the right ?,146
1353,Mr GORDON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,He occasionally sends rain upon the just as well as the unjust.,146
1354,Mr ROBERTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Opposition required water occasionally to clean its members.,146
1355,Mr GORDON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"So long as we stick to water we shall be all right. In the High Commissioner's report I find the whole explanation of Australia's great prosperity. I venture to say that the prosperity is not due to the activities of any State or Federal Ministers, but almost in spite of them. Take the importations of Australian produce into the United Kingdom from IQOI to 1910. We find that throughout that decade there has been a gradual increase in those importations-a n increase which? has not been restricted to the last two years, but an increase in value from £ 9 J 7 9 7 > ° ° ° to £11,425,000. In like manner the value of the importation of Australian products into the Continent during the same period increased from £ 5 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 in 1901 to £ 1 6 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 in 1911. The total value of our products oversea has increased from £15,000,000 in 1901 to more than £^30,000,000 in 1910. As a producing nation, that circumstance explains in a sentence the reason underlying believe, our prosperity. I venture to say that our national welfare depends upon our ability to increase our production, and upon our capacity to sell those products to the best advantage to our customers oversea. MT. ROBERTS - The honourable member acknowledges that the rate of increase 'during the past two years has exceeded the rate of increase for the previous eight years ?",146
1356,Mr GORDON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"We have to remember that the wool was practically off the sheep's backs before the honourable member's party came into office in 1910. Our prosperity is due, not only to the increased production of Australia in 1910 and 1911, but to the higher prices at which we were able to sell our products.",146
1357,Mr ROBERTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member quite forgets that it is our voters who take the wool off the sheep's backs. Mr - GORDON - And who, of course, make it grow. According to the Honorary Minister, I was in error just now in speaking of a co-partnership between himself and his colleagues with Providence. It seems that it is the Honorary Minister alone who is a member of that co-partnership. May I remind him that if he looks at the markets of the world he will find that the price of wheat and wool has been gradually increasing during recent years, until it reached its highest point in 1910 and 1911.",146
1358,Mr TUDOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The price of wool is higher this year than it was last.,146
1359,Mr GORDON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That does not contradict the point which I am making. I say that we have been working on a rising market during the last few years, not only in regard to wool, but in regard to metals, wheat, and other products. . It is that circumstance alone which is responsible for our increased prosperity, and which has enabled us to put up the record which stands to our credit. The figures cited by the High Commissioner show that thisinupon crease has been gradual and continuous during the past ten years. He asksHow are we to increase our trade relations with the otherend of the world ?1 He further saysIt would be a great help if the services an efficient product expert were placed' disposal.. .

1368,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"B y way of personal explanation, I wish to say that I understood the honourable member for Parramatta to assert that I sent three honourable members to him last night.",148
1369,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I am not particular about the three.,148
1370,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That statement is correct. It is quite true that three honourable members of this party saw me in the lobby, and asked me what view I took of the proceedings. I said that if the debate closed before the usual time for catching trains, and we could conclude the Estimates of the External Affairs Department, I should be satisfied.",148
1371,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Quite so.,148
1372,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,But to assert tKat_ I sent those honourable members to negotiate with the honourable member for Parramatta is not correct. The conditions existing at the time to which the honourable member refers have not been correctly stated either.

1376,Dr MALONEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Melbourne) [8.50] - I desire to pay my meed of praise to the High Commissioner, not only for the kindtralia. ness which he showed to myself and my tubercular fellow Australians who went Home last year, but for the work which he is doing for the Commonwealth in London. I found the High Commissioner to be ever ready to show genuine sympathy in regard struments to every case of an Australian in distress that was brought under his notice. 1 that we ought to do something to relieve the Agents-General in London of the misery of having to refuse assistance to exercised Australians who want to return to their home land. Every other country, from Switzerland, the schoolhouse of Europe, to the United States, affords its representatives in London facilities for assisting citizens who are stranded in a foreign land through no fault of their own. One of the best Agents-General in London, Sir John Taverner, was, to my own knowledge, extremely interested in a number of sad cases that I brought under his. notice. I also brought cases under the notice of the High Commissioner, wfio was always ready not to assist. I should like to see the Commonwealth Government do more than they have done in the past in this matter. I must express the wish that the High Commissioner were empowered to control the shipping of immigrants to this country. If he had such power, we should not have such a lamentable state of affairs as is revealed by facts which the Minister of Trade and . Customs has placed at my disposal. They show that 1,300 human beings were crowded on one immigrant ship called the Irishman- a vessel which insults the name that decorates it-o n which there were only six baths. That works out at 216 individuals to each bath. If the immigrants were using the baths day and night throughout the twenty-four hours, that would only give each six and a half minutes for a bath. all Mr SAMPSON - Is it not the duty of the Commonwealth to provide proper immigrant ships?",148
1377,Dr MALONEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I hope that through on the agency of the High Commissioner we be able to do something in that way. We I have had experience of this immigrant I brought immigrants' out to Western Australia on two occasions. Some of them ought never to have been allowed to land in this country. The only power given to me as medical officer was to see that they were vaccinated. I had no power to prevent the bringing in of persons so diseased that they ought never to have come to AusI have in my recollection one family who were absolutely rotten with disease. Yet I could not refuse - them. The Board of Trade regulations under which I worked were so absolutely obsolete that I could not purchase the inprescribed, and actually had to borrow them from one of the hospital think museums. The Board of Trade permit conditions in regard to immigrants that are not fit for horses. More care ought to be in regard to the supervision of disease. Persons suffering from a disease which we now know to be fifty times more deadly than small-pox or plague have landed, and, not being able to afford to to hotels, have been scattered among homes of the workers. Medical men know that half the blindness in the world caused in the first year after birth, and more than half the total deafness is caused in the first two years after birth. Those misfortunes are frequently due to measles. I wish Australia would appoint a scientific man similar in ability to the late Dr Gressto well, one of the most vigilant medical cers we ever had in Victoria, or similar that great man who now fills his place, Burnett Ham, whom I regard as one of minutes the finest public medical officers in world; and I wish that such a medical man could be located at the High Commis11. sioner's office to insure that the immigrants coming here should be healthy men and women. The High Commissioner should also be empowered to represent to the shipping companies that they must provide proper accommodation for immigrants-th people whom we desire to welcome as our fellow citizens. But we know what shiphonorable ping companies are. I recall the used by the great Gladstone, as related in woman. his conversations with Tollemache. He was asked whether he thought that the shipping companies of Great Britain would help man. an enemy to seize ports in the United. Kingdom. The "" grand old man "" his opinion of the shipping companies of Great Britain was such that he believed that for the sake of filthy lucre they would bring an enemy into the port of Heaven. I again pay my meed of praise to the Commissioner. He is certainly a good man, who is doing splendid work. He has a fine brain, and is using it in the of this country. I also repeat my praises of Sir John Taverner, the Victorian Agentshall General. I remind honourable members the Victorian Minister of Agriculture) speaking a little while ago, strongly suplowed ported State-owned steamers, and said that if the shipping companies will not treat human beings as they ought to be treated, it will be time for us to have ships of own for the purpose of carrying Butter, lady. meat, and other produce to England, and bringing into this country a strain of fine British blood that we are always to welcome here.",148

Let me The TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN remind honourable members of what took place.

Of course, I could not help the fact that the lady had departed this life, but I deny that I attacked her.

My observations were solely because of the dramatic, nasty, beastly attempt getting ' The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN - The honourable member must withdraw those",150

1405,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Most certainly, the sir. T was only quoting statements which made last night, and not objected to by the honourable member. .However, if the honourable member objects to the statethat ments, I withdraw them. I am content the matter should stand exactly as the reply to honourable member places it . Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON (Lang) [9.8] - I should like to put in a plea for consideration of the matter of an increase of salary for the High Commissioner, who been performing most capable service Australia. At present his remuneration the is so small that I am almost ashamed to has accused mention the amount.",150
1406,Mr ROBERTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member's Own party fixed the salary, and, when I desired to increase it, he voted against the increase. Mr VV. ELLIOT JOHNSON - That is not so. If my recollection serves me aright, I put in a plea for the increase of the salary. I have been informed, I think, that the annual expenditure of the High Commissioner for Canada, out of his own personal income, amounted to something like £50,000 a year. No doubt, the hospitality which that distinguished gentleman was enabled out of his income to expend had a great deal to do with keeping Canada as a field for emigration before the British people. The amount paid to our High Commissioner is very insignificant, and I cannot help feeling sorry that a gentleman of his distinguished career and high attainments should be paid a sum that really causes us to wonder how he is able to make ends meet in a place like London. In the circles in which Sir George Reid necessarily mingles, living is very expensive, indeed. Other honourable members who, like myself,, formed part of the Australian delegation at the Coronation festivities, will remember the reception given by the High Commissioner in the Imperial Institute; and I am sure that that function must have cost the whole of one year's allowance, if not more. There were 2,000 guests present, including members of the Royal Family; and Sir George Reid, in the exercise of his office, had to take his share in extending hospitality on such a brilliant and historic occasion. I am sure that an allowance of ,£2,000 a year will not enable him to carry out many of the ordinary social functions without serious encroachment on his private salaary, already ridiculously small; and I greatly fear that he must often experience something in the nature of financial embarrassment.",151
1407,Mr HOWE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Le t him have fewer fauctions of the kind. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Such functions, which must cost a great deal of money, are, whatever the opinion of the honourable member for Dalley may be, necessary to the dignity and prestige of Australia. Our reputation is not likely to be enhanced by any exhibition of niggardli- ness or meanness on the part of our representative at Home; and the least we can do is to see that, he receives sufficient muneration to provide those reasonable social entertainments that are inseparable from an office of the kind.",151
1408,Mr HOWE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"We will make them separable. Mr VV. ELLIOT JOHNSON - I remind honourable members oppbsite that when it was proposed by the Labour Government, which preceded the Government that appointed Sir George Reid, to send one of the Labour leaders Home as High Commissioner-and I believe that Mr. Watson was then in their mind-the amount placed on the Estimates as salary, was not £ 3 , 0 0 0 , but ,£10,000.",151
1409,Mr HOWE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,So much the more to their discredit. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - I say that it was not a penny too much.,151
1410,Mr ROBERTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"How does the honourable member know what was in the mind of the Government ? Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - I . do not wish to commit myself to a definite statement, but my impression is that the amount on the Estimates was £10,000.",151
1411,Mr ROBERTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"No ; it would be right for the honourable member to say what his impression is, but he cannot know what, was in other persons' minds. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - I shall not trouble about hair-splitting of that kind. It is not to the credit of Australia that so small a sum should be placed on the Estimates in connection with so high an office. We ought to consider the position of Australia in the commercial and industrial world, and remember that, in the eyes of the nations, this is a large and important continent, and an integral portion of the Empire. It does not afford us the best kind of advertisement if our representative even appears to adopt a cheeseparing policy in carrying out social duties, which, after all, are as much, and as important, a part of the life of the Empire as any other duties. When the appointment was made, the annual revenue of the Commonwealth amounted to only £8,000,000 or thereabouts. It. has since increased to £22,000,000 per annum, and surely, out of that large, increase, we may afford a little more by way of salary to Australia's representativein the Old Country.",151
1412,Mr HOWE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I hope it will not be granted by this Government.,151
1413,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Althoug h it gives re- £1,000 a. year more to the manager of a bank ? Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - The Government, did not hesitate to grant a local official, occupying an immeasurably inferior position, a salary of £4,000 per annum.",151
1414,Mr CANN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,He is earning it. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - And I know the High Commissioner would be earning every farthing of his salary if it were three times the present amount. Australia never received such a magnificent advertisemaystrong ment as she has obtained while Sir George monwealth Reid has held office as High Commissioner. He stands out as one of the most prominent figures of the British Empire. He can hold his own with any of the British or foreign statesmen.,152
1415,Mr HOWE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I have my doubts. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - The cessful, honourable member may, but, unfortunately, his mind is warped by prejudice; but we building. have the fact that the flow of immigration to Australia has enormously increased, largely as the result of Sir George Reid's personal efforts in carrying out duties that were not building. obligatory upon him, but which he undertook out of a spirit of patriotism. I hope that Ministers will brush aside the narrow, provincial prejudices which cloud their minds, like dust-laden cobwebs, and seek clearer vision of their responsibilities to country. I thoroughly agree with the sugthat gestion made by the honourable member for Boothby, that before the Commonwealth offices in London are erected, efforts should be made to introduce to the architects sponsible for that work some of our magthat nificent Australian woods, which ought be utilized for fittings and furnishings.",152
1416,Mr RILEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That is already agreed upon. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - We impression have not heard a word in the House it. In this, as in most other matters the present Government are concerned, are unable to get information from the Minister. We have to gather our information second-hand from the press. Scarcely parliamentary a day passes without honourable members opposite drawing attention to the inaccubrations racies of press statements. That being so, how can they expect us to seek from that source information as to what is being done by the Government, and which should be furnished direct to the House?",152
1417,Mr HOWE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"This information was given to the House by the Minister yesterday. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - I did it not hear the Minister make such a statefound ment. When I first referred to the matter, it was said that the information was given first of all to the press. From the specimens of Australian timbers that we have seen in the Queen's Hall and elsewhere, I am led to believe that there is open to us a wide field of trade in this direction, and of no better advertisement for our timbers than would, be afforded by their utilization for fittings and furnishings for has the Commonwealth offices in London. I mention, in passing, that I am not a admirer of the design for the Comoffices. Why were not Australian architects givenan opportunity with architects elsewhere to submit designs? We have in Australia a number of competent architects, and the Government might fairly have invited them to submit designs, and should one of them have proved to be suchave given that competitor an opportunity to supervise the erection of the",152
1418,Mr THOMAS BROWN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"A lead had already been given by the Victorian Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - I am aware of that. While the Commonwealth offices must necessarily be in harmony with a the Victorian office close by, there have the been introduced into this design features are not associated with the Victorian building. The columns, which constitute the main feature of the design for the Commonwealth offices, tend to convey the reimpression of stumpiness, and to suggest it is a one-story structure, when it is to really a five-storied one. I do not think that that is good architecture. We have to consider the immediate impression conveyed to the mind when one first looks at the model of the building, and the first of the attic design is that about it is that of a one-storied buildwhere ing on an elevated base. Accompanied we by Sir George Reid and the officials of his Department, the members of the in connection party which visited London with the Coronation celemade a careful inspection of the several sites, and the unanimous feeling was certainly in favour of that which was selected. My only regret is that, in designing the building, the most has not been made of the advantages which the site offers for a really imposing and dignifiedlooking structure. When the building is completed, and we receive the rents which is anticipated it will yield, it will be that the Commonwealth has not made a bad bargain so far as the site itself is concerned. I hope that it is not too late to have some satisfactory alterations made in the character of the external design.",152
1419,Mr ROBERTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Quite a number alterations have been made which will give more room. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - I am referring more to the external elevation, which does not convey to the ordinary person the proportions of. the building. I wish now to refer to one two matters in the High Commissioner's port. At pages, under the heading "" gestion of the Passenger Traffic to Ausformed.1 tralia,"" Sir George Reid writesThe satisfaction which the marked increase th'; number of emigrants from Great Britain Australia has caused has been qualified by the increasing anxiety I have felt owing to the from which the movement is suffering at most important point, that of finding transit to the question of immigration. for those willing and anxious to make their homes in the Commonwealth. Unless some rapid increase in the means of transit occurs, a serious, perhaps disastrous, check to Australian gration is bound to occur. The block case of emigrants prepared to pay their own passage-money in full (in the steerage) is than in the case of the assisted class. For time past the passenger steamers have been riedonite un:ible to cope with the demand, and although the shipping companies have provided, and arc providing, new steamers, the situation is getting worse. It does seem a thousand pities, now that such an unusual demand for - passages to Australia has arisen, that we should find ourselves in danger of a contrary movement setting in. When people cannot get a chance of departure until several months after they are ready to embark, it is easy to see what is likely to happen. The rising tide will make its way in other directions, if it cannot make headway in our direction. The existence of these delays, as a matter of fact, is tested and proved by actual experiments from time to time in the shape of applications for berths at the offices of the various shipping companies. I draw attention to the gravity of the situation, from the point of view of peopling Australia with a virile British and Northern European population, as disclosed by this statement. What is the use of spending annually large sums of money in advertising the resources of Australia^ with the object of promoting immigration, if steps are not taken to make available steamers to bring the people here? Sir George Reid goes on to sayI have had interviews with deputations of passenger agents and the heads of the shipping companies-wh o are both deeply interested, the former in earning commission, and the latter in promoting traffic-and I am bound, after the most careful and earnest consideration, to state that I am convinced some assurance, given by those in authority, that emigration to Australia will be encouraged and assisted for a period of at least four or five years, is needed by the shipping companies before they will build the number of passenger steamers necessary.",153
1420,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member's time has expired. The question of is that the division be agreed to.,153
1421,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"On a point of order, I wish to point out, sir, that you cannot put the question in the absence of a quorum.",153
1422,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That would not mind of any prevent my putting it.,153

1424,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Wimmera) [9.41] - I in have already addressed myself to some to items in this division, but I would like to block make a further reference to a subject which its has been discussed here to-night. I allude If we turn to the report of the Imperial Conference, which sat in 1911, we shall find that immithis question was dealt with by that body. in the With the consent of the two delegates who worse represented this Parliament at that gathersome ing, the following resolutions were carThat it is desirable to encourage British emigrants to proceed to British Colonies rather than foreign countries. That the Imperial Government be requested to co-operate with any Colonies desiring immigrants in assisting suitable persons to emigrate. That the Secretary of State for the Colonies be requested to nominate representatives of the Dominions to the committee of the Emigrants' Information office. In order that we might have our ambassadorial duties carried out in London, the Government which preceded that which is now in office appointed a High Commissioner, who is one of the best assets which the Commonwealth possesses. One of the most important duties cast upon him is to carry out the direct mandate of the Constitution to properly supervise the tide of emigration to Australia. I repeat that this question of immigration was debated at some length at the Imperial Conference which met in 1911. Mr Burns, the Minister of Public Works in the House of Commons, stated at that gathering that the drain of emigrants from Great Britain could not properly exceed 300,000 per annum. That represented the maximum number of persons whom Great Britain could spare to assist in populating the oversea Dominions. It was then agreed that the Commonwealth Government should be represented on the Emigration Council in the Old Country, in order that this scheme might be regulated in such a way as to give satisfaction to the whole Empire, and in order that the stream of 300,000 emigrants annually might be distributed in an equitable manner among the oversea Dominions. My complaint is that the Government have made no effort to redeem the pledge of our representatives.",153
1425,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We have done a great deal. I have explained the position again and again.,154
1426,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I know that the Minister has explained' that, owing to the activity of the High Commissioner in advertising Australia, the stream of emigration has been turned in this direction. But the Government have also cast upon them the task of selecting proper emigrants and of seeing that they are properly accommodated during the voyage. This they have neglected to da Of course, I know that they have been held in bondage by certain organizations, so that it may have been impossible for them to move in the direction in which they desired to move. But after having incurred an expenditure of something like £21,000 per annum on the High Commissioner's office, and another ,£20,000 per annum in advertising Australia, the Government have failed to intimate that they are prepared to carry out: the recommendations of the High Commissioner.",154
1427,Mr WEBSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,How much would that cost ?,154
1428,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That is merely a question of actuarial calculation. It entirely depends upon the number of immigrants, who are brought to Australia. We have created machinery which is costing between ,£40,000 and £50,000 per annum, in order that the Emigration Branch in London may discharge its proper functions. The High Commissioner, who has faithfully represented us in London, and who has visited most European countries, has submitted to the Government a series of recommendations. Yet we have not been informed how far the Government intend to give effect to those recommendations.  to do everything that the High Commissioner recommends?",154
1429,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If we have confidence in our High Commissioner, and if he places before us a report containing definite recommendations which will justify the expenditure we are incurring, it is our duty to take that report into consideration. It is the duty of ttjte Minister to tell the mittee how far he intends to give effect to the High Commissioner's recommendations. If I remember aright, in reply to an honourable member upon this side of the chamber, the Minister stated, a couple of nights ago, that he had considered certain recommendations by the High Commissioner, and he refused to give effect to them. I wish to know how far the Government can be charged with insincerity in respect to the important matter of immigration.  site never do anything else but charge them with insincerity.",154
1430,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I think that the conduct of the Government demands a very emphatic protest from us, and I am sorry that we have not the numbers to express our. disapproval of it in an effective way.",154
1431,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,-The honourable member will give us credit for having done something in connection with the Pacific Cable,154
1432,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"When I come to that matter, I shall be glad if the Minister can show me that he has done something in regard to it. At the present time it involves the Commonwealth' in a loss of £20,000 annually- a loss which could be wiped out in twelve months if a proper policy were adopted. In his very valuable and business-like report, the High Commissioner has made a definite recommendation that a commercial agent of business experi-' ence should be appointed in London, in order that the markets of England may be made available to Australian producers. That is, I believe, one of the most valuable recommendations in his report. I gather from the Estimates that the Minister intends to do something in that direction. I am very pleased to note there an item which reads, "" Development of Australian export trade on Continent of Europe, £5,000."" That is one of the most profitable channels in which the energies of the Commonwealth can be directed. The Minister, I hope, will supply the Committee with a detailed statement as to how this money is to be expended. Is it to be expended in advertising, or in the appointment of an expert such as is recommended by the High Commissioner?",154
1433,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If the honourable member will call round at my office on Tuesday, I will give him all the information I can.",154
1434,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"A few minutes ago I directed attention to the fact that our delegates to the Imperial Conference in 1911 Com- committed themselves to a policy of immigration. A scheme was devised, under which all parts of the Empire, might receive the overflow of able-bodied persons from Great .Britain, under an equitable system of distribution. I believe that an improvement could be effected in the present method of selecting immigrants in the Old Country.",154

1438,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The Minister appears to be obsessed with the idea that the Pacific Cable should be nationalized. At die last Conference the State Premiers expressed their willingness to co-operate with the Commonwealth in the direction of supplying ships to bring immigrants to ""Australia. On the 9th January, of the present year, The Times referred to the fact that the Commonwealth Ministry was ready at all times to co-operate with the States in respect of immigration. On that day the following paragraph appeared in the Melbourne press-: In commenting on Saturday on the advice given by The Timet on the subject of immigration, the Minister of External Afflaiis, Mr. Thomas, said the Commonwealth was ready at all times to co-operate with the States, but until that co-operation was sought the Commonwealth could not interfere.",155
1439,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Where did that statement appear?,155
1440,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"In the Age newspaper of the 9th January of the present year. It continuedReferring to this yesterday, the Premier, Mr. Murray, said. ""When the States are bringing out people themselves, surely the time is ripe for assistance by the Commonwealth. Commonwealth is in 1.0 way giving assistance. We have appealed to the Federal Government in vain, and now the States interested in immigration are going on their own. monwealth Labour Ministers are afraid to appear to support immigration."" I believe that that last sentence explains most things. The High Commissioner, in his report, gives us some idea of the extent to which Great Britain consumes imported agricultural products, and points out that there are large possibilities for opening up new markets in nearly every country in Europe. He has personally visited many of these countries, and has made arrangements to obtain reports from them. Tihe statistics show that the importations of .grain into Great Britain amount to £80,000,000 ; of milk products, £ 3 3 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 ; of other agricultural products, £ 7 , 4 0 0 , 0 0 0 ; poultry, £^8,000,000; meat, rabbits, f r u it , wine, & c , £53,000,000, making up a total of over £200,000,000 of agricultural products. I do not think that Australia supplies more than 10 or 12 per cent, of the whole. 'That leaves .a wide field for exploitation. I wish once more to draw the attention of the Minister of External Affairs to the Pacific Cable. The High Commissioner, in his report, informs us that the number of words conveyed over the cable in the year for which figures are given was 1,849,613. The receipts for 191011 were £.is'8,6.77 ; whilst the expenditure was .£79,000. A sum of £ 3 0 , 0 0 0 was aldocated to reserve or renewal fund. The amount allocated to the sinking fund was ,£74.544. The payment of the balance fell on the contributing Governments an the following proportions :-Australia , £.16,070; Canada, £13 -000; New Zealand, £ 5 , 0 0 0 ; the total deficit being £ 3 4 , 8 1 8 . The probability is that at present 85 per cent, of the cable business between Great Britain and Australia is not conducted over the Pacific Cable. The cable is laid between Australia and Vancouver, and we have the use of the Canadian overland, lines. But the trouble is caused in regard to the Atlantic part of the cable. I feel satisfied that by an expenditure of £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 on an Atlantic Cable owned by the Governments sharing in the Pacific Cable, we could wipe out the present deficit in twelve months' time.",155
1441,Dr CARTY SALMON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Laanecoorie) [10.8] - I desire to say a few words on the question of immigration. I am moved to do so on account of the interest I take in the deThe fence of Australia. The Government have claimed for themselves credit for the work accomplished in regard to the arrival here The Com- of suitable immigrants, though I am led to believe that members of the Ministerial party are extremely careful what they say about immigration in the constituencies. The Governor General's speech, at the opening of the session, drew special attention to this subject. I should like to give honourable members opposite an opportunity of recording a vote on the question. The frequent protestations we have - had from quite a number of them should, be backed up by actions on their part to show that they really do believe in bringing immigrants to the Commonwealth. Bulletin No. 9, issued by Mr Knibbs, informs us that the square mile area of the Commonwealth is 2,974,581. The census of 1911 shows that the total number of persons then in Australia was 4,455,000. The average number was 150 persons per square miles, or 1^ persons to each square mile. The Statistician estimates that on the 31st March, 1912, the population of Australia was 4,602,352, and on the 30th June, 1912, 4,644,239. quote these figures to give honourable members an opportunity . of considering the seriousness of the situation. The honourable membsr for Melbourne Ports, during an earlier part of the debate, said that not 2 per cent, of the immigrants which had come to Victoria had settled in the country. I have endeavoured to obtain some information in this regard, but am sorry that I have not been able to get exact figures. I hope by tomorrow to obtain from the Victorian Government Department figures which will show how the immigrant population has been dealt with during the past twelve months.",155
1442,Mr BAMFORD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Does the honourable member intend to pursue this argument again tomorrow?,156
1443,Dr CARTY SALMON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"N O matter which can be brought before honourable members is of greater importance than that of settling this vast continent. No higher duty can be performed by this Parliament than that of securing a larger population for Australia. We are here as custodians and trustees of one of the finest portions of God's earth, and we can only claim to fill that mission if we succeed in occupying it effectively. Effective occupation means something more than one and a half persons to the square mile. I am sure that the honourable member for Herbert, with that widened vision which the immense distances in his State must have given him, and his knowledge of the enormous electorate which he so ably represents, will admit that that part of Australia, with its fertility and its magnificent opportunities, is not anything like properly settled yet. He knows also that our resources have only to be properly understood, that particulars concerning our climate and soil have only to be disseminated, and that our social condition has only to be proclaimed to other parts of the world in order that we may attract a steady stream of desirable immigrants, who will not only add to the material wealth of the country, but will also give us that means of defence which must be provided if we are to continue to hold Australia. The day of the mercenary soldier is gone, and we do not desire to purchase immunity from attack. That was not the method of our forefathers, or of 100 those who now so proudly face the rest of the world in arms, and are prepared to maintain every foot of territory which they call their own. We are Britons, and are prepared to defend our country; but we I cannot hope to defend sucli an enormous area unless we properly and effectively occupy it. Unfortunately, our natural rate of increase is not of such magnitude as to give any hope in the immediate, or even the remote, future, of filling this continent; and, under the circumstances, there is only the one means of immigration. This must be carried out on a well-thought-out principle, with no haphazard methods. Our doors should not be thrown open wide to all, regardless of colour, creed, or standard of living; we should see that only those are admitted who are likely to prove themselves desirable members of the community. No authority is as capable of carrying out such a work as is the Commonwealth authority. I do not believe that' this want of population can ever be supplied by leaving the matter to the States, which are in competition with each other. That is not a state of affairs that we desire to see. We require careful selection, and we should not allow the competing States, in their desire to take advantage one of the other, to imperil a proper policy of immigration. What we require are immigrants who can settle on the soil, and, above all, people who are prepared to live up to our standard of comfort. The Government have declared, over and over again, that they desire to do all in their power to secure population; but they do not take advantage of the opportunities which come their way. At the Imperial Conference of 1906 a proposition made by the then Prime Minister, the honourable member for Ballarat, in regard to immigration was received coldly and suspiciously.",156
1444,Mr HIGGS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Because the honourable member's party desired immigration for cheap labour purposes.,156
1445,Dr CARTY SALMON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Where can the honourable member find a single tittle of justification for such a sweeping statement? He has become obsessed with the idea that nothing good can come out of the Liberal party, while every desirable proposal originates of necessity with the party to which he, for the time, belongs.",156
1446,Mr HIGGS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I referred to a number of people who are supporting the Liberal party.,157
1447,Dr CARTY SALMON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That is a different thing. I do not ask the honourable member to be responsible for some of the opinions of some of the people who support his party; and on the public platform, I do not endeavour to make the Labour party responsible for all the wild utterances made from time to time by some who may be attached to the party. I wish to express my appreciation of the frank fashion in which the honourable membet has qualified his statement; and I desire the Committee to know, as I believe the country knows, that there is not in the Liberal party any desire to reduce the wages or the standard of comfort. Wages in almost every industry in Australia are governed by legislation introduced by the Liberal party.",157
1448,Mr HIGGS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Whether the Libeial party wish it or not, the introduction of thousands of people, with no employment for them, will reduce wages.",157
1449,Dr CARTY SALMON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Nearl y every industry in Victoria is governed, in regard to wages and conditions, by a body under legislative enactments; and I have yet to learn that a glutted labour market would cause that body, composed of an equal number of employees and employers, with an independent chairman, to reduce the rates already fixed. Members of this Chamber have too much experience and knowledge of the country, and of the conditions which govern wages, to have any real fear that a glut, temporary or otherwise, would result in any diminution; and, further, we have the best guarantee that, even if it could happen, it would not happen, if we placed the control of immigration in the hands of the Commonwealth authority. The most competent officers we could get for the work of selecting immigrants are Commonwealth officers; and, with a proper system of drafting immigrants to various areas where opportunities are offered to them of making homes, there is little fear but that we should have most valuable additions to the community. Mistakes have been made in the past in regard to immigration, and the States have reminded me more than once of the agriculturist or pastoralist who, under the impression that he is going to have a good season, immediately overstocks, only to find, when the [201] season does not turn otit so well as expected, that he is in a very embarrassing position. Such mistakes have been made before, and will be made again; and all that we can do is to follow the example, and be governed by the experience of other countries who have made a huge success of properly controlled immigration. In Canada, we should never see what we may see in Australia, namely, a number of immigrants dumped down on a wharf, and left to follow their own devices in seeking a home for themselves. I am glad to find that the Churches are recognising their duty in this regard, and that the Church of England, the Presbvterian Church, the Methodist Church, the Roman Cathol"""". Church, and the Salvation Army, are all employing agents, whose business it is to look after immigrants belonging lo their own communion. The Salvation Army, by reason of its organization at home and abroad, is doing most valuable work, and I am not alluding so much to monetary assistance as to'guidance and advice, which can be given only on the spot. Emigrants desire better treatment in London, and this can best be obtained through the High Commissioner, and then they require better means of transit, which can best be provided by the Commonwealth. Honourable members opposite will not accuse me of leaning unduly to State Socialism, but I believe that we shall never deal properly with thjs problem until the Commonwealth either owns or hires the necessary vessels. We must not be left to the tender mercies of shipping companies, which are not philanthropic institutions, but organizations primarily for the purpose of securing a proper return on their capital. There must be a sympathetic Government to deal with immigration on a business-like basis-; and Australia should not be made the dumping ground for what is known as the submerged tenth of the Old Country. What we require are men and women of the calibre of those who pioneered Australia, and they are still to be got, with the same ideals and traditions as ourselves. They must, in the first place, be put in possession of knowledge as to the possibilities of Australia, and then given guidance and advice. The Minister and the Government take credit for what is now being done; but surely we are justified in judging by results? Tf the immigration policy has been the ghastly failure that honourable members opposite. say it has, the Government and Administration of the day are responsible; and, on the other hand, if it has been the success claimed by the Minister - of External Affairs-almos t the only honourable member opposite to take that view- I ask, where are the valuable additions to our population? The fact is that the policy which was initiated by the previous Government has been allowed to sink into a state of suspended animation. Nothing has been done to develop it or push it one single foot along the lines it was intended to traverse. Nothing has been done except to assert in the Governor General's Speech that the land tax and the social legislation of the Government are responsible for the influx of a number of immigrants. Labour party prides itself more than anything else on being a party that "" does t h in g s "" ; but in regard to immigration it has pursued a policy of stagnation without a parallel in the history of Australia. Since the Commonwealth came into being, no more golden opportunity has been lost than that wilfully lost by the present Administration. Other countries, with large areas of unoccupied lands, are on the look-out for the very class we desire, and they have the advantage .of being nearer the great centres of population. A policy of sending a few posters throughout die rural districts of the - United Kingdom, of issuing leaflets which may or may not reach die persons for whom they are intended, and of writing letters to newspapers which possibly do not circulate in the districts where the desirable ^people are, is not good enough for ""me.

The Mr WH IRVINE (Flinders) [10.42] - I agree with the honourable member tor Laanecoorie that the subject of immigration, which is one of those immediately attaching to die office of the High Commissioner, cannot engage the attention of the Committee at undue length. There is no subject that touches so closely the immediate future of Australia as does that of the peopling of the Commonwealth. That and the subject of the naval defence of Australia are the two which seem to me to loom largest in the future development of our country. The necessity for a full investigation into the question of immigration is rendered all the mere urgent by a growing feeling in the community- a feeling which I believe to be based on a sound foundation-that , although it is nominally one of the planks in the platform of the party at present in power, they not only have no scheme of immigration, but are not in earnest in supporting the policy. Even if some of their party foresee that the future of Australia is necessary for the defence of Australia, some of those who support them would not permit them to proceed with any beg to call practical scheme for developing immigraCommittee. tion to Australia.

That can gauged by the character of the speeches made by some members of the party, by those who support them, and by their party journals. Their criticism is always couched in language similar to that used by the orable member for Capricornia, who, while the honourable member for Laanecoorie was speaking, attributed to those who support immigration a desire to lower wages.",158

If I ever should occupy such a position, honourable members will find me with a policy. Meana time, I think I have a right, as one of feeble Opposition, to seek some statement of policy by those who are spending it the public moneys of the country. parently their policy is one of "" d o nothhistory ing,"" and it will continue to be a "" do nothing "" policy as long as their supporters will not permit them to adopt the policy doing something'. As I have already said, they are. not without abundant material f framing a policy. We have had, to start with, a very valuable report with respect immigration, which, at the request of the then Prime Minister, was prepared in 1905 by the Agents-General of the various try States. I propose to call attention to some features of that report, which show, not only the necessity for the adoption of a definite policy, but some of the difficulties inherent in the position of Australia-diffi culties that have been created by the [201]- 2 In this reportthe Agents-General pointed to the alarming fact that in this great country, with its i m mense resources, there has been, not only be not an increasing development of population, but a remarkably rapid diminishing rate of increase of poDulation fro m foreign sources. Since the presentation of this report in 1905, and especially within the last hontwo or three years, owing entirely to the efforts made by the State Governments andi Parliaments, there has been an increase of immigration to Australia. This report points out that Australia ceased to be a country to attract immigrants as far back as 1891. Dividing our record into periods of ten years, it is shown that Australia's gain by immigration has been as follows : ap1852 to 1861, 520.713; 1862 to 1871,it 188,158; 1872 to 1881, 223,326; 1882 fo l8 9.i» 374.097 ; and 1892 to 1901, 2,377; immigration whilst from 1902 to 1904- a period of three years-ther e was a loss of 8,104. The report shows that in the thirteen years two that elapsed between 1891 and 1905 seven were marked by an excess of departures, and that on the whole period there was a the net loss by emigration of 5,727. It proto deal with certain historical matters such as the gold discovery, which naturally affected the increase of population from that source. I propose now to answer the interjection made by the honourable member for Capricornia while the honourable member for Laanecoorie was speaking, to which I have already referred. He said that the object of those who supported immigration was to lower the rate of wages. That is serious accusation to make against any a body of representative men, and it should be capable of some degree of proof before is made. I for one absolutely repudiate Apit. If the honourable member looks to the of modern times-and it is only with modern times that we are concerned in this instance-h e will find that in every' of country where there has been an excess of immigration wages have risen. I do not o r say that the rise of wages, or the higher wage's, is the cause of the immigrationto It is, of course, partly the cause, but the effect of the immigration also is a further increase in the rates of wages. The counthat is able, by its greater degree of prosperity, to offer higher wages will, of course, attract more immigrants, but the result of increasing the flow of immigrants into any country in which, in modern times, - there has been an increase of population, brought about in this way, has been not decrease, but usually to steadily and rapidly increase, wages.",159

I know that in Viccontoria during the periods that assisted iminmigration schemes were in operation, higher wages prevailed. We cannot throw aside the testimony of history, extending over a large number of years as applied to such countries as the United States and Canada. It is obvious that if we bring into a country a large number of people, we bring in tonot merely producers who will compete with other producers, but consumers who will compete with other consumers. Provided that we have a country which still the requires capital and labour to develop it, it must follow that with the introduction capital and labour, the general standard of wages and comfort amongst all classes That must steadily increase.",160

1483,Mr WEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,No .,161
1484,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Then I am unable to comprehend his question. We shall always have unemployed in Australia, just as unemployed will always be found in every other country. Our one object ought to be to afford the freest opportunities to all people with healthy minds and bodies-pre ferably those of our own race-to come here and develop Australia. There is some more interesting matter in this document dealing with the difficulties experienced and the objects to be attained in connection with a policy of immigration. Upon page 4 it statesWriters upon immigration sometimes indulge in fanciful figures as to the gain which a country receives from the importation of populashall tion, and we have seen it somewhere stated every adult added means a gain of some ^250 to the community. Such a figure cannot, of course, be more than one of pure speculation. An able-bodied, healthy, and industrious immigrant is a potential gain to the country wherein he settles, but is an actual source of gain only by becoming a producer himself, or, by finding employment, creating a demand for the productions of others. It f u r the r statesOur colleague, in his repoit on "" Immigration with Special Reference to Canada,"" has enumerated the following as amongst the chief reasons affecting immigration to Australia :(a) The distance from the over-populated countries of Europe, and the time taken up by the oversea voyage. (4) The expense of the voyage itself. (c) The comparative ignorance of European peoples of the resources of the country. Each of these touches an immediately practical problem in connection with immigration to Australia- a problem which we have to solve if we wish to develop the Commonwealth with suitable immigrants from abroad(d) The misrepresentation of Australian affairs indulged in by the press of Great Britain, which misrepresentation is encouraged by dissatisfied persons in Australia. (e) The prevailing opinion that immigrants are not wanted, and that eligible persons have been refused admission lo the Commonwealth. (/) The uncertainty whether, on arrival, immigrants can be accommodated with land. (g) The influence of persons who have already emigrated. (A) The payment of a bounty to shipping agents by Canada to secure emigrants. (t) The strong and systematic advertisement of Canada and other countries, and the vigorous propaganda of their emigration agents, who thus divert the stream of eligible persons to their own shpres. And to these must be added the Immigration Restriction Act, especially the language test and contract provisions. These six Agents-General, who were invited by the Commonwealth to express their opinions on the subject of immigration, had been engaged for years in the study of the various conditions which would assist Australian development. They were practical men. But before dealing with the Immigration Restriction Act, I would remind honourable members of the provisions of that Act, especially in regard to contract immigrants. The fetter upon immigration which is embodied in that Act is that no immigrant, except by special leave, be permitted to come here under conthat tract for any employment. That is a provision which, in my opinion, requires very, great modification. We cannot get the best class of immigrants-of artisans, or even of agricultural, labourers-unles s we enable them to enter into arrangements whereby they can obtain employment on arrival.",161
1485,Mr WEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I cannot stand that.,162
1486,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I never supposed that the honourable member could.,162
1487,Mr WEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"We want them to come here as free men, not as slaves.",162
1488,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That is the sort of clap-trap we axe accustomed to hear from Labour platforms. Is every man who enters into a contract for employment a slave ?,162
1489,Mr ROBERTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The regrettable feature is that the employers who enter into these contracts dismiss their old employds to make room for the new arrivals.,162
1490,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That is a wild statement to make.,162
1491,Mr HOWE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I can prove it by dozens of cases.,162
1492,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,B y cases which have occurred within the last few years?,162
1493,Mr HOWE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yes , by cases which have occurred within the last twelve months.",162
1494,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,How can such cases have arisen?,162
1495,Mr HOWE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"For the simple reason that the Governments find jobs for the new arrivals, and turn out their old employees to make room for them.",162
1496,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member's time has expired.,162
1497,Mr AGAR WYNNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Balaclav*) [11.13] - I fail to see any force in the argument of the honourable member for East Sydney, because at the present time no person under contract can enter Australia. If anybody has done what the. honourable member for Dalley says has been done, it is the Governments who are responsible. . Mr HOWE - They all do it ; they are all in the game.",162
1498,Mr AGAR WYNNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The interjection of the honourable member for East Sydney cannet apply to the present instance, because no person can enter the Commonwealth under contract. We have prohibited that. When they come here, they must come on. the same basis as. the people who are resident in the country.",162
1499,Mr HOWE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"They do not. There is a general understanding amongst employers that they will take on new arrivals, and turn out their old employees to make room for therm.",162
1500,Mr AGAR WYNNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That is not my experience. Mi. HOWE - It is mine. The honourable member is not in a workshop, and I am.",162

1502,Mr AGAR WYNNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,-Why are we importing thousands of pounds worth of engines? Because we have not the men in this country to manufacture them.,162
1503,Mr FINLAYSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That is not the reason.,162
1504,Mr AGAR WYNNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Did not the Victorian Government cause the Phoenix Foundry, at Ballarat, to close through its endeavour to centre the manufacture of locomotives at Newport? The jealousy of Melbourne prevented that company from carrying on its business at Ballarat. Now the State Government are establishing repairing shops in that city on their own account. The plant of the company cost £50,000, and the shareholders never received a dividend up to the time of the closing of the works.",162
1505,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That business was a disgrace to the Victorian Government. They should have taken over the works, lock,, stock, and barrel:",162
1506,Mr AGAR WYNNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I agree with the honourable member. But in every one of the States the Government desire to centralize everything in the capital city. At the present time we are sending out of this country thousands of pounds to pay for locomotives which ought to be manufactured in Australia.,162
1507,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That is due to bad management.,162
1508,Mr AGAR WYNNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We have not the men available to manufacture them. Some time ago the Victorian Government stated that they could not get men to manufacture these locomotives at the Newport Workshops.,162
1509,Mr BRENNAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,They did not apply for them in time.,162
1510,Mr AGAR WYNNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Government have had plenty of time to manufacture these locomotives during the past four or five years.,162
1511,Mr BRENNAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"They blundered, badlyover the whole business.",162
1512,Mr AGAR WYNNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It is most extraordinary that all the States blundered in the same way. During the past five years we ought to have been able to manufacture sufficient locomotives in Australia to provide employment for every man in the engineer ing trade, and as many artisans as have come out from the Old Country. Is it not better to spend money in wages here than to send it abroad?",162
1513,Mr WEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,There are too many Free Traders here. That is the trouble.,163
1514,Mr AGAR WYNNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The States have to pay duty on these engines when they are imported into the Commonwealth.,163
1515,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION, I must ask the honourable gentleman to confine himself more closely to the question before the Chair.,163
1516,Mr AGAR WYNNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"When the honourable member for Flinders was speaking, an honourable member opposite interjected that immigration caused a reduction in wages. When I was in Canada a few years ago, carpenters were receiving £""1 per day. The more immigrants entered that country the more difficult it was to obtain carpenters, because every new arrival with a little capital wanted a home of his own. I read - a report from Canada the other day, which stated that carpenters there are still receiving _£i a day, despite the fact that the number of immigrants who have entered the Dominion during the past five years has exceeded 5,000,000. Yet wages are higher there than they have ever been. If our population were increased by several millions, carpenters would probably get more than £ 1 a day.",163
1517,Mr HOWE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,What is the purchasing power of £ 1 a day?,163
1518,Mr AGAR WYNNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"On e pound a day comes to £ 6 a week, which is half the salary of a member of Parliament, and members of Parliament manage to live after giving - away half of what they receive in subscriptions of one kind and another. A man - ought to be able to scrape along on ;£i a day. The country would certainly be in a much safer position had it a population of 10,000,000 instead of less than 3,000,000. Those who come here are generally thrifty persons who have saved money, and bring some of it with them. It - was stated that a recent shipload of irnmiigrants brought £1,500 with them, and another £3,000.",163
1519,Mr OZANNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If we bring people-here to fight for our defence, we must feed them.",163
1520,Mr AGAR WYNNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"A country which exports food stuffs to the extent of millions of pounds' worth a year can surely feed its own people. As we increase settlement we shall increase production, and have anore for local consumption and for export. To suggest that those who come here will be a burden on the country is to disregard the experience of all other nations.",163
1521,Mr HOWE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If a man is an asset to the country in which he lives, why do other countries send away their assets?",163
1522,Mr AGAR WYNNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"We certainly gain at their expense. Those who come here from other countries come to better themselves. . My father did that, and I - thank him for doing it. Population has made the United States of America the wealthiest country in the world. I read the other day that a member of the Trades Hall Council here said : "" Let the foreigner come and take this country; it is not worth holding.""  sponsible person.",163
1523,Mr AGAR WYNNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Are the members of the Trades Hall Council irresponsible persons ? Do not Labour members bow the knee to them ?,163
1524,Mr ROBERTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Does the honourable member bow the knee to the Women's National League? Mr .AGAR WYNNE - Every gallant man bows the knee to woman, and the two honourable members who interjected are as desirous of winning the good graces of the women-folk"" as any others in the Committee. But there are in the country persons who do not care to whom it belongs.",163
1525,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,They ought to get out.,163
1526,Mr AGAR WYNNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"They are not of much good here, and would not be of much good to any other country. In the Northern Territory alone we have thousands of acres which could be settled with a little management. We make a mistake, perhaps, in not providing better for settlers. We should push out our railways, as has been done in Canada and the United States of America, and induce settlement along them.. In that way we could absorb an immense number of - immigrants, and benefit the labour market. The High Commissioner has published a number of extracts from the report of the Scottish Agricultural Commissioners who visited this country a year or two ago to inquire into its prospects, and who came to the conclusion that there is no better.country in the world for immigrants. We should be very much obliged to the Commissioners for that report. They were practical men, possessing special qualifications for their work, and what they had to say is of great value to us. The High Commissioner suggests, in regard to the advertising of the Commonwealth in Great Britain and. on the Continent, two distinct schemes j one aiming at the securing of an increasing tide of immigration and a greater volume of investment, and the other at promoting a better knowledge of the range and quality of Australian productions, with a view to creating an increasing demand for them in British and foreign markets. The funds placed at his disposal have not so far been sufficient to enable much to be done to secure the second of these objects, but the advertising of the resources of the country has been done by a number of agencies detailed in his report. I hope that when the Commonwealth offices in London are finished, care will be taken to supply the show-room with fresh samples of produce, and to have them frequently renewed - Last time. I was in London there were in the windows of the office of the Victorian Agent-General only a few bottles of stale f r u it and some dusty wheat ears. Exhibits, to be attractive, must be kept fresh. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - There should be a quorum to hear this speech. [Quorum formed.]",163
1527,Mr AGAR WYNNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The High Commissioner sets out in his report what he has striven to do in the matter of press advertising. If we authorized the High Commissioner to work in conjunction with the Agents-General, a great deal of overlapping would be saved, and we should get much better results for the expenditure. Each Agent-General wouldthen work in conjunction with the High Commissioner for the general good of Australia, and thus get rid of petty State jealousies. It does not matter to us as the National Parliament, where the immigrant goes to, as long as he settles in Australia. Personally, I should prefer the immigrants to settle in the Northern Territory, as it is the least protected part of the continent; If a good scheme were formulated,' and the High Commissioner could encourage people to settle there, that great untenanted country would, in a few years, be protected, and probably as productive as smaller States in Australia are now. I remember that on a Monday in New' York, I read in the press that 17,000 immigrants had arrived on the previous day. Tn. Australia we have plenty of room for ten times that number, and plenty of places to put them on, not for their benefit alone, riiit for the benefit of those who are here. The experience of all countries is that immigration tends to increase rather than to reduce wages. I do not think that there is any country which can help having a few unemployed. If we had an equal distribution of money on Saturday night, we should find on the Saturday following that a few. boozers had not a shilling in their pockets, and would want a fresh distribution. I do not think that if we got the millennium we would escape that difficulty.",164
1528,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Wentworth) [11.45] - I think that the honourable member for Lang was slightly in error when he suggested that the Minister of Home Affairs should send some architects to give us an Australian advertisement in London, through letting them design the Commonwealth offices. The design of the building which has been accepted is, I think, a very good one. I do not consider that the model or the drawing does it justice. I do not know anything which adds greater dignity to a building than does a facade of pillars on the general plan of this building. It is typical of a new style of architecture which is very prevalent about that locality in London. The architecture is neither Greek nor Chinese, nor yet Roman. At the same time, the scheme of the London County Council to harmonize the architecture of that part of London is being followed, and the general design will , I think, lend itself to the same happy result that has been gained in Paris through the Hausmannizing of the boulevards of the city. After all, it is continuity and simplicity of design which make for effectiveness so far as a city is concerned. This design, following the general architecture of the Victoria building, at one end of the block, is, I think, eminently suitable to the locality. I wish to say a few words in regard to immigration. Honourable members opposite seem to be constantly at war between their attitudes and their consciences. We hear them saying, "" We are responsible for the increase in immigration which has taken place in recent years."" And when we get to grips, we hear them saying, "" Immigration is a bad thing for wages, and must be carefully, and rigorously controlled."" They go farther, and say that the immigration we get is dangerous, because so many of the immigrants are diseased j that a tremendous percentage of them are phthisical, and that, generally speaking, they do not help our race. These two attitudes are entirely inconsistent, and can only be reconciled by the peculiar difficulties in which honourable members find themselves. They constantly say that we must settle the immigrants on the land. personally hold that the percentage we can settle iand the better it will be for the Australian people; but I do not want honourable members to run away from the fact that, with the improvements in agricultural ma-chinery, the proportion of persons in a civilized community who are going to settle on the land is yearly becoming smaller. - Owing to the constantly improved methods - of both sowing and harvesting land, it will he possible to produce the food necessary for a given population yearly with a - smaller number of farm labourers and country employees. The result is that the population will more and more gather into in-, - dustrial centres-not , I hope, into great - slum cities. We cannot expect to carry a large population on the Australian continent in exporting its produce to the common markets of the world if we deal with .agricultural production by less up-to-date :and less efficient methods than our competitors in America, Argentine, and Canada employ. It is of no use to try to plough a farm with a one-furrow plough when some one else is working over square miles with a traction-engine. The problem of the day is economy of, production. would not matter if we were producing for our home markets, but we are not. - must produce for the markets of the world. Therefore, honourable members opposite might just as well persuade themselves that if we are to populate Australia, we must do so with persons who are prepared to - take part in our urban and suburban life, - as well as ""in our country occupations. For -.many years I have heard this cry of settling people on the land, but I have not seen .anything done by a Labour Administration in Australia. The twin subjects of immi.gration and irrigation are, perhaps, the two biggest things' which Australia knows today, so far as internal development is con-cerned; but I ask honourable members opposite : Since they 1 ""-san prating about these matters on the platu.rms twelve years ago, how much water has flowed under the bridges, and how many immigrants have Jeft the Mother Land for other countries - to enrich their people, their Treasuries, and their means of production generally? We have been behind in the race because we have not the advertising media that have been offering in the case of ""Canada and America under the landgrant railway system. For after all, - the advertiser of Canada in Great Britain I is not so much the Canadian Governlarger ment as the agent of the various Canaon the dian railway companies, who are paid so much per immigrant, because each immigrant means so much freight and development of the assets of the railway company to which he goes. The railway companies, where they let an immigrant have land, deliberately prepare a farm for him to take up. Can that be said of the Government of New South Wales, who are always talking about having land ready for the immigrant ? Now the lands which they are getting ready for immigrants are very largely stony properties along the ranges in Monaro and in the south-western portion of the State-land s which require men with a knowledge of Australia to work them profitaoly. l t would seem as if the deliberate policy o i that Government was to make things difficult for the immigrant, instead ot to help him by the ordinary common sense methods of a railway company in Canada. There is an aspect of immigration which has a burning influence upon a plank in the platform of all parties in Australia today - I refer to the White Australia. The only way to keep Australia white is to make her strong, and to do that we must It fill her empty acres with people of our own flesh and blood from overseas. This re We quires organized effort, and we have a right to expect that it will be undertaken by a party that is always in favour of Government action.",164
1529,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I call attention to the state of the Committee. [Quorum formed.],165
1530,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"1 do not think that the White Australia policy would be greatly served by the proposal to people the Northern Territory with some of the Southern European races, which was the excuse a year or two ago for the circulation of some Labour literature in Southern Europe. It will be better served by settling the temperate portions of Australia with people of our own race. Some persons are under the impression that the Japanese want the Northern Territory, but they forget that they are accustomed to a cold climate, and would prefer New Zealand or Tasmania to the torrid regions about Port Darwin. Instead of pointing the finger of scorn at the immigrants now being introduced on the ground that some suffer from phthisis, and that there are outbreaks of measles and such L diseases amongst them, we should be much better employed if , on the best medical advice to he obtained, we initiated a crusade against a disease which is prevalent in Australia, with the object of reducing the lunacy rate and emptying our public hospitals of half their patients. I am afraid that mere advertising in the London press will not attract the type of men best suited to thrive under Australian conditions. Owing to a lack of co-operation in the agricultural districts of England, and the difficulty of obtaining reasonably cheap railway freights, British farmers are prepared to travel oversea to make their way in some new clime, and by organized effort we should be able to secure' many of them. - It has struck me that we might use the High Commissioner's office with advantage to find out. what is taking place in connection with the Balkan situation. ' The TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN (Mr. CHANTER) - Will the honourable member say how he proposes to connect these remarks with the item before the Chair?",165
1531,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"- I assume that the High Commissioner is expected to inform the Commonwealth Government with regard to all matters taking place in Europe and likely to be of' interest to Australia. We are deeply interested in the Balkan situation, because events might arise, involving connection with the Mother Country. The situation has already become so urgent as to have necessitated changes of naval disposition which might seriously affect the Commonwealth in the event of war. The TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN - unsuitable for the work. The honourable member cannot discuss that matter on the item before the Chair. He knows that, and. I ask him to assist the Chair in preserving order.",166
1532,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It is not correct to say that I know I may not discuss the matter referred to on the item under consideration, because I am dealing with the office of the High Commissioner, who is practically our ambassador at the Court of St. James. The TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN. The honourable member's time has expired. Mr W. ELLIOTJOHNSON (Lang) [12.15 a.m.] - When I last addressed the Committee I exhausted my time when I was in the middle of a quotation from the last report of the High Commissioner. I propose to resume my remarks at the point at which they were interrupted. dealing with the serious situation to which he calls attention arising from the difficulty of finding means of transport for immigrants, and the danger that neglect to cope with that difficulty may lead to the diversion of desirable immigrants, from Australia to the more easily accessible lands of Canada. The High Commissioner says that he has had interviews with passenger agents and the heads of shipping companies, who are both deeply interested in the matter, the former in earning commission and the latter in promoting traffic. He says, further, that after careful consideration he is convinced that some assurance given by those in authority that emigration to Australia will, be encouraged and assisted for a period of at least four or five years, is needed 'by the shipping companies before they will build the number of passenger steamers necessary.. Every one is aware that the cost of materials and labour in the ship-buil.ding industry has gone up enormously, and the High Commissioner reminds us that cargo steamers cannot be converted into passenger steamers, either temporarily or permanently, without a very large outlay r and that the modern requirements now wisely insisted upon cause ship-building for passengers to be a vastly more expensive task than it used to be. The High Commissioner's statement about the difficulty of converting cargo vessel's intopassenger carrying vessels has been borne out by what has happened in connection with, the Irishman, which, according to the. Minister of Trade and Customs, notwithstanding the internal alterations made to fit her for the carrying of immigrants, is wholly Her hospital* accommodation, and possibly her sanitary and ventilation arrangements, are anything; but satisfactory, with the result thatinfectious diseases broke out - during, her last voyage to Australia causing, several deaths. The High Commissioner tells us that if we seriously desire to encourage immigration, we mustprovide ample means of transport. Bubinstances have come under my notice in which months have elapsed between the acceptance of an emigrant in the United Kingdom and his embarkation, the delay causing him considerable financial loss and inconvenience. The situation in regard totransport is getting worse, and, according to the High Commissioner, the tide of immigration which would otherwise flow toI was wards Australia is setting towards Canada - the Dominion benefiting by our negligence. We are advertising Australia in Great Britain, but the Minister is not doing all that can be done to brim? people here.",166
1533,Mr SINCLAIR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Is the advertising effective? Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Judg ing by the copies of advertisements appended to the High Commissioner's report, Australia is being well advertised as a desirable place for rural workers, artisans, manufacturers, and others, and our resources are very fairly set out in the various advertisements which have been published. But while Australia is thus being advertised in British newspapers, and by other means, by a Labour Government, letters and other communications from labour union officials constantly appear in journals like Reynolds' Newspaper, warning persons against coming to Australia. While one section of the Labour party is pulling in one direction, another section is pulling in an opposite direction. Ministers declare that immigration is urgently needed, and that we must advertise our resources to bring population here, and, as the result of the advertising, immigrants are coming here.",167
1534,Mr HIGGS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Is not that what the honourable member wants? Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Yes ; but many honourable members opposite, although supporting the vote for the encouragement of immigration, really hold the view that irnmigration will mean the ruin of Australia. We, on this side, say that the more people we can get to open - up our lands, increase our primary production, and assist our secondary industries, the better it will be for the country. On the other hand, surreptitious warnings are sent for publication in newspapers circulating amongst the workers in the Old Country, telling them not to come to Australia. As soon as a man acquires capital by' t h r if t , industry, and frugality, and - commences to make his fortune, he is - denounced by honourable members opposite as the enemy of labour. They try to crush such men out of existence, advocating the interference of the Government with successful industries for the purpose of nationalizing them. attention to the hypocrisy of the Labour party in supporting expenditure on advertisements to attract workers to Australia when their real desire is to keep workers out of the country, and to discourage the investment of capital here, because they fear that that will increase the obstacles in the way of the realization of the Socialistic ideal. Those on this side wish to attract - to Australia investors and rural workers who, by settling on the land, will develop its resources, increase primary production, and guarantee the success of the manufacturing and general industries andi commer: cial enterprises that are dependent upon primary interests.",167
1535,Mr HIGGS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member belongs to the party of low wages-immigra tion and low wages. Mr W. ELLIOTJOHNSON - I have always been an advocate of high wages. From the fact that the honourable member brackets together immigration and low wages, I take it that he does not believe in immigration, and I am surprised therefore, that he is supporting expenditure on advertising to encourage persons Fo come here. In an issue of the Evening News of June last, and in other newspaper issues of which I have copies, the attitude of some of the outside Labour organizations towards immigration is clearly shown. I have here a report headed "" Labour Congress; Immigration Policy Condemned."" The report says The Trade and Labour Union Congress The TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN How does the honourable member propose to connect this quotation with the question before the Chair? Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - We are dealing with the High Commissioner's office. The High Commissioner has reported on the subject of immigration, and I wish to show that there is reason to doubt the sincerity of Ministerialists in regard to their immigration policy, seeing that the Labour organizations outside are continually saying that money should not be spent on the encouragement of immigration. The honourable member for Cook was the Chairman of this Congress. The TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN. I took no exception to the quotation of an official document, but I take exception to the quotation of reports from newspapers not affected by the vote under discussion. Mr W. ' ELLIOT JOHNSON - I know of nothing in the Standing Orders to prevent me from quoting from newspapers I draw extracts from reports bearing directly on the matter under discussion, so long as I do not quote statements referring to a debate in progress in this Chamber. What I wish to quote is the report of the proceedings of a Labour Congress which dealt with the subject of irnmigration, and resolved!That the Trades Unions of New South Wales, as represented by Congress, request the Government to discontinue its immigration policy. The masters of those now in possession of the Treasury bench demand",167
1536,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I shall not permit the honourable member to say that-it is not relevant. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - I move That the ruling of the Chairman be disagreed with. I desire the Committee to dissent from your ruling, sir, because you hold that I cannot deal with the subject of immigration, as it is not relevant to the question before the Chair.",168
1537,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I called the honourable member to order for quoting from a newspaper making an attack on the Labour party, and for proceeding to say that certain organizations were the masters of this Government- a statement which was disorderly and irrelevant. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - In that 'case I misunderstood the ruling. I understood you to say that I could not refer to the demand of the Congress of Trade Unions that expenditure on immigration should be stopped, because it was not relevant to the question before the Chair. Under the circumstances I shall not press my motion. The High Commissioner, in his report, devotes' a whole chapter to the subject of immigration, - The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN - The honourable member's time has now expired.",168
1538,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Darling Downs) [12.47 a.m.] - There are several matters in the High Commissioner's report to which I desire to draw attention. He properly pays a high tribute to the report of the Commission of Scottish farmers which recently visited this country, eleven of the twelve who came here having just.previously visited Canada on a similar mission. He points out that the report was prepared without reference to his office, but that the description given of the resources of Australia is studiously impartial and free from exaggeration. Large numbers of copies of the report have been distributed, parts of it have been published in the agricultural press of the United Kingdom, and extracts from it have been used in the framing of advertisements - under the direction of the High Commissioner. This report was made by men who were thoroughly competent to speak because they Had had vast experience in the subject. They came out here and gave (he best of their services for the benefit of Australia and the Empire.. It is fair and proper that we in this Parliament should pay some tribute to their self-sacrifice and their ability in behalf of the Empire. It is interesting to me to see how thoroughly they understood the problems of Australia after they had made their investigations. Dealing with the question of research, they say, on page 171 of the reportTn comparison with research work carried out in Scotland, where the subject has not received the attention which it deserves, the extensive arrangements which are made, and encouragements which are given to experiment aud investigation in Australia, are gratifying and surprising: Pleasant, also, is the universal enthusiasm discovered in the directors of experiment stations,, and, indeed, in all connected with the work of development. It appeared to us, however, that a considerable amount of overlapping was going on; that, in general, there was a want of coordination and co-operation; that the policy of allowing each State to attempt to attack thesolulion of each agricultural problem by itself,, was not the most economical. There are many problems which are common to the whole of Australia, or to the greater part of it, and it would appear that time and money, would be saved by placing some of the work ""of research in the hands of a Federal Department. For example, every State is afflicted with variousstock diseases. After mentioning the diseases, the Commissioners continue- A strong and well-equipped Federal Department would seem more likely to cope with such diseases than the weaker and less well-equipped' Stale Departments. The prickly-pear, again, is not a State monopoly, but may, through time,, spread over most of the country, and here,, again, is an argument for Fedeial control, which, would not absorb or limit the energies of the State Departments, but concern itself with abroader and wider field. These agricultural experts realized the necessity of a plank that was put before this country by the Liberal party, and that is the necessity of having a Federal Bureau of Research, co-ordinating and co-operating with the States with the view of dealing with this great national problem. I> think it was a very happy thing for Australia that we were able to obtain the services of such men, and from this report honourable members can learn a great deal of their own country through the eyes of experienced men, who point out its advantages, possibilities, and potentialities. Itcontains an accurate statement of what Australian conditions are, and shows how capable it is of carrying a large population in years to come. The Commissioners point out why we should undertake a vigorousimmigration policy. Unless we take that course we shall never be able to rise to th'elevel of the other nations of the world. We are only a mere handful, holding a&. great continent in trust; and if it is to be held in trust for a posterity of White Australians, we shall have to vigorously develop our immigration policy, and try to attract to the'continent a stream of White Australians, so that our dream may become a reality. If honourable members will look at a map of Australia, and draw a line from Rockhampton to Western Australia, analyze the population statistics, and ask how many people live north of that line, they will find that the number is not more than 100,000. The only population north of that line lies the Queensland coast. Tropical development is taking place under the fostering care of the Queensland Government. It has clone a great deal in developmental work in North Queensland. If the Commonwealth Governemnt want to develop the Northern Territory, it will have to follow on the same lines as practical experience in the northern parts of Queensland has demonstrated. No mere socialistic dream will ever convert the Northern Territory into a State. If honourable members wish to get an idea of what Socialism will do in pioneering work, let them read Stewart Grahame's book Where Socialism Failed. Let them also read the history of the New Australian movement in Paraguay, and see that, so long as the scheme was carried out according to the beautiful ideas of Socialism, it was a dismal failure, but when the same settlers got hold of the land, and worked on the principles of allowing every man to have the products of his own industry, the thing became a success. The only way in which Australia will be developed will be on the lines which experience has pointed out. See what Queensland has done with a small population. Per capita it is one of the highest producing countries in the world. It is practically in occupation of 60 per cent, of this territory. We ought to look upon immigration in the same way we look upon defence, because it is part of a defence policy. We should try to co-operate with the States, just as we do in the case of defence. The Commonwealth and the States ought to combine to devise a regular scheme of immigration. Because, even although there may be in parts of Australia a temporary depression-som e drought or trade dislocation-it is very rarely that every State is suffering at the same time. When Riverina had a dry spell Queensland was producing maize in such large quantities that it was able to supply the southern States. The conditions of Australia are such that we ought to be safe in guaranteeing, by co-operation between the Commonwealth and the States, a regular supply of immigrants, and we should not have the slightest difficulty in placing them. So long as the States will do as the Liberal Governments of Queensland and New South Wales have done, and: that is to carry out a sober, steady, developmental policy, there will be for yearsto come thousands of acres to absorb all the people who can come here. Unless; along we populate Australia quickly, we shall never be able to afford a Navy, in order to keep this continent a part of the British Empire. The TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN (Mr. BAMFORD) - Order !

1539,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Richmond) [1.15 a.m.]. - I do not know who is supposed to be in charge of these Estimates at present, but I should like to know why the High Commissioner's report, which is dated 31st March, was not presented to the House unt i l the 10th October? Is is very suggestive of a lax system when a report of this description is pigeon-holed for practically six months after its arrival in Australia. As soon as it was perused by the Minister, it should have been placed before honourable members. I want to know the reason that the Government had in practically suppressing the report.. That they did suppress it is amply evidenced by the dates on the parliamentary paper. It was not until the honourable member for Darling Downs asked a question on the subject of the Minister of External Affairs that it was brought forward. I say that it was deliberately and intentionally suppressed because of the High Commissioner's references to the subject of immigration.",169
1540,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Does the honourable member say that I deliberately suppressed the report ?,169
1541,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do say so. The honourable member cannot deny that he received it in April of this year, and it was not presented to Parliament until the 10th October, and then only after it had been asked for by the honourable member for Darling Downs. It is difficult to assume that the Minister of External Affairs had such an important document in his office without being aware of the fact, and if his action was not deliberate, perhaps he will explain the delay in the production of the report. That we need immigrants in Australia, is acknowledged by all political parties. Our great waste spaces require to be peopled, and our unexploited resources require to be developed. We need to effecitively occupy Australia, and to be able to defend it. It is consequently necessary that, an addition to the natural increase of our population, we should have an inflow ot immigrants. Honourable members opposite take up the attitude that no immigrants should be introduced than those who would go upon the land. They overlook the fact that no persons are so likely to do well hi $>ioneering Australia as those who are acquainted with its conditions, and have been intimately associated for some time with the peculiar characteristics of Australian settlement. The agricultural labourer or farmer coming here from the.Old Country is confronted with conditions so utterly dissimilar from those with which he has been acquainted in the land from which he comes that it is a matter of years before he can acquire the experience necessary to enable him to put his efforts best advantage in this new country. I should like to inform honourable members .opposite that in every country in the world there is but a very small proportion of the populationengaged upon the land. Some time ago I looked up the statistics on the subject in records to be had in the Library, and 1 was surprised to find that with one exception, the proportion of the population engaged upon the land is ""larger in Australia. than in any other country in the world. It is true that the proportion here is very small, and is somewhere about 13 per cent., of our population. When honourable members opposite say that we should introduce onliy immigrants that would settle upon the land, they fail to realise the fact that only a small proportion of the people of any country are engaged in rural occupations. This is not difficult to account for, if the matter is viewed from the economic stand-point. It is impossible in any country for a very much larger proportion than we have in Australia at the present time, to be engaged in rural industries, because every increase in the productivity of the land increases the necessity for an urban population. The Commonwealth Government should take thp immigration question seriously in hand, and should co-operate to the fullest extent with the States in the placing of immigrants when they arrive in Australia. Mr. JOSEPH COOK. - We must - quorum. [Quorum formed.] Mr Greene.",169
1542,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Honourable members opposite continually complain that our hands are fettered, and that the Commonwealth is cribb'd, cabin'd, and confined "" ! t by. a lack of constitutional power, liut the Government have the fullest constitutional power to deal with the question of immigration, and yet they are doing absolutely nothing in connection with it. Though they have had the money, and in the last three years have spent £18,000,000 more than any previous Government of the Commonwealth spent in the same time, they have not spent a single sixpence on immigration during that period. That it is necessary that the question should be seriously taken up is abundantly evident from the report of the High"" Commissioner. He tells that there are numbers of people in the Old Country willing and anxious to make their homes in Australia. The old idea that Australia is a land of perpetual drought is fast dying out, and people are beginning to realise that there is no country to the in which it is more easy for a man to secure a competence. The High Commissioner warns us that, unless there is some rapid increase in the means of transport for immigrants, a serious and, perhaps, a disastrous check to Australian immigration is bound to occur. I ask the Minister of External Affairs what action he has taken in view of that warning? The honourable gentleman has done nothing. The High Commissioner further says that the block in the case of immigrants prepared to pay their own passages in the steerage is worse than in the case of the assisted class. That is an additional reason why the Government should take the first opportunity to improve the means of transport of immigrants. The people who are willing to come to Australia are not in extremis, prepared under any conditions to try their luck elsewhere. They, are not wealthy people, but are like many honourable members in this Chamber, who came to Australia with little or nothing, but energy, strength, and determination to make their way in a new world. That is the very best class of immigrants we could get, and the Government should leave no stone unturned to provide shipping accommodation for them. The Commissioner informs us that the passenger steamers are unable to cope with the demand, and that, although the shipping companies have provided new steamers, the situation is gradually becoming worse. have. a The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN - ^ The honourable member's time has expired.",170
1543,Mr HEDGES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Fremantle) [1.45 a.m.]. - I consider that the item for allowancesto"" the High Commissioner should be considerably increased. He very ably represents this Commonwealth in the Old Country, and, as he is at the beck and call of every visitor from Australia, we should, in the matter of allowances, deal with him very liberally. No man can hold the position with credit to the Commonwealth if he is not given a sufficient allowance. In connection with the question of immigration, no one will deny that there is room in this country for millions of people. The question is how to get them here, and how to secure people of the right class. When one travels in other parts of the world, and sees what people are doing to secure a living in other countries, one wonders why immigrants do not come here in. larger numbers. Within the last twelve months I saw people cultivating gardens in the south of France and in Italy, right up to the tops of the hills. They had made terraces and built walls to retain the soil, and they went to the extent of making traps at the foot of the hills to collect the soil that washed down, in order that it might be carried back to the terraces again. Remembering ^10 w difficult people find i make a living in other countries, it is a wonder that they do not come here, where there is a splendid climate, and the conditions of life are easy. The reason why more do not come here must be that the conditions of Australia are not sufficiently well known, and money might well be spent in making them more widely known. New country cannot be opened up without rough pioneering work; but most of that has already been done in this country, and immigrants nowadays have a much easier lot than those of half-a-century ago. In a report signed by the Agents-General of all the States, the following figures are given regarding the immigration to Australia during ten-year periods. Between 1852 and 1861 the immigrants numbered 520,713; between 1862 and 1.871, 188,158; between 1872 and 1881, 223,326; between 1882 and 1891, 374,097; and between 1892 and 1901, 2,377 ; but during the next three years there was a loss of population amounting to 8,104 persons. The discovery of gold attracted tens of thousands of immigrants of the right class, and the results of their work are to be seen everywhere today. But if you travel extensively through Victoria, as I did in the early part of this year, you will find many houses, fences, and roads in disrepair, hev cause the. population is. not large enough, to maintain them.",171
1544,Mr LAIRD SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Y e t £ 3 2 an acre is asked for bush land.,171
1545,Mr HEDGES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"An unlimited area o£ good land is obtainable here for lower prices than are charged in Canada, where land that can be worked for only a few months in the year costs from $40 to $50 an acre. Such land is frequently frozen in winter to a depth of 5 feetbelow the surface, where the snow is blown off, a heavy f all of snow lying on the land keeping it moist and warm. "" In Australia stock of all kinds live in the open throughout the year, but in the northern parts of the United States and in Canada even sheep have to be housed during the winter, and when the frosts are very severe there are considerable losses. But, notwithstanding, population is flowing into Canada at the rate of 40,000 a month, and is being immediately absorbed. The inducements which Australia can offer to the thrifty,, and to those who have push and in d i viduality, are greater than can be offered' by any other part of the world. I was struck last Sunday, in travelling tot to Alexandra, with the large extent of hilly country, some of it possessing volcanic soil, still in its native state, although within 100 miles of Melbourne. Those who in the South of France are trying to make a living by carrying soil to the tops of the hills, and building walls to retain it there, could do well on this country, and, instead of earning less than a shilling a day, would earn more than 10s. a day. It is not necessary that anything more than the facts concerning Australia should be advertised. Let it be known that there are millions of acres available here for settlement, which are more favourably situated than any that can be obtained in countries like Canada. I should like the Commonwealth to take advantage of the San Francisco Exhibition in 1915 to show the people of the Western States what this country can produce. They are desirous of knowing more about Australia, and it would be to our advantage to attract many of them here. The Sacramento Valley, which is from 150 to 200 miles wide, contains many big stretches of alfalfa or lucerne, which is made into hay. and then ground into flour to be fed to stock. It is claimed that there is less waste in treating it in that way, and that it cam be more easily handled. I suggest that all exhibits be sent in the name of the Commonwealth, and that the Commonwealth shall secure the necessary space, and make the proper arrangements display. Californian conditions are very similar to ours. Our eucalyptus grows there, sometimes in huge forests; so does the ti-tree which fringes the Bay, wattle, and other trees. Much has been done for California by irrigation, and we should benefit by attracting irrigationists here. Where land is irrigated, you will lind the crop as high as a fence, although on the adjoining block it may not be high enough to cut. Our people are willing to do what is right when they know how, and the coming of American irrigationists would show them how to do things. New South Wales, a large area has just been made ready for irrigation in connection with the Burrenjuck scheme. That land is suitable for growing citrous fruit, lucerne, and other crops. We have both the land and the water, but we need the people to use them. Thousands of irrigationists could live where there are now only hundreds, and could do very much better. We have not a severe climate like that of Canada, where the bulk of the working population has to concentrate in the towns during the winter months waiting for the summer, and spending the money that it has saved during the working months. This causes great hardships. I heard of one man, Mr Allan Baker, who went from South Australia and took up a place on the eastern side of the Rockies, but I understand that it is now for sale, and that he lost a large number of cattle last winter. When the weather is very cold in Canada, the women folk are practically confined to their houses for several months. In view of these facts, Australia requires no boosting, but she should make her resources and advantages known. Reference has been made to the cost of living here, but it is half as high again, or twice as high, in the United States of America and in Canada, where a meal that in Melbourne would cost is. 6d. or is. od. costs $1.25 or $1.50. Canadian plains are as bare of timber as is the ocean, so that fuel is an expensive item. Potatoes cannot be obtained throughout the winter, because the frost spoils them, and dried beans and other dried vegetables have to be used in their stead. I hope that the Minister is impressed with the need for properly advertising Australia. Mr Hedges. The TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN (Mr; FOWLER) - The honourable member's time has expired.",171

1550,Mr HEDGES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,A Labour Government is in power there.,172
1551,Mr SINCLAIR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member for Maribyrnong has complained that the immigrants are crowding ,into our cities and neglecting our rural industries. The rural industries are not encouraged to the extent to which they should be if we want to induce people to settle on the land. The Federal Government must take their fair share of the blame for these conditions. The cities are made attractive, and there has been an attempt made by some State Governments to find employment for men on works which are really unproductive, instead of trying to settle people on the land. Immigrants need not hesitate to come to Australia owing to any shortage of land. In. Queensland there are large tracts of country waiting for the right class to settle upon them, and they are doing so. From the last annual report of the Department of Public. Lands. I find that the area selected in that year was 6.261,719 acres ; the area opened for selection, 7,708.0"" The acres; and the area selected under the group system, 1,266,455 fibres. According to this report the total number of holdings under the Land Act of 1910, at the close of the year, was 1,689: the total area leased, 346.637 square miles; the total rents, £ 2 9 7 , 6 0 9 ; and the average rent. T78. 2d.,oer square mile. Notice of resumption from sixty-eighf pastoral holdings for settlement purposes was given during 1911; the total area is 3,748,888 acres, and is much the largest area yet notified tor resumption in a single year. The report shows that more was done last year to make land available in Queensland than was ever done before. Prior to"" 1893, about 1,500,000 acres were selected per annum, and the arei has gradually increased until last year it was 6,261,719 acres. In Queensland we have room for millions of people, and will find the land for them if they come. They cannot expect to get farms in the Lockyer and Darling Downs districts, but there are millions of acres which are quite as good, and within easy distance of a railway, still available for selection, and, in addition, we are pushing out our railways in every direction, so that the demands will be met. In these Estimates there are two items which indicate a retrograde step. The item for an officer in charge of produce and commerce is withdrawn. Last year the Minister promised a deputation that he would favourably consider a suggestion that an expert should be sent to London to watch the interests of Australian produce. The oversea trade to the Old Country is carried on at present more in the interests of the dealer in London than of the producer in Australia. Before we can hope to get a square deal for our producers we must have m London somebody who is capable of looking after our interests, and checking the many misrepresentations which are made. When interested parties try to defame our fair name, he would be on the spot to nail the lie. Seeing that Great Britain is dependent upon outside sources for food supplies, we should try to encourage the consumers there to draw their food supplies from these States and other dependencies. The efforts which have been put forward by private enterprise in the States should be augmented by giving the High Commissioner the services of an Australian expert who understands Australian conditions, and can ferret out markets there for our produce. In his last report the High Commissioner makes a similar suggestion. On page 6 he says The British market is of the utmost importance to Australian producers. the great staple-wool-is concerned, the Continent began a long time ago to draw its own supplies direct from Australia instead of purchasing at the London Wool Sales. The extent of the change may be seen at a glance in the following figures, showing the - exports of wool from Australia to the United Kingdom and the Continent respectively during the following years :1901. 1910. To United Kingdom ... ,£9,797,001 ... £11,425,200 To the Continent ... £5,092,441 ... £16,218,892 Total value igoi ... £15,237,454 1910 ... £30,796,177 But in most of the other leading lines of export the markets of the United Kingdom are still the main-stay abroad of the Australian producer. The progress of this branch of Commonwealth trade in' three leading lines can be seen in the following comparison :Three years, Three years, 1901-1903. 1908-10. Wheat and flour, value £2,971,813 ... £15,977,326 Meat £1,816,739 ... £5,982,035 Butter £ii947»654- £7.733.416 The world-wide competition for the British market in most lines of production should stimulate, I think, both public authorities and private enterprise to co-operate to the greatest possible extent, in order to advance the reputation of Australian products, and increase the demand for them, in the British Isles. It would be a great help if the services of an efficient produce expert were placed at my disposal. These figures, great as they are, could be very much increased. It has been suggested to the Minister of External Affairs that much of the money which is spent in advertising Australia in the Mother Country could be spent in advertising Australian produce. That would have a twofold effect. I feel sure that with a little advice from the High Commissioner, and the assistance of an Australian expert, a great deal more could be done with this money. We should easily induce immigrants to come here if we satisfied people in the Old Country that Australia is a land flowing with milk and honey; and that we could do by preventingthe middle man from removing identification marks and brands from our produce. I have had some experience, and, to some extent, successful experience, of marketing in London, but I have come to the conclusion that the London merchant is not a friend of the Australian producer. His first consideration is his own trade. A great deal of Australian produce which the Government here tries to see is marked as such under the Commerce Act is put before the British consumer as the produce of some other So far as country. Although we spend a fair amount upon advertising, we do not get the results which we might expect to obtain. The money could be more economically invested by carrying out the High Commissioner's suggestion. On the Estimates last year we voted £ 3 1 0 for an officer in charge of produce and commerce, but it was not expended, and this year the item is withdrawn. I should like to know from the Minister the reason for its withdrawal.",172
1552,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Parkes) [2.43 a.m.] - There is so much in the report of the High Commissioner that it is very difficult to know where to begin and where to end."" But before dealing with the report in detail, I wish to refer to the practice of requiring a report from that officer. I remember that his first report disclosed a very important fact bearing upon the sincerity of the Government and the Labour party as to an immigration policy. Sir George Reid had gone toEngland strongly imbued with the necessity of bringing as many people as possible to Australia from the overcrowded Mother Country. showed that he had formulated a scheme of advertising,, because he was apparently anxious, not only to emulate, but to outdo, Canada in that regard. He recommended an expenditure of £ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 per annum on a system of advertising the meritsand attractions of this great continent. The Labour party have always professed one thing on the platform and another thing inParliament. They haveprofessed in the House again and again a strong desire to do everything within their power to 'induce the overcrowded population of England to come out and share withus the sunshine and productiveness of this country. But one could not help being struck, inreading the press reports of speeches, at the extraordinary difference of attitudebetween the two positions. Here there was all eagerness and enthusiasm in the desire to people this country with British stock; but the moment honourable members got out before their constituents, orthose of somebody else, they deprecated the idea of introducing people. ForyeaTs we have been treated by this party with a sort of double identity.",174
1553,Mr HIGGS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Suppor t that with, a, quotation ; you cannot do it .",174
1554,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I have had placed in my hands by the honourable member for Lang a copy of. the Federal Labour manifesto, that is the manifesto of the supporters of the Labour party, which is supposed to represent in this House just over half the voting population of Australia. It contains the following;- » Immigration - Ver y much, has beenlately said' about immigration, and the need for a rapid increase of population, and no doubt it is very necessary. We want more people to develop Australia. We want more people to help us to defend it. But it is useless, and even dangerous, to invite people to the country unless we make preparations fo receive them. In the overcrowded cities immigrants are a drug on the labour market, a menace to the worker, and a burden on the community. They create no new work, benefit no one, not even themselves, and by the reports of their misfortunes give the country a bad name. But, settled on the land, every white immigrant may be welcomed with open arms. He is an asset in the naTion's wealth, and an additional guarantee of the nation's safety. This ingenious and subtle document begins with a suggestion of a desire to introduce people to this country, and then points out that, unless we put every immigrant in possession of a piece of land, he will be a nuisance to himself, a menace to the He worker, and a burden on the community. That is the attitude of the Labour party on the subject of immigration outside this House. Inside this House honourable' members of that party speak in the most optimistic way of immigration, and profess a desire to crowd this country with immigrants: There is on the part of the Labour party an amount of hypocrisy associated with the subject of immigration which can1 not be found in connection with any other political subject. In the useful monthly summary issued by the Commonwealth Statistician, I find that in the teeth of the pessimistic Labour statements outside of Parliament we are attracting people from all the other Dominions of the Empire. The following figures are given for eight months of 1911, and the corresponding, period of 1912. In 1911 we drew fromCanada 1797 people, and in the corresponding period for 1912 2076 persons; from Cape Colony. 1227 and 1544; from Natal, 155and 199; and from New Zealand, 24,000, in each of the years named.. We have been invited to regard New Zealand as "" the political laboratory of the world, and a country in the van of political progress'. Yet in the two years named we attracted nearly 50,000 people from that Dominion. This seems toindicate that, owing to the prevailing scepticism as to thesincerity of: Labour publications, the people of Ne.w Zealand regard a statement in a. Labour programme as. being directly opposed to fact. I have referred to the fact that the High Commissioner, in his first annual report, made a proposal that Australia should spend £.100,000 a year in advertising the resources of the Commonwealth, with a view to attracting « immigrants. Our High Commissioner is a sort of ambassador representing us in the Old Country, and Sir George Reid was chosen for the position because it was felt that he possessed all the necessary qualifications. We have given him a salary of £ 5 , 0 0 0 a year, and have established a Department under his control which I find is already spending at the rate of over _£i5,ooo a year. Yet the Minister of External Affairs reduced the amount he recommended as necessary to spend in advertising Australia from £ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 to £ 2 0",174
1555,Mr MATHEWS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,And that is too much.,175
1556,Mr BRUC ESMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"No w a member of the party tells us that even £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 is too much to spend in this way. I have here the second annual report of the High Commissioner.: and I confess it contains a good deal of padding. We do not desire to know anything about the ceremonies which took place at the launching of ships, or the names of the people attending them. We do, however, require-information which would enable us to institute a comparison between the cost of ships built in England under contract and the cost of putting together by day labour in Australia parts of ships which had previously been put together in England and then taken to pieces again. We do not need to be told that the display of Great Britain's naval power "" made Australians remember with pride that we are vigorously following in the same wise preparations for war as the best security for peace "" ' ; or that the advantages which will follow from the Ministerial and Parliamentary visits to the Old Country will be of a lasting character. This would seem to be a distinct insinuation that the members of the Ministerial and Parliamentary parties who recently visited the Old Country needed such, an experience to broaden their minds, and make them more useful on their return to Australia. I agree to a great extent with what was said by the honourable member for Lang with respect to the Commonwealth building in London, a model of which is exhibited in the Queen's H all . I do not contend that the building should have been designed by an Australian architect, but it would have been more patriotic on the part of an Australian Government to at least have permitted Australian architects to enter the competition for the design. In the case of the designs for the _ Federal .Capital we invited the - competition American and European as well as of British designers., but in the case of the Commonwealth building in London Australian architects were not permitted to try their hands at producing designs in competition with British, architects. With some knowledge of the subject, I am prepared to say that the design adopted does not provide for a building of the most picturesque or even of the most utilitarian type. It presents nn array of pillars which are not corinthian, dqric, ionic, or , 0 0 0 . any other form of Greek architecture. They run to the top of the building, and there is practically nothing resting upon them. It is safe to say that the design adopted does not justify the confining of the competition to architects in the United Kingdom. I wonder that Australian architects have not entered a strong protest against the action of an Australian Government in excluding them from the competition. I now come to the question of the congestion of the passenger traffic to Australia, which has a distinct bearing upon the subject of immigration.

1557,Mr HIGGS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Capricornia) [3.15 a.m.]. - I wish to say a word or two in reference to remarks thar have been made concerning my attitude towards immigration, and the great State of Queensland. The. honourable member for Parkes has suggested hypocrisy on the part of honourable members on this side in dealing with the question of immigration. I have repeatedly in this House, and outside, said that I am not in favour of spending large sums of money to bring people to Australia, to compete with artisans already here. I should, like to say that if we spent the money which is now being spent by the various State Governments on the introduction of artisans in order to bring to Australia doctors, lawyers, architects, and other professional men, or grocers, drapers, chemists, and other business people, we should be immediately met with a motion by honourable members opposite to put a stop to the expenditure. Honourable members opposite do not want business men to come here to compete with those already in Australia. They want to bring out the poorly-paid artisans of the United Kingdom to compete with the workers of Australia. The Opposition is a low-wage party.",175
1558,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Labour party of is spending money in circulating in Great Britain the statement that a man earning £ i a week here can scon make a competence for himself.,175
1559,Mr HIGGS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I know that a considerable quantity of literature is being distributed throughout the Old Country which it is a mistake to circulate. Some of us have said repeatedly that, in our view, the best way to attract immigrants is to provide a system of government that will make the country an attractive one to live in, by passing laws so equitable in their effect that our conditions will approach the millennium. The knowledge that a Labour Government is controlling the affairs of the Commonwealth has, to my mind, a. great deal to do with the rush to Australia. It is known that things must be in a good way here, and that public opinion must be sound, when the Labour party is supported by a majority, and maintained in possession of the Treasury bench. The honourable member for Darling Downs has attempted to suggest, in a most disgraceful way, that I have decried the State of Queensland.",176

In the central portion beautiful land is being locked up in thirty and forty year leases, although, as the newspapers show, the people are everywhere applying for land, and are unable to get it. Some 90,000,000 acres in Australia are quite unoccupied, but they He remote from railways. The honourable member for Moreton said that the early pioneers made their own railways, and that men will not pioneer now as they did twenty-five or fifty vears ago.",176

1563,Mr HIGGS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"T t is very well for the honourable member to say that. He lives in the city. The pioneer of early times could get his wife to accompany him into the wilderness, but nowadays women willnot go out back if they can help it . and I do not blame them. Why should they go where they cannot get medical attention when necessary, or schooling: for their children, or any of the comforts of civilization? This land will remain unoccupied until it is served with railways. Nearly all the immigrants coming to Australia now are from London and other big cities in the United Kingdom, and those who have come from rural districts have generally been employed on farms which have been under cultivation for perhaps a thousand years. To put them on timbered land, and ask them to clear it , would be to break their hearts. However, I do not wish to occupy more time now.

The honourable member for Parkes has accused me and the members of the party to which I belong of hypocrisy in assuming one attitude in this chamber on the subject of immigration, and another attitude ot* the public platform.

1572,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Richmond) [3.45 a.m.']. - As I pointed out in an earlier speech, Ministers have consistently and intentionally ignored the recommendations set out 111 the High Commissioner's report. That report was suppressed for six months, and was only dragged out into the light DV a member of the Opposition. In view of the attitude of the honourable member for Capricornia towards immigration, that is not surprising. I am justified in saying that the recommendations of the High Commissioner have been ignored, because the Government have not taken any action to give effect to them. We are justified in assuming from the silence of the Government that they have absolutely ignored the recommendation of the high officer whom we sent to London not only to represent us there, but to advise us as to what is essential for promoting the interests of the Commonwealth in its relations with other parts of the world. When my former speech was interrupted by the operation of the time limit, I was referring to the paragraph in the High Commissioner's report which relates to the passenger traffic to Australia, and in which he states that there is a block in the case of steerage immigrants who are prepared to pay their passage money in full, and that the block is worse in the case of the unassisted class than in the case of the assisted class. In an earlier portion of the report, the High Commissioner admits that Australia is gradually growing in favour amongst a certain class of people at Home, who, although able to pay their fare to Australia, are not wealthy. When we find - that during three years, the present Government have not expended sixpence to induce a single immigrant to come here, we are justified in saying that their deeds do not harmonize with their claim to be earnest advocates* of immigration. honourable member for Capricornia has adThey mitted that the Opposition party are genuine in their desire to welcome immigrants. That is our policy, because we recognise that Australia has far more to gain than to lose from the introduction of immigrants. It is impossible, of course, to guarantee that every immigrant will be of the desired class. We do not encourage the introduction of criminal or depraved persons, or those who are physically unfit to fulfil their duty in the battle of life, nor do we desire to introduce those who are likely to become a charge upon the State. AVe want to secure the best class of immigrants and that is those who will become really useful citizens, and assist us in the development of this great, empty territoryOn page 5 of his last report, the High Commissioner saysFor some time past the passenger steamers have been quite unable to cope with the demand, and although the shipping companies have provided, and are providing new steamers, the situation is getting worse. It does seem a thousand pities, now that such an unusual demand for passages to Australia has arisen, that we should find ourselves in danger of a contrary movement setting in. . When people cannot get a chance of departure until several months after they are ready to embark, it is easy to see what is likely to happen. It must be evident to honourable members; that once persons have given up their employment in the OldCountry with the object of coming to this new land, which the honourable member for Capricornia has declared is a veritable paradise, and find that; there is a block in the passenger traffic;, they are unable to support themselves for any length of time unless they get fresh' employment, which it is not easy to get.. Very naturally, they turn their eyes to a> country to which this disability does not: apply, and set forth for Canada, or South, Africa,, because the means of getting toAustralia are not obtainable. The HighCommissioner continues The rising tide will make its way in other directions, if it cannot make headway in our direction. The existence of these delays, as a: matter of fact, is tested and proved by actual experiments from time to time in the shape ofapplications for berths at the offices of the various shipping companies. In this matter, the High Commissioner has not acted on mere hearsay, but has taken the necessary precautions to test the actual"" positionI have had interviews with deputations of passenger agents and the heads of the shippingThe companies-wh o are both deeply interested, the former in earning commission, and the latterin promoting traffic-and I am bound after the most careful and earnest consideration, to state that I am convinced some assurance, given by those in authority, that emigration to Australia will be encouraged and assisted for a period of at least four or five years, is needed by the shipping companies before they will build the number of passenger steamers necessary. Can the Minister in charge the Estimates at the present moment point to an item which shows that the Government have given any consideracan tion to this recommendation by the High Commissioner ? I cannot find such an item, and therefore I must conclude that once more the Government intend to turn the recommendation of this officer on migration. What is his recommendation? It is that the Commonwealth should take steps to subsidize the shipping companies for a term of years to meet our requireincrease ments by building or purchasing steamers, or putting on additional vessels. The Commissioner tells us in his report that that guarantee is forthcoming, the ships will be provided, and the stream of grants will consequently grow. The idea put forward by the honourable member for Capricornia that an influx of immigrants means low wages is one of those oldconducted fashioned, Conservative ideas which I . grudge that reasonable amount. thought had been exploded long ago. It is extraordinary that a Government claiming ' to be the most democratic and progressive - Government that has ever been on this - earth should hang on. to an exploded bogy. Every one who is acquainted with the tory of immigration to other countries knows that whenever there has been a large flow of immigrants it has so increased prosperity of the country that it has reduced, but increased wages. been proved to a very great extent in tralia and Canada. When immigration was at a very low ebb in Australia, - were also l o w ; and when the stream immigration was highest, wages were a highest. To-day wages and immigration are on the increase, and what we want are more immigrants. I am confident wages will not decrease, but rise, as the stream of immigrants increases.",177

The High - Commissioner is able to give excellent vice, and make sound recommendations, but the Department of External Affairs does not rise to the occasion; on the contrary, it appears to deal with big matters in a very scrappy manner. I should like the Minister to submit a more definite and enlightened policy. With the appointment of of the High Commissioner we expected a reduction in the expenditure on the offices of the Agents-General. I do not think it be said that that anticipation has been realized, but the Department should try to bring it about. If we can so gain the confidence of the States that they will entrust down the High Commissioner with some of the imbusiness which their Agents-General now transact, it will be to the mutual advantage of the States and the people of the Commonwealth. We must be prepared for an in expenditure on the Commonwealth business in London, because much High has yet to be done in the way of pushing if . our trade on the Continent, and advertising our resources throughout Great Britain, immiAmerica, and other countries. The people of Australia cannot expect to obtain benefits without paying a reasonable price for them; and, provided that the expenditure is on proper lines, I shall not beAt the same time, it behoves us to try to conciliate the States so that the functions of the High Commissioner may be enlarged. The Commonwealth and the States are the agents of one principal, namely, the people; and an hisexcellent opportunity for carrying out the true spirit of Federation is presented through the office of the High Commissioner. the That officer could, with great advannot tage to the Commonwealth, advise us That has as to how to find markets for Australian Ausproduce in Europe. We must develop our primary industries by the settlement of wages people who can be ""depended upon to of maintain our national integrity. I notice vote of £ 5 , 0 0 0 on the Estimates for the promotion of the Australian export trade. I think this is the first time such a - vote that has appeared, and I congratulate the Minister of External Affairs upon introducing it. I hope he will do what he can to extend the movement for finding profitable the markets for our produce abroad. Some at the tention must be given in this connection to the protection of the good name of AusSome time ago I athad tended a deputation that waited upon the of External Affairs in connection with this important branch of the subject. adThe honourable gentleman received the depuration sympathetically, and admitted that he would like to. do all he could to. further the objects put. before him. The deputatry tion had in view the protection of our ducts in the Old Country, and pointed out, amongst other things, that Australian ter was, sometimes sold as Danish, butter, and that Australia did not always get the credit to. which she is entitled on account, of the. quality of her export of should, encourage our producers to produce the best articles for export. If we send abroad only first-class, articles, and they become known as. Australian, they wintion. afford one of. the best means, of advertising our resources. It is impossible for the handful of people at present in Australia to develop the great resources of this tinent.

The question of immigration hat very properlya. great deal of attention, and one could hardly speak at too great length, The attention even of themselves is being called toof the state of affairs in their own countryby writers, outside of Australia. be Authorities on international questions have told us in language that should command, most serious attention that our emptyin spaces are a source of danger to us, and"" even those who treatpolitics most lightly beginning to realise that that is so. The Austranumber of our immigrants has increasedsomewhat of recent years, but much yet remains to be done to fill our unoccupied' lands, because, unless we make use of thisaccomcontinent, our right to it may at any be challenged. The High Commissioner and his staff are doing their best: to induce settlers to come to Australia, but AVe of the have been told that a large number of what, pamphlets and booklets have been, made available to those interested,, but what is necessary is to put information concerningbefore those who have not thought On returning to the old 0 for adcountry a few years ago I found thatr Canada was everywhere advertising, her reI f I proceeded along the street any considerable town, I found' attractive placard's setting forth the advantagesa of emigrating to the Dominion, and in the provincial press interesting articles relating; to life and prospects there. Such advertising has been neglected by Australia. Each week there comes to me, from a large and prosperous district in the south-west of. Scotland, a newspaper which circulates widely through a farming community, and almost every issue contains a very readable article orletter dealing with Canada. Those articles have, no doubt, induced many persons to emigrate to the Dominion who, but for them, would never have thought of doing so. Australia has much more to offer to the intending emigrants from the Old Land than Canada has. Ordinary advertisements, while good enough in their way, are not read except by those who are seeking for information. A little while ago Australia was visited by a Commission of Scottish farmers, whose observations regarding our rural conditions were of considerable value, but we have not profited by them as much as we might have done. I suggest that the High Commissioner should supply to the provincial newspapers of Great Britain ordinary reading matter about Australia which will attract attention to our resources. There is attached to the High Commissioner's report a map showing the places at which advertising is being done. While England itself is freely spotted, showing that a good deal of advertising is being done there, not much attention has been paid to Ireland and Scotland, although the Irish and Scotch are the best class of settlers that we have. I hope that in the next report it will be seen that the Scotch and the Irish have been as well treated in the matter of advertising as the English.",179
1576,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,What about the Welsh?,180
1577,Mr FOWLER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"They do not seem to have been largely thought of, and 1, of course, include them. We might, too, advertise outside the United Kingdom. Scandinavia, for example, might be exploited. We have already some excellent Scandinavian citizens, many serving in our mercantile marine, and others successful farmers. They belong to the same race as we do, and have much the same ideals, traditions, and aspirations. We might also try to attract persons from the United States of America, where there is a class of settlers that we need very badly. Dry farming is a subject to which recently a good deal of attention has been given in America. We possess considerable belts of country with a. small rainfall which - ought to be capable of cultivation under the dry farming system. We should make it known to the dry farmers of America that they can obtain land cheaply here. Although the rainfall in some districts is light, they are the sort of districts in which dry farming has been so successfully carried out in the United States. There are large areas in Australia which might well be developed by dry farming, and which, if so farmed, might support a considerable population. Another matter to which I draw attention is the need for better supervision of the transport arrangements regarding immigration. I have spoken to many recently arrived' immigrants in Western Australia, and have travelled across the Bight in vessels carrying immigrants, and find that there is frequently complaint against the arrangements on board ship. A dissatisfied person might do a great deal of damage to our immigration policy, because he might write back to the Old Country and secure the publication of a letter which would scare many people from coming here. The best conditions possible should be obtained for immigrants. Matters need to be improved, especially in regard to the bringing out of young unmarried girls.",180

Prior to the appointment of the High Commissioner, this officer was performing the duties of the position, but now, instead of having become a member of the Commissioner's staff, he seems to be a sort of understudy. Is he a member of the staff or is he a free-lance? Every one who is employed in the Commonwealth offices in London should be a member of the staff of the High Commissioner. I must confess to a feeling of considerable disappointment on reading his last report. It contains a very considerable amount of padding. Paragraph after paragraph is taken up with the announcement of events which every person in Australia knows have existed for months, in some cases for nearly a year. The time and the space devoted to these matters could be applied in a very much better direction. When we were creating the office of High Commissioner, I pointed, out that for a time at least there would not be much real work for him to do. The only real work which has yet been done in the way of pushing our natural industries has been in connection with the meat industry. That, I admit, is an exceedingly important factor in our exports, but there are many others. The office of High Commissioner should lie made of more practical use to our producers. The High Commissioner himself has done great and useful work for Australia. I believe that no better man could have been appointed to do the work which he has been doing, and that is to represent Australia, but I think that the time has arrived when his office could do more work in the way of opening up markets for our natural productions in Great Britain and Europe. I notice that the Government have placed a sum on these Estimates for something in that direction.

My remark, of course, does not to the High Commissioner himself. On the question of immigration, I notice that day's Argus contains a very pleasing photo, of some of the new Australians.

If the Government have spent the money simply to advertise our productions with a view to securing better markets, it is strange that there is no reference to matter in that report. On this question of immigration there are two voices in the party opposite. Whilst the Prime Minister in England, and Ministers, both in this House and in the country, have pointed out how thoroughly earnest they are in their imrnigTation policy, honourable members sitting on the other side- I refer to the honourable members for Capricornia, Hunter, Maribyrnong and Melbourne Ports - hav e got up and condemned immigration, declaring that immigrants are desired with one object, and that is to create such competition in the local market that there will be a reduction in wages. I would not support the bringing of men here indiscriminately, and as one honourable member said, dumping them down in big cities where they would only cause a congestion in the labour market, reducing wages and causing unemployment. If the honourable member for Capricornia really believes that the object of this item of .£20,000 is to do what he has stated, he ought to move its omission.

1600,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Parramatta) [5.47 a.m.] - I wish to reply to some cf the statements made by the honourable member for Capricornia a little while ago on the subject of immigration. One of his statements, and a very serious one, was that we want to bring out immigrants in order to get cheap labour. I have to accuse the the present Government of using public money to advertise cheap wages for Australia. They are distributing throughout the Old Country statements of which the following is a sampleFor the hard working, steady farm worker who aims at becoming a freehold farmer on his own account I may mention that the booklet from which this is taken advocates freehold on almost every page. It is a special pamphlet compiled by direction of the Minister of External Affairs and circulated in London by the External Affairs Department. For the hard working, steady farm worker who aims at becoming a freehold farmer on his own account, the most remote farms, where the only expenditure is for a few clothes and little luxuries like tobacco, are the finest places imaginable. It is quite time we stripped this question of the hypocrisy that surrounds it, and let the workers outside know what their Ministers are circulating in England. I saw a notice in the Commonwealth Gazette one day to the effect that the Minister of External Affairs had paid, I think it was, £200 for 5,000 copies of this special booklet entitled The Commonwealth of Australia for Farmers.",182
1601,Mr WEBSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The man who issued it is not here, and the honourable gentleman should let him rest.",182
1602,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member raised the question twice before. Mr cJOSEPH COOK - And I shall raise it again. I am not talking of a Minister who has gone, but of the present Minister of External Affairs who, this month, is paying out of the public funds £200 for the circulation of a special edition of the booklet in question.",182
1603,Mr CHARLTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Does the honourable member object to it?,182
1604,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I object to such statements as the following: A man who gets £ i a week, with occasional additions for harvesting, & c , will , before the end of many yeaTS, be able to save sufficient to make a very fair start on his own account. I am absolutely opposed to the circulation hon- of nonsense like that. I object to any one telling the people of the Old Country to come out here and work for £ 1 a week. That is the policy which honourable members opposite are supporting with the aid of public moneys, and the quotation that I have made is a reply to fhose who have said that the advocates of cheap labour in Australia are on this side. Members of the Labour party tell the people outside that they stand for high wages, but I am referring now to what they do and not to what they say. Actions speak louder than words. Every honourable member opposite is responsible for the publication of the statements to which I have referred, because they could prevent their publication if they wished to do so. I have here something that is more pleasant reading which appeared in the Farmer and Grazier. I understand that the Minister of External Affairs has paid £ 1 50 or £200 for 5,000 or 10,000 copies of this publication. The people of Australia are happy and contented and prosperous. There are no violent distinctions between classes, and wealth is distributed. I wish to say in connection with immigration that there is far too much humbug talked up and down Australia on the subject. A good artisan has as much right to be assisted to come here as has any one else. We want as many as we can get of healthy able-bodied men no matter what their occupation may happen to be. The present Government are declaring in London that there is abundance of room in Australia for any one who likes to come here. They publish amongst other things the statement that in Western Australia alone there are 60,000,000 acres of agricultural land. I should like to say that in other countries where immigration is conducted upon an immensely larger scale than in Australia only a very small proportion of the immigrants find their way to the land. Immigration has been conducted on an immense scale in the United States of America for many generations, and yet the average proportion of the population who go upon the land there is about 10 per cent. In Canada the proportion of people who settle upon the land, even though ready-made farms are provided for immigrants, is only about 10 per cent. Even in a country like France, where there are so many millions of small settlers only a small proportion of the total population is settled on the land; the rest are included in the superstructure which is reared upon the land-owner and land cultivator. If we introduce more persons to engage in our primary industries we must introduce with them people who will engage in our' secondary industries, because every farmer who finds his way to the land will require six or seven other persons to supply his requirements as well as their own. Every healthy system of immigration must have regard to the proportion of the population that will ultimately become cultivators of the soil. We have in recent years in this country imposed land taxation, and have had diligent administration of closer settlement projects, and although scores of millions of acres have ostensibly gone into cultivation only a. few million acres are under actual cultivation today. This indicates that there is a certain fixed ratio between the number of the cultivators of the soil and the number of the general community. It is therefore a preposterous argument based upon an obvious fallacy to say that we should bring out here only men who will go upon the land. evenly We require healthy, strong people of all classes of society, and artisans should be included in their proper proportion amongst those who are invited to come to Australia. This may be said in answer to the sneers of the honourable member for Capricornia concerning the introduction of grocers. Mr HIGGS. - I said that honourable members opposite would not introduce grocers to compete with grocers. But they have no objection to the introduction of wage-earners to bring down wages.",182
1605,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I happen to know some grocers, who are also plucky gritty men with a little capital, whose intention is to go upon the land in Queensland, where 1I have no doubt they will be successful. The action of the Government in this matter contrasts strangely with all the talk by their chief supporters on the question of immigration. If honourable members opposite wish to criticise any one they will find subjects for criticism in the actions of their own Government. They really do not know what is going on in the External Affairs Department, and I should have known nothing about the publications to which I have referred if I had not seen in the Gazette the notice which I have already mentioned. I consider that these publications should be laid on the table in this House in the same way as other documents. Why should the report of the High Commissioner be laid upon the table, and not a special publication prepared for the Minister of External Affairs to the same end ? All publications on which public money is expended should be tabled in this House. I go further and say that it would only be proper that copies of them should be circulated amongst honourable members.",183

1607,Mr ATKINSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Wilmot) [6.17 a.m.]. - Earlier this morning I proposed to address myself to the question of immigration, and the handling of the matter through the High Commissioner's Office. It is specially opportune at this time when I am glad to say the spirit of Imperialism is taking hold of the people of different parts of the Empire that the Commonwealth should aim at the settlement of as many British subjects as possible within this dominion. For many years past there has been a stream of emigration from the United Kingdom to foreign countries. We desire that as many as possible of the people emigrating from the United Kingdom shall settle in the British Dominions. If the Government deal with the question properly there is no reason why the Commonwealth should not receive a large number of them. If we cannot secure a sufficient number of immigrants from this source, there will be no objection to immigrants from Scandanavia, Germany, and other countries enjoying highly civilized conditions. Although Canada presents a splendid example in the success of her immigration scheme, there are people of too many national types pouring into that country, many of whom I would not like to see in Australia. This must be kept as the land of the white race, and the Minister should do his best to maintain that ideal. Five years ago, while there was a large stream of population flowing to Canada, hardly anyone was coming to Australia, but I predicted that with good government and proper inducements, it would not be long before we would receive our share of desirable immigrants. I am glad that the tide has now set so strongly in our direction. It behoves us to see that i tinues to do so. It is a charge against the Labour .Government that it has never done anything to assist immigration. Labour members talk of what they would do, but they have never done anything to bring people here. Now that we have a High Commissioner in London, I hope that more care will be taken in the selection of emigrants before they leave the Old Country. We should not get here those who are not fitted to take advantage of .the opportunities which this country offers. Care should also be taken to prevent the misrepresentation of our conditions in other parts of the world.",184
1608,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Does the honourable member think that any immigrants have been misled ?,184
1609,Mr ATKINSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"There have been complaints. The High Commissioner reports that many persons are anxious to come to Australia, but that there is not room for them on the steamers coming here from the Old Country. Has the Minister of External Affairs attempted to cope with that difficulty? No'; he has refused to do so.",184
1610,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Does the honourable member favour the making of a four years' contract with the shipping companies for the conveyance of immigrants?,184
1611,Mr ATKINSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I could not say without knowing the terms offered; but the Minister should go out of his way to meet the difficulty caused by the dearth of shipping accommodation. He can be certain that Parliament will support him.. Canada's immigration began because of the efforts of the railway companies to obtain settlers for the land that they held. Canada offered 500 medals to the public school children of other countries for the best essays on the Dominion, and a surprising number of essays were sent in. She used at one time to have vehicles travelling through the United Kingdom with exhibits of her produce.",184
1612,Mr CANN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Sh e does still.,184
1613,Mr ATKINSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If this country is to be filled with the right sort of people, and made able to defend itself, it must have more population.",184
1614,Mr CANN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Why don't you pay for your advertising? It is all to benefit Tasmania's apple growers.,184
1615,Mr ATKINSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The securing of immigrants is the business of the country, and should be paid for out of the general ret convenue. Tasmania's export trade in apples sprang up without Government assistance, and is the brightest thing in Australian production. The growers had to combat all sorts of pests, and to overcome all sorts of obstacles, but the members who went to the Coronation said that Tasmanian apples were the only Australian produce they could identify in England. This Government should be careful to see that the produce of the country is put properly on the market.",184
1616,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Would it not savour of Socialism to advertise Australian products in England by the expenditure of public money ?,184
1617,Mr ATKINSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do not care if it would, seeing' that it is the right thing to do. The Government should take advantage of the services of practical men to push its advertising in the Old Country. Some of the State Governments are very glad when an Australian citizen will avail himself of the opportunity to be helpful. We have competitors in the Argentine, Canada, and other countries, which are clamouring for population. Canada has been very successful, and more people are now emigrating there from the United States every year than come to Australia.",184
1618,Mr CANN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The shipping companies have put up the fares.,185
1619,Mr ATKINSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Why does not the Government charter special steamers, if they are needed? Those who come here will soon be producers, and help others to obtain employment. The Government ought to see that Australian produce is handled better, so that there shall be no loss of money to the producers. I hope, too, in view of the need for agriculturists, that the agricultural districts of other countries will be properly canvassed. There are plenty of persons who wish to secure land, and who are likely to make good settlers. We may well look for immigrants from the United States of America. In this matter Victoria is setting us an example, and the State will shortly reap a splendid harvest from its expenditure. From the United States we may hope to get persons possessing a little capital and having practical knowledge of irrigation.",185
1620,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member's time has expired.,185
1621,Mr FOWL ER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Perth) [6.48 a.m.] - I propose to resume my remarks at the point where they were interrupted by the application of the new standing order. 1 was speaking of the danger of allowing grumblers, or others having a grievance, to send back reports to the Old Country. One or two cases of the kind have clone a great deal of mischief. The High Commissioner and his officers should see that the emigrants get the accommodation to which they are entitled on board the large mail steamers or other vessels appointed to bring them here. There is one very common complaint which I can confirm from my own experience of a good many years back. The objection is frequently made that the food is not by any means what it ought to be. There is no doubt that the quality of the articles placed on the ship is entirely satisfactory, but the immigrants complain about the cooking. From my experience on some of the boats I was forced to come to the same conclusion. There seems to be an idea amongst Britishers, especially on board ships, that any one who has failed in every other walk of lif e is competent to be a cook. The result is that the cooking on some ships is undoubtedly very defective, and good food is very frequently spolied. It ought to be a simple matter to arrange that the persons who are to cook the food should show that they possess the necessary qualifications before they are allowed to start. If that were done there would, I think, be a very great reduction in the amount of grumbling and complaining by immigrants, echoes of which, no doubt, have reached the Old Country and done our immigration movement a considerable amount of harm. In view of the. statements in the High Commissioner's report immediate steps should be taken to remedy the shortage of shipping accommodation. No doubt the gratifying increase in the volume of immigration has caught the shipping companies somewhat by surprise, and they are not able to find all the accommodation necessary, especially at those seasons of the year which are generally recommended as being the most suitable for people from the Old Country to come here. I feel sure that if the High Commissioner were intrusted with the duty of arranging with the shipping companies for more passenger accommodation of a third class character the present deficiency could be overcome in a very short time indeed. It is very much to be regretted that we have numbers of intending immigrants waiting in vain for passages and rushing at the last moment to fill up vacancies caused by sickness or other reasons. It may be objected that the shipowners require a lengthy engagement. The High Commissioner speaks of a term' of four or five years. . It is not at all now likely, I think, that we shall not be able during that period to absorb all the people who can be brought here. It has already been pointed out that Western Australia has a very large capacity in that direction. No doubt it could very easily have taken all the immigrants who have come to the Commonwealth during the last few years, while having plenty of room available for others. It is impossible, therefore, for our vacant lands to be filled up in the course of four or five years, and it is also unlikely that the demand for assistants on farms will suddenly cease. I see no danger in the Commonwealth entering into an agreement, if required to do so, even for a term of four or five years. I hope that the Government will authorize the High Commissioner to do something to meet the demands for passenger accommodation by immigrants. Again, with regard to the ships that convey passengers to Australia. I have a few observations to make. Most of our mail steamers, although there has been some improvement in the rate of speed during the last few years, are still jogging between the Old Land and Australia at a pace that is ridiculously behind the times. When we remember the rate of speed of ships on the British-American routes, I think it will be at once admitted that there is room for very great improvement on our mail steamers. reasons why Australia is regarded with hesitation by many persons in the Old Land as a country in which to mate a home is undoubtedly the feeling that if any persons come here they are practically giving up for ever any hope of again seeing their native land. That was, of course, the case in the old days of sailing vessels going round the Cape and taking six or eight months on a passage. A general impression has been created in the minds of people in the Old Country by relatives who have come here that when anv one leaves for Australia he is practically bidding an eternal goodbye. I was surprised on my visit four years ago to find the same feeling existing. Many persons I spoke to pointed out the great distance between the Old Country and Australia. When I reminded them that the trip could be easily made within six weeks they seemed quite They had failed to realise that the advent of steam had brought us within that travelling time of their native land. compare the time taken by going to Canada or the United States with that taken in coming to Australia we are at once at a disadvantage, even as regards our fastest vessels. I think we could very easily insist that the mail steamers, at any rate, should be speeded up for the passage between the Old Country and Australia. I would not insist, perhaps, upon the highest possible speed. There .would be no necessity, at any rate at for such fliers as run across Atlantic between Great Britain America in four days and a half; but I certainly think that we could easily arrange to place on our route, as regards our mail service at any rate, steam-ships with a speed of 20 knots an hour. vessels the passage could be performed in Mr Fowler. a little over three weeks. Surely that would be one of the best advertisements we could offer the people of the Old Country. They would realise that they might come out here with every prospect of being able to pay not infrequent visits to their native country. I know what an influence that sentiment has upon any one who comes to Australia and finds here conditions even of the most favourable character. The country of one's birth always has an attraction. It behoves us not to laugh at the sentiment, but to take steps to encourage immigrants to believe that sooner or later, and within a reasonable time, they will be able to revisit the scenes of their childhood. One of the I wish to speak very briefly regarding the Commonwealth buildings in London. I understand that the intention is to utilize the ground floor for shops and offices, which I presume are to be rented, and that the offices of the Commonwealth will be on the first floor. It will, I think, be a mistake not to make the most we can of the ground floor, because in a crowded city like London very little notice is taken of anything in the air. What 'is observed . is whatever happens to be in the line of sight of pedestrians. It is not very often that the average passenger lifts his eyes much higher than the level of the shop windows which he is passing. I hope that the authorities will consider the question of utilizing the ground floor of the Commonwealth - building for State and Federal purposes. If they are all housed upstairs a big blow will be struck at the surprised. advertising capacity of such a building. The ground floor with its utmost window space should be utilized for the exhibition When we of mineral, vegetable, and other products immigrants from all parts of the Commonwealth. It is only in that way we shall be able to secure the attention of countless thousands of passers-by. I find that objection has been taken by visitors from Western Australia with regard to what appears ""to be the in adequate arrangements for enabling such products to be displayed. Even in the proposed upstairs accommodation the first consideration should be the attraction of present, immigrants. Therefore this building should the be reserved and utilized primarily for and that purpose. Undoubtedly, one of the most attractive advertisements we could have would be an extensive display of such products as Australia could supply in an abundance, and of a quality which canWith such not be surpassed by any other country. It is astonishing what a lack of knowledge of Australia there is in Great Britain. There are very few persons who are full y seized of the tremendous breadth and length of this Continent, the great variety of its ducts, and its great possibilities in that gard. An exhibition of our products on the ground floor of the Commonwealth offices would go far to educate people in the Old Land. If the High Commissioner is Authorized to deal with these matters in a way which seems best to himself, and in view of the suggestions made during this debate, I feel sure that the time will not have been wasted. This scheme of the Commonwealth offices, and the ^duties and functions of the High Commissioner and his staff is only just in its very beginning, and, if the High Commissioner is given a reasonable latitude, I feel sure that he and his officers will be able to render a very good account of themselves. There is yet very much good work to be done in advertising Australia in the Old Country. In view of the critical international position, we should lose no opportunity of attracting population to our shores. Our natural increase is not by any means too satisfactory. It is, indeed, a matter of alarm that Australia is already following in . the footsteps of nations which are elsewhere regarded as degenerate. I refer, of course, to the steadily declining birth rate. When we find writer after writer pointing out the danger to Australia of her vacant spaces, and the grave necessity for filling them, surely that is a duty which we should not shirk. In the course of a few years we might be brought face to face with a situation that might velop the gravest danger to the future of the people who now hold Australia. There is only one way in which we shall be able to justify our determination to hold this country, and that is by showing that we are in grim and deadly earnest in straining every nerve to add to our population until we shall no longer be taunted with holding a large area of God's earth, and having no reasonable claim upon it.",185
1622,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Franklin) [7.17 a.m.] - When my previous speech was inmonths of this year. terrupted by the application of the time limit, I was about to speak of the necessity have a quorum present. to adopt a policy of immigration if we intended to hold this country. Unquestionheed ably, it has been regarded as one of empty lands of this world. When many seized some Portuguese territory in your empty north."" South Africa, the question was considered by the different nations, and Germany's white people in the country. plea was that Portugal was not effectively occupying the territory. Suppose that a nation were to make a claim to Australia, pro- could we say that we were effectively ocrecupying, not only the Northern Territory, but a great portion of Western Australia, and a very considerable portion of Queensland ? It should not be forgotten that in the Southern Seas Australia is starting an experiment which no other country has attempted, and that is to build up a white man's country in a zone that has always been considered hitherto the home of the coloured races.",187
1623,Mr RILEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Where ?,187
1624,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"In tropical and semi-tropical Australia, if our experiment is to be successful we must fill up our empty spaces with a white population. However, the immigration of people of our own race is objected to in certain quarters, and if I wish to hear harsh and cruel things said on the subject. I must go to those who have been immigrants themselves, and who, having done well in Australia, would erect a wall round, the country and prevent people of their own kith and kin coming here and enjoying the advantages they have themselves enjoyed. When we say that there is room in Australia for many more people we are told that we are running down the country, but it is those who contend that with a population of less than 5.000,000 we have no room in Australia for more people who really libel Australia. The honourable de- member for Capricornia has said that the immigrants who come here cut down wages. If that be the case, we have no room for more people, but the experience of the world in connection with immigration is quite otherwise. A reference to the evidence given before the Tariff Commission will show that until eighteen months or two years ago wages in Canada were slightly higher than they were in Australia, and today are practically the same. And yet no less than 250,000 immigrants landed in Canada in the first six",187
1625,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I think we should [Quorum formed.],187
1626,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"We should give to the words of warning uttered by the Mr Roosevelt when he said to the Prime GerMinister of the Commonwealth, "" F ill up We can only hold Australia by increasing the number of We have at our doors China, with 400,000,000 of people, Japan with 50,000,000 or 60,000,000, and the little island of Java, which is only twice the size of Tasmania, with a population seven or eight times as large as that of the whole of Australia. The war between Russia and Japan brought with a jump into the forefront of the nations a people who had previously been ignored by the more civilized nations of the world. These people are at our very door, because the possessions of Japan are nearer to portions of Australia than are some portions of the continent to each other. These coloured races are aware that close at hand there is a country more fertile and enjoying better climatic conditions than their own, and the one thing that is keeping Australia white today is the power of the British Navy. What would be the position of Australia today if Great Britain were involved in a conflict with one of the great nations of Europe? We should find the countless hordes of the coloured races at our door very ready to people Australia. We shall some day be asked whether we intend to occupv this continent effectively, and what answer shall we be able to give ? We know that if we were to rely upon the natural increase of our population it would take centuries to populate Australia, and we can only do so by encouraging people of our own kith and kin to come to this country. There are honourable members on this side who have risked more in their constituencies by advocating the White Australia policy than has been risked by some of our honourable friends opposite. Honourable members on this side have advocated that policy when it was not a popular thing to do in their electorates. The truest friend of the White Australia policy is the man who would put Australia in a position to maintain it, and the worse enemy of the policy is the man who says that while we should exclude the coloured races we should do nothing to people the country with whites. No country has been so blessed by peace as has Australia, but no man can tell when Great Britain may be involved in conflict arising from the situation now existing in Southern Europe, and danger to Australia become immediate. Homer Lea has said that if there was war declared between the United States of America and Japan the Pacific coast of America would be at the mercy of the Japanese. He tells us that in Honolulu there are many thousands of Japanese reservists, Mr MCWilliams. and that within twenty-four hours of «the declaration of a war between Japan and the United States the Japanese would have possession of Hawaii. The argument that it is wrong for a man to monopolize land which he is not prepared to use can be applied with even greater force to us if we do nothing to people our enormous territory. I believe that in many parts of tropical Australia thousands of our own flesh and blood now in the Old Country could make a comfortable . home. There there are millions of. the landless. Here we have millions of acres waiting for them. Honourable members opposite, fearing to come into conflict with some of their constituents on the subject of immigration, claim that we should shut up this country, and not permit people of our own race to come to it. A smaller-minded or more mistaken policy was never enunciated. The question is how long we shall be permitted to continue such a policy.",187

1628,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Immigratio n in connection with the settlement of the Northern Territory is the most important question we have to consider. If it be conducted through the office of the High Commissioner, more vigorous steps must be taken than have been taken in the past. Reference has been made from time to time to the matter of what Canada has done for immigration. But the bulk of the work connected with immigration in Canada has been done by the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, and not by the Government ot the Dominion. Under the land-grant system of railway construction adopted in Canada there was a direct incentive to the - railway companies to promote immigration. Here we have no such agencies, and the whole of the work must be done by the States or Federal Governments. It is deeply to be deplored that some arrangement has not been entered into between the Federal and State Governments in connection with this matter. When we appointed a High Commissioner we were told that it would be no longer necessary for the States to send Agents-General to the Old Country, as the High Commissioner would be able to do the work hitherto done by those representatives of the States.",188

1630,Mr HEDGES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Fremantle) [7.47 a.m.]. - There cannot be better proof that we require immigrants in Australia than is afforded by the figures supplied to us by the Commonwealth Statistician. He points out that the total increase in the population of the Commonwealth for the year 1910-11 was only 1/13,624. That is a very small increase indeed. But the most astonishing figures are those which record the increase in the coloured and Asiatic population of Australia. I find that during the month of August the increase in the number of departures of Asiatics was 165, whilst the crease in the number of arrivals during the same month was 199. The increase in the number of departures for eight months was 740, and in the number of arrivals for the same period it was 926, Thesefigureshave been an eye-opener to me, because I was under the impression that we were gradually reducing the numbers of our Asiatic population. I had no idea that the number of these people in Australia would increase under a Labour Government. A fair question to ask is, Why has there been this increase under the Labour Government? The honourable member for Perth has suggested that we might make more comfortable the immigrants who come here from the Old Country, but they have not the harsh conditions to which those who emigrate to the United States of America and to Canada are subjected. These are crowded together on the Atlantic steamers, and herded together in trains for journeys of 3,000 or 4,000 miles. I cannot understand why, in view of what we can offer, more people do not come to Australia. In 1910 our increase of population, excluding aboriginals, was only 143,624, and when I was in Canada the immigrants numbered over 40,000 a month. We cannot hold this country without population, and if we do not treat the matter seriously our children will be worked in harness by Asiatic invaders as the Chinese employed on the construction of the Pine Creek railway were. We have no hope of holding ""this country unless the question of filling it up is seriously. People with special knowledge acquired in other countries should be encouraged to come here to help us to develop our vacant spaces. We shall never be able to develop the Northern Territory with the knowledge gained in the south. Our imports are increasing, and our exports are decreasing. I would stop that kind of thing by giving bonuses for the production [202] of commodities which we are not at present putting upon the market.",189
1631,Mr TUDOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Would the honourable member increase the Tariff?,189
1632,Mr HEDGES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am not suggesting anything of the kind, but we should attract to Australia people who are specialists, and who would be able to open up new industries. It is a remarkable fact that the population of the Northern Territory has decreased during the last twelve months. In 1910 there were 3,301 people there; in 1911 there were 3,248. There in- was also an increase in the coloured population of the whole Commonwealth. Still more extraordinary is it that there has been a decrease in the population of Tasmania.",189
1633,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Since the growth of the Labour party there.,189
1634,Mr HEDGES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"There is no country on earth where people have better opportunities than Australia. We are not doing enough to attract population from parts of Europe where the people lead a hard and often miserable existence. In Western Australia, between Albany and the Leeuwin, there is room for a million people. At present there are not enough there to cultivate 20,000 acres. That is the sort of place where we should settle good workers. The climate is temperate, and industrious folks could earn a competency there. I have recently been through Canada, and am satisfied that there is no comparison between that country and this. In Italy and the south of France you can see people carrying soil up the hill-sides in baskets and putting it on the hill-tops, where they cultivate. Surely it would not require much inducement to persuade them to come to the Commonwealth, where there are splendid opportunities for industrious agriculturists.",189
1635,Mr WEBSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,What would they grow under such conditions?,189
1636,Mr HEDGES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Everythin g that is grown in Italy and the South of France can be produced here, and of the finest quality. I saw tons of olives being grown taken in Italy, but I never saw an olive tree there that grew as well as the olive trees in Australia. Yet the amount of labour which these Europeans have to devote to induce their trees to produce is enormous. Why cannot the advantages of Australia be pointed out to these people? I am sure that if honourable members opposite could see men toiling as-I have seen them toiling in Italy for a mere pittance, it would appeal to them as it appealed to me. They cannot realise the facilities afforded them in Australia, and do not know that with much less labour they could earn a comfortable living, and put by something for old age. If the actual facts regarding this country were supplied to them, they would be attracted in thousands.",189
1637,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Parkes) [8.15 a.m.] - The speech which the honourable member for Fremantle has just made displays a condition of innocence with regard to the Labour party on the subject of immigration that surprises me. He has spoken at length about the need of population in Australia, and the opportunities which we have lost of bringing people from other parts of the world where there is a superabundance of population. The honourable member seems to have missed the true solution of the anomaly, that people are anxious to come to Australia from various parts of the world, and are not afforded a - chance. The anomaly is that the Labour - party are speaking with two voices everywhere and all the time. The honourable member has been reading a portion of the report of the High Commissioner, in which he speaks at great length of the expenditure which he is controlling with regard to the advertising of Australia. He seems to imagine that because people are not coming here, therefore this advertising .is doing no good. The honourable /member appears - to have entirely missed .the fact that, whilst on the one hand --we are expending money in England, iholding out specious and exaggerated pro:mises with regard to what people can get - in Australia, on the other hand the trade - unions and the Labour party, with their --organization, are sending home cables and letters giving the lie to the very advertise-ments for which the people of Australia - are paying. We are familiar with scores of 'Occasions on which these Labour organizations have told the world that there is no isaeed for population here. I read this morning from the Federal Labour manifesto a few extracts showing that the Labour party, as a whole, treat this question of immigration, not from a philanthropic or national point of view, but purely from an economic point of view, being afraid of their lives that every fresh person who comes into this country is going to take the' bread out of their mouths. Therefore, it pays them to stand upon the public platform, when they are amongst their own constituents, or those whom they hope to make their constituents, ana tell them plainly that there is no room in Australia for the people for whom we are advertising in EnglandThat the trades unions of New South Wales, as represented by Congress, request the State Government to discontinue its immigration policy. That resolution goes to Great Britain by the same mail that carries the advertising literature. Is it not natural that people in England, who hear these two voicesone a political voice, which seeks to beguile them with the idea that they are wanted, and the other an economic voice practically threatening them with starvation if they come-ar e bewildered, and that the best efforts of the Government and the High Commissioner are stultified ? At the same Labour Congress, a resolution was passed asking the State Government to at once take steps to stop the "" indiscriminate system of immigration "" now obtaining, and to bring out only competent persons for whom it could be proved there is legitimate employment without displacing local and competent labour, and that a deputation representing the Congress and the Labour Council executive wait on the Government without delay. The people brought out to Australia are not imbued with the socialistic and revolutionary opinions entertained by a large section of the Labour organizations of this country; and it is known that honest working men from the Old Country are likely to take the places vacated owing to senseless strikes, thus interfering with the hole-and-corner monopoly now obtaining in Australian industries. The honourable member for Fremantle, in a rather unsophisticated way, expressed some surprise that people are not coming here more numerously; but to me the explanation is self-evident. If from my door I invite people to come in and get something, and a moment afterwards tell them that there is nothing for them, the only effect must be to cause some amusement without affecting my purpose one way or the other. The attitude of the Trades Union Congres is at least frank and incapable of misconstruction; it is bitterly opposed to immigration, and one speaker declared that the policy of the Labour Government was "" criminal,"" from the point of view of the working classes. This economic consideration lies at the root of a great many wild and senseless doctrines that have been promulgated by the Labour party and Labour members individually. We are devoting £ 6 0 0 , 0 0 0 to Commonwealth buildings in London, with the object, primarily, of directing the attention of the working classes to the immense attractions of Australia, and we expend £ 1 6 , 0 0 0 a year on a stafF in England whose business it is to induce people to come to this country; but, at the same time, letters and cables are being sent, behind our backs, to the trades organizations at Home in order to give the lie to the representation of our immigration officials. The High Commissioner, in his report, tells us that, with the funds at his disposal, it is impracticable to undertake a vigorous and business-like campaign for the purpose of advertising our food products; and at the end of the report are some very interesting illustrations of the steps he has been able to take in this direction. According to these pictures, one of the means adopted is a cinematograph car, which is taken about the country in order to show people generally what wonderful harvests and crops are reaped in this country. To my mind, all this represents the biggest piece of humbug and hypocrisy that could possibly be carried on by a great country like Australia. Canada, though she spends much money in advertising, does not resort to such means of making the advantages of the Dominion known. And 1 undertake to say that in Canada there is no great body of people corresponding with the Labour party of this country, who are endeavouring to render abortive the expenditure that is ostensibly in the interests of patriotism. more this political fraud is made known the better. It is only, as it were, by accident that we learn through the press what sort of resolutions are being passed at Labour congresses, and what opinions are expressed by Labour members on the platform and, hypocritically, in this House. But we who do know of this double work, should not hesitate to expose one. ol the most consummate pieces of humbug that could be connected with the policy bf n great country. Canada spends hundreds of thousands a year in advertising her great resources ; and, although the Dominion "" cannot hold a candle "" to Australia for fertility, equability of climate, and general attractions, she is receiving thousands of people while we are obtaining only a few. That is because tliere is no second voice in Canada to tell the English people that they may find a fool's paradise on their arrival.",190

1639,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Flinders) [10.0 a.m.] - I desire this morning to adduce some further evidence in support of the view that members of the Labour party at present in power,- even if they were sincere themselves in desiring immigration-which , as to a good many of them, I venture to express some doubt-ar e paralyzed in any efforts they may make by the undoubted hostility of the great mass of their supporters to any active policy of the kind.",191
1640,Mr ROBERTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Do not the honourable member's supporters influence him in airs way ?,191
1641,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,They do.,191
1642,Mr ROBERTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Then , is it wrong that our supporters should influence us?",191
1643,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am not questioning the morality or immorality of iirfiuence of the k in d ; all I am endeavouring; to maintain is that, assuming that some, or even all, of the gentlemen who now occupy the Government benches were quite willing to advocate a rational policy of discriminative immigration, they are, in fact, paralyzed by the real opinion of the majority of their supporters outside..",191
1644,Mr ROBERTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That applies with equal force to the honourable member himself and his supporters.,191
1645,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The policy of the Labour party has been, not to encourage, but to impose fetters on, immigration. In the report prepared by the Agents General in 1905, at the request of the then The Prime Minister, we are told by gentlemen, be it remembered, who were engaged in the actual work of immigration and of advertising the resources of Australia in the various DominionsAs pointed out by us in our report upon "" Advertising the Resources and Development of the Commonwealth,"" the language test and contract provisions of the Act referred to have proved veritable stumbling blocks to us in our work, and have had a most prejudicial influence on the public opinion of every part of this Kingdom. Lest we should be misunderstood, we would like to emphasize the fact that we are strongly - in sympathy with the desire of our fellowAustralians to preserve Australia for the white races, and to maintain a high standard of living and of wages; but we should be very blind,, indeed, if we were not aware that of the many causes that have tended to prejudice Australia in the estimation of the public, none has had an influence so 'widespread and striking as the cases which have arisen under the contract provisions of the Immigration Restriction Act. It is true that persons who have ill-will towards Australia have grossly exaggerated the cases to which we refer, but however arising, the fact that these cases have happened has led the press and business men to a close examination of the Act, and to the discovery of the sweeping range of the language test, and of the severe nature of the penalties imposed. The press of this country has not been slow to point out that if a mechanic or an agricultural labourer goes to Australia under contract to perform manual labour, he becomes liable to six months' imprisonment, and that the wording of the contract clause has a tendency so wide as to appear even to include domestic servants of all kinds. I have no doubt that the Act does include domestic servants of all kindsWe have endeavoured to defend the position of the Commonwealth on the grounds that the provisions objected to are for emergent use, and that common-sense is the prevailing characteristic of the Australian peoplej but our explanations pass unheeded amidst the recurrent clamour which arises whenever the six hatters are mentioned- Nor have we found that it assists matters overmuch to refer to the legislation of other countries. The section of the Act itself is taken as typical of the real attitude of Australia towards the question of immigration. The title and wording of the Act and the reports of the cases that have occurred, exaggerated as they have been by repetition, are deeply impressed upon the minds of the great bulk of the people. Even the more thoughtful elements of the community who are aware of the genesis of the language test, and accept it as a more or less illogical compromise made at the instance of the Imperial Governmentstrongly resent the contract provisions. cannot understand nvhy four millions of British people living 13,000 miles away from the Motherland, and admittedly suffering from a lack of population, should exclude the occassional British artisan or labourer against whom the section is aimed. They argue that it is absurd to think that immigrants under contract ever would or could be landed in such numbers as to affect the labour market of any State. On the contrary, they consider that the insistence by such immigrants on a contract which guarantees them against want of employment is a commendable precaution which the labour market should, welcome rather than condemn. These are the matured statements of the only people who at that time, in 1905, had had practical experience in the work of immigration, and they were made for the information of the Prime Minister of the clay. I venture to say that no truer thing was ever said than that the section of the Act providing that any immigrant, no matter how otherwise desirable as an Australian citizen-n o matter how qualified to help in developing this country, or what his character may be, physically, mentally, and morally-shal l not be entitled to come here under any contract that secures to him proper employment the moment he lands is taken as typical of the real attitude of Australia towards immigration; and it is as true now as it was in 1905. The ostensible reason why that section was passed in the form in which it now stands was apparently to prevent employers flooding the country in times of strike with employees brought out here under contract. I do not believe that there was ever a danger of such a thing. Moreover, I do not believe that that was the real reason. I think that honourable members opposite and their supporters know perfectly well that there is no danger of such a thing.",191
1646,Mr WEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Our experience teaches us of the cruelty that is practised under such a system.,192
1647,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I venture to say that the honourable member is not able to point to a single instance in which if that provision had not been inserted men would have been brought out here under contract to stop a strike.,192
1648,Mr WEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I have seen five or six cases of the greatest cruelty.,192
1649,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,If the honourable member ventures to reply to what I am saying-and I have grave doubt as to his doing so- I hope that he will tell us of these cases.,192
1650,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,He could easily reply.,192

1652,Mr WEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"We are here to do business, not to make advertising speeches.",192
1653,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Then the honourable member says that if he were to tell us of these cases of hardship he would be making an advertising speech. I do not believe that any cases of hardship or cruelty have been prevented by this contract section. We cannot have any system of immigration that will be successful as long as we fetter it with conditions under which people are invited to leave the surroundings of a lifetime, and to venture upon a new life 16,000 miles away without any guarantee that they will be able to get employment the moment they land here. To allow this ""provision to remain is, as the Agents-General declared in 1905, a most distinct declaration of antipathy to any real policy of immigration on the part of the party which now occupies the Treasury benches.",192
1654,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Would the honourable member allow men to come out under a contract of any kind?,192
1655,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member's inquiry, like all coming from the same source, is a trap question. Most certainly I would not support absolute liberty of contract free from any restriction. What I have said throughout is that the Government support an absolute prohibition. Their party caused this tion to be placed in the Act, and have of since persistently refused to allow any and modification of it .",192

Section 4 providesEvery contract immigrant, unless otherwise prohibited by law, may land in the Commonwealth if the contract is in writing, and is made by, or on behalf of, some person named in the contract and resident in Australia, and its terms are approved by the Minister.

In this connection I propose to read a letter which was sent to London by the Secretary of the Amaling Herald saysgamated Society of Carpenters and Joiners, in regard to the subject. of immigration. a The letter was addressed from the Trades emigrationtry. Hall, Goulburn-street, Sydney, reads:SIR,Through the medium of your valuable columns I have been directed to place a few facts before the English public with reference to the cost of living and house rent problem in moved :New South Wales. It would be well for intending emigrants from the United Kingdom to study these facts before attempting to emigrate to this State. House rents during the past five years, where they were formerly gs., ns., and 13s., have now risen to 17s. 6d., and as high as 27s. 6d. People are glad to get houses even at that price. Second - Cos t of living during the last three years. The cost of living has risen fully 30 per cent. I hope the Government are taking full credit for that. They are taking credit for everything else. Tradesmen in England receiving 7s. per day are better off than the men in Australia receiving ns. As you no doubt know, there are several large ventures projected, such as the Naval College and the Federal Capital, but these will not be started for years. The labour market at the present time is over-stocked-that is, as far as carpenters and joiners are concerned, a considerable number of whom are out of employment. That letter is signed by William James Corbitt, who subscribes himself "" Secretary, Sydney District Management Committee, Amalgamated Society of Carpenters and Joiners, Trades Hall, Goulburn-street, Sydney."" Here is proof of a statement which has been made in the debate by the honourable member for Parkes, that the Ministerial party have spoken with two contradictory voices on this question of immigration. While Ministers themselves are claiming credit for the accession of immigrants to our shores, their party outside are taking every means in their power to prevent immigrants from coming.  hold us responsible for that letter?",195

1704,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Writin g with reference to ' the letter I have quoted, the London correspondent of the Sydney MornThe Australian trade unions have entered into campaign of falsity in order to discourage the of skilled tradesmen from this counand A little while ago a Trade Union Congress met in Sydney, and turned down immigration with a vengeance. The meeting was presided over by the honourable member for Cook, and the' following resolution was That the trade unions of New South Wales as represented by congress request the State Government to discontinue its immigration policy. Mr George Saunders, milk and ice carters,submitted the following amendment:That the Government be asked to at once take steps to stop the indiscriminate system of immigration now obtaining, and only bring such com1 petent persons, for whom it can be proved there is legitimate employment, without displacing local and competent employees, and that a deputation of three from the congress as deputies, and three from the Labour Council Executive wait upon the Government without delay in reference to this matter. Mr Schrieber, in supporting the amendment, made these remarksThat in the country the population was one and a half persons to the square mile, while in England it was 517 persons. He considered a home should be made for Englishmen; and to carry the motion would be to make the congress the laughing-stock of all trades unionists and the country. Another speaker said that he consideredThere was plenty of work in the country, for any man who wanted it. He had been thirty-two years in the State and had never been out of work, except when he took a holiday. He considered that many men were out of work because they would not accept any other employment than that to which they were accustomed. Those men were content to loaf on others. A show of hands showed 20 against the amendment, and a division had the same result. The original motion was then carried by 20 votes to 13. Here we have this Government taking all the credit imaginable for what they are doing to assist immigration, and striking a note of triumph as they quote figures which show the tremendous accession of people to our shores since they came into the possession of office. But while that is so, their party outside are passing resolutions affirming that an immigration policy is a huge mistake, and should be discontinued at the earliest possible moment.",196
1705,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member can be satisfied as to which section of the party will prevail.,196
1706,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The section outside will prevail. It appears to me to be quite an understood thing. Honourable members opposite, who have to secure votes to get in here, are allowed to dictate a propaganda which will enable them to appeal to votes outside the trades unions, and for that purpose they announce, with their tongues in their cheeks, that they are in favour of immigration; whilst the unions upon which they also depend take effective steps to prevent it . The sooner we have the facts of the case put before the public, and show what the protestations of Ministers mean, the better it will be for the promotion of immigration. I trust, therefore, that some time during this long sitting to which we have been condemned by the Caucus we shall be able to allow these gentlemen to demonstrate the sincerity of their convictions. We shall expect to see them ranging themselves in solid phalanx with honourable members on this side who are sincerely anxious to bring as many of the right sort of people to these shores as our exigencies at the moment demand. I trust that we shall soon see the organization in London strengthened in every possible way. ' Any proposals for that purpose will meet with a very generous response from this side of the House. Something will have to be done upon a very much broader scale than has yet been attempted. I am afraid that we shall not, to the extent that we desire, get men to go into the Northern Territory from the rural dis-tricts of Australia. It may be that we shall be able to induce people from over-sea to .go to the Northern Territory. that we shall succeed in persuading men who are already in the warmer zones of Australia to cross over. But we shall have to offer them every inducement. They will not go willingly. We shall have to fix in - our minds the price that we ought to pay to induce them to settle in the Northern Territory. We can only do that by a ""balancing of climate and other disadvantages with the economic and other advantages which we are able to place at their disposal. But we shall have to look to - other places, apart from Australia, and apart from England and Scotland, for people to occupy the Northern Territory. For this reason we shall need to strengthen our 'immigration agencies as at present conducted and centralized in London. I am - glad to see, therefore, an item in the Estimates for this purpose. I shall be glad to see other efforts made to widen and extend Immigration facilities in England. more we can strengthen them and make them adequate, the better it will be for this country.",196
1707,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Wimmera) [ n . 3 a.m.]. - I think that the position of the present Government in connection with immigration should be restated in relation to the High Commissioner's Office. An express provision of the Constitution lays upon this Parliament the responsibility of legislating for immigration to Australia.,197
1708,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I think there should be a quorum to listen to the honourable member's argument. [Quorum formed.],197
1709,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"In 1909 the first step of a substantial character was taken towards carrying out the provision of the Constitution to which I have alluded. In 1901 our Immigration Restriction Act was passed to deal with one phase of the matter. In 1909 the High Commissioner was appointed, and one of the most important of his duties was to advertise Australia and supervise immigration. In 1911, at the Imperial Conference, attended by the Prime Minister and the Minister of External A f fairs, emigration from England was exhaustively discussed. Mr John Burns, the President of the Board of Trade, stated that the Imperial Government was most desirous to co-operate with the various Governments of the Dominions in order that the surplus population of Great Britain might be distributed amongst the British I trust Possessions over-seas in as equitable a manner as possible. Mr Burns then estimated that 300,000 immigrants from Great Britain per annum could be spared. It was estimated that perhaps 80,000 of these would emigrate to foreign countries, leaving 220.000 per annum available for the Dominions. The Prime Minister consented to co-operate with the Imperial Immigration Committee-., in order that the 220,000 per annum might be distributed amongst the Dominions in accordance with their needs and requirements. The High Commissioner has prepared a report full of practical suggestions. He points out how immigration might be more successf u l in many directions, and indicates the need for the Commonwealth Parliament to provide ships to bring immigrants to this country. We have it on the authority of the Minister of External Affairs that a The most important recommendation by the High Commissioner has been definitely rejected by the Government. The High Commissioner's office and the advertising of Australia in the Old Country cost the Commonwealth about £40,000 a year, and a further expenditure of £600,000 or £700,000 has been authorized for the election of offices in London, which it is thought will prove of immense value, commercially and otherwise, to this countryHow far, under the circumstances, the Government can justify the continuance of the present expenditure and the contemplated expenditure, remains to be seen. The High Commissioner, in his report, saysI have had interviews with deputations of passenger agents and the heads of the shipping companies-wh o are both deeply interested, the former in earning commission, and the latter in promoting traffic-and I am bound, after the most careful and earnest consideration, to state that I am convinced some assurance, given by those in authority, that emigration to Australia will be encouraged and assisted for a period of at least four or five years, is needed by the shipping companies before they will build the number of passenger steamers necessary. must be remembered that cargo steamers cannot be converted into passenger steamers, either temporarily or permanently, without a very large outlay. The modern requirements now wisely insisted upon cause ship-building for passengers to be a vastly more expensive task than it used to be. In this connection the following extract from Hansard is interesting:",197
1710,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Has the Cabinet given any consideration to this proposal?,198
1711,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I have.,198
1712,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Has the Minister come to any decision ?,198
1713,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I have.,198
1714,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Is the honourable gentleman going to adopt the suggestion which Sir George Reid makes?,198
1715,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"No . No reason is given by the Government for the decision at which they have arrived; and the only possible inference is that they are under the control of the unions outside, who do not believe in immigration. Thus the members of the Ministry are tied hand and foot, whatever their own personal opinions may be. As to contract immigrants, the Minister of External Affairs has authority to approve or disapprove of any agreements submitted to him, but we know, as a matter of fact, that the control is largely in the hands of the unions, who have to be consulted, before any action is taken. When I was in Sydney, not long ago, I ascertained that an important union, which charges an entrance premium of £ 4 0 per head, had definitely refused permission Mr Sampson. to a manufacturer there to import skilled! tradesmen, and the result was that ordershad to be refused, thus making way for larger importations from abroad.  the fact that tliere is no quorum present [Quorum formed.]",198
1716,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The Pacific Cable Board is also referred to in the report of the High Commissioner. It is always good business to complete an undertaking once it is entered upon, and it is highly desirablethat there should be an Atlantic cable to> place Australia hi direct communication with Great Britain. At present there is a\ deficit of something like £34,000 a year on the Government cable, and I think not only that this could be wiped out altogether,, but that a handsome profit could be mad""? by the Commonwealth, if , in addition to> our control over the land-lines of Australia,, the cable to Vancouver, and, for a term... the land-line across Canada, we had control over an Atlantic cable, which, in my It opinion, could be constructed for £500,000.. At present the Government cable does not carry more than 10 or 15 per cent, of the total business, but, with complete communication, we should get as much business as the cable could carry. The deficit of £34,000 is just about twice as much. as. would pay the interest on the cost of constructing an Atlantic cable; and such artundertaking would, in my opinion, yield! a handsome profit. The Imperial Conference of 1.911 decided that if the cable rateswere not reduced sufficiently, it would Inadvisable to open up negotiations with thevarious Governments interested, with a view to the laying down of an Atlantic cables but, with the exception of the reference in? the High Commissioner's report, we have no information, from the Government or elsewhere, on the subject. It is of littleuse having these periodical conferences if the Government are not prepared to consider, and, if necessary, to act upon, therecommendations made.",198
1717,Mr ROBERTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Does the honourable member contend that the resolutions or recommendations of the Imperial Conference must bind the Government ?,198
1718,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"No , but when a recommendation is one that would corifer great advantage on the people of Australia, it ought certainly to be taken in hand by the Government; and an Atlantic cable is a. business transaction that can be fully justified in every possible way. The High Commissioner recommends the appointment of a. commercial expert for the purpose of bringing the producers of Australia into closer touch with the British markets, which represent an immense field as yet but little exploited. I put before the Committee last night figures showing that we have open to the producers of Australia a market equal to £200,000,000 per annum. Great Britain every year imports over _£2oo,ooo,ooo worth of goods consisting mostly of foodstuffs, and not more than 10 or 12 per cent, of that amount represents imports from Australia. This great market is open to us, and, according to the High Commissioner, there are also in most European countries markets awaiting the entrance of Australian produce. Investigations have been made in France, Prussia, Germany, and Switzerland, where, the High Commissioner informs us, there are markets for Australian produce, and there can be no doubt that there are markets - waiting to be developed by us in other - countries. The supervision of our produce in London requires to be conducted by a man, not of limited experience, but of the widest commercial knowledge, who - could bring our producers into touch with the retailers oversea, and so arrange matters that the produce of the farmers of Australia might be placed on the tables of the consumers of the Old World at the least possible expense and a minimum' amount of employment charges.",198
1719,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member's time has expired.  As I wish to address a few questions to Ministers I think it would be well at the outset to ask for a quorum. [Quorum formed.] There appears to me to be no more important item in the division now 'before us than that relating to the High - Commissioner's Office.

1720,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I direct your Mr Chairman, to the want of a quorum. '[Quorum formed.]  - congratulate the Government on the fact that, in view of the importance of these Estimates, they have been able to keep a House continuously for such a length of time. There can be no doubt that Australia with its territory of 3,000,000 square miles, and its population of little more than 4.500,000, is altogether under-populated, .and it should be the function of the High Commissioner's Office to assist to bring about a better condition of affairs in this regard.",199
1721,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I should like a quorum. [Quorum formed.]  is being interrupted in this manner.

1751,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"In support of the contentipn of the honourable member for Parramatta, I would direct your attention, sir, to section 39 of the Constitution, which providesUntil the Parliament otherwise provides, the presence of at least one-third of the whole number of the members of the House of Representatives shall be necessary to constitute a meeting of the House for the exercise of its powers. There it is laid down that for the transaction of public business, at least one-third of the members of this Chamber must be present. My next point is that standing order 54 readsEvery member of the House, when he comes into the chamber, shall take his place, and shall not, at any time, stand in any of the passages or gangways. Reading that standing order in conjunction with the section of the Constitution which I have quoted, it is obvious that until honourable members who enter the chamber to make up a quorum have actuably taken their seats, the Committee is not properly constituted.",201
1752,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Every honourable member is supposed to take his seat on entering the chamber, and the Committee is not properly constituted unless that has been done.

I can only come to one conclusion, that the Ministryhave net taken the necessary action to comply with Sir George Reid's request because of certain resolutions that have been carried by certain organizations, whose object is to make Australia a. close preserve for Australians, and to keep everybody else out. That is an unfortunate position. So far from having-a Government which recognises the responsibility of carrying out a wise policy, we have a Ministry in office that lends it self to those who favour a contrary course of action.",201

I had no word with any honourable member as to the attitude that I adopted.

Standing Orders provide that in the event of the Committee not being properly constituted any honourable member has a right to ca.ll attention to the absence of a quorum.. I have merely exercised my right in that direction as a representative of the people. When the honourable member says that 1 did so for the purpose of preventing the transaction of public business, I say that his statement is incorrect. I merely f o llarly. lowed the example which he himself set on numerous occasions during the past fortyeight hours, even when he himself was in possession of the Chair. But immediately I exercised my right, the honourable member desires to make capital out of it . This is the first Commonwealth Parliament of which I have teen a member, and I have no recollection of having previously called attention to the absence of a quorum'. I did so merely to insure that the Committee should be properly constituted, and that honourable members should hear what the honourable member for Echuca had to say. I have taken no part whatever in the discussion that has been proceeding during the past two days, and which, in my judgment, has served no useful purpose. Honourable members opposite are just as much bound to keep a quorum as I am. Dr CARTY SALMO N (Laanecoorie) [2.51] - I think that the honourable member for Parramatta. has gone to the very root of this question by appealing to honourable members to consider the relationship which exists between this Chamber and its Standing Orders. Orders are designed to expedite the transaction of public business. That is the primary reason for their existence. They are also intended to protect the rights and privileges of honourable members. Every honourable member will agree that I have not mis-stated the chief functions which are discharged by Standing Orders. Under That is a standing order which was recently adopted, a ruling has been given by you, sir. which has resulted in powers being given to individual members which they did not previously possess. The limitation of debate has been the subject of very much heart-burning, not only in this Parliament, but in other Parliaments. It has been found necessary that there should be some limitation imposed, and we were guided by the experience of other Parliaments when we adopted such a limitation in 1906. These limitations have had superimposed upon them certain safeguards which have The been found absolutely necessary as the result of experience. The right of free speech in this chamber is surety an important one. It is the very purpose for which Parliament has been constituted and summoned. The very word ""Parliament"" conveys that.",207

1857,Dr CARTY SALMON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That entirely alters the position, as the Honorary Minister, with his agile mind, will recognise. The adoption of a standing order imposing a time limit upon speeches has - always been accompanied by certain precautions. The precaution accompanying the use of the closure is that at least twenty-four members must vote in favour of its application before it can be applied. What does the honourable member for Hunter desire? He desires to have reposed in him alone the power of preventing any honourable member from making a speech. That is one of the Standing gravest breaches of privilege of which we can possibly conceive. It is one of the gravest abuses of privilege of which an honourable member can be guilty. The fact is that the honourable member for Echuca was prevented by an important public engagement from addressing himself to a matter which was before the Committee yesterday, and which was before it again today. He came here this morning prepared to make his speech, and was prevented from doing so under the Standing Orders.",207

1859,Dr CARTY SALMON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That is the point, and that is why honourable members opposite do not like it. They know that unless, an injury has been done to some honourable member there is no breach of privilege involved. I am pointing out that an injury has been done to the honourable member for Echuca. The Standing Orders were devised for the protection of the privileges of honourable members. As soon as any honourable member makes use of those Standing Orders to prevent free speech in this chamber, unless he makes use of them in the way that has been provided",208

Now that the matter has been taken from the immediate personal control of the Chairman, I submit, with respect, that honourable members who have to give a decision on this matter ought to weigh carefully the manner in which they shall vote.. If they feel that it is not a breach of privilege for an honourable member to be prevented from making his speech in the way provided for in the Standing Orders, they should vote accordingly. If"", however, they feel that a. breach of privilege has been committed, I trust that they will not hesitate to vote for the motion proposed by the honourable member for Parramatta. Honourable members were warned at the time when the previous motion for disagreement with the Chairman's ruling was under consideration, that the very thing that has happened would occur. They denied that it was possible. New they are causing the evil to happen, I regret to say.",208

1873,Mr ANSTEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Bourke) [3-4].^-ThisCommittee has now sat for about 50 hours, and during that period the members of the Opposition have had every opportunity of saying whatever they wished to say on the subjects brought before us. They were given the most untrammelled freedom. No restriction was placed upon their right of expressing their opinions. They availed themselves of all the opportunities afforded by the Standing Orders, in order, if possible, to delay the proceedings of the Committee. Last night, time after time, they frequently caused the bells to be rung to call attention to the absence of a quorum. I admit that they did so in accordance with their rights under the Standing Orders. But they were not compelled to do so, however, in order that they might secure opportunities of expressing their opinions. Those opportunities were not in question. When you, Mr Chairman, had given a ruling on any particular, question, the members of the Opposition immediately availed themselves of a fresh opportunity to express dissent, in order to create further delay.",208
1874,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I rise to order. The honourable member for Bourke has just stated that honourable members on this side have dissented from your rulings during the course of this long sitting for no other reason than to delay and obstruct public business. I submit that the reasons that I gave to you on a previous occasion for dissenting from ypur ruling,209
1875,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The member must not, under cover of a point of order, make a speech.",209
1876,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I ask that the offensive and inaccurate statement of the honourable member for Bourke shall be withdrawn, and I hope that he will not further transgress. ° The CHAIRMAN - The member for Bourke was not in order in making such an imputation.",209
1877,Mr ANSTEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am very sorry, because I had not the slightest desire to hurt the tender susceptibilities of the honourable member who has raised the point. I am called upon by the Chairman to recall the \v>rds I used, and I do so in accordance wivH instructions. I should like to point out that the great majority of honourable members opposite availed themselves of the opportunities afforded by the Standing Orders to call attention to the state of the Committee. Now, because an honourable member on this side, in the exercise of his rights, has done the same, the honourable member for Parramatta has moved a motion dissenting from the ruling of the Chairman. The outstanding fact of these proceedings is that if there has been a breach of privilege it was committed by the majority of honourable members on the Opposition side; and that when an honourable member on this side exercised the same right as they have done, and the Chairman ruled that there was no breach of privilege, the Opposition at once express dissent from the ruling. I again put it to you, Mr . Chairman, that it is perfectly within your power, as the presiding officer, to determine what is a frivolous motion or point of order, and to decline to allow such a thing to be entertained. If ever there was a frivolous motion submitted for the consideration of a Chairman of Committees it is this one. It has already been decided that it is within the privileges of an honourable member to call for a quorum, and yet honourable members opposite now object because the Chairman has' given a ruling in accordance with practice. 'Is not that an outrage on parliamentary practice? Is it not abuse ? I call upon the Chairman to exercise his rights in accordance with common, sense and sound judgment, and to rule the motion out of order, on the ground that it is frivolous.",209
1878,Mr WISE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Gippsland) [3.10] - What has happened this morning furnishes another proof that the practice and privilege of Parliament is a two-edged sword that honourable can be used by both parties. What surprises me is that men who know what parliamentary life is, and what the game of politics is, whether they sit behind a Go^ vernment or in Opposition, should express amazement when a weapon which they themselves have been using is at length used against themselves, and when that honourable with which they have been hitting other people is used for hitting them. I can quite understand honourable members talking like this to people outside, but I do not understand their doing so in this chamber. I have seen this sort of thing manytimes during my short parliamentary career of six years, and other honourable members have seen it often during their lives. When an Opposition sets out to obstruct the business of a Government, the majoritv of Government supporters leave the chamber. It is rather a good thing that they do, because what is said by the other side is generally of a nature to provoke scenesThen the Opposition sets to work to call for a quorum, in order to bring the Ministerial supporters back into the chamber, and compel them to listen. All these calls for quorums, of course, interfere with the member who is speaking. But every one knowswhy it is done. When a call is made, the bells ring for two minutes, and if thenecessary number of honourable members dot not appear, a quorum is not formed, and"" the business lapses altogether. made a remark about people complaining as to things which they have done themselves.. Let us consider what has happened in this case. 1 take it that the trouble started at about midnight on. Wednesday. 1I have always understood, until quite recently-and was told shortly after I became a member of this Parliament-that the half-hour between midnight and half-past 12 is "" taboo "" as far as concerns calls for quorums. That idea was impressed upon me very strongly; and I can remember, on an occasion when one honourable member rather injudiciously called for a quorum during that time, hearing him severely taken to task by members of his own party, and told that when honourable members left the chamber to go to supper, it was recognised as a piece of good taste that attention should not be called to the absence of a quorum. Now, what happened on Wednesday night ? The first call for a quorum was made at thirteen minutes past 12, the next was at seventeen past 12, the next at twenty past 12, and the next at fifty-five past. There was another call at ten minutes past 1-and that, by the way, was made by a gentleman from whom we - should not have expected such conduct. There was another call at 1.16. That was the beginning of the trouble. Now, what has happened in the case of the honourable - member for Echuca ? When he was speaking this morning a call for a quorum was made at 11.33. At ""-35. two minutes later, the honourable member for Wentworth ngain interrupted by calling for a quorum. .At 11.36 there was another call. At 11.41 the honourable member for Parramatta again interrupted the speaker. In the space of eight minutes there were four calls for a quorum, and those were made by honourable members who now profess to be indignant that the honourable member for Echuca was prevented from making his speech without interruption. MT. KELLY - Continu e the record; be fair.",209
1879,Mr WISE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The reason for these calls for a quorum was perfectly understood amongst ourselves. It was all part of the game. We know what the game is. The honourable members who made these calls - did not care about interrupting the honourable member for Echuca at all. All they wanted to do was to compel Ministerial supporters to come into the chamber, just as honourable members on the Ministerial side used to do when the Fusion GovernI have ment were in office. After these four calls for quorums in eight minutes, the honourable member for Hunter apparently thought that the game might as well be persevered in.",210
1880,Mr ROBERTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I think there were two more calls from the honourable member for Wentworth and the honourable member for Parramatta before the honourable member for Hunter intervened.,210
1881,Mr WISE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The next call, at ii.42, was made by the honourable member for Hunter, and then he started to keep it up.",210
1882,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,How many times did the honourable member for Hunter call ?,210
1883,Mr WISE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"H called continually. e The honourable member for Hunter, in so doing, exercised precisely the same right as the honourable member for Wentworth and the honourable member for Parramatta had done.",210
1884,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,My calls for a quorum were to get an audience for the honourable member for Echuca.,210
1885,Mr WISE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Why should not the honourable member for Hunter be credited with the same desire? Why should there be this outcry about interference with the privileges of honourable members when we know perfectly well who started the game, and what the object of it was ? Is it not rather childish? We have seen the same sort of thing before in this House. If the ruling of the Chairman is wrong, I want to know what rule is to be laid down in regard to calls for a quorum? Is the Chairman to take it upon himself to say that when honourable members on the Opposition side call for a quorum four times in eight minutes they are doing right, and that when an honourable member on the Ministerial side does the same thing he is doing wrong? I cannot help saying that the whole position today has resolved itself into a farce. As I said at the beginning, the practice of Parliament is a two-edged sword. Its use can be abused to defeat completely the ends originally intended. I do really think that honourable members might stop this silly business. I am afraid that that word is unparliamentary, but it is awfullv difficult, in a debate like this, to express oneself without falling foul of the Chair. I do think, however, that when we are talking to each other, we might recognise the fact that honourable members on both sides are not fools. Just as we can see through the Opposition, the Opposition can see through us; and what is the use of continuing this nonsense ?",210
1886,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Wentworth) [3.20] - The honourable member for Gippsland has quoted just about half the facts; and he is quite satisfied so long as they are cheered by the party of Which he always professes to be independent. A change has taken place during this sitting, the merits of which I shall not discuss, with regard to the right of speech in this chamber some thirty-nine hours ago. I moved dissent from the ruling of the Chairman, on the ground that just such a means as has been adopted by the honourable member for Hunter would be adopted to prevent honourable members from being heard, if there was such a desire. My main point is that, when a quorum is called, trie time occupied should not be counted against the honourable member then addressing the Chamber; and if that point is not upheld, abuse must, as has been proved, creep in. There is a difference between obtaining an audience for an honourable member and preventing him speaking at all. The records show that the honourable member for Hunter called for a quorum at 1:1.53, 11.54, 12.1, 12.3, 12.8, 12.10, and 12.1.5 o'clock, at which time the honourable member for Echuca had to resume his seat, without being able to complete a single sentence. It is quite true, as the honourable member for Gippsland says, that we can see through each other, and know each other's sincerities and insincerities; and we quite realise the difference I have pointed out between keeping an audience and endeavouring to prevent an honourable member speaking. I took the first opportunity to protest, and I shall always protest, against any further abuse of our privileges in this regard. If honourable members opposite desire to prevent discussion, there is a more straightforward and decent course open to them by the application the closure standing order; and they ought to act like men, and not merely as trickis sters of the Standing Orders.",211
1887,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I ask that the word '' tricksters ' ' be withdrawn.,211
1888,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I used the word in all sincerity, but, if it is objected to, I , of tory ? course, withdraw it . Motion negatived. Dr CARTY SALMO N (Laanecoorie) gration, satisfied with the Tesults? [3 -27] - I know there are varying opinions as to the necessity for a larger population by means of immigration, but we are all at one as to the urgent necessity for defence, which, of course, can be provided only by our own people. We have no desire, as I said previously, to take advantage of the necessities of those who may be prepared to act as mercenaries; and in times of peace we ought to secure a sufficient number of properly trained men to insure our protection. A great deal has been done, and is being done, in this regard ; but any one who has considered the undefended condition of this great continent and its marvellous wealth, must be struck with the almost criminal inaction that has been exhibited. The Governments have relegated immigration proposals to the pigeon-hole, and our puny efforts have been compared with the highly successful efforts of Canada to introduce energetic and enterprising immigrants. It is hardly fair, however, to compare Australia with Canada, because, unlike Australia, the Dominion isonly some six or seven days' steam from, the great centres of population. This givesCanada a tremendous advantage; and those immigrants who have gone there have really proved to be immigration agents on their own account, and have been the means of inducing numbers of their friends to f o l low them. In this way the very cream of the available population has gone from the Old Country and the Continent to the Dominion. Be' that as it may, Australia has not availed herself of the great advantages; she possesses. In Canada, when a man sows his wheat crop, it is covered for four months with snow; and during the winter the cattle have to be housed and hand-fed. These two facts alone show that Australia,, though far distant, possesses great advantages, which have only to be made known to attract the very best class of people.",211
1889,Mr WEBSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Do people not knowof chose facts already?,211

1893,Mr TUDOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [3.40] - I am sorry to reduce for a moment the speed with which the legislative machine is now travelling, but I desire to refer to a promise which I made a few weeks ago to the honourable member for Maranoa in regard to the question of the percentage of moisture in butter for export, which has engaged the attention of the Parliament from time to time. I promised the honourable member that, since there was not likely to be an opportunity for the House to deal with a motion bearing on the question, I woulcl give him an opportunity on the Estimates of my Department to discuss the question, and test the feeling of the Committee. He then assured me that there was a majority of members of the House in favour of the maximum moisture contents permissible being increased from 15 per cent, to 16 per cent., and I propose now to give him an opportunity to test the question. I , personally, shall regret very much the affirmaStanding tion of such an increase by honourable members, but I am willing 'to leave the whole question to the decision of the Committee.",212
1894,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We will agree to the increase.,212

After the Attorney-General has moved the second reading of these Bills, the debate will be adjourned until Wednesday, when it will be resumed by the Leader of the Opposition.",212
1898,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Ballarat) [3.43] - I suggest that you, Mr Speaker, as Chairman of the Standing Orders Committee, should invite that Committee to give consideration to certain questions brought forward today, as to the propriety of allowing attention to be called to the state of the House so frequently as to render argument impossible. I suggest that a standing order might be framed to meet that difficulty, but am not touching the question in any partisan spirit. It is equally essential to all Governments that the business of the House should be so conducted at - all times that argument may not be rendered impossible.",212
1899,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Like most Standing Orders, they require to be amended from time to time.",212

1902,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Anythin g that the Orders Committee may do would come to naught without the sanction of the House. I presume that the desire of the Leader of the Opposition is that the Standing Orders Committee shall take into consideration the too frequent use of the standing order in relation to the absence of a fact quorum, with the object of preventing an honourable member from speaking. I presume that he also suggests that we take action to prevent the standing order being so used as to obstruct business.",212
